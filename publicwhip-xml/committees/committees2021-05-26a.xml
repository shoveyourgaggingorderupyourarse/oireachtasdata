I also extend a welcome to his officials.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any members who are participating via Teams to confirm, prior to making their contributions, that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  To anyone watching this meeting online, I point out that Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Only I, as Chairman, and the necessary staff essential to the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room. </p> <p>  We have had an intense degree of consultation and exchanges with many groups.  I know the members will be interested to hear what the T&aacute;naiste has to say and we are looking forward to the engagement.  I call on him to make his opening statement. </p></speech>

While I welcome the scrutiny, I do not want ratification delayed and drifting indefinitely, and for Ireland to have to stand by and watch other member states ratify it ahead of us, as the majority already have.  That would send out the wrong message to the world, one of waning commitment to trade and free enterprise in Ireland which would have negative consequences for investment and employment.  Ireland should be a leader in Europe in support of free trade.</p> <p>  Unlike other countries, Ireland is not wealthy in natural resources.  We did not grow wealthy on the back of colonies.  Nobody owes us a basic income.  As a country, we owe our relative prosperity to the goods and services produced by our people and our land which we sell around the world.  It is a formula that has worked very well.  It is based on international trade, our attractiveness as a place to invest and our ability to enter international free trade agreements with other countries.  Our position at the heart of Europe, its Single Market and the eurozone is also crucial to this.</p> <p>  This economic model has consistently raised our living standards throughout the decades and created hundreds of thousands of jobs for our citizens.  We will depend on that for the recovery.  It is the model that can best serve Ireland, the EU and the world as a whole, lifting billions out of extreme poverty in our lifetime.  This is the message I conveyed last week to EU trade ministers as we finalise Europe&rsquo;s trade policy review.</p> <p>  However, Ireland cannot take this for granted.  Following the departure of the UK from the European Union, Ireland has an even bigger responsibility to promote the EU&rsquo;s role as a champion for global free trade and to resist any backward moves towards nationalism or protectionism.  Nor can we take for granted the range of free trade agreements we benefit from every day - trade agreements that are negotiated on our behalf by the European Union, as a bloc of 27 countries and 440 million citizens.</p> <p>  Since the provisional application of CETA in 2017, the benefits have been plain to see.  Goods exports to Canada increased from &euro;953 million in 2016 to more than &euro;1.7 billion in 2020, an increase of 78%.  Services exports grew from &euro;1.6 billion in 2016 to more than &euro;2.3 billion in 2019, an increase of 44%.  This all benefits Irish jobs, Irish businesses and Irish tax revenues, which we use to fund our public services and public infrastructure.</p><p>The elimination of tariffs, reduced trade barriers and simplified customs procedures and the more compatible technical requirements that flow from CETA make it easier and cheaper for Irish companies of all sizes to trade with Canada.<br/><br/>My Department recently released the results of an independent study by Copenhagen Economics of the potential economic opportunities and impacts for Ireland of the EU's free trade agreements, FTAs, with Canada, South Korea, Mexico and Japan.  It found that these four European Union FTAs are forecast to have a positive effect on trade, GDP and national income for Ireland.  It goes without saying that the deal with Japan benefits us the most, but that is due to the size of that country and its economy, which is approximately 120 million relative to Canada's 20 million.  An important finding is that real wages would increase by up to 4.4% by 2030 as a result of the trade agreements, with the largest increases for low-income workers.  This refutes the notion that well-designed free trade agreements exert downward pressure on wages or labour standards when in fact the reverse is true.<br/><br/>As members are aware, the full coming into force of CETA, once ratified across all member states, will see the implementation of the investment chapter of the agreement, including provisions for the resolution of disputes between investors and states should they arise.  This has been the area of most controversy.  All international agreements have dispute resolution arrangements.  They have to.  Where such agreements cover not only trade in both goods and services but also investment rules and protections, then there must be some form of dispute resolution mechanism that covers the investments.  The EU's new approach to investment protection is the investment court system, ICS, which is contained in CETA and replaces the old investor-state dispute settlement or ISDS mechanism.  It is something that we, as Europe, looked for.  It was not imposed on us by Canada or anyone else.  It is there as much to protect our companies and their workers and to ensure that they are treated fairly and not discriminated against if they trade with China and other countries.<br/><br/>The rights of governments to regulate in the public interest is paramount and I believe this is fully protected under the terms of this agreement and the joint interpretative instrument.  Investors may utilise national courts or the ICS but cannot use both or forum shop.  Equally, it is important to remember that a Canadian firm can already sue the Government for alleged unfair treatment or discrimination in our courts whether CETA exists or not.  In the courts today we see plenty of examples of companies suing the Government and its agencies or the Government and its agencies suing companies.  The same will apply to Irish companies that operate in Canada, so it very much works both ways.  CETA simply provides an arbitration alternative to using national courts.  However, that alternative, unlike a challenge in the courts, cannot find any act by Government to <i>be ultra vires</i>or unconstitutional - it is concerned only with redress if harm is proven.  As the ICS tribunal cannot interpret national law or seek to overturn it, there is no question of it overriding national courts or legislatures.  Significantly, CETA introduces a precise and specific standard of &quot;fair and equitable treatment&quot; of investors and investments.  Therefore, an investor may only have recourse to the investment court system on very specific limited grounds such as in the case of the denial of justice, a fundamental breach of due process, or through targeted discrimination for example on the grounds of race religious belief or gender.  None of these rights gives the Government any concern that Ireland would be subject to ICS proceedings.  We are not going to discriminate against Canadian companies or treat them unfairly, so we do not anticipate many serious legal challenges.  Moreover, it is important to say that under the ICS a state can never be forced to change its legislation, only to pay fair compensation in cases where the investor is deemed to have been treated unfairly under the specific grounds detailed.  It is important to make clear that an investor cannot be given compensation just because they have lost profits or suffered economic loss or costs.  It is for the investor to prove they were discriminated against and to establish that it incurred losses as a consequence of the discrimination.<br/><br/>CETA reaffirms the EU and Canada's right to regulate to achieve legitimate policy objectives, such as the protection of public health, the environment or consumer protection, meaning policies such as those relating to plain packaging on cigarettes, or minimum alcohol pricing can continue to be introduced.  These &quot;right to regulate&quot; provisions are specifically designed to avoid any danger of so-called &quot;regulatory chill&quot;.  Despite having more trade agreements than ever, we have more regulations than ever and it is pretty obvious that one does not prevent the other.<br/><br/>As part of the finalisation of the agreement, the EU and Canada also agreed a legally binding joint interpretative instrument, JII, that was added to CETA to provide further assurances in relation to public services, labour rights, environmental protection and investment.  CETA does not restrict either the EU or Canada from passing new laws in areas of public interest such as the environment, and health and safety nor does CETA affect the Government's scope for developing new laws in response to the needs and priorities of Irish citizens.  Importantly, within CETA, both sides agree that more trade and investment should not be at the expense of environmental protection and labour rights.  The EU and Canada will not seek competitive advantage through the lowering of standards in any domain.  On the contrary, the European Union and Canada are committed to ensuring that CETA helps confirm that economic growth, social development, and environmental protection should go hand in hand as far as is practicable.<br/><br/>As a small, open economy, Ireland has benefited immensely from our export-orientated enterprises trading across the globe and, therefore, we support international trade and the EU free trade agreements that seek to underpin this.  Equally, Ireland has been an attractive destination for foreign direct investment, FDI, for many decades and participating in EU third country agreements that cover investment and provide investment protection continue to assist us in marketing Ireland as a competitive FDI-friendly jurisdiction for multinational enterprise to invest with the attendant jobs and prosperity that entails.<br/><br/>As somebody who hopes in the coming months to travel to North America and around the world again to promote Ireland as a place to invest, ratifying CETA is an advantage in that regard.  Not doing so may cause some potential investors to have concerns.  Taking the foregoing into consideration and given that there can be no doubt that CETA is a progressive, high-standard agreement, I believe that ratifying the agreement, albeit at this late stage, would send a positive message to our trading partners around the world that Ireland continues to be committed to the values of open and fair global trade.  I again thank the committee for taking the time to consider the agreement in detail.  I hope this process can help us to move towards ratification very soon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-26a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021052600002#B00200"><p>I thank the T&aacute;naiste for coming before the committee.  This all comes down to the investment court system that he dealt with substantially.  We had a number of legal minds and other experts before the committee.  There was some element in the narrative of people moving away from ISDS.  Regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, some of the ISDS-related situations were being negotiated out and the Canada-US-Mexico agreement does not have the same element of that at this point.  The French are looking at moving away from the energy charter treaty on the basis of the ISDS provisions within it and the Dutch are being sued currently.  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned the fear of being sued on the basis of the legitimate expectation of profits.  To a degree, I and others have asked why we would hamper ourselves in this regard and leave ourselves open to a chilling effect.</p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste stated earlier that Canadian companies currently have the right to go to court in the case of agreements.  I contend that we are not a rogue state in terms of our legal system and therefore companies have the option of European or Irish courts.  A number of speakers, including members, asked why we would rush into this given the difficulties.  A number of major players in Europe are making no moves towards signing up to the ICS.</p><p>I am thinking of France and the Netherlands.  Why would we sign up to this when elements of the provisions contained within the trade deal are in operation at this point?  We are talking about signing up to the ICS, while many trade deals are now being done without that.  That does not stop the EU, the UN or whoever coming up with some sort of ICS or dispute resolution mechanism that exists outside of trade deals and could be useful in facilitating business and such.  In this case, the fear is the chilling effect and that we will be slower to take action on climate change and all the rest of it.  The big example is the fears that have arisen regarding the Energy Charter Treaty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-26a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021052600002#C00200"><p>Fundamentally, there are a few things we need to accept.  If one has an investment treaty, one must have some form of dispute resolution system.  An investor court system is as good as any and better than an investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS.  This will not be renegotiated.  It has been ratified by most member states.  I would not like Ireland to be the country that holds this up.</p><p>It features in other trade deals.  There are dispute resolution mechanisms in approximately 2,000 investment treaties.  It is in the EU-Mexico deal.  If we hold up CETA because of this issue, we will have to hold up the Mexico agreement too.  That would be a big mistake and would damage relationships with Mediterranean countries and Latin American countries, in particular.  While Canada might resile from aspects of this in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, USMCA, it is signing up to it in the Pacific agreement.  It is not going out of fashion.  It may in time be replaced by some sort of world trade court, which I would not object to, but I imagine people will make the same arguments against that as they are making against this system.  </p><p>Governments can always be sued and often the cases I hear people citing in their opposition to CETA have nothing to do with CETA.  They are taken under other treaties or national laws.  Governments can be and are sued by companies.  It does not mean the companies win the cases.  <i>Vice versa</i>, governments sue companies.  That can be seen in our courts today.  On the fear of being sued having a chilling effect, I do not get that argument.  One may as well prevent access to the courts or to justice because companies can sue states and states can sue companies.</p><p>It is important to say it works both ways.  This is there to protect our companies and their workers if they end up in difficulty in Canada.  This is something the EU wants and looked for.  It was not imposed on us by Canada.  We would like this in agreements with other countries, particularly where we have concerns about their court systems.  We do not have concerns about the Canadian court system but there are countries around the world where we might be concerned about their court systems and would like to have an alternative mechanism such as this.  This is something the EU wants rather than something being imposed on us.  We want it to protect our companies, their workers and their owners.  </p><p>The real advantage for an Irish company investing in Canada is that rather than having to navigate their system which involves many provinces, municipalities and national courts, there is a single mechanism.  That is an arbitration panel comprising one Canadian, one European and one independent.  The same is true for Canadian companies.  Instead of having to navigate 27 countries with different constitutions and legal systems, they can have one system.  That promotes investment.  It is easier to invest in Europe if there is one mechanism that can be used rather than having to navigate up to 27 different ones.</p><p>I heard what was said in terms of the rush.  There is no rush whatsoever.  The agreement has been around for approximately ten years.  It might have been the Fine Gael-Labour Government that signed off on it.  Maybe it was not that long ago.  We have had another Government and two elections since then.  This is not being rushed in the slightest.  It is happening really slowly.  Of the 27 states in the EU, 15 have ratified this.  We are a slow adopter, which is not where Ireland should be.  We should be early adopters of trade agreements, not slow ratifiers.  Whether it is a UN convention or an international treaty, we should ratify agreements we sign up to quickly.  I would have made the same argument about the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Istanbul Convention and was keen to get them done during my period as Taoiseach.  I am keen to get this done during my period in this office.  </p><p>France was mentioned.  The Assembl&eacute;e Nationale in France has ratified this.  We are behind them.  It has not been ratified by the senate in France but it has been ratified by their lower house.  It has also been ratified by the Bundestag in Germany but the vote has been challenged in the courts.  So we are even behind countries such as France, which are not seen to be advocates of free trade.  We are way behind on this.  Far from a rush, we are laggards.</p></speech>

At the meeting in Brussels last week of EU trade ministers, Europe's general trade policy review was discussed.  The T&aacute;naiste explained to Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; that the majority of member states have ratified this, as have the vast majority of member state parliaments, but there are still elements to go through.  Will the T&aacute;naiste give us an insight as to what the overall EU opinion among the 27 member states on this?</p> <p>  Senator Doherty asked me to ask on her behalf what reputational damage is being done to Ireland by the delay in ratification.  The T&aacute;naiste pointed out we are laggards in ratification.  There has been a theme that certain people have tried to bring into this debate inside and outside of this committee that we do not have to fully ratify CETA, but can take the bits that have been ratified already and forget the ICS.  We got clear pushback from Canadian Government representatives in that area when we heard from them.  Will the T&aacute;naiste go into the importance of remembering that CETA is an overall package?

What potential does CETA provide to workers and companies across Ireland?  Has the T&aacute;naiste&rsquo;s Department, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland or the IDA, identified particular sectors where there is serious opportunity?  More generally on Irish and EU trade strategies, how important is it that we, as an open, dynamic trading country, seize the opportunity with new trade deals?  Returning to Deputy Doherty&rsquo;s point, how do we look to the rest of the world?  For example, Australia and New Zealand are in their ninth round of negotiations with the EU or Vietnam and Malaysia which are starting off their negotiation with the EU on trade treaties.  How do we reassure those future trade partners if, all of a sudden, Ireland, of all member states arguably the most reliant on open international trade and investment, is trying to throw a spanner in the works after more than a decade of discussions about CETA?  I recall discussing this in 2014 in the European Committee of the Regions.  It was imminent and soon to be a done deal but, seven years later, we are bringing it back to committees for review.</p></speech>

It was the first time we met in person since Berlin last year and my first time in Brussels since February 2020.  It used to be kind of a second home.  It was strange to be there again but great to meet up in person.  Hopefully, that will be the norm again from now on.  We had a very long meeting.  It went on all day.  CETA did not come up, or, if it did, somebody might have mentioned it in passing.</p><p>This is not a hot topic of debate among EU trade ministers because the expectation is that it will be ratified by every member state sooner or later.  There is certainly no discussion of it being renegotiated.  That is not something I have seen any government seriously propose.  Individual politicians or parliamentarians might do so, but not a single one of the 27 member governments has said that.  It is quite different from Mercosur where a number of governments, including our own, are saying it needs to be renegotiated to include legally binding and enforceable protections around the environment, afforestation etc.  This is not in that space.  Not one of the 27 governments is suggesting an annex, renegotiation or protocol or anything like that.  Largely, Europe is moving on.  The focus of our discussions was China.  It was the US-EU trade agenda, trying to get things back on track given the change in administration with the Biden Harris Administration being much more multilateral and open to free trade agreements than the Trump Administration and also WTO reform now the new Director General is in place, and making that work better.  That was the focus of the agenda.</p><p> The potential for Ireland is considerable, particularly being an English speaking country with a similar culture and business culture to Canada, Ireland will be one of the countries that can benefit the most from increased trade with Canada.  The estimate you see from Copenhagen Economics might sound small, 0.2% of GDP, but that is &euro;600 million a year, of which about a third gets to the Government in taxation.  It could be worth &euro;200 million a year to Revenue, which is 20% of the mental health budget, to put it in context.  When you turn 0.2% of GDP into a cash figure and work out how much of that would come to us in tax, it is actually a considerable amount, and &euro;200 million a year for the Irish State to use on public goods is worth fighting for, to my mind.  </p><p> Yesterday, the Minster of State, Deputy Troy, launched the first of our free trade round table series which focused on raising the profile of the recent free trade agreements.  An online webinar was held in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland which focused on the Canadian market and the benefits arising from CETA for those companies.  Some 80 companies joined the webinar, mainly from the ICT area, digital, tech, engineering and consumer products.  They are the companies expressing an interest in trading more with Canada.  We were trying to help them to do business in the region, make them aware of CETA and its tariff-free benefits and also procurement opportunities.  One of CETA's big benefits is that it has opened up public procurement in Canada to Irish companies.  It is a campaign we will run through May and June, really focusing on the agreements with Canada, Mexico, Japan and South Korea.  There will be a further cycle later in the year looking at other regions that represent further opportunities for Ireland.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-26a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021052600002#D00200"><p>As a member of the Government which ratified CETA originally, I was strongly of the view that CETA was in Ireland's interest and worthy of ratification.  Since most of the treaty has already been implemented, the obvious benefits for Ireland as a very open trading-focused economy is already self evident.  We live or die by trade.  We trade more <i>per capita </i>than virtually any country in the world and we support free trade.  However, the investment courts system has been focused upon.  I have not only listened to every piece of evidence presented but I have also done my own research as has every member of this committee.  There are undoubtedly real and substantial issues that we as a Parliament must address.</p><p>The T&aacute;naiste, in his presentation, says that dealing with countries like China, we must have a robust dispute resolution system.  Of course we do.  Every international agreement has to have a dispute resolution system that both parties agree to, but in a trade deal with Canada and the EU there cannot be any doubt that the domestic court systems, the things that the T&aacute;naiste has mentioned occur every day, are both fair, robust and ones that everybody who is party to the agreement can have full confidence in.  Nobody has said for a second that any Irish investor could not have full confidence in a determination made by a Canadian court.  No Canadian who presented evidence to us has said they could not have full and complete confidence in a decision of an Irish court.  The whole mechanism has often been presented as a tool to encourage investors in developing countries where confidence in their court system is lacking but none of that applies in this particular agreement.  There may well be situations were we do agreements where there is an arguable case for an external oversight mechanism for disputes outside the domestic dispute resolution systems that are robust, tried, tested and in accordance with our constitutions but I do not see it in the context of this agreement.  That is the point on which I have the greatest difficulty.  </p><p>The committee has had presentations from professors in Ireland and from the University of Amsterdam, for example, citing the individual issue that the T&aacute;naiste has already been alerted to.  Among them is that once this is agreed, there will be a lack of oversight available to our Parliament for any rogue decisions made subsequently.  We have no legislative control over it once it is done.  Therefore the net question is whether we can have CETA without the investment court system, ICS?  The T&aacute;naiste's answer to Deputy Richmond was &quot;No&quot;, that it is an integrated package.  My experience, and I chaired three European Councils, is that where there is a very serious difficulty to be overcome, the flexibility within the EU institutions is extraordinary.  I have sat at Council meetings where intractable positions were resolved by clever legal operations.  I have no doubt that these things can be resolved if there is determination for it.  </p><p>It boils down to my last point that we do not want to go there because of the reputational damage it might do.  That is a fair point to make but if there is a component part of an agreement that causes us real concern then we have to set it out and see if we can have the agreement without the ICS.  I see no difficulty in arguing that case from an Irish perspective.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-26a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021052600002#D00300"><p>I agree with Deputy Howlin on a few points.  We have no concerns about the domestic court system in Canada and I do not think that Canada has any concerns about the domestic court system in Ireland.  I am not sure if that is necessarily the case for every EU country.  There are some EU countries which unfortunately do not uphold the kind of legal standards of independence of the courts as we do, and we need to bear that in mind.  ICS will work as an arbitration tribunal.  One person from Canada, one from the EU and one independent.  Before going down this line, a company has to decide if it is going to use the court system or whether it will use the investor court system.  They must consult with the Government, mediate and then arbitration occurs.  The advantage is that it will be easier for Irish companies in Canada.  They might not choose to use the mechanism but if they run into difficulties, in the unlikely event they are being discriminated against or treated unfairly by Canada or a government agency of Canada, they can opt for this system rather than having to navigate different provincial courts, for example.  Similarly, for a Canadian company investing in the EU, having this one simple mechanism that they can understand and take part in as an alternative to particular domestic courts, all with different systems and constitutions.  It is an advantage in terms of investment and will help to promote investment.  Companies will be more likely to invest in the EU and EU companies more likely to invest in Canada if we have this mechanism than if we do not.  However, we need to be very clear about what it can and cannot do.  Unlike the courts, it cannot overturn or strike down domestic legislation, it cannot decide that anything is <i>ultra vires</i>or unconstitutional.  There is no concern about that with this mechanism.</p><p> The Deputy stated that sometimes in European politics, if a country is a particular concern or if there is a bottleneck, we get together politically and use our ingenuity to resolve matters.  When Ireland initially rejected the Nice and Lisbon treaties, we saw how we could sit around a table and, without changing the treaties much, give reassurances to people that helped the treaties be ratified.  I take the Deputy's point in that regard.  It is only true to a point, however, and I think we have reached that point because that has been done.  The ISDS was changed to an investor court system.  We had the hearing of the European Court of Justice, which determined this was consistent with EU values, EU law and EU principles, and there was the joint interpretative instrument, so I think we have already been through that process.  Steps can be taken to reassure people and to allay fears, but there is a point at which we can go beyond that.  I think we have already reached that point.</p><p> As for what would happen if a member state definitively rejected CETA, I am advised that in order to formally communicate the completion of their national procedures, member states are required to officially notify the General Secretariat of the Council.  Were a member state to lose a vote on ratifying the terms of CETA, it might choose to engage in a period of discussion regarding the possibility of charting a path forward towards a positive endorsement of the agreement.  If a member state were unable to ratify CETA and this represented a permanent and definitive position, it would be obliged to formally notify this to the General Secretariat of the Council prior to any action being required on the part of the Commission.  If that were to happen, it would be the first time for any EU trade agreement - I would not like Ireland to be the country to do that - and the Commission would engage with member states regarding the implications.  The possibility of termination of the provisional application would arise and could be determined by qualified majority voting, QMV.  The idea, therefore, that we have banked the good bit of CETA and that is grand, and that we do not now need to ratify the second bit or try to get it changed, is not entirely true because there is the possibility of the provisional application being terminated, and that would do harm economically.</p></speech>

In the context of the ratification of the treaty, he mentioned that he would not like it to be delayed indefinitely and that ratification would send out a positive message from Ireland at this time.  How quickly would he like it to be ratified?  He mentioned that 15 of the 27 member states have already ratified it.  As a committee, we are coming to the end of our scrutiny process, although I am not sure what other Oireachtas committees are doing.  Moreover, the trade agreement is being provisionally applied.  Would the T&aacute;naiste like the D&aacute;il to conclude its deliberations on this matter before the July recess?  How urgent does he consider it to be from an Irish point of view?</p> <p>  I accept that the T&aacute;naiste cannot comment on the High Court challenge being taken by Deputy Costello, but is that challenge to the constitutionality of the trade agreement something he considers to be relevant or should we just proceed at a political level?  There is potential for a referendum arising out of this process but, having said that, the submissions we have received seem to suggest that it is constitutional.  How quickly would the T&aacute;naiste like the D&aacute;il to ratify the agreement?</p> <p>  On the lobbying of the T&aacute;naiste, in his position as Minister, in respect of this issue by Canadian interests or general business interests, has he had many meetings in that regard?  Has he been lobbied to any great degree by those interests on the importance of this trade agreement and its ratification?</p></speech>

We were happy to concede to that.  I would ideally like it to be put to a vote before the summer recess, and certainly no later than this year.  I do not want to go into too much detail on any court cases but I would find it very surprising if the courts found this agreement to be unconstitutional.  The ESM treaty was not, so I do not see how something that is less far reaching and does not involve a transfer of sovereignty could be unconstitutional.  People have a right to go to court, but I hope they will not impose on the taxpayer the cost of the court cases.   I think it would be wrong that the Government would have to pick up the bill for substantial legal fees if the case was defeated.  The decent thing for them to do would be to cover the cost of that themselves, or at least to contribute to the cost of it rather than asking the hard-pressed taxpayer to do it or for the money to be taken away from public services, which would be the effect, unfortunately.</p> <p>  I do not recall being lobbied by any Canadian interests but the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, would certainly have met the Canadian ambassador and perhaps Canadian interests too.  By lobby, I mean to physically or virtually meet.  I get many letters all the time and I do not see them all, as the Deputy knows, so there may have been letters.  The Irish business associations have been very much in favour of the treaty and supportive of it, such as the various IBEC associations.  They are the ones dealing with Canada, and they know it is in their interest and is good for Irish business and Irish jobs.  They also know what signal it could send if Ireland starts to be seen as one of those countries in which the political consensus in favour of free trade is breaking down.  That would be a problem.</p> <p>  The chilling effect of that is the effect about which I worry.  One good thing we have had in Ireland for decades is that business and investors know that among the major parties, there is a political consensus in favour of the European Union, the Single European Act, the euro and so on.  It would be damaging for Ireland if people thought it was drifting away or that there was a move towards more extreme, nationalist ideologies that oppose the Union, the Single European Act and the euro, and that now might start opposing free trade agreements as well.  When businesses make investments, they make 30-year investments.  If they have a concern nationalistic politics of that sort could take hold in Ireland, they might invest elsewhere.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an T&aacute;naiste as teacht os comhair an choiste seo ar an &aacute;bhar f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach seo.</p> <p>  It is well known that taxation and regulation are mechanisms used to modify taxpayer behaviour and corporate behaviour, but the presence of the investor court system means that corporations will have recourse to a kind of court to which ordinary people do not have recourse.  This has the potential to create a chilling effect whereby policymakers could be and will be hesitant to use the tax and regulatory system to try to change corporate behaviour.  This will create significant risks and could place limits on legislators acting in the public interest.  It will also mean that the State could incur significant fines or, even where cases are won, large legal fees.  I am interested in what the Government has done to examine the financial impact assessment of CETA.  Is the T&aacute;naiste concerned about the financial impact it may have?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-26a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2021052600002#E00600"><p>In regard to the argument on regulatory chill, it is clear in CETA that the Government continues to have the right to regulate.  That is specifically directed to allay concerns about regulatory chill.  Most investment claims do not challenge the Government's ability to legislate or regulate but are administrative in character.</p><p>A Government or State actor would be sued not because it has legislated or regulated, but because it has discriminated against a particular company or investor in the context of a particular licence or permit, or in cases of expropriation.  CETA does not restrict the EU or Canada from passing new laws in the public interest, such as in the areas of the environment or health and safety, nor does it affect our scope to develop new laws in response to the needs and priorities of Irish citizens.  As I said, the chill effect about which I am concerned is not around our ability to regulate and legislate.  The number of free trade agreements is increasing year-on-year and so there is need for more regulations year-on-year.  Some people would say we have additional taxes every year notwithstanding that we have more trade agreements every year and more environmental rules.  As trade agreements have increased, so, too, have taxes, regulations and protections.  I do not see that as a chill.  The chill that I am concerned about is an economic one, that is, that Ireland, which has been always a reliable country and supportive of international trade, multilateralism, the EU and the WTO, might be moving away from that path.  There could be a fear among investors that the political consensus that we have had in Ireland, which has been always internationalist, pro-European, pro-free trade and pro-enterprise, might be waning and that nationalistic forces might becoming popular again in Ireland.  We saw the effect of that type of politics in the 1930s with the economic war.  It brought our population down to 2.5 million at one point, until it was reversed by Se&aacute;n Lemass and others.  </p><p> On the financial impact, we do not think there will be a financial impact.  If there is one, it will be minimal.  The Deputy mentioned that we could still face legal fees, but if one wins the case generally legal fees are covered, or most of them are covered.  There would only be a financial impact if the Irish Government or an Irish State actor was to discriminate against a Canadian company and that company was able to prove in court that it faced losses as a result of that decision and was then granted compensation as a result.  We think that is pretty remote.  It is impossible to assess on an econometric basis because there are so many variables and it is so unlikely to occur, but our assessment, applying logic, is that it would be zero or minimal because the Irish State and its agencies are not going to discriminate against Canadian companies and, therefore, they will not be able to prove that we have and, therefore, they will not receive any compensation for any losses.  </p><p> Deputy Howlin made the valid point that there is a strong case for having these mechanisms when it comes to countries not like Canada.  In other words, countries we are less confident about in terms of their legal systems and in their courts acting independently and fairly.  One of the reasons the EU wants this in CETA and in the Mexico Agreement is to set a precedent.  In negotiations, countries that are not democracies and do not have a courts system like ours, might ask why they should agree to this when it does not apply to other countries.  They might take the view that we would be saying we do not trust them and that is why we are demanding that this clause be in a treaty with them, yet we did not say that this should be in a treaty with countries like Canada and Mexico.  From a European point of view and from a strategic point of view, as team Europe, we want this included so that when we negotiate with Canada or, for example, countries in the Middle East, we can say this is standard clause that we now have in agreements with democratic partners like Canada and Mexico and we would like to see it in a particular agreement too.  </p></speech>

Deputy Whitmore is waiting.  Before I call her, I want to let members know that Senator Keogan is participating in the meeting this morning, but as she is not on campus she has submitted her question to me to ask on her behalf.  What will be the impact of the ICS on the taxpayer?</p></speech>

I do not see that arising.  As I mentioned earlier, there is a potential very positive impact for the Irish taxpayer in that it is estimated that CETA will grow our GDP by approximately &euro;600 million per annum, one-third of which will accrue to the Government in taxes, which is a benefit of approximately &euro;250 million per annum.</p></speech>

It is important that we have this debate.  The move prior to Christmas to have the vote following a 55-minute debate was the wrong choice.  It is important that we have an opportunity to discuss this issue.  As part of that discussion the information needs to be on the table so that the public understand what will be voted on.  Members, too, need to have that information to enable us to make a considered determination.  I understand that the T&aacute;naiste has the economic report and analysis on the FTAs on Ireland, but there does not appear to be a risk analysis in regard to the ratification of the ICS on social or environmental considerations or a quantification of the likelihood of the chilling effect.  That type of analysis would add value to this debate.</p> <p>  On the economic report, I understand a member of the public requested it and that the person was told that it could not be released because it was not in the public interest.  That kind of discourse feeds into the suspicion around the investor court system, ICS.  I would be interested in hearing the T&aacute;naiste's thoughts on the following matter.  At a previous meeting of this committee at which the Chair of the Ireland Canada Business Association was in attendance, I asked where I could find a list of the members represented by the association.  He declined to tell me who the lobby group represented.  This group has lobbied a number of Members of Parliament, including the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, and he has had meetings with the Minister, Deputy Troy.  It would be important that as part of this debate we know what companies are represented by this business association.  I was surprised that the Chair of the association declined to give us the information.  Is that normal or is it something that would be of concern to the T&aacute;naiste?</p></speech>

Under the lobbying Act anyone who carries out lobbying has to declare on whose behalf the lobbying is being carried out.  It is a question for SIPO more so than for me.  My understanding is that anybody who is lobbying a designated public official, which all of us are, must declare that and state what the purpose of the lobbying was and who they represent.  I note Deputy Howlin is nodding.  Having drafted the legislation, he might be able to answer the question for us later.</p> <p>  On the risk analysis question, I do not know how we could do a risk analysis on the ICS element of this agreement because the risk is so obviously negligible.  A company would have to go to the investor court tribunal and prove that the Irish State or one of its agencies had discriminated against it.  The grounds on which discrimination is defined are very clear in CETA.  They company would have to prove that it was discriminated against and that it incurred losses as a result and then be granted compensation from the Irish Government or one of its agencies as a result.  That is extremely remote.  I do not see the Irish State or Irish State agencies discriminating against Canadian companies and them being able to prove that before the three person tribunal.  Even if it were true, they could use our domestic courts.  I do not see it happening.  It is like looking for a dragon under the bed.  It seems too remote.  I am sure we could get someone to provide an analysis on it, but it seems so obvious.</p></speech>

A consideration of where the ICS has operated differently from in the previous examples would be useful.  In the absence of that type of analysis, we would need to take a precautionary approach on this.</p><p>That is because the risks as outlined by many of these experts are so great that we are better off erring on the side of caution.  Currently, we benefit from the trade aspects.  The signing and ratification only relates to the investment court system.  It would be a more risk averse approach to stay with the <i>status quo</i>and not rush into trying to ratify prior to other member states.  My thanks to the T&aacute;naiste for his answer.</p></speech>

I do not think we would have signed up to the European Court of Justice, which is able to overrule our national courts.  That is a more far-reaching action than could ever arise from something like CETA.  We would not have signed up to the International Court of Justice.  We would not have signed the European Convention on Human Rights.  If we took the precautionary approach to any of these things we would not have signed up to them.  I do not agree with that argument.</p> <p>  Many of the cases people have put forward have been red herrings.  One case that people often mention was in Egypt, where a company took Egypt to court.  The suggestion was that the company was suing Egypt because it increased the minimum wage.  First, that was misleading.  That is not why the company took Egypt to court.  It took Egypt to court because there was a clause in the contract providing that it would be compensated for any changes to social charges.  The company actually lost the case.  Anyone can take a case to court.  It does not mean the plaintiff will be successful.  I think the case referred to by the Deputy taken against Romania is the Gabriel Resources case.  That case is still pending.  It is almost a natural extension of the Deputy's argument to say we should take away the right of people to go to court because they might do so.</p></speech>

I find it interesting that the T&aacute;naiste is concerned that a Member of the Oireachtas is taking a legal case.  What I see is a threat that the State will pursue the costs.  Then, the T&aacute;naiste contradicts himself when he refers to Deputy Whitmore asking whether we should be stopping people from going to court and taking cases.  It is also interesting that the investor court system the T&aacute;naiste is advocating in CETA has <i>per diem</i>rates.  The cost to the State of defending cases at the ICS will be substantial.  That is a point of interest.</p><p>I have a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; question for the T&aacute;naiste.  Is it not true that the following countries have not completed the ratification process: France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary, while Cyprus has rejected it?  Is this not the case?  None of these countries has ratified the agreement.  If we do a calculation, then approximately 77% of the population of the EU represented by those countries have decided not to ratify CETA yet.</p><p>On 26 March, following the EU-Canada second joint committee meeting, the French Europe minister, Cl&eacute;ment Beaune, explicitly said in an interview with the media that his government would not contemplate ratifying CETA until after the presidential elections in 2022.  The T&aacute;naiste is saying Ireland is a laggard and that he has no wish to go to North America unless Ireland has ratified it.  Yet, the French are content in the sense that they will not ratify this until after the French presidential elections.  That is on the basis of their experience with investor-state dispute settlement under the Energy Charter Treaty and Canadian companies.  The environment minister there was threatened with a billion euro legal suit by Vermilion, a Canadian oil company.  It forced the French ministry to change position.  If we are talking about being laggards, it is interesting that the French do not have the same concerns.  Given their experience of ISDS, they know that to touch the ratification of CETA would be toxic prior to any election campaign.</p></speech>

I would not question the right of any citizen to take a case to court, whether a Deputy, a Senator or otherwise.  People and companies are free to go to court and free to seek vindication of their legal rights.</p> <p>  However, I believe there is a decency issue.  When people take cases that are unnecessary or unsuccessful, they should not burden the taxpayer or the Irish citizen with the full cost of them.  They should be willing to accept some of the costs themselves out of a point of decency, just as a person must when he or she makes a planning objection or when someone applies for a tender or contract and does not get it.  The tenderer has to bear the cost of a failed attempt.  There is a decency issue for people taking some of these cases.  They should at least bear some of the costs if they are unsuccessful rather than impose the costs on Irish citizens and taxpayers.  There are better ways to spend taxpayers' money in my view.</p> <p>  There are 27 member states in the European Union.  Of those, 15 have ratified and 12 have not.  To say "rejected" is incorrect.  They have not rejected it.  Something not being ratified is not the same thing as rejecting it.  Two of the 12-----</p></speech>

My thanks to the Senator for clarifying that.  Of the 27 countries, 15 have ratified and 12 have not.  As I mentioned earlier, the Assembl&eacute;e Nationale in France, the equivalent of the D&aacute;il, has ratified it.  As Senator Boylan said, the French Government intends to ratify it.  It is simply a matter of timing.  It is for political reasons, as Senator Boylan pointed out, rather than policy reasons.  The German Parliament has ratified the agreement - these are the biggest countries in terms of population in Europe - but it is currently stuck in the courts.</p> <p>  I have a view on Ireland when it comes to international agreements and free trade agreements, whether they are on climate or the rights of people with disabilities or trade.  We should seek to be among the early adopters and among the first to ratify the agreements.  That is the approach I took with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities when getting it through as Taoiseach.  I feel the same about the Istanbul Convention and similar agreements.  We should not wait to be last or be in the second half of countries.  We should not say that simply because a country is slower than us, then it is fine.  We should aim to be among the countries first to ratify.  That is a matter of opinion.  Again, it speaks to my issue of Ireland being seen as a country that is committed to being pro-enterprise, multilateralist and interested in free trade rather than a country that waits until everyone else has done it to ratify.  I think that approach sends out the wrong message.</p></speech>

It is much appreciated.  I found the discourse today informing.</p> <p>  I find myself agreeing with Deputy Howlin's position.  It appears that this trade agreement and its benefits for our society outweigh our right to defend ourselves via our national courts.  I believe that is a difficult position for many considering some fought hard for our independence and the right to defend ourselves.

I believe &euro;200 million of that would come into the State coffers.</p><p>In the context of litigation, which was mentioned earlier, has the Department or the State analysed the potential of litigation and the difference between what we gain over what we might have to pay out?  It is better for society if we are more affluent but the cost of that is giving up part of our sovereignty to allow others to make decisions on litigation.</p></speech>

It is not possible to estimate the potential cost because then one has to start imagining cases that could be successful.  One would have to imagine all cases of discrimination causing harm that could be successful that would get through the ICS but that would not have got through the national courts.  To me, it is minimal or zero.  To get compensation from the State, a company has to prove that it is being discriminated against and it has incurred losses as a result.  It then gets compensation and that is the cost to the State.  It also has to be proven that the company would not have achieved the same result had it gone through the national courts.  One can imagine all sorts of scenarios where it would be different but they would be imagined.  I do not see how it could calculate that.</p> <p>  I am advised by my officials that Cyprus has not notified its rejection.  The negative parliamentary vote was about the halloumi cheese issue and geographical indicators.  It is believed that can be resolved.  No country has notified its rejection.</p></speech>

However, as there is more regulation, particularly in the area of the environment, more cases are taken by investors for compensation in respect of that investment.  Some 80% of investor claims have been taken in the past 15 years.  The number has increased year-on-year.  As we have more regulation, there is a relevant factor, so that where there is more regulation, we see more cases taken.  That has been acknowledged by the European Commission in respect of the energy charter.</p> <p>  I have been on the board of a very small company and we conduct a risk analysis.  Of course, it is about imagining scenarios.  Frankly, the idea that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has not conducted a risk analysis is cause of concern for everyone.  Something that could be considered in that is a risk analysis on the legal cost.  Even the infamous Phillip Morris case, where Australia won, it paid a &euro;12 million legal fee.  We spoke of the decency principle but the fact is countries pay large costs even when they win.  Then there is risk analysis on areas of policy where we may have exposed ourselves.  One of the grounds for claims of unfair and inequitable treatment is under Article 10.2 of CETA where representations have been made to investors to induce investment leading them to have a legitimate expectation of operating in a particular area.  A very clear example might be REITs, which have been encouraged to invest in a certain way in property, as well as many others who have been encouraged and supported.  What is regarded as encouragement and inducement in case law under ISDS is often as simple as giving planning permission, giving a grant or a meeting with a representative body of the State.  These can be regarded as creating legitimate expectation and then creating a vulnerability when regulations in that area are changed to a claim for compensation.  We need to be really clear.  No one is talking about whether the State can regulate; that is not the question.  The question is: when the State regulates, is a potential liability added by this ICS for compensation in respect of companies that feel they have been unfairly or inequitably treated?  The T&aacute;naiste indicated that we do not need to worry because we will not discriminate.  Is he telling us that all policies in these areas where there are investors from Canada will be examined and that we will ensure that we form those policies in a way that will not leave us vulnerable to cases being taken?  Is that why he is confident we will not discriminate?  Is it because the Department has conducted a full review of our exposure to investors and such things we have done that may constitute inducement?  </p> <p>  It is correct that there are arbitration mechanisms in all trade deals but it is also the case that increasingly those arbitration mechanisms are solely between the parties, that is, the countries or blocs, not private investors.  In the UK-EU deal. there is arbitration between the UK and EU.  In the new deal between Canada, the US and Mexico, there is a very limited access for investors to arbitration mechanisms.  One reason for this is internationalism, because there is increasing realisation that Europe shares international goals with Canada regarding climate, sustainability and so on, and they could be undermined when an individual company that does not have to share those values decides to take a case in respect of its interests.  In that context, is the T&aacute;naiste concerned that there may be diplomatic or international damage if an Irish company were, for example, to sue Canada for taking an action that damaged the company's interests and that the company might have thought was unfair, but that was in line with our collective international goals in areas such as climate?  </p> <p>  I am asking explicitly around discrimination and what mechanisms will be in place to anticipate and look at questions about whether there might be discrimination and the risk assessments that might be taken.</p></speech>

However, people, NGOs and companies have the right to sue.  The question is whether they are successful.</p> <p>  The risk analysis is as I described it.  We can write that up if the Senator wishes.  Essentially, we are saying the risk is minimal to zero.  It is never possible to know for sure because it is impossible to imagine every scenario but because of the reasons I explained, that is our belief.  We can certainly write it up.</p></speech>

Under CETA, only companies may take a case.  There seems to be a bit of a contrast where the climate Bill has an explicit clause limiting liability in respect of inaction on environmental matters yet, at the same time, we propose to bring in a new financial liability in respect of CETA.  We are treating NGOs and companies quite differently.  We are trying to take financial leverage from one and give it to the other. </p></speech>

This will be a scenario whereby an investor is discriminated against and loses out.  An NGO claiming losses on behalf of someone else or society in general is very different from a legal entity like a company or even an individual claiming that they incurred losses themselves.</p><p>The Senator asked whether there was a risk of the State being sued if it was to change its regulations or rules mid-stream-----</p></speech>

Is there a risk?  Of course there is.  If the State or a government changes its regulation or rules mid-stream, can it be sued?  Of course it can and it has been sued.  The State is sued from time to time when it changes its rules or regulations mid-stream or mid-process but is that risk higher because of an ICS?  I do not think so because the same company or entity could take the State to the national courts.  Is there a higher risk?  I do not think so.</p></speech>

In that regard, it is very different, which is why companies go for investor courts.  Investor courts will not consider the rights of the child or whatever other considerations a national court would balance in determining an outcome.</p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned changing things mid-stream and said companies make 30-year investments.  Is he suggesting that when a company has made a 20 or 30-year investment based on certain expectations and a State policy in that area is changed within that 20 or 30-year period, that is the State changing policy mid-stream?  I would be very concerned that we might be tied in to the expectations a company had at its point of investment.</p></speech>

Discriminatory treatment is only one part of the criteria.  In fact, unfair and inequitable treatment is a moveable feast.  It can be changed under CETA and new elements can be added to it, but one of the areas in Article 8.10.2 is that in deciding whether a company has been treated unfairly or inequitably, the question of inducements arises.  Will the T&aacute;naiste tell me whether the Government has analysed whether State planning permissions, State investment, as we have learned in some areas, State meetings with representative bodies, and other such State encouragements for companies to invest may be constituted as having given reasonable expectation?  That is part of the risk analysis.</p></speech>

I have been a member of three governments and have done that regularly.  Notwithstanding that, a policy certainty is good for business.  If a business is making a long-term investment, it wants to be aware of that, so any time we change the rules, we must take the effect of that into account.  We have to balance those considerations.</p> <p>  It might be helpful to state what is actually in the agreement.  It is very clear in my mind.  It says that a party breaches the obligation of fair and equitable treatment if a measure or series of measures constitutes a denial of justice in criminal, civil or administrative proceedings or a fundamental breach of due process, including a fundamental breach of transparency in judicial and administrative proceedings, so a company has to get over a very high bar to prove it has been mistreated.  Again, it says in the agreement for certainty that the mere fact a party regulates, including through modification of its laws, in a manner that negatively affects an investment or interferes with an investor's expectations, including its expectations of profits, does not amount to a breach of an obligation under this section, so I think there are very clear protections and there is a very high bar for companies.</p></speech>

Some of the commentary relates to the flexibility referred to by Deputy Howlin and just continuing with provisional application.  There has already been a fair amount of conversation about where ratification is and is not.  A considerable number of states have not ratified it while others have difficulties with it.  I cannot see the logic of us hamstringing ourselves.  We will leave ourselves open to the legitimate expectation of profits for companies.  We have already introduced a fair amount of legislation and will have to introduce far more in the area of climate change.  We do not need the fear of being sued affecting things.  I do not see why we would go ahead of other states, who are going to wait before they do anything, at this time.  Will the T&aacute;naiste address what Deputy Howlin said, which is that the EU is particularly adept at offering flexibility?  At the end of the day, we all accept and the T&aacute;naiste has stated himself that, in respect of Ireland and Canada, there are no difficulties relating to the legal framework that is open to people.</p></speech>

That is when we put it to a vote.  My view is the best strategic position for Ireland to take is to be early adopters of international agreements to which we have signed up and that we believe to be in our interests.  The "wait and see" argument made by the Deputy is one anyone could make about any international agreement - "let's be the last person to sign up".  That is not my philosophy and I do not think it should be our national policy or philosophy.  I think we should be a small country that is out there and is part of Europe and the world and that when we sign an agreement or convention, we should be the ones to sign up to and ratify it quickly.  That is in our interests.  I appreciate that the Deputy and I have fundamentally different views on that.</p></speech>

It has been of great assistance to the committee.  I want to deal with one issue I am still concerned we have not dealt with enough, which is the chilling effect many people have presented to us regarding regulation.  I looked again at the chapter on investment and regulation measures.  Certainly CETA does, as the T&aacute;naiste says, reaffirm the right of states to regulate for legitimate policy objectives such as public health, environment, safety and so on.  It goes on to say it can take account of an investor's profit expectations arising from its interactions with the state or statutory bodies.</p> <p>  I want to be careful in what I say about this.  With regard to our public-private partnership programme, a particular company frequently resorted to the courts.  In my judgement, our experience with this company had a real and demonstrable impact on other companies tendering for business.</p><p>I am referring to the circumstances that would arise if there were in the public system a notion that certain things could not be done because it would mean ending up in court.  Can the T&aacute;naiste assure us that the chilling effect whereby people avoid doing things for fear of being drawn before some international tribunal, which effect is very hard to quantify and see, will be addressed because it has an impact on public policy formation?</p></speech>

It is always the case that states and companies can end up in court.  I believe I know the example the Deputy is thinking about.  That has nothing to do with any international treaties but it is always the case that companies and states can end up facing each other in court.  Of course, that could have a chilling effect, deter investment or deter people from tendering.  It is a question of whether the inclusion of this additional mechanism, an investment court system, makes it better or worse.  I believe it makes it better because there is a clear system that companies can use.  It involves a panel of three people: one for Canada, one for the UK and one independent.  It is an alternative mechanism and is very difficult from what could be a much more complicated and difficult process, namely the process of trying to get through different courts in different legal systems, whether it is across Canadian provinces or EU states.  The risk exists.  It is a matter of whether the existing mechanism, this arbitration and mediation option, makes it better or worse.  I believe it alleviates the problem and makes things better.</p> <p>  With regard to the process for CETA and the argument that it is somehow being rushed, it was in negotiation for eight years and was agreed in 2016 with the joint interpretive instrument.  It was approved by the European Parliament and the 15 member states in 2017.  This was sorted out already.  One gets one shot at allaying concerns, as was done after the ratification of the Nice and Lisbon treaties.  We have already been beyond that process with CETA.  That was done through the joint interpretive instrument and the ECJ ruling.  I do not believe we can go back again.  It would be like rejecting Lisbon twice, or at least twice.  One would get a very different answer.</p></speech>

Let me be very clear: I am an internationalist.  My concerns are specifically about the investor court system and the fact that companies will have access to a court that ordinary people do not have access to.  It is astounding that there has been no risk analysis of the financial impact of this.  The T&aacute;naiste is saying there cannot be econometric analysis due to the many variables.  Although I came late to this, I understand he is referring to the financial benefit that would be created for the country.  I find it astounding that there would not be a risk analysis of the financial impact.  One of the core components of behavioural finance is the concept of overconfidence bias.  Does the T&aacute;naiste believe there is potential for overconfident bias regarding the impact if there has not been a risk analysis of the financial impact?</p></speech>

While I do not know about the Deputy, her party has certainly voted and campaigned against every single EU treaty, including the Single European Act, the Maastricht treaty, the Lisbon treaty and the fiscal treaty.  To me, the European Union and European integration comprise one of the greatest acts of internationalism in recent history.  Being against those would not be internationalist.  This is not the only trade treaty the Deputy is opposed to so I do not believe it is just down to the investor court system.  I believe there is a wider philosophical objection to multilateralism at play.  The investor court system is just the one that is arising at the moment.</p> <p>  On risk analysis, I appreciate the Deputy is pressing me on this question.  She is asking it time and again, which is fine, but I cannot really give a different answer.  We do not have a difficulty in writing up what I have mentioned as a risk analysis but our view is that the risk is minimal to zero, precisely because we would have to identify potential cases that would be successful in an investor court system but not in the national courts.  We just do not see-----</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste makes his point based on logic but it is very clear that there are biases.  While the T&aacute;naiste may disagree with my concerns and I may disagree with his view on benefits, we must, if we are to deal with this, because it is of such importance, realise that the fact that no analysis has been done is an issue.  While I understand what the T&aacute;naiste is saying about variables and so on, some kind of risk analysis of the financial impact must be done.  We may have different opinions as to the benefits, and either of us could be proven right, but I am very concerned that if there is no risk analysis we will be basing the whole approach on overconfidence bias.</p></speech>

I can and everyone can, and anyone doing the analysis could also be biased.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste gave the example of Egypt and stated the case was won in the end.  The problem was that the workers did not get a pay rise for several years while the court case was ongoing.  The same applies to New Zealand.  As a former doctor, the T&aacute;naiste will appreciate that New Zealand and Australia withheld the introduction of plain packaging while the court case went ahead.</p> <p>  Let me give an example of regulatory chill at home.  Maybe the T&aacute;naiste can rule this out for us.  The programme for Government contained a commitment to ban the importation of liquified natural gas, LNG, at Shannon.  It was previously on a list of projects of common interest, PCIs, of the European Commission.  The Government removed its support for the initiative from the PCI list but it remains on the PCI list until September.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications released a policy statement on a ban on the importation of fracked gas last week.  He said the Attorney General said it would not be compatible with EU law for the State to ban LNG importation.  The Irish Centre for Human Rights at NUI Galway has a legal opinion that clearly contradicts that.  Information I have from the European Parliament's research service states Article 194 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union indicates that member states choose the conditions for exploiting their energy resources and which energy sources they use so they can, therefore, ban particular fossil fuels and structures if they so decide to.   Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm categorically that the Energy Charter Treaty was not part of the Attorney General&rsquo;s opinion concerning why we are now going ahead with what was in the programme for Government, which was a ban on LNG importation?</p> <p>  Under the Energy Charter Treaty, in respect of which the T&aacute;naiste keeps referring to fair and equitable treatment, 62% of the investor cases have been taken based on fair and equitable treatment.  Is it not true that the chance of winning a case is far greater if the case is taken through the investor court system as opposed to the national courts system and that this is why investors choose it?   We are going to set ourselves up for greater losses because the odds are against us.  One of the international legal experts said it is the equivalent of playing at home rather than away.  When one signs up to an investor court system, one is signing up to playing away constantly because investors will choose that system.  I would particularly like the T&aacute;naiste to confirm categorically that the Energy Charter Treaty was not part of the thinking in the advice that the Attorney General gave the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications on why we could not ban LNG importation.</p><p>Is it the case that we cannot ban it, which contradicts the advice I have from the EU, or is it that we stand at risk of being sued for compensation?</p></speech>

I have not read the legal advice from the Attorney General on that matter.  I have only read the memorandum brought to Cabinet by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  The best thing to do is take it up with him.  The issues around LNG and the Energy Charter Treaty are matters for him, as Minister.  The Energy Charter Treaty, which is old at this stage, was not deemed to be unconstitutional.  If that was not unconstitutional, it is hard to see how CETA could be.</p></speech>

The climate and finance committees are looking at that.  From the answers that have been given, it seems that other Ministers may have pieces of the puzzle.  Hopefully they will be able to tease that out in those committees as they scrutinise what is proposed.</p> <p>  I have a question on the ECJ ruling and the suggestion to the effect that it is all done.  There were two ECJ rulings.  One told us that states had responsibility, explicitly, for considering the investor court component and that this could not be decided at European level because of its implications for states.  That is one ECJ ruling we are trying to fulfil through the process of scrutiny.</p> <p>  Paragraph 221 of the more recent ECJ ruling explicitly states that the dispute settlement mechanism should be reviewed prior to member states having to consider this in the ratification process.  It explicitly pointed out that the investor court system is not finished.  One of the concerns of the ECJ is that there is inequitable access and small and medium businesses do not have the same access to the investor court system as larger companies.  It found the measures and suggestions the Commission made in that respect, about a one-judge court and so forth, inadequate.  It explicitly asked that the mechanism be reviewed, allowing sufficient time for member states to consider that in the ratification process.  As far as we know, it has not been reviewed.  Is that not something of which member states should be aware?</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Howlin that things may need to be negotiated.  Whether or not they are negotiated to remove ICS, which I would prefer, it can certainly be adapted.  One area which could be adapted is the 20-year sunset clause.  Will the T&aacute;naiste comment on that clause, which has been identified by the European Commission as a major concern in the context of the Energy Charter Treaty?   Does the T&aacute;naiste not think that we should look for a shorter sunset clause so if we have adverse consequences from an investor court system under CETA, we have the option of exiting?</p> <p>  A one-word response will do in respect of my final question regarding internationalist goals.  I am an internationalist, as others have said.   Does the T&aacute;naiste see a danger in terms of our international shared diplomatic goals in areas like climate?  Is there a tension between that and the goals individual companies may have in respect of the investment treaty?</p></speech>

It has been a long time since we have debated legislation in the Seanad but I enjoyed it when we did.  It is hard to keep up with the number of issues raised sometimes, so my apologies if I missed them.</p> <p>  On this treaty being scrutinised, it was the Government that agreed that the treaty should receive more scrutiny.  It was a proposal from the Green Party, which the Government accepted, that it be referred to committees.  When it comes to a vote, as it will and should, it will be one of the most scrutinised and debated treaties Ireland has been asked to ratify.   That is good but I hope when it comes to a vote, people will allow the vote to happen and will not try to disrupt it through further procedural tactics at that point.  I understand that SMEs have access to the investor court system and can look for a single-member arbitration panel.  That is supposed to be designed to assist them.</p></speech>

On climate goals, there is always a potential conflict between trade and climate.  Trade, by its nature, means transporting things across seas and oceans.  That can increase emissions but one has to look at these things in the round.  There could be major advantages in terms of achieving our climate goals from increased trade and investment from Canada, particularly given their knowledge in the energy industry.  I do not mean gas, but renewables and so on.  There are potential benefits there.</p> <p>  The 20-year exit clause will only apply in the unlikely event of either party terminating the agreement.  The purpose of the investment court system is to protect small and big businesses, individuals and pension funds from discriminatory and unfair treatment by the state.  It is built around the core principles found in most domestic courts and international tribunals, such as permanency, the possibility of an appeal and the random allocation of cases.  Were a party to deny an investor due process by simply terminating the agreement, this could result in significant adverse effects for the investor and would be against the principles of natural justice.  Given that one of the main goals of CETA is to encourage further investment between the EU and Canada, which will facilitate jobs and improve prosperity for both parties, the agreement ensures only investment made under the terms of CETA is protected for a period of 20 years in the unlikely event that the agreement is terminated.  It once again seeks to encourage and protect investment, which I believe is a good thing.  It is important to note that only investments made prior to the agreement being terminated would be covered.  The ICS provisions under CETA would not be available to new investors during a phase-out period.</p> <p>  On CETA being revised to permanently exclude ICS from the agreement, all international trade agreements have dispute resolution arrangements of some sort.  Recent witnesses before the committee appear to have indicated there is very little appetite for reopening the agreement, from either the EU or Canada.  I can attest to that.  There is a fear that would lead to a Pandora&rsquo;s box situation regarding adjustments to the current text of the agreement.  Once the agreement is reopened, all the agreement is reopened.  I can attest to that when it comes to other negotiations I have been involved in.  Having negotiated a text that has been agreed and ratified by most European states over almost a ten-year period, there is no appetite to reopen it.  If we sought to exclude the dispute resolution mechanism, it is not clear what value the protections set out in the agreement would be worth if one cannot vindicate one&rsquo;s rights.  The protections are intended to encourage investors in terms of the security of their investments.</p><p>We need to remember that the provisions of CETA are not judicable in our domestic courts because CETA is not part of our national law.  In the absence of ICS, a Canadian investor would be required to progress a case under the respective national law and constitutions of 27 member states.  If we are confirming protections in CETA, we need a way that they can be vindicated.  I believe using arbitration and in a single consistent framework across 27 member states is a practical option.</p><p> There is an attempt to make it less costly for SMEs to engage in dispute resolution than is currently the case.  CETA includes specific provisions on mediation which do not exist outside EU agreements.  These are of relevance to SMEs, as mediation represents a low-cost option compared with full litigation in the courts.  CETA encourages parties to a dispute to solve the issue amicably within 60 days, rather than go through litigation.  The possibility to have mediation is available at any time in the proceedings.</p><p> The provisions allowing parties to hold consultations via video conference, which is easy and of low cost, can be of particular benefit to SMEs.  Procedural deadlines also make proceedings faster and reduce the cost of litigation.  As I mentioned earlier, an SME has the option, on request, to submit claims to a single judge which would make proceedings faster and cheaper.  It seems that ICS might be a better option for SMEs rather than relying solely on national courts.</p></speech>

At the outset of this process, when we said we would go to the committees and not have a vote in the D&aacute;il, I predicted that it was likely that people would not change their minds.  That is not necessarily a bad thing.  It means that all the issues have been aired and at least we know the items on which we agree and disagree.  I hope the members will allow the D&aacute;il to have a democratic vote on this in due course because that is the very least, we should expect in a democracy.</p></speech>

Before we start, I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the bravery of the two members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who were shot and injured yesterday evening in Blanchardstown.  This shocking event reminds us all of the dangers in which members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na put themselves every day to protect us.  I also pay tribute to the other members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who responded to the incident without any further injuries.  I acknowledge the full support and co-operation they received from the other first responders.  I wish both garda&iacute; a swift recovery and thank them and all those who responded last night to what was a very difficult and dangerous situation.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to attend to discuss the 2021 Further Revised Estimates for the Department of Social Protection.  Almost exactly a year ago, this committee considered the first ever Social Protection Estimate to include spending related to income supports introduced to provide assistance to people whose jobs and livelihoods were impacted by the pandemic.  I am here today, one year later, to discuss the continuation of that support as we thankfully begin to work our way out of what has been a very dark time for our economy and society.  As we all know, Covid-19 has presented many diverse and complex challenges for society, for the economy and for the Government in supporting our people who are dealing with these challenges daily.  The speed of reaction required to deal with the ever-changing nature of the pandemic required decisions to be made quickly, and that is what the Government did.  Across all branches of the Government, services and supports were galvanised to develop and deliver innovative measures designed to mitigate as far as possible the impact of Covid on the lives of our people.  One of the critical challenges has been how to support workers who are suddenly without the means to support themselves and their families.  This is why we have a social protection system and why it is important to secure the resources that allow us to respond efficiently and effectively in real time.  The roll-out of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, in a very short space of time proved my Department's capacity to be responsive in providing invaluable income supports.  The scope and range of other supports such as an enhanced Covid illness benefit and the flexibility introduced to rent supplement contributed to easing the financial impact of the virus on the most vulnerable in our society.</p> <p>  The Further Revised Estimate which the committee is to consider today reflects an ongoing commitment to supporting those who continue to be affected by the pandemic and all the Department's customers who need our support on an ongoing basis.  When the 2021 Estimate was originally compiled in October 2020, parts of the country were at either level 2 or level 3 of the public health restrictions.  That Estimate envisaged expenditure in 2021 of &euro;25.13 billion based on Government decisions that had been made at the time, including that pandemic supports such as the PUP and employment wage subsidy scheme would close at the end of March.  The resurgence of the virus in the weeks and months which followed led to the Government deciding to extend payment of and access to the PUP until the end of June 2021.  The employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, was similarly extended to the end of June 2021.  These decisions, as well as the extension of other Covid-related spending, mean that further funding is required in 2021 to meet these new commitments.</p><p>An additional &euro;4.1 billion in funding is required, bringing the Estimate for the Department&rsquo;s spending to &euro;29.14 billion.</p><p> The primary drivers of the increase in social protection spending in 2021 are the schemes which provide support to the parts of the economy that continue to suffer the consequences of the Covid crisis.  Nearly 20% or &euro;5.75 billion of the total departmental spending of &euro;29.14 billion is attributable to Covid-related schemes.  PUP expenditure is estimated at &euro;3.3 billion or more than 11% of the total 2021 expenditure.  The funding of Revenue&rsquo;s employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, is estimated to be &euro;2.36 billion, representing 8.1% of the 2021 Estimate.  The Estimate also reflects the fact that the Social Insurance Fund, SIF, from which PUP is funded, is now in deficit.  The &euro;453 million surplus in the fund at the beginning of 2021 has now been eliminated.  SIF expenditure for the year is projected to be &euro;15.34 billion.  With SIF income projections of &euro;11.13 billion, the deficit for the year is projected to be &euro;4.22 billion.  Taking account of the 2020 surplus carried forward, the deficit, which will be funded by the Exchequer through the Department&rsquo;s Vote, will be &euro;3.76 billion in 2021.</p><p> As Minister for Social Protection, I never lose sight of the fact that our core business is the provision of income support throughout the course of people&rsquo;s lives.  Pension expenditure continues to be the biggest element of social protection spending.  It represents more than 30% of total expenditure and amounts to &euro;8.8 billion in 2021.  Working age income supports, with projected expenditure of &euro;7.9 billion, account for 27% of projected expenditure.  This includes &euro;3.3 billion for PUP expenditure up to the end of June 2021.  It also includes &euro;3.2 billion on jobseeker payments for the year.  Illness, disability and carers payments, with expenditure of &euro;4.9 billion, make a significant contribution towards supporting the most vulnerable in society and represents 16.8% of overall 2021 spending.  Working age employment supports cater for a range of schemes aimed at helping people get or retain employment and have a projected spend of &euro;3.3 billion or 11.3% of 2021 expenditure.  Included in this figure is a &euro;2.36 billion provision for the EWSS.  Expenditure on children is nearly &euro;2.7 billion in 2021 or 9.1% of overall social protection spending.  The supplementary payments programme funds are a range of household benefits, free travel, fuel allowance and other schemes.  It represents 3% of the projected 2021 spend at &euro;878 million.</p><p> Currently, the live register records the number of unemployed as 173,293.  This does not, however, include those on the PUP.  To provide an assessment of the cost of supporting those not in employment throughout the year, the Estimate applied the unemployment rates underpinning the April 2021 stability programme update.  Based on these quarterly unemployment rates, the numbers unemployed in each quarter, whether on PUP or jobseeker payments in the first two quarters, or jobseeker payments for the second half of the year, were determined.  The Estimate is, therefore, based on a robust foundation of the 2021 unemployment costs, which is not revealed by live register numbers alone.</p><p> The broad overview I have presented to members of Vote 37 expenditure, is developed in greater detail in the comprehensive briefing material provided to the committee last week.  It is, however, important to note that the expenditure underpinning this further Revised Estimate is based on decisions made at a point in time in a constantly evolving environment.  The Government is actively considering how we continue to provide supports beyond June as we enter a new phase of the pandemic, where many people have returned to their jobs and people gain back the freedoms that were curtailed due to public health restrictions.</p><p> It is encouraging that, in recent weeks, we have seen in excess of 100,000 people leave the PUP and return to employment and self-employment.  The coming weeks will see that progress continuing.  Research from the ESRI and others has shown that the Department&rsquo;s response to the pandemic cushioned the financial shock for people throughout the State as the crisis hit, particularly for those in the lower income deciles.  In excess of &euro;7.6 billion has been spent on PUP alone.  Some 23 million payments have been issued, with 865,000 people receiving at least one payment.  More than 10 million calls have been answered.  I acknowledge committee members and the Chairman have acknowledged the huge efforts by staff of the Department in every county to ensure people got the support they needed, when they needed it, during what has been a hugely challenging period for our country.  I look forward to hearing members' views and answering their questions over the next few hours.</p></speech>

I will repeat myself and acknowledge the great effort of staff in the Department, the Minister and her predecessor, Senator Regina Doherty.  What jumped out at me from the Minister&rsquo;s presentation at the end were the figures of 23 million payments and more than 10 million calls answered: they are astounding numbers.</p> <p>  I invite members to raise any issues with her about the Estimate on a programme-by-programme basis.  I request that members indicate what programme they are referring to from the outset.  As we have a relatively small number of members in attendance, we will have multiple opportunities so we can give the Minister a chance to answer rather than over-egging it with questions from the off.</p></speech>

Will new people be able to go on the PUP after that or is it intended to cease it?  We need clarification.  People are dependent on this payment.  Many people will not be back to work according to figures from the Minister's Department in reply to a parliamentary question I tabled.  On 1 July, it is estimated that there will be 325,000 people in receipt of PUP.  When will decisions be made on this so that people can plan with some certainty as to where they are going?</p> <p>  The second issue the Minister might clarify relates to the projected figure of 345,000 PUP recipients in the first week of June.  She said there has been a drop of 100,000 in the past month.  What is the latest figure she has for the number in receipt of PUP from this week or last week?  Are we going to overshoot or undershoot the end of May-beginning of June target?  Can she explain why we always go through this charade of not providing for the Christmas bonus in the budget calculations or in the Estimates?  It makes year-on-year comparisons difficult to gauge, because it looks as if there is an over expenditure on the previous year but there is not really.  The reality is that the bonus was paid out and it is not provided for in the Estimate.  The Minister might explain why it is not provided.  Is it intended to be back, as I hope?  I presume she will confirm there will be a Christmas bonus.  There is this situation of going through the year with people not knowing whether they are going to get it.  There will be utter shock in the system if people did not get it.  The Minister might explain that.</p> <p>  Third, how good is cyber control in the Minister's Department?  We have seen what happened and can imagine what would happen if there was a ransomware attack on the social welfare system and payments could not be made.  It is too horrible to think about.  How prepared is the Department?  It has a large range of systems, some of which are much older than others, and that they are constantly being renewed.  That could pose problems.  What is the situation, and will there be an immediate step up in protecting our social welfare system?  After health, social welfare and Revenue seem to me to be the two key services in our system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-26a.109" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021052600002#C00100"><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v for raising all those questions.  I will try to take them but he should come back to me if I leave any out.  As the Deputy will be aware, there has been a significant investment in the PUP.  At its peak in May 2020, more than 600,000 people were availing of the payment and, as restrictions were eased, the numbers dropped to just over 200,000 in October 2020.  That clearly shows that as the economy reopens, people want to get back to work.  The future of the PUP continues at current rates and remains open for new applications until the end of June.  The Government will set out the future of the PUP in the coming weeks, probably at the start of June.  As one might imagine, I am talking to my Government colleagues about a pathway out of the PUP.  We will soon have a better sense of how things are going with the vaccine roll-out, the number of new cases and the trajectory of the virus, and we will also have a clearer picture in terms of the numbers returning to work.  We have been clear that there will be no cliff edge for people.  We certainly have not been found wanting as a Government in regard to supporting people who have been out of work through no fault of their own.  I will meet my Government colleagues in the coming week and we hope to make an announcement in early June.</p> <p>  The current number of people receiving the PUP is 345,000.  We project that the unemployment number on Friday, 25 June, will stand at 523,281.  We estimate that 330,047 will be on the PUP and 193,234 on the traditional jobseeker's payments.  This estimate was based on assumptions made in April 2021, before the Government announcements on 28 April that have seen the reopening of sectors of the economy, with a significant number of exits from the PUP.  We are doing much better than we had anticipated because the economy has reopened.</p> <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Christmas bonus is announced at budget time and is not provided in the Estimates.  The briefing provided to the committee shows last year's expenditure without the bonus to aid comparison.  The decision to pay the Christmas bonus is something the Department and I discuss with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and its Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath.</p> <p>  On the cyberattack issue, the Department has a full-time information security team, headed at principal officer level, and operates an information security management system, developed to meet the requirements of the industry standard ISO 27001.  The Department adopts a security-by-design and defence-in-depth approach to cybersecurity, meaning the system and networks are designed and built with a view to minimising the risk of a security breach.  Operational practices are developed and deployed to identify and deal with any breaches that may be attempted.  The Department ICT systems are fully operational and are always monitored from a cybersecurity perspective.  The recent HSE cyber incident has not affected the Department's core payment systems.</p> <p>  Out of an abundance of caution, the Department has deployed extensive additional cyberdefence mechanisms to provide additional reassurance.  Nothing abnormal has been detected to date.  The Department's information security team continues to monitor events closely and is liaising with the National Cyber Security Centre.  This is an issue of which we are very conscious in the Department and much work goes into it.  Sometimes we are criticised when we make announcements because there may be a lead-in time to putting those payments into effect, but one of the reasons there is a lead-in time is we have to build the system securely to ensure there are no cracks where hackers can get in.  We are conscious that these criminals - they are criminals - are becoming more and more expert in their work, and we continue to monitor the issue closely at the Department.  We are conscious that we hold a large volume of data and that the work we do is very important to people's daily lives.</p></speech>

On the PUP, I appreciate that she cannot make a decision at this time but the initial plan was from April to move those remaining on the PUP over to the jobseeker's payments.  Is that still being considered or what is likely to happen?</p> <p>  Has an extension of the fuel allowance, as it was last year, been considered by the Department?</p> <p>  Some people were moved from the PUP to jobseeker's payments because of the qualified child provision and so on.  On the short-time work support, for workers such as those in airlines who are working on reduced days and whose industries have not fully reopened, they may be running out of the 234 days they are allowed to remain on that scheme and running out of their PRSI stamps.  What are the options for them?  Would the Department examine extending the time that people can remain on the likes of the short-time work support or the jobseeker's benefit, given that their industries are not fully up and running?</p> <p>  The Minister referred to the rent supplement and how that was made available for people during Covid, which was welcome.  It was made available, has been extended to the end of the year, for people in domestic violence situations   Has the Department considered leaving that there permanently as a support for domestic violence victims or survivors?  I think that would be important.</p> <p>  According to the Estimates, the blind pension accounts for a cost of roughly &euro;12 million to &euro;13 million every year - small money, I think the Minister would agree, relative to the size of the social protection budget.  I recently met an artist who is in receipt of the blind pension, as I mentioned to the Minister the other day.  She has to be careful about awards and bursaries because the blind pension is means tested.  It reminded me of a case in my constituency office last year where the partner of a blind lady got a promotion and pay rise, which led to her losing her blind pension.  The blind pension is unique in the list of means-tested social welfare payments in that if my partner's income increases, I am still blind.  For an artist, it must be so difficult worrying about taking a gig or winning something in case he or she loses the blind pension.  Should the blind pension not be treated differently?  If a person is blind, he or she is blind for life.  That should be examined and I would appreciate if the Minister would undertake to do that.  It is small money for a small number of people.</p> <p>  I met staff members from the EmployAbility scheme yesterday.  They are concerned about the tender and what is happening with the future of EmployAbility.  I am sure the Minister will agree it is a unique service, aimed at persons with a disability or with mental health issues.  Can she give any certainty on the issue?  I acknowledge the Department is tendering out for job clubs in the local employment service, LES, but what are the plans for other schemes?  What is the future for the likes of T&uacute;s and community employment?  Will the Department tender out or contract out for all these services?  The Minister might give an update.</p> <p>  I have previously raised with the Minister the issue of the widow's pension.  The legislation is very outdated, given that it still requires the recipient to have been married in order to receive the widow's pension.  I accept it is complicated and there are legal impacts and so on, but some of these people may have been with someone for 20 or 30 years.  On the radio last week, there was a story about a person who had hoped to get married last March.  The woman became very sick and the wedding had to be cancelled because of Covid.  She later died, sadly, and the partner was left with nothing.  Where there are kids or dependants or where someone has been in a relationship for long enough, there should be some way around this and these people should be supported.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-26a.111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021052600002#D00100"><p>I thank the Deputy.  The first issue she raised relates to the PUP.  As I stated, I am considering various options in terms of the PUP as the economy reopens.  I am discussing it with my Government colleagues and I will be in a position to make an announcement in early June.  We are working very hard on it and I am conscious of several issues that we are taking into consideration.</p> <p>  As regards the fuel allowance, it is paid to 372,000 low-income households.  In 2020, an increase of four weeks was provided on a once-off basis.  Although I understand these are difficult times, especially for the vulnerable, any further measures have to be considered while taking account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.  In this regard, it is important to note the scale of the support provided throughout the pandemic, with more than &euro;7.6 billion paid out on the PUP alone.  Budget 2020 increased the fuel allowance by &euro;3.50 per week from January 2021, ensuring recipients benefited from the increased payment through the winter.  Finally, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet once-off costs, including heating costs.</p> <p>  In terms of the short-time working support, where a person has been temporarily placed on a shorter working week, he or she may be entitled to part-time jobseeker's payment or short-time work.  As the Deputy stated, several workers in the airline sector have been availing of some of these supports.  Where a recipient of jobseeker's benefit is working for part of a week, the amount of jobseeker's benefit he or she is paid is based on a five-day week.  This means that for each day the person is employed, one fifth of the normal rate of jobseeker's benefit is deducted from his or her payment.  The jobseeker's benefit payment week is calculated on a six-day week, with one fifth deducted for each day worked.  The sixth day is an unpaid day but counts towards the cumulative total each week.  The duration of the payment of jobseeker's benefit is nine months or 234 days for people with 260 or more PRSI contributions.  It is paid for six months or 156 days for people with fewer than 260 PRSI contributions.  It is a fundamental feature of the Department's range of benefit payments, including jobseeker's benefit, that the payment is time-limited.  Time limits apply across a range of PRSI-related schemes, such as maternity benefit and illness benefit.  Where a person exhausts his or her entitlement to jobseeker's benefit short-time work support, he or she may be eligible for support under the jobseeker's allowance scheme.  The Department will contact recipients of jobseeker's benefit short-time work support ten weeks and four weeks in advance of the expiry of their payment.</p> <p>  As regards the blind pension, it is a means-tested payment.  We can examine the means test in the context of the budgetary process.  I accept the Deputy's point that if one is blind, one is blind for life, but we have to examine the issue because there are other medical conditions that, unfortunately, are also life-long conditions.  I will consider the issue.</p> <p>  On victims of domestic violence, the pilot scheme will run until the end of the year.  It has been a valuable scheme, especially in terms of providing support to victims of domestic violence such that they did not have to remain in the premises or in a very difficult situation.  It is something that I very much support and I will certainly be looking at it towards the end of the year.</p> <p>  On the issue of the employability scheme, last Monday I met those running one of the schemes in my county and had a good long chat with them about the wonderful service they provide.  One thing that struck me is that those running the employability scheme place people in jobs but it is the follow-up they do that is really important.  If there are problems between the employer and the employee, they are able to facilitate addressing those issues.  That is key to their success because they have been doing really good work.  Some of those with whom they are dealing are long-term unemployed and vulnerable people and I take this opportunity to thank them for their work, as did the Deputy.  As the Deputy is aware, we are expanding several schemes and I hope to publish the request for tender for the expanded schemes very shortly.  The employability scheme goes to the end of the year.  We have no plans as yet in that regard but, as the Deputy is aware and as I explained to the staff running the scheme, because of procurement rules we will have to put it out to tender in due course.  At this point, the employability scheme continues.  Just as the scheme is encouraging people to have the confidence to find new work and take up employment, those running it should have the confidence that they are well able to bid for this work.  I am very confident, given their track record, the work they do and their involvement in the community, that they have a very good chance of winning the contracts.  </p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point regarding the widow's pension in the context of partners.  Last year, I increased the grant that get widows and surviving civil partners get.  It is a once-off payment of &euro;8,000.  It had not been increased for many years.  When a person is bereaved, it is a very difficult time for him or her.  I was of the view that there is a lot of expense involved now with funerals and such things, so I increased the grant by &euro;2,000 to &euro;8,000.  It is available.  I take the Deputy's point.  We review all our schemes to make sure they are suitable and meet the needs of citizens.  As the Deputy can imagine, the legal context governs relationships such as marriage.  It is regulated by the Minster for Justice.  I suppose I will have to speak to her as well.  The status of marriage and civil partnerships is a much broader policy area than its implications in this regard.  I will certainly consider the issue.</p></speech>

As regards the PUP, members are aware that people are getting the payment based on what they earned before the restrictions came in.  Now we can see there is an argument for tapering the PUP.  If a person who is currently on &euro;250 or &euro;300 works in the restaurant or broader hospitality sector and is brought back for outdoor service but on fewer hours, such as for ten hours per week, and will only get &euro;100, that person would be down by &euro;100 or &euro;150.  There is an argument for tapering the PUP to cater for those workers so that they do not find themselves on probably half what they received on the PUP, which was calculated on the basis of their previous wages.  I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on that issue.  Is she considering it?</p> <p>  Many of the questions I intended to ask have been covered and I will not repeat them.  I refer to workers who were on the temporary Covid-19 wage support scheme, TWSS, payment from March to September last year.  All present know why the scheme was brought in and I am not in any way arguing that it was a negative payment.  It kept workers employed and it assisted employers whose turnover was down by 25% or more.  However, I refer to the workers who worked right through the pandemic, such as pharmacy employees and many thousands of other workers.</p><p>They found they had to pay tax on the TWSS payment.  The workers see that as a cut in their wages because the basis of the payment, as arranged by the Government and the Revenue Commissioners, was that the employer would not have to return the PRSI or tax payment, such that the worker would get paid his or her net pay.  Owing to that, workers found themselves paying tax on their net pay.  Essentially, it was a cut in the wages of the workers and they are very aggrieved by it.  This matter has not been given the airing it should have been given from the point of view of the workers.  What is the Minister's opinion on that?  Should the workers be in this situation?</p><p> Is the Minister considering introducing paid miscarriage leave at any point?</p></speech>

With regard to the future of the PUP, I take the Deputy's point regarding the tapering.  I am examining all the options and discussing them with my officials.  I am also talking to the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I am trying to address this fairly.  The one thing I have said is that there will be no cliff edge.  I hope I will be in a position to make an announcement on this in early June.  The issues the Deputy is raising are the matters I am taking into consideration.  I appreciate any points made to me because it is all about trying to do our best.  We are here to help people.</p> <p>  I understand what the Deputy is saying about the wage subsidy scheme and how it has meant workers ended up with somewhat less because they are being taxed on a lesser amount.  I will raise that with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  The rule is that if in any one year one earns a certain amount of income, regardless of the source, income tax has to be paid on it.  That is the way it works but I will raise it with the Minister.</p> <p>  We review issues such as paid leave for those who have had a miscarriage.  I can understand why somebody would need to get time off.  It is a bit wider than that.  An individual might have some type of illness also.  It is a matter we will certainly consider.</p></speech>

I wish them the very best and a speedy recovery.  The incident highlights the risk that garda&iacute; take.  They put their bodies on the line to safeguard the public.  I wish the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na well.</p> <p>  On the Estimates, I pay tribute to the Minister and her officials for responding comprehensively to the huge challenge presented by Covid.  I welcome the Minister's comment that a decision will be made on the PUP and wage subsidy schemes in early June.  We need clarity in this regard.  Certain sectors, including aviation, hospitality and tourism, have been affected more than others.  These sectors are major contributors to our economy and employ hundreds of thousands of people.  There is a strong argument to be made for extending the supports for the sectors until the end of this year and even into next year.  I encourage the Minister to give strong consideration to that proposal with her Government colleagues.</p> <p>  I have a couple of points to make.  I acknowledge the Minister has been working to try to resolve the issues concerning community employment, CE, supervisors.  She has been engaging with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, in this regard.  Could she update the committee on the position on finding a resolution to the long-standing issue?  Every member of this committee will be very familiar with the case.  There were hopes that it could be resolved in the immediate term.  I hope the Minister will have positive news about it.</p> <p>  I have received queries on the payment for people who retire at 65.  The Minister will be aware that there are many companies in the Clare area, including the Shannon area, that employ a lot of people.  Over the years, certain people retired at 60 but they are not deemed eligible for the new payment that was introduced.  I have dealt with the case of a man who was 60 when he retired.  He worked for 41 years and made all the relevant contributions but appears to be 13 contributions short and is not deemed eligible for the new payment that was introduced.  This is grossly unfair.  I ask the Minister to examine the circumstances.  Again, I thank her for her attendance at this committee and for her positive engagement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-26a.116" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021052600002#E00400"><p>I thank Deputy Carey for raising these issues.  I thank him for his comments on the bravery of the garda&iacute; last night.</p> <p>  As the Deputy knows, we have supported many people through the PUP, with total expenditure to date amounting to &euro;7.75 billion.  We are considering the future of the payment.  It is the role of the social protection system to provide a basic income.  With regard to sector-specific measures, we need to take the point up with the Ministers with responsibility for the relevant sectors.  The social protection system has never paid sector-specific payments because it gets very complicated and it is probably unworkable.  For example, where does one draw the line between a painter or electrician on a film set in the arts sector and a painter or electrician on a building site?  Many supports have been given to the music, entertainment and arts sectors through the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has provided a broad range of supports for the business sector.  Therefore, there are sector-specific supports within each Department.</p> <p>  We have been working with CE supervisors and have had discussions with them.  For several years, they have been requesting, through their union representatives, the allocation of Exchequer funding to implement a 2008 Labour Court recommendation.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had to have regard to any potential Exchequer exposure associated with dealing with the specific issue relating solely to the CE supervisors arising from the Labour Court recommendations.  The Deputy can appreciate that.  Any proposals to resolve this specific issue can and will only apply to CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors.  We have been working closely with the relevant Department and we have made a proposal.  The proposal was sent to the unions representing the CE supervisors and CE assistant supervisors.  The unions had a few queries and we have reverted to them with the answers.  We are engaging with the unions on this basis.  I hope we will find a resolution very quickly.  The process is at an advanced stage.  Any settlement arising will apply only to those parties who were the subject of the 2008 Labour Court recommendation and the related discussions with the Department, that is, the CE supervisors and assistant supervisors.</p><p>I am confident that we have a solid basis for progressing and resolving this issue while not exposing the Exchequer to any additional costs.  That is the position as it stands.  As I have said, I hope we will get this long-standing issue resolved fairly soon.</p><p> Regarding the payment for the 65-year-olds, the Deputy will remember that, before we brought in this payment, people who had to retire at 65 had to come in and fill out a form.  This was the issue which was raised with me at the time.  I saw it myself.  They had to fill out applications for jobseeker's payments.  These were people who had worked all of their lives but who had to retire at the age of 65 because of their contracts.  They had to sign on and to present and say that they were available for work.  I felt that was wrong.  That is why we brought in the retirement payment for 65-year-olds.  Originally, this could be claimed for nine months, depending on one's contributions.  We then made it available for the full year but it only applied to people who retired at the age of 65.  It remains in place.  People do not have to sign on or attend an Intreo centre.  The social insurance contribution requirements are not as high as those for State pension eligibility.  Given that they have a recent attachment to the workforce, people retiring at 65 should, in most cases, meet the PRSI requirements.  One has to have been working at the age of 65 to get it.  That is part of it.  Unfortunately, the particular person Deputy Carey mentioned would not seem to qualify but, if the Deputy wishes to provide me with the details, I am happy to take a look at the case. </p></speech>

I also commend An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on its actions last night in bringing to a conclusion, without any further injuries or loss of life, the incident that occurred just around the corner from my house.  It is quite scary when one is coming home, as I was coming home from the convention centre last night, to see the place completely surrounded by garda&iacute;.  It was a very frightening incident for all of the community and particularly for the children from Mountview Boys and Girls Football Club, who had to be very quickly brought into the community centre.  I commend the coaches, who acted very swiftly.</p> <p>  I have one quick question regarding women who are pregnant and who are in receipt of the PUP.  As businesses reopen, many women who are pregnant will not want to go back to work in what may be unsafe environments.  They may not have got the vaccine.  Will the Minister assure such women that their payments will continue?  Will she comment on that?</p></speech>

The incident was certainly a big shock to all of us.  The Deputy and I were both in the convention centre and, when I came out, it was a big shock to hear that had happened.  I acknowledge and recognise the community, which responded well, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who managed a very difficult situation, and the first responders who were on the scene.  To everybody involved I say "well done".  It was a very difficult situation.</p> <p>  With regard to the PUP, I hear what the Deputy is saying in respect of women who are pregnant.  These sorts of things all form part of the considerations.  I take the Deputy's point that such women are not able to go back to work.  As I have said, we are discussing all of this.  I have had a good number of meetings with my officials.  We are trying to get this right.  I will take all of the matters that have been raised with me today into consideration.  I thank Deputy Paul Donnelly for that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-26a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1617" speakername="Marc &Oacute; Cathasaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021052600002#F00400"><p>I will ask my own questions next.  If members wish to come in for a second round of questioning, I ask them to use the "raise hand" function.  I have a number of general questions but, in this round, I will focus on more specific questions arising from the Revised Estimate.</p> <p>  With regard to live register figures and their interface with the PUP, do we have figures as to the number of people who transition from the PUP to jobseeker's payments?  If we have such figures, what do they imply?  If people chose to make that transition, it obviously shows that they decided they would be better off having done so.  </p> <p>  What do we know about people on the PUP?  Are we gathering that type of information?  Do we know their living arrangements, their total household income or whether they are students or people who were formerly employed?  This will obviously become a huge data set in the future.  It would be very useful to have that level of information so that we can know what sectors are most liable to this type of shock.  It would set a context for the continuing work in the Government with regard to universal basic income and for the way in which we set our basic welfare rates.  What information is the Department gathering in that regard?</p> <p>  I very much welcome the significant increase in funding for school meals, 21.8% or &euro;65 million.  What metrics are we using to measure efficacy?  Are we just talking about the number of meals on tables or the amount of money or are we looking at other ways of defining our success?  Are we looking at the nutritional quality of the meals being delivered, for example?  Are we looking at the social outcomes of children getting to sit together with a hot school meal?  I am interested in the metrics used in this regard.</p> <p>  A very small scheme which jumped out at me is the experience year Europe, EYE, scheme.  This caught my eye, and I am not going to apologise for the pun.  Funding for this has increased slightly.  It is a very interesting scheme for us.  We know that young people suffered disproportionately during the lockdowns.  It would be nice to see a pandemic divided for them, perhaps through a scheme like this which would support them in a European experience.  It is a very welcome scheme.  Would the Minister like to comment on that?</p> <p>  There is a line item for miscellaneous services.  Some &euro;17.8 million was provided for this in the Revised Estimates for 2021 and the outturn was &euro;13.3 million.  In this year's Revised Estimate, the provision is back up to &euro;20 million.  What is funded under this line item?  If the outturn was significantly below the Estimate provided last year, are we confident that the money will be spent this year? </p> <p>  I apologise that I am taking somewhat of a scattergun approach and jumping around.  Under administration, there is a heading for travel and subsistence which again shows the same pattern.  It was approximately &euro;5 million in the Revised Estimate for 2020 while the outturn was only &euro;1.5 million.  We can all understand why spending on travel and subsistence would be lower last year but in this year's Revised Estimate, the provision is back up to &euro;4.155 million.  Are we envisaging a return to business as usual?  Is there not an opportunity to bring this spending down now that we are all much more used to remote working?</p> <p>  I have two other specific matters to raise.  Some &euro;18.6 million is allocated for other working-age supports.  This may be a small figure within the overall context of the budget but does the Minister have additional details on this?  In a similar vein, spending on the working-age employment support scheme is up 174%.  There are ten smaller employment support schemes.  We all understand the need to resource employment supports in the coming year, but will the Minister supply further details on this?  The last matter I will raise in my scattergun approach is that there is an increase of &euro;3.6 million in spending on eGovernment-related projects.  I would not question this level of funding.  In fact, I would imagine there is scope to increase it.  Will the Minister provide some further detail on this?  I will leave it at that for the moment.</p></speech>

I will try to answer them.  With regard to the PUP, we have collected a lot of data on the numbers in receipt of the payment.  I do not have it to hand, but I have asked my officials for a breakdown with particular regard to those who have been on the PUP for the long term, that is, those who have been on it since last March, because we want to see the sectors affected and how we can get people back to work again.</p><p>I will launch a pathways to work strategy in early June that will look at all the different supports we can give people to help them find employment.  This could mean we need to retrain or upskill so there are a number of apprenticeship schemes and we are looking at a work placement support system.  The main thing we want to do is help people find new jobs.  Some may not go back to the jobs they had previously so we want to give them that support and confidence.  This is also important because I speak to people, including older people and people who have been out of work for a long time, who will need confidence building because they have been at home or have not been out there in the workplace.  We have all been out working and it is easier for us but for those who have not been, it is about giving them the support they will need to go back into the workplace.  That is what the pathways to work programme will help to address.  <br/><br/>I am particularly conscious of young people.  We maintained the PUP for students.  I was very strong in respect of doing this because I felt students lost their jobs in the same way as everybody did when this pandemic hit.  We have continued to make the payment to them.  Thankfully, as the economy reopens, we can look to a brighter future.  I know there are a lot of young people who are just dying to get back to work and want to get out, meet their friends and return to normality.  I expect that as the economy opens further, we will see a lot of people who will take up employment and return to work.  <br/><br/>In respect of miscellaneous services, that expenditure includes <i>ex gratia</i>payments to women from the Magdalen laundries and other institutions, a small rent allowance scheme for people affected by the de-control of rents and information grants.  The food aid programme under the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived is also included.  The provision for miscellaneous services in 2021 is &euro;20.9 million.  When we were putting together budget 2021, we expected that the economy would reopen.  None of us thought we would be in lockdown in January so the figures were produced on the basis that life would start to return to normality but that did not happen, which is why in respect of a lot of the figures referred to by the Vice Chairman, there was an underspend in 2020 and an anticipated increase in expenditure for 2021.  <br/><br/>I think I have covered most points.  Other employment supports include an enterprise support grant, which aims to get people back to work; a training support grant; a credit union loan guarantee where we help people when they need to take out a loan; a part-time job initiative; an activation and family support project; and payments to long-term unemployed and lone parents.  There are a number of different things.  These are all working-age employment supports.  I can get the Vice Chairman more details on that.  Regarding e-government expenditure, it is necessary because we are investing in online and digital services.  The experience of the pandemic has shown that many customers want to interact with us digitally.  We all know that ourselves.  We are doing our banking over the phone and want to be able to interact with Government services digitally.  <br/><br/>I hope I have answered all the Vice Chairman's questions.  The school meals programme has been a great pilot.  I have increased it this year.  My view is that it is hard to beat a hot meal in the middle of the day for schoolchildren.  I am very supportive of that.  We will carry out a review of it because the Vice Chairman is right.  We want to make sure we are not wasting food and that the food has good nutritional value.  I am still of the opinion that a good hot dinner in the middle of the day is great for children.  It helps their concentration and is delivered to them in the schools.  I am a big supporter of that.  We have expanded the pilot scheme and I will continue to review that.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-26a.124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021052600002#G00300"><p>I join in the thanks offered to the staff for their fantastic interaction with the public.  The responses we on behalf of the public get as public representatives are prompt and thorough and give one information.  So often nowadays, one gets official replies that say the matter is being considered and there are no timescales.  There is good interaction with the Minister's Department, which is appreciated.</p> <p>  I looked at the Estimate regarding T&uacute;s and the community employment, CE.  The Estimate for this year is up but the experience on the ground is down.  I have figures for Connemara.  Between 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2021, the number on T&uacute;s declined by 28% while the number on the CE scheme declined by 9%.  I would love if I could say that unemployment in Connemara had decreased at the time but this was in the middle of the pandemic when more people than ever were on the PUP and standard unemployment payments.  A lot of this is attributable to two things.  The first is people not being referred to these schemes because a hold back by the JobPath programme where people who are very unlikely to get employment are not able to access these schemes because they must go through a whole process with JobPath first.  The second issue is that there are unnecessary limits to how long someone can spend on these schemes.  I have never seen the rationale for pulling people off schemes and putting them back on to means-tested social welfare payments.  It is demoralising when people do not have the opportunity to get up in the morning, go into work, socialise and make a contribution.  It is an urban upper middle-class myth that people who get good employment in the commercial economy will be happy on a CE or T&uacute;s scheme.  The idea that if we allow them to stay on longer, it might disincentivise them from being activated is an urban myth.  It is not my experience of real people on the ground.  Will the Minister look at the length of time people can stay on these schemes, particularly on T&uacute;s because CE is more expensive and involves training?  It concerns whether after a number of years when a person has done all the training, that will make any difference in terms of activation.  What the person needs is a job or somewhere to work and make a contribution to the community.  This issue needs to be tackled.  Unless Connemara is unique, I would be very surprised if at the end of the year, the Department spends its budget here.  </p> <p>  There was a discussion earlier about pensions for CE supervisors.  I welcome the progress being made and hope this matter can be brought to a resolution and that the discussions lead to a good outcome.  However, the Minister knows that it is a bit disconcerting when people say that rural social scheme and T&uacute;s supervisors will be treated in a totally different manner.  I expect that what will happen here is that we say that they are similar schemes and should be included in this package.  What discussions are taking place based on the reality?  Sometimes we deny realities that are inevitable rather than getting on and doing the thing that will have to be done and that is right to do.</p><p> At the end of the year, there is a projected figure of 395,000 unemployed.  I find that a little surprising.  One would have hoped that by autumn, every adult in the country who wants it would have been vaccinated.  Obviously a small number will opt not to have one.  I am surprised the projected figure for unemployment is that high.  I would have thought that in some sectors of hospitality, because people had been deprived of going out, they would be even keener to go out.  I understand big indoor events in particular, concerts and so on, would be more difficult, but there will be other sectors of hospitality that would be even stronger than ever, with people taking staycations and so on.  I accept aviation would be down, but looking at it sector by sector, I am surprised the projected figure is that high.  On what is it based?</p><p> The PUP has three rates of payment.  One is the exact same as jobseeker's allowance.  How many people are on the three rates?  It is one thing to say there are 345,000 on PUP but a breakdown would be interesting.  How many are on the &euro;203 rate, the medium and the high rates?  That would be useful to us when thinking about this issue and in future debates on how we find a way forward from where we are.  I welcome the Minister saying there can be absolutely no cliff edge.  It would be useful for us to know how many people are at the different cliff faces, the high one and the very low one.</p><p> I join those who wish well the two garda who were injured last night.  It is horrific that this is happening in the streets of our country.  I would love to see guns out of this society in total.  Guns and criminality are a huge challenge we face.  We must all work to ensure we not only deal with the actual criminals but also with the underlying social issues that, unfortunately, breed antisocial and criminal behaviour.  We have a huge job to do in early diversion of young people.</p></speech>

That is something this Government is committed to - to helping our young people in every way we can.</p><p>There were a lot of questions there.  One was on the pensions for CE supervisors and why we cannot extend it to T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme supervisors.  All these schemes are delivered by independent bodies.  The promoters of the schemes are funded by my Department.  While it provides funding for participant and supervisors payroll, the Department is not the employer of any scheme participants or their participants.  We need to be clear on that.</p><p>Community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors have for some time been seeking the allocation of Exchequer funding to implement a 2008 Labour Court recommendation that specifically related to a pension scheme for community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors.  It is within this context that officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the unions representing community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors held discussions on proposals to progress this issue.  These discussions were held on the clear agreement by all involved that they related solely to community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, and I recently reached agreement in principle to try and resolve the issue.  It has gone to the unions and I hope we will have a resolution in due course.</p><p>We have increased the numbers on CE schemes as part of the July stimulus package.  We announced an additional 3,000 places.  Unfortunately, the lockdown meant some schemes were impacted by restrictions.  There are 1,760 vacancies on community employment and 1,458 on T&uacute;s schemes.  The community employment sponsoring authorities are encouraged by my officials to promote awareness of the benefits of community employment in local communities and to advertise their vacancies on the Department's recruitment portal <i>www.jobsireland.ie</i>.  I take the Deputy's point about the length of time people are on these schemes.  CE schemes provide two services: job activation and a social service.  Until we recognise that, we will always have these problems where people want to stay on, they reach a certain age, and if they get another six months on the CE scheme, they might be due to retire.  It is either that or they might get another two years.  We have to recognise that.</p><p>I have met with a number of the CE supervisors and listened to their concerns.  A report was done and it said you are stigmatising people if you put them in the category where they can stay on and you do not expect them ever to work again.  On the other hand, there are those who want to stay on and who are doing really valuable work in their communities.  If those services they provide were not available, there would be a gaping hole and somebody would have to provide them.  There is a further conversation we have to have on CE schemes and I am prepared to have it.  I am clear we need to look at it from the perspective that it is a job activation measure and does really good work in that.  Many young people come in, get the work experience and training, and then get jobs.  That is what it is meant to do, but there is also the social side to it.  I am happy to work with the committee on that because it is something I feel strongly about.</p><p>As I said, there were a number of measures in the July stimulus to get people back to work, many of which we could not activate because the economy was closed down.  We will be getting these back up and running and they will form part of the Pathways to Work strategy.  I have been talking to the labour market advisory council which has given us good advice on how we go forward.</p><p>On PUP rates, 45% in receipt of the payment are on &euro;350, 18% are on &euro;300, 17% on &euro;250 and 20% are on &euro;203.  The vast majority on the PUP are higher earners.  The Deputy mentioned our projection of 395,000 unemployed.  They are all projections and it is hoped the numbers will reduce, but we have figures to back up the projections.  The unemployment numbers in the Revised Estimate are based on the assumptions of rates and numbers of unemployed used by the Department of Finance in the development of the stability programme update which was published in April 2021.  The stability programme update assumed that the quarterly unemployment rates would be 24.4% in quarter 1, reducing to 11.2% by quarter 2.</p><p>The numbers range from 592,000 in quarter 1 to the actual number of those on the live register plus the pandemic unemployment payment recipients, which was 273,000 by the year end.  As Deputies are aware, we are constantly monitoring projected unemployment.  The latest Central Statistics Office data for April 2021 recorded a Covid-19 adjusted overall unemployment rate of 22.4%.  This includes all those in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment.  The traditional International Labour Office level of unemployment is 5.6%.  Neither of these is likely to represent the true underlying level of unemployment.  It is likely to lie between the two estimates.</p><p> The quicker the economy gets opened up, the better the position we will be in to beat the figures.  We have said we will get more people back to work.  The roll-out of the vaccine programme has been successful.  As the Deputy said, the vaccine has been rolled out and we want to get more people back.  People want to get back to normality and get back to the workplace and to social interaction.  We want to support them to do that.</p></speech>

If members come in with additional questions, please be brief and to the point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-26a.129" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1569" speakername="Joan Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021052600002#J00300"><p>I will be brief and to the point.  I want to come back on the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  I take the point made by the Minister that people pay tax on their income.  However, the scheme was brought in under extraordinary circumstances.  There must have been an arrangement between the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners to forfeit the original tax that would have been due on the gross pay of those workers.  There was an arrangement to forfeit PAYE tax at that point.  Many workers did not realise they were on the temporary wage subsidy scheme because they were getting net pay and their employers did not have to inform them.  We know that thousands of employers availed of the scheme.  Therefore, thousands of workers were affected by it.</p> <p>  The idea of taxing those workers under an extraordinary scheme brought in on net pay has to be reviewed.  Under the initial scheme the Government was able to forfeit tax on gross pay.  It should be able to forfeit tax on net pay.  Effectively, these workers are taking a cut in their wages.  That has to be looked at by the Government from the point of view of these workers.  These workers were going into work.  It was the first phase of the restrictions.  They had no idea what was going to happen.  They were afraid of their lives.  This was especially the case for pharmacy workers who would have gone back to their families thinking they were probably bringing home the virus and so on.  Given the extraordinary circumstances we were dealing with in respect of the scheme, the Government should look at the impact it had and the unintended consequences for those workers in taking a pay cut.  I will leave it at that and ask the Minister to look at it again from that point of view.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-26a.130" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021052600002#J00400"><p>I take the point the Deputy is making.  It was a valuable scheme.  It kept employers in touch with their employees.  For some, employers received the wage subsidy scheme and it was passed on to the employees.  Many employers topped up the payment and made up the difference between what they got on the TWSS.  That was the purpose behind it.  However, I take the point the Deputy is making for those who could not afford to do that.</p> <p>  As the Deputy knows, tax issues are a matter for the Department of Finance and Revenue.  We are the administrators and it came out of our budget, but tax issues are a matter for the Department of Finance and Revenue.  It is underpinned by legislation.  I will take away the points made by Deputy Collins.  I understand them and I have had the same points made to me.  I will discuss it will colleagues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-26a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1517" speakername="Joe Carey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021052600002#J00500"><p>I wish to bring the Minister back to the hot school meals programme.  It is a progressive initiative introduced by the Department of Social Protection this year.  As I understand it, 281 applications were made of which 189 were successful.  There was some disappointment.  In County Clare we had four successful applications.  They were welcome.  I am concerned about schools that have lost out.  I know from correspondence I have had with the Minister directly that she will look at the matter again once she has confirmed the position on successful schools.  When will the Department be in a position to do that?  If some successful schools do not take up the scheme, can others schools that were not successful aspire to get into the scheme this year?  Will the Minister outline a pathway for those schools to get back into the programme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-26a.132" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021052600002#J00600"><p>I will comment on the process for selecting those schools.  We increased the budget considerably because the pilot scheme involved 37 schools.  This year we brought the number up to 189.  Those schools were picked on a random basis by the computer.  There is one situation in particular where there are four schools in one campus.  Three are getting the hot school meals and one is not.  Those involved are not happy and I can understand why.  If I had picked them myself, some would have said I had hand-picked them, and I do not know what they might have thought I was trying to do.  A computer picked them this time.  We have to blame the computer.  The computer looks at roll numbers but does not really know the situation.  What can I say?  I am looking at it carefully.</p> <p>  I am fond of hot school meals.  Schools that put in applications and that want to do this and engage in it deserve to be supported.  A total of 281 schools submitted expressions of interest.  Some may not go ahead.  The Deputy should leave it with me.  I am engaging with my officials.  I am a big supporter of the scheme.  It is a really good scheme.  I love to see a child getting a good hot dinner.  Maybe that is the mother in me.  Anyway, I will say no more for now but I would urge the Deputy to leave it with me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-26a.133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1617" speakername="Marc &Oacute; Cathasaigh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021052600002#J00700"><p>The school teacher in me very much agrees with you, Minister.  The more hot meals we can get to children, the better.</p> <p>  I will inflict my scattergun approach on the Minister again.  I will begin with two of the measures announced by the Minister in the July stimulus plan, namely, the work placement experience programme and the JobsPlus programme.  The Minister touched on this already.  How are we doing in terms of take-up?  Are we getting the employers?  It has been a difficult context to roll out those schemes.  Are we hitting targets?  Are we getting anywhere close?  What are the sectors where we are seeing deployment?</p> <p>  Young people have been mentioned repeatedly.  That is appropriate and I will mention them again.  We know they have been disproportionately affected by the contraction in the labour market.  It has been very much in hospitality and so on.  They will now face a reduction from the pandemic unemployment payment to a lower level of jobseeker's allowance, especially for people under 25 years of age.  I am concerned this will affect young people with lower social capital in particular.  They are less likely to be in education and they may now find themselves more distant from the labour market.  Are we specifically planning ahead for how we deal with that so that we do not have young people falling into long-term unemployment?</p> <p>  Some issues have been raised with me relating to people whose income dropped during the course of the pandemic.  Maybe they fell behind in their rent or mortgage payments or utilities.  I am concerned we will have an overhang of Covid-19 debt.  People will fall into hardship.  Certainly, we do not want to see people cut off from utilities or losing rented accommodation.  Is there any contingency within the departmental budget to deal with that as we begin to come out of this Covid crisis?  In a more general sense are we beginning to see the new policy direction of this Government and Department reflected in the figures?</p><p>I think it was Joe Biden who said: "Don't tell me what you value; show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value."  Are we beginning to see that support for lone parents, the cohort most likely to be affected by issues such as deprivation or isolation?  There are very ambitious targets in regard to consistent poverty of about 2%.  Are we beginning to see forward planning on the Department's part in regard to how we will achieve this, not just in this budget but over the lifetime of the Government?</p><p> We always talk about base rates in absolute terms and cash figures, whether that is the &euro;5 increase in the pension or whatever it is.  That tends to apply to both pensions and jobseeker's payments.  Has the Department considered the potential benefit of benchmarking payments against other measures, such as the cost of living or as a percentage of the average industrial wage?  Are we considering different ideas for how we measure these payments?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-26a.135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021052600002#K00200"><p>I am very conscious that we need to support young people and that is why we have all these programmes, including the EmployAbility service, that target young people who have difficulties getting back into the workplace.  I met representatives of EmployAbility on Monday and they explained to me how when young people come in to the service, they are placed with an employer and sometimes there are problems.  A typical example could be if somebody is suffering from an addiction and is trying to go to work.  He or she might then miss an appointment with the addiction support service and slip back, and then the employer wonders why the person is not at work.  When there is somebody who can connect and address those issues, there is a better chance of resolving it.  The employer can give the employee time off to attend the service and there will be a better outcome.  I am very conscious that we must provide those services for people who need to get back to work, and particularly young people.</p> <p>  There are some figures regarding youth unemployment.  At present, approximately 43,000 PUP recipients are students, 90% of whom are under 25 years of age.  Using the international definition of unemployment set in the International Labour Organization, students are generally not counted as unemployed as they are not considered part of the labour force because they are in education.  Therefore, the inclusion of students has inflated the Covid-19-adjusted measure of youth unemployment.</p> <p>  Having said that, I am not taking away from the fact that we need to focus on getting our young people into work and skilling them.  There are many jobs out there at the moment but some of them do not have those skills, so our further and higher education system is important.  As the committee will be aware, the Minister with responsibility for that matter, Deputy Harris, has launched a new apprenticeship scheme and a number of supports are available in that regard to reskill and upskill, and to take on the jobs of the future.  I am familiar with a number of projects from my time as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation where the focus has to go on industry 4.0.  We have to train people.  While it may still be on the factory floor, it will be about telling the robots what they have to do.  Many young people are very interested in programming and so on, and we have to capture their imagination, look to the future and use technology in every way we can.</p> <p>  The Vice Chairman mentioned the work placement experience programme and a number of other programmes we launched in the July stimulus package last year.  Unfortunately, we were not able to launch some of them because the economy was closed and the jobs were not there.  I will announce the pathways to work early next month and it will certainly be a case of all hands on deck.  Every effort will be made to maximise the take-up of all the supports out there.</p> <p>  In recent budgets, we have targeted resources at those at most risk of poverty.  In the most recent budget, the employment income limit of &euro;425 was removed from the working lone parent benefit.  We increased the qualified child allowance by &euro;5 a week for children aged 12 and over and &euro;2 a week for children up to age 12, while for pensioners and people with disabilities, we increased the living alone allowance.  There a number of other supports we provided in the previous budget.  It was targeted at those who needed it most and we wanted to help those most in need.</p> <p>  Regarding the indexation of pensions, as a first step the Department undertook a consultation process with a number of interested stakeholders throughout 2019 to hear their views.  The outcome of these discussions was considered and, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department has developed proposals for setting a formal benchmark for contributory State pension payments.  The roadmap for social inclusion outlines the potential approach currently under consideration, using what can be described as a smooth earning system that ensures that, over the long term, the relative value of welfare payments compared with market earnings will be maintained and, over any short-term period, the real value or purchasing power of these payments will be protected.  I have asked my officials to continue to engage with their counterparts in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with a view to progressing this work.</p></speech>

I have one eye to the work being done by the Government on the well-being indices, which is under way.  Are there other measures we use in regard to our social welfare outputs, such as well-being?  Do we have health outcome data on the effects of reducing poverty in certain cohorts?  One issue that has come home to me over the course of the pandemic in particular, although I am sure it applies at all times, relates to subjective measures of community participation or people experiencing loneliness, for example.  Some people question the merit of subjective measures but I think they are important and they have a role to play.  The Department is probably uniquely positioned to gather such data on people living alone, for example.</p> <p>  Has the Department begun work to evaluate our Covid response in the context of key policy outcomes?  I refer to lone parents and how difficult they must have found the period of home-schooling in particular.  They would have been receiving payments from the State, but are they now more distanced than ever from the workforce?  Are we keeping an eye on that and on how our Covid response has affected those particularly vulnerable cohorts?  Is this informing our future budgetary decisions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-26a.137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2021052600002#K00400"><p>Across Government we evaluate all these issues and examine the impact, and of course there will be a review of Covid, the impact it had on society and the issues on which we need to focus post Covid.</p> <p>  On the role of the Department regarding equality budgeting, we introduced equality budgeting on a pilot basis in 2017 as part of a commitment in the programme for Government in 2016 to developing the process of budget and policy-proofing as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights.  The pilot was relatively successful in pushing for equality considerations.  In 2019, the OECD was commissioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the then Department of Justice and Equality to conduct a review of Ireland's approach to equality budgeting, both to accelerate the uptake and impact of the initiative and to take account of developments.  The OECD recommendations will underpin overall future implementation and the establishment of an interdepartmental network of equality budgeting contact points.</p><p>By improving knowledge sharing across Departments, this network will help to resolve several challenges highlighted by the OECD.  The network will also facilitate cross-Government training on the purpose and application of equality budgeting.  The interdepartmental group will include a senior member of staff from each Department, with each member having a broad knowledge of the policy work undertaken by his or her Department and its relevance to advancing the goals of equality and inclusion.  This network will help inform the future direction of equality budgeting policy in line with the provision of a distributional overview by income decile and household type.  There is a lot of work ongoing in this area and we continue to have a strong focus on proofing all our budgets in respect of these targets.</p></speech>
