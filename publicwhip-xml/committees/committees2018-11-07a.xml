    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Gleeson" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018110700002#B00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to address members and to highlight the ongoing work on climate action in the agrifood sector.<br/><br/>The agrifood sector is a critically important part of the economy.  It accounted for 174,000 jobs or almost 8% of employment in 2017.  Many of these jobs are in rural areas.  In Food Wise 2025, the sector outlined a vision for its development that involved the creation of 23,000 jobs and an increase in the value of exports to &euro;19 billion by 2025.  That vision recognised the critical importance of environmental sustainability giving it equal billing with its developmental objectives and recommended a range of environmental actions.  Against that background, the department and its agencies have been engaged in environmental action for some considerable time, for example through the afforestation and rural development programmes.  We have also recognised that positive environmental credentials can be an important element in our international marketing strategy.<br/><br/>Under the Paris Agreement, Europe has proposed an ambitious reduction of 40% in emissions by 2030.  Every member state and sector will need to play its part.  Agriculture contributes 32.3% of Ireland's overall emissions.  This is not surprising given the profile of the economy and the importance of agriculture.<br/><br/>Even in a successfully decarbonised Ireland, agriculture emissions as a percentage of the total will still be significant.  It must also be recorded that our food production systems provide some of the lowest carbon footprint profiles across the EU on a per unit basis, as reported by the EU Joint Research Centre.  The lowest emissions per kg of livestock product are created by extensive temperate grassland systems similar to the one that exists in Ireland.<br/><br/>Unlike other sectors, no one-off technological fixes can be applied to the agriculture sector.  Mitigation requires the sustained application of improved management practices over time by farmers.  Bearing all of this in mind, the national mitigation plan refers to a long-term vision for the agriculture, forestry and land use sectors.  This is based on &quot;an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land use sector, including forestry, that does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production&quot;.  This is entirely consistent with the principles laid down by the EU Council conclusions of October 2014.  These provide as follows: &quot;The multiple objectives of the agriculture and land use sector, with their lower mitigation potential, should be acknowledged, as well as the need to ensure coherence between the EU's food security policy and climate change objectives&quot;.<br/><br/>While agriculture contributes to emissions, it is also part of the solution.  There are three strands to the Department's approach and they are abatement, sequestration, displacement and substitution.  Abatement<b></b>reduces emissions of methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide from the sector insofar as it is possible.  Sequestration takes carbon out of the atmosphere through forestry and other land use mechanisms.  Finally, there is the displacement and substitution of fossil fuels and energy intensive materials with renewable energy sources.  From a departmental point of view, we are working with stakeholders and State agencies on all three strands of this approach.  My colleagues and I are happy to brief the committee on what we are doing under each of these headings, including our investment in efficiency through the following: the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP; the new beef environmental efficiency pilot, BEEP, scheme; the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS; investments in areas such as low-emission slurry technology; and work by both Teagasc and Bord Bia through research, advisory services and carbon audits.<br/><br/>The committee has been briefed previously on current compliance with the 2030 targets.  Based on that analysis and a no policy change scenario, the gap to target in the 2021-30 period for the non-emissions traded sector is in the region of 90 plus megatonnes.  Based on the flexibilities afforded to Ireland in the effort sharing regulation, the agriculture and land use sector, including afforestation, will contribute approximately 26.8 megatonnes towards closing that gap.  This flexibility was provided to Ireland specifically in recognition of its large agriculture sector and its relatively low mitigation potential.  In addition to that contribution, the latest research from Teagasc has identified significant additional abatement potential from the agriculture sector.  Agriculture can also contribute to meeting the renewable energy targets.  These are potentially major contributions.<br/><br/>The mitigation effort comes at a cost.  If we are to achieve the ambition for the sector, it is important that we continue to incentivise positive climate action through the afforestation programme and a well funded, and appropriately configured, Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  The Department is currently engaged in a negotiation on Commission proposals for the post-2020 CAP.  These require 40% of the budget to be directed at climate change or environmental measures.  This approach is well aligned with the recommendations made by the Citizens' Assembly, which recommended that farmers be rewarded for good environmental practices.<br/><br/>The Department and its agencies recognise the important contribution that stakeholders have to make, and not just farmers but farm bodies, education and advisory services and industry.  We will only make progress if we bring all the various actors along with us.  This will require us to configure public policy to assist farmers in their efforts.  We must also recognise the strong synergies between those efforts and economic efficiency, and our positioning in the international market place as a source of high-quality and sustainable food.<br/><br/>The Department held a sustainability dialogue during the summer, which was attended by a broad group of stakeholders where we had good engagement and positivity around what the future requirements might be.  There was a sense of collaboration on the day.  We will continue to work at building consensus on the need for agriculture to make a positive contribution to the climate change debate.<br/><br/>I am happy to take any questions that the members might have.</p></speech>

The first is about carbon neutrality.  The national policy position suggests an approach to carbon neutrality for the agriculture and land use sector that does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production by 2050.  What does that mean in practice and what approach is the Department taking in this regard?  Is it the bio-economy or the circular economy, for example?  Could Mr. Gleeson expand on that?  Second, the balance between complying with our EU targets on reducing emissions while at the same time meeting the Food Wise 2025 targets is also a concern for many committee members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Gleeson" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018110700002#C00200"><p>There are two issues.  First is an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land use sector, including forestry, that does not compromise the capacity for sustainable food production.  What we are talking about here is a direction of travel that requires us to deploy all of the sequestration and abatement tools we have.  We know what some of those tools are, for example, afforestation in land use.  On abatement, we are incentivising practices such as low-emission slurry spreading and the development of more efficient livestock through breeding policies.  This policy requires us to deploy all of those technologies and all of that knowledge to reduce the emissions profile of the sector.  We are succeeding in reducing the carbon intensity of the sector through all of those mechanisms.  Technology will move on over the next few years.  We have succeeded in quantifying what can be done through those mechanisms.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned meeting our targets.  We have a national target in the non-emissions trading system, non-ETS, sector, of which agriculture is a part, to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030.  Agriculture can make a contribution to that.  We can certainly reduce emissions intensity and flatline emissions output, even against the background of an increasing profile of production.</p> <p>  On Food Wise, there is a kind of fixation on the target which was, in fact, a projection by industry for itself.  The headline figure was to increase the value of exports to &euro;19 billion by 2025.  There are a number of mechanisms for achieving that ambition.  It could be achieved through additional production.  However, it could also be achieved through adding value, for example to manufactured product, finding new markets and maximising the price we achieve for our product.  When we talk about the ambition for the sector, it is an ambition that has been set by the sector for itself but with broad approval from successive Governments.  I have heard some commentary that suggests we should resile from the ambition for the sector.  We have to maintain our ambition but we have to be sure that we focus on delivering it through methods that do not exacerbate the emissions situation.  That is the objective but it is difficult.  We have done a lot of work over successive years on focusing our policy through the rural development programme, for example, on emissions reduction.  However, because of its nature, agriculture will always be a contributor to emissions.  It is not possible to produce food without having emissions.</p></speech>

First is Senator M&aacute;ire Devine, who has ten minutes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1388" speakername="Maire Devine" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018110700002#C00400"><p>I thank Mr. Gleeson for his presentation.  I note for the benefit of the committee that the Collins Dictionary's most notable word of the year is "single-use".  We need to take into account the growing traction of that term.</p> <p>  The agriculture sector is extremely important for our economy but also for the environment.  That is where the dichotomy is in terms of the problems and solutions for climate change.  One third of the carbon is stored above ground in biomass and the remaining two thirds are in the soil.  We are talking about forestry here.  Plants and soil are acting as natural carbon sinks, accumulating and storing the carbon.  We plant forests and many of us, while walking in the Dublin Mountains or wherever, see coniferous trees.  Has research been done on how effective coniferous trees are as carbon sinks?  I notice when I am walking that there might be a forest on one side with tall conifers while there are broadleaf trees on the other side.  There is so much more wildlife in the broadleaf trees, whereas the coniferous forests are a dead zone.  Has the effectiveness of conifers been assessed?  Is there an evidence base for them?  Are there other types of trees that might be more effective as carbon sinks?  I have in mind rotation crops such as willow that grow quickly and are good for biomass as well.</p> <p>  My other concern is hedgerows, which are all over the country and are an important part of rural Ireland.  The season in which cutting is allowed has been extended.  Are hedgerows effective as carbon sinks?  Has any research been done on that?  What will be the impact of the extension of the cutting season provided for in recent legislation?</p> <p>  Agriculture and the agrifood industry are about producing beef, lamb, pork and dairy products.  We need to take account of the increase in the trend of veganism, especially among our young citizens, many of whom are learning about it and deciding to become vegan.  I do not think I could do that myself but it will be a significant factor for the generation that is growing.  In about ten years, the current generation of 15 year olds will have been significantly influenced and that many will have decided to become vegan.  The concentration should not just be on beef and dairy but also on horticulture and the excellent products from north County Dublin such as potatoes, lettuce and all the vegetables.  However, vegetables cannot easily be exported.  Has that been factored into the idea of the growth of the agrifood sector?  We have a significant youth population of whom 25% will be vegan in the next ten years.</p> <p>  A dairy co-op in the Netherlands decided to invest in installing solar panels on over 300 farm structures as these barns and so on would give the most effective return in generating solar on a small scale.  Have we considered that in respect of solar or wind?  The buildings are there.  If we made that investment we could reap the rewards from it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Gleeson" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018110700002#C00500"><p>I will deal with the Senator's question in the order in which they were asked.  If I miss anything, I ask to be reminded.  We have metrics around forestry.  As part of our Paris or COP 21 deal, we were given credit for 28.3 megatonnes between now and 2030.  That is largely from our existing forestry stock.  One of the things that surprised me was that 30% of our existing forestry stock is in deciduous trees.  There is a significant narrative, and I guess we will hear some of it today, about the preponderance of Sitka spruce being planted at the moment.  We are sensitive to the need for more diversity in our stock of trees.  The balance is between producing a stock of harvestable and renewable trees that provide a basis for a reasonable income for farmers while being managed in a renewable way, and remaining sensitive to the need to encourage biodiversity.  This year, we increased our grant rate for deciduous trees.  Our national requirement is now for at least 15% of planting to be in deciduous trees.</p><p>We insist that at least 15% of planting is deciduous trees.  Forestry is a critical part of the climate change discussion and we have credit for it up until 2030.  Depending on how our obligations are accounted for after 2030, we would need to be planting trees now to provide mitigation potential for the period thereafter.  That is why it is critically important to plant those trees now.</p><p> We are concerned, to be frank, that there is a negative narrative around forestry at present which might make it more difficult to reach our targets.  While it is important to have a balanced discussion on the pros and cons and the difficulties involved, I urge this committee to make some sort of recommendation that encourages the planting of trees over the next period.  People may have different views on how we do that but it is very important that we do not have an eternally negative narrative about afforestation because it is critically important in the context of climate change.</p><p> The issue of veganism was mentioned but I do not think it is productive to get into a discussion about peoples' dietary habits.  Farmers grow vegetables as well as producing beef and dairy products.  The reality is that this country has the most carbon efficient dairy production system in the world.  It is not just me saying that; that is also the finding of the joint research committee of the European Union.  We also have a very efficient beef sector.  Generally speaking, our beef is produced on small family farms in an extensive way.  This results in exactly the kind of environmental public goods that people want to see delivered.  Notwithstanding the fact that agriculture contributes a significant percentage of the emissions pool in Ireland, our production systems are actually quite carbon efficient.  I am not going to get into a discussion about veganism-----</p></speech>

I am just asking for recognition of the fact veganism is growing and that we must cater for that fact.  Emphasis must be put on the horticultural sector into the future, alongside beef and dairy.  I am not asking that Mr. Gleeson would discuss veganism but----</p></speech>

As a Department, we provide support to the horticulture sector on an ongoing basis.  We provided &euro;1 million last year in supports for that sector.  We have encouraged the establishment of producer groups in the horticulture sector in order that producers can come together and market their produce collectively.  It is an area with significant potential and we recognise that.</p></speech>

I also asked about hedgerows.</p></speech>

We provide financial incentives for the planting of hedgerows which has a role to play in carbon sequestration.  Last year, there were 7,000 applicants to GLAS for the planting of new hedgerows and over 1,000 km of hedgerows have already been planted, incentivised by GLAS.  It is something that we encourage farmers to do because hedgerows have a climate change mitigation function, as well as a biodiversity function.  I cannot articulate precisely the carbon sequestration effect of hedgerows but can find out and revert to the committee with that information.</p></speech>

The specific question asked was on cutting hedgerows.  A degree of flexibility is allowed, following changes made to the Heritage Bill, which is the responsibility of another Department.  While I cannot quantify the impact of that I would point out that the changes relate only to the timing of hedgerow cutting rather than prescribing that hedgerows should be cut.  That should not interfere with the volume of carbon stored in the actual hedges.  The changes relate to the timing of cutting rather-----</p></speech>

If there is growth for longer and a spread of growth for longer, it will have more impact.  It is interesting to note that hedgerows account for 3.9% of ground cover.

It measures all of the forests, including the different age growths and species growths.  The inventory looks at between 1,700 and 1,800 plots all over Ireland.  Everything is measured in the plots, including the above-ground biomass and the below-ground biomass.  Those data are used to calculate the sequestration impact nationally.  The national forest inventory is peer reviewed and conforms to international best practice.  The metrics are there to measure the carbon.  It is not just a question of getting a rough estimate.  We can measure the carbon sequestration of our forests very accurately.  Reference was made to large and small trees.  Obviously different trees, depending on their age, have different rates of sequestration.  Our national forest inventory measures old and young trees, including very small trees, across a whole range of species groups.</p></speech>

Under that plan, we will ramp up food production in beef, dairy and other sectors.  As technology advances, we like to think that there will be technological solutions to problems arising.  The witnesses have outlined three important areas, namely, emissions reduction, carbon sequestration and the use of renewable energy to replace fossil fuels.  We can also add to that the need to find new markets for the &euro;19 billion and the 23,000 jobs that will be lost.  In reality, we cannot do to cattle what we can do to cars and we will run out of road when it comes to agriculture and carbon neutrality.  There are certain home truths about agriculture and food production in the context of emissions that cannot be denied.  This needs priority, not just in Government policy but also in people's thinking because we are talking about food, which is not optional.  We do not have a choice about eating, although we can choose what we eat.</p> <p>  The report produced by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine recognised the importance of this issue.  One of its recommendations is that an impact assessment be conducted on the climate change and sustainability targets set out in Food Wise 2025 to determine how they match up with our carbon emissions targets.  As it stands, there are serious issues around emissions.  We are trying to get down to the nuts and bolts here.  A lot of what we are discussing today has been discussed previously.  Teagasc has contributed to these discussions and has highlighted the strides that have been made in terms of carbon efficiency.  Nonetheless, under Food Wise 2025, we are talking about increasing the size of the national herd, which has consequences.  What assessment has been done in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Gleeson" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018110700002#D01800"><p>Bovines produce emissions and that is the reality.  However, there are a number of important considerations here and the Senator has touched on some of them.  The description in the national mitigation plan is nuanced because some of this is difficult.</p><p>We talk about an approach to carbon neutrality that does not compromise our ability to produce food sustainably, which is nuanced language for a reason.</p><p> On the Food Wise 2025 strategy, what is driving the expansion of the dairy sector is not public policy, which has been moved out of the way with the disappearance of the quotas.  Rather, the expansion is driven by economics.  We have an agricultural sector that provides a decent living for farmers and that produces milk in the most carbon-efficient way in Europe and, by extension, the world.  This is not a matter of public policy; it is about farmers responding to market signals in a way that allows them to make a living.  We are working hard to ensure that is done in the most sustainable way possible, for which we have many measures.  It is important to stress that it is not a function of public policy but rather of economics.</p><p> In the case of the beef sector, we have been very careful since 2005, when we dispensed with coupling payments to beef farmers.  We have ensured that when we intervene in the beef sector it is in ways that improve its carbon efficiency.  All of our measures, therefore, such as beef genomics and the scheme that was recently announced in the budget, are configured to try to improve the beef sector's carbon efficiency.  When we talk about an approach to carbon neutrality, it is an approach that configures public policy to improve its carbon efficiency to the greatest extent possible.  More can be done, however, and there will be a new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, post 2020.  There will be an additional "greening" in that policy, that is, there is an undertaking in the proposal to require 40% of expenditure to be devoted to climate change or the environment, an ambition which Ireland has supported rather than resiled from.</p><p> We have defined what can be done in the agricultural context.  If more needs to be done, say in the dairy sector, it would require a somewhat perverse step to reduce production in the most environmentally friendly milk production system in the world.  There are policy options in the context of all of this, none of which are easy, but in considering what options we take in future, we must consider the cost and the social and environmental impact.  As I said earlier, most beef producers are small producers in the west of Ireland who farm in an environmentally friendly way.  We have defined an approach that allows us do what can be done with current technology without taking some of those more difficult or extreme steps that might have unintended consequences for greenhouse gas emissions globally.  We are clear that we are working hard to reduce the emissions intensity of these sectors, but maximising the potential of even that will require some difficult decisions about land use and so on.  Going further, however, will require other difficult decisions and could have the global impact of increasing emissions when one considers that demand for dairy production globally is increasing and that somebody will fill the gap.  There is a reasonably strong argument, therefore, that there is potential for carbon leakage from the more efficient producers of food to the less efficient producers of food if production is cut in more efficient places.</p></speech>

What steps has the Department taken to ensure farmers have been given credit for the carbon efficiencies they have achieved?  I do not want to have a domestic conversation only but rather internationally, whether it is the Paris Agreement or any other climate action agreement.  Mr. Gleeson said we are the best at dairy production and quite high in the ranks of beef production, although it is acknowledged there is more to be done.  We want to be world leaders in this area and the world must be fed.  As I understand it, more and more of the world is choosing to get its protein, which is required in humans' diets, from beef and dairy.  If we do not produce it, it will be somebody less carbon efficient.</p> <p>  We need protein in our diets but in this country we do not have a great track record of growing beans and other protein-rich food crops, for which the most successful areas are in the warmer climates and the tropics.  I do not hear people who promote lifestyles without meat argue that many protein-rich foods, such as beans and so on, are imported from areas with a significant carbon footprint and take food out of countries where people do not have much in the first place.  </p> <p>  It is grand for us to have a conversation, but how is the message that we are a special case put out?  We are the top of the class in dairy and we will get top of the class in beef also, but how will that be recognised?  How will the farmer get credit?</p></speech>

It is important to record the fact that we are saying that the agriculture industry has done a great deal but must do more, which we understand.  We want to use the lengthy opportunity of the next CAP to configure it in a way that helps us to do that.</p> <p>  On getting credit, in recognition that agriculture is such a significant part of our economy, we got special credit in the Paris Agreement for up to 28 megatonnes for the existing biomass in our forests and our land use.  That is specific credit that we got in the context of our overall obligations.  </p> <p>  There are national targets that must be met.  Even domestically, there is a negative narrative about agriculture which is not justified.  Agriculture has always been a significant part of our emissions, and it is not that it has performed badly over the past 20 years.  In fact, the emissions from agriculture since 1990 have virtually flatlined, although they have begun to climb.  There has not been any extraordinary increase, and that is the nature of the beast.  It is important that we domestically communicate credit for farmers.  As to the marketplace, if that is what the Senator is asking, we have positioned ourselves in not to compete with commodity producers but rather to try to get onto supermarket shelves in the European Union and extract the best price we can, which requires us to tell the story of our sustainability credentials.  </p> <p>  Mr. Moloney from Bord Bia might like to talk about Origin Green and what is being done about that.  It is an effort to monetise the good work we have done on climate change.</p></speech>

Mr. Gleeson described credits received under the Paris Agreement, but we did not get credit for all the work done to bring dairy to where it is today.  It is regrettable because we made changes which other countries have not.  We are being responsible in how we produce it and we are up for more in the other sectors of our agriculture industry.  The situation, therefore, is not right.</p> <p>  On the bio-economy, members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine visited the BEACON bioeconomy research centre at University College Dublin, where many technological advances are researched.  In particular, the committee was informed of a joint venture in Tipperary between Teagasc and Dairygold to make plastic as a by-product of dairy, which would replace fossil fuels and would be biodegradable in plastics and adhesives.  My understanding is that Enterprise Ireland is investing there.  How is the Department investing in finding these technologies to reduce carbon emissions, or is it batting it over to some other Department?  What is the Department doing to help farmers?</p> <p>  On renewable energy, what is the take-up of the renewable heat incentive scheme?  How has it affected farming and emissions reduction?</p></speech>

It is entirely correct to say there is a project relating to the use of whey permeate and Glanbia is at the forefront with its facility at Lisheen.  The company has been clear that the objective is about adding value to milk and giving the returns to the producer.  There is a discussion at European Union level on that.  We are involved in the support of the project.  The Department has been heavily involved and the Department of the Taoiseach published an overall policy position on it quite recently.  Our Department contributed strongly to that.  We chair a working group jointly on how that bioeconomy can be moved forward.  There is no question of us handing it over and we see that as being particularly important with respect to forest fibre and milk.  The mushroom industry, for example, is involved with proposals at Lisheen as well.  The bioeconomy development will very much be part of agriculture in future.</p></speech>

The new requirement under the CAP proposals is that 40% of the overall expenditure would be devoted to climate and environmental requirements.  There are two mechanisms for this.  One is kind of new and under Pillar 1, the traditional income support payment for farmers, there would be a requirement for an eco scheme.  Farmers will receive their direct payments, which come with conditions, some of which relate to the environment, but in addition to this we will be required to establish some kind of eco scheme.  We are thinking about what that might look like but I do not have the policy answer right now.  It is something on which we will engage stakeholders.  In the rural development scheme we will have a range of measures and my view is that we must focus to a more significant extent on the climate impact of those measures.  There are measures in the green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS, for example, covering issues like water quality, biodiversity and some climate impact.  We will have to look more at the climate impact of those schemes.</p> <p>  With regard to investment, there is currently a TAMS element for production and some environmental investment.  We must consider what we want to invest in the next time around and whether we want to focus investment on elements that have an impact on the environment.  For example, do we want higher grant rates for things that may have a positive climate impact?  There is a new provision, for example, under the proposals to allow for low-cost loan schemes and grants.  Do we want to configure grants versus loan schemes on productive versus environmental expenditure?  These are some of the questions that arise and although I do not have the answers now, we have already engaged in a significant national consultation, including on the environmental pillar of CAP regulations.  We will be required to draft a national Common Agricultural Policy plan, embracing both Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 of the Common Agricultural Policy.  We will engage in consultation on the shape of that.</p></speech>

Mr. Gleeson said in his presentation that agriculture will contribute 26.8 megatonnes of the gap we must close of more than 90 megatonnes.  I presume from the comments thereafter that this will largely come from existing forestry.</p></speech>

Apart from the 26.8 megatonnes, we have identified measures that can contribute to some additional abatement and we are funding some of those measures.  We must reflect, in the context of future policy, on what else we do.  For example, Teagasc has done much work on a marginal abatement cost curve that identifies potentially mitigating strategies and we must reflect on the fruits of that work.  Dr. O'Mara can speak a little to that cost curve or we could provide it in written form.</p></speech>

There is much talk of increasing biomass use, grass to gas and all sorts of other initiatives, as well as further increasing our herd and further increasing output.  How will we do that in a country where in the past three or four years we have had to import fodder to feed the herd?  How will we complete these objectives with biomass and increased production when we cannot feed the existing herd?  Are we not overstocked?</p></speech>

Looking at stock numbers over the past ten or 15 years, they have gone up and down in accordance with market dynamics.  The overall stock numbers now are not very much higher than they were in the mid-1990s.  We had a particularly difficult year this year and it is certainly true we must consider resilience strategies.  Dr. O'Mara from Teagasc would have more to say about this than I would.  We know people are under-utilising the resource we have in grass and there is potential for significantly more production of grass if people managed their land correctly.  Dr. O'Mara can speak a little more about the technology behind this.</p></speech>

Top farms are producing 15 or 16 tonnes of dry matter per hectare per year but the average as measured in the national farm survey is probably less than half of that.  By improving grassland management there is the possibility to produce much more grass in the country.  If farmers wanted to and market conditions were right, there is the opportunity to produce some of that for the production of biogas.</p></speech>

We saw significant crop failure this year, as our grass crop failed at the height of the growing season and the best climate scientists tell us that is likely to happen again and again with greater intensity.  We must take that into account as well.</p> <p>  In the Citizens' Assembly, Professor Alan Matthews, our best land use economist, set out a very good case for putting a signal into the agriculture system to get productivity and generate revenue that we could feed back into the Irish agricultural system to pay farmers in the less affluent areas who are not part of the milk bonanza.

Carbon taxes have, however, been applied elsewhere.  There are issues with where to apply the tax.  If applied at production level, one of the issues for farmers is that it is a low margin business and it would impact on profitability.  The objective of a carbon tax is to change behaviour.  We have to ask ourselves again if there are alternative options for farmers to improve or change their behaviour.  We have already discussed the technological limitations on what can be done to mitigate or abate emissions from farming.  I am not going to say that I agree or disagree with policies that may or may not arise but there are issues to be considered in the context of reflecting on that policy.  I have mentioned some of those.</p></speech>

Any new forestry is for what happens after 2030.  Does Mr. Gleeson have figures on afforestation and the type of afforestation the Department believes is required?  How many hectares of forestry should we plant each year by the middle or end of the next decade?

Our afforestation targets in recent years were not as good as they could have been.  It is important for sustainability that we continue an afforestation programme every year.  We are getting the benefit now of the forestry we planted since the 1980s.  We planted more than 300,000 acres since the 1980s and it is important that we continue afforestation over the next number of years that will affect the next commitment period.  On the type of forestry, under our forestry programme we have a target of 30% of broadleaf forest cover for that part of the afforestation programme.</p> <p>  We are trying to influence farmers' decisions.  We provide higher grants and premiums for the planting of broadleaf trees.  We also introduced a minimum requirement that every single forestry application must have a minimum of 15% broadleaf cover.  Looking at the national afforestation that has taken place in recent years, some farmers have planted 100% broadleaf, which is great.  Some plant much less but they plant a large amount of coniferous forest.  Even with coniferous forests, a certain minimum level of types of broadleafs must be planted.  We also have stringent environmental requirements that must be taken into account for every single forest.</p></speech>

We should look not only at the volume of forestry or number of trees but also the nature of the forest.  We need continuous cover forest because it provides an environment that people like to live in.  I am conscious of time so I will ask a final question.  I wish Mr. Gleeson well in his job.  He will need our best wishes.</p> <p>  I put it to Mr. Gleeson that Ireland is a net importer of food.  Last year, when we had a storm we found within a couple of days that our supermarket shelves were starting to empty.  We are in a very insecure position regarding food because we rely on such distant supply chains.  There are some Irish vegetable growers but they are few in number.  There may be only about 150 of them left and many will pull out of the sector because of the climate problems we had this summer.  Some 90% of farmers here are earning less than the minimum wage, if they are not below poverty levels.  There may be 15,000 farmers doing well but there are 115,000 who are earning next to nothing.  We have a farming sector where the average age is 57 or 58.  In truth, it is impossible to get young people to go into farming because we do not pay farmers or foresters enough.  </p> <p>  Emissions are rising in Ireland.  The line of argument that we are better than Brazil or somewhere else on carbon leakage will not work in the environmental sector.  The scale of the change we have to make means that everyone has to cut emissions.  The truth is that Irish agricultural emissions are rising and projected to keep rising, with no plans in place to cut them.  The Department must ensure emissions in the sector reduce.  The system is working for public limited companies but not for Irish people.  Going green is the chance to change the system for the better for citizens and farmers.  While I wish the Department the best of luck in that, we are not ambitious enough in what we are doing. </p></speech>

Scientists state that it is the quantity of carbon going into the atmosphere that counts.  Carbon emissions must be reduced.  We can think of ways of doing this which will help Irish farming and give Irish farmers a better payment in the future.  They are not served well by the current system.  It is the public limited companies rather than people who are gaining and that must change.</p></speech>

We have national targets and agriculture has to play its part in meeting them.  The issue is complex, however, and there are a variety of economic and social considerations to take into account in the context of national policy.  While this is difficult for administrators and politicians, that does not obviate the need for agriculture to make a positive contribution.  We are up for doing that.</p> <p>  It is important, however, in the context of the narrative on this issue that the negativity around agriculture is totally counterproductive.  I appreciate that Deputy Ryan has not done that.  If we want to bring farmers with us, we have to acknowledge what they have done and encourage them to do more.  We need to provide the public policy tools to compensate them for the extra work they have to do to achieve these goals.  That is how we have to shape the next round of the Common Agricultural Policy.  </p></speech>

I read a recent Teagasc report by Trevor Donnellan, Kevin Hanrahan and Gary Lanigan, titled, Future Scenarios for Irish Agriculture: Implications for Greenhouse Gas and Ammonia Emissions.  I refer to the factory economic model used and the projected scenario planning there.  The report provides a bleak scenario analysis of agriculture in the context of greenhouse gas emissions and ammonia, even with mitigation measures.  Is the Department at one with that study in respect of the projected scenario planning?   I am referring to the case where, even if we do everything in respect of mitigation, greenhouse gases, ammonia in our cattle population will still increase by 2030?  We will be closer to the 2005 position than the aspirational target of 2030.  Does the Department wish to comment on the scenarios provided in the report?  They are bleak and uncertain in the context of some of what the witnesses have outlined on the general emissions targets.</p></speech>

It is always objective and well conducted and it is financed by the Department.  We do not ever seek to hide from the facts.  I mentioned previously that there is an acknowledgement, not only in Ireland but internationally, that there is a limit to what agriculture can do if we want to continue to produce sustainable food based on existing technologies and management strategies.  The Department is doing much research and Teagasc is doing much work to explore new mechanisms for abatement and sequestration.</p> <p>  I will ask Dr. O'Mara to speak about the work done by Teagasc but I believe it was based on current practice and there being no additional measures.  I am not sure that the scenarios were projections.  They were simply scenarios based on certain assumptions.  Stock numbers will be driven by market dynamics.  Again, I said earlier that we have been careful in the context of supports, for example, not to pay for stock numbers in the beef sector but instead to provide supports for environmental action.  That is the policy of the Department.  Perhaps Dr. O'Mara wishes to say something about the research to which the Deputy referred.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.76" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Frank O'Mara" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018110700002#G01500"><p>I will comment briefly.  There were two parts to the study.  The first part was as Deputy Chambers outlined.  It was a set of scenarios as to how the national herd might evolve over the next 12 years up to 2030.  That is hard to determine.  As Mr. Gleeson said, the national herd is below the level at which it peaked and slightly above the figure at which it stood in 2005.  The increase in numbers is gradual.  We picked six scenarios and a range of about 1 million animal numbers between the highest growing scenario and the lowest growing one.  We currently have approximately 7 million cattle.  The range was from almost 8 million to slightly under 7 million.  The way in which that evolves over the next 12 years will depend to a large extent on market conditions.  I would not like to describe the scenario as bleak but everyone takes a different view.</p> <p>  The second part of the study provided information on what can be done.</p><p>We approached it as something technical, a marginal abatement cost curve, but it is really just a way of setting out what the options are.  From research to date, there are 14 options available for policy makers to consider to encourage farmers to adopt these measures.  The good thing about it is that most of them are things farmers would want to do anyway as they are about improving the efficiency of how they operate their business.  The total mitigation potential of the measures is about 2 million tonnes, on average, over the commitment period 2020 to 2030.  At the end of that period about 3 million tonnes could be delivered if all of the measures were adopted at the level we have assumed in the study.  It will not be easy to get that level of adoption, but at least it shows that there is something that can be done.  </p><p> Research will continue.  Some of the measures in the marginal abatement cost curve were not in place ten years ago.  Even five years ago when we brought out the first version, it included measures that are not in the current one.  I have no doubt that when will we do the list of abatement options again in the future, we will add other mitigation options to it which will I hope allow the sector to do as Mr. Gleeson says, that is, to do more than what we currently see can be done.  While it is challenging, "bleak" is not the word I would use.</p></speech>

He said there could be an increase of up to 30% in greenhouse gas emissions.  The level of ammonia could be up by 20%.  The percentage reduction attributed to potential mitigation is less than what is attributed to the increase in what I mentioned.  It is bleak to think that in 2030 - if some of us are stll sitting here, as I hope we will be - the environmental impact of agriculture will be greater than it is now.  That is a bleak assessment.  I do not think Dr. O'Mara has outlined a scenario in which there is not a positive curve in that mix of analyses.</p></speech>

Availing of the mitigation options available would bring emissions below 2005 levels by 2030.  There is a mitigation figure of about 3 million tonnes by the end of 2030 which would bring emissions below those levels, depending on how the national cow herd grows.  As I said, the challenge for us as researchers is to find other abatement strategies.  We are continually working on them and involved in a lot of international research to find other solutions to the problem which I hope will emerge over the period.</p></speech>

In western countries it is wasted mostly after it leaves the factory.  In less developed countries it is generally wasted before it gets to the consumer.  For us, the big challenge is to try to extend shelf life in order that foods will go off more slowly.  There are two approaches, the first of which involves better packaging, while the second involves reducing the passage and load throughout the food production and processing chain.  There is a lot of progress being made.  If one looks at the carton of milk one buys, ten or 15 years ago the best before date was probably only three or four days away but now it is ten or 11.  It could probably be extended significantly.  The meat industry is also working with us.  There is a new initiative, Meat Technology Ireland, which is researching many aspects of meat processing, but a big target for the sector is shelf life extension because of product spoiling.  It is an area in which we have to make progress.  We are actively addressing the issue.</p></speech>

A target of a 30% decrease by 2030 is ambitious.  It is a large sector, with relatively low mitigation potential.  The points made about the three strands of work are valid.  Abatement, sequestration and displacement and substitution are important.  I was disappointed that a fourth strand - efficiency - was not included.  It is something we have overlooked in the industry.  If we make a comparison with the position after the Second World War, the output in terms of litre of milk per kilogramme of beef is much more efficient now, but we are not given credit for it.  The point was made that agriculture would present some of the solutions, for which it should be credited. </p> <p>  I will pick up on the comments made on small family farms and the public good element which is often overlooked.  Because we cannot put a number on it, it is difficult to quantify its value in the real economy.  What work has been done to establish the reality that there must be a place for large, efficient, modern farms in conjunction with and alongside small family farms?  There is a notion among the wider public that big is always bad, but that is not the case.  Very often big farms can offer opportunities when it comes to welfare, the environment, efficiencies and our carbon footprint.  The reality, albeit it is not popular to say it, is that on the island of Ireland a big dairy unit has a smaller carbon footprint per litre of milk than a small family farm.  However, it is not a comfortable discussion to have.  It is the reality, but we do not want to see Ireland covered by large industrial farm units.  As it is such an emotive subject, often charged by opinions of groups not directly involved in agriculture or food production, what work is being done to make sure everything we do is based on evidence-based policy and that we are not making policy decisions based on public opinion and what is in vogue?  We have paid the price for doing so in the past in the food industry.  For example, 20 years ago we were all told that saturated fats were killing us.  As a reaction, we removed saturated fats from our diets and replaced them with sugar.  Twenty years on we find that it is killing us.  We need to consider evidence-based policy underpinned by science.</p></speech>

When I spoke about abatement, I included efficiency which is a critical part of the abatement effort.  The more economically efficient people are, generally, the more climate efficient they are.  What potentially attracts farmers to climate mitigation measures is the knowledge that they will also have more money in their pockets at the end of them.  That is a critical linkage we have to make.</p><p>On the small family farms versus large farms, people talk about the Common Agricultural Policy as being multi-functional.  It is multi-functional in that it has economic, social, spatial and environmental functions.  The supports we provide do not distinguish in any qualitative way between small farms and commercial dairy farms.  I mentioned earlier that with the lifting of quotas we have succeeded in producing a cohort of farmers that can make a decent living from farming.  </p><p> On small beef farms, as mentioned earlier by Deputy Eamon Ryan it is more difficult to make a profit as a beef farmer.  When it comes to justifying the public input into this type of farming, one has to consider the environmental piece.  There is a lot of beef produced on small farms in the west that produces downstream benefits in terms of the purchase of local inputs and processing and marketing jobs in the meat sector.  When it comes to justifying the public policy intervention one has to consider the public good that is being provided.  We are doing a lot of work on the environmental piece.  From the point of view of the contribution that agriculture can make to climate change, through agencies such as Teagasc, we have done more research work than any other Department across Europe to quantify the climate impact of what we are doing.  This research work will continue.  As I said earlier, we do not resile from the facts.  The facts inform our judgments but they are also tempered with difficulties in terms of the implementation of policy and the social and economic impact on small communities of decisions made.  A complex set of facts inform policy decisions.  We will continue to fund Teagasc.  This climate change piece is an important part of the work of Teagasc into the future.      </p></speech>

In other words, conversations had in one Department that are pertinent and relevant to another Department are not being fed to the latter Department.

From the point of view of farming and anaerobic digestion, there are issues of scale and relative costs of alternative energy sources that have to be considered, again, in the context of developing public policy.  This is specifically called out in the policy documents around the proposals for the new Common Agricultural Policy.  It is an issue that we are examining and can do more on but it is not one-way traffic in terms of discussion.  Teagasc has established an anaerobic digester in Grange on a pilot basis.</p></speech>

Anaerobic digestion is expensive as a technology based on mitigation alone, notwithstanding the Senator's remarks regarding food waste.

What work is being done on solar panels?  In other countries, solar panels are being installed on cattle sheds and farm buildings, with the energy generated being used for own use or being fed into the grid.</p> <p>  On biomass, for a number of reasons, not least our international commitments, we have to phase out peat in the midlands.  The midlands is in danger of becoming a rust belt unless we put in place alternatives fairly quickly.  We do not have the biomass to feed the three power plants that are currently being fed with peat unless we import it from places such as Indonesia, which does not make sense in terms of carbon footprint.  The cost of shipping it here, financially and environmentally, is high.  What is the Department doing to establish a biomass industry?  I am aware of the difficulties encountered with miscanthus and willow but there are other crops that can be used, including, for example, birch.  What is being done in regard to the use of birch and other products that can be potentially used in this area?  People in the midlands counties are watching this space.  The recent announcement by Bord na M&oacute;na has shocked the public in terms of what is coming down the line.  Why are these schemes not yet in place?</p> <p>  Crop rotation and the genomics scheme were mentioned.  In terms of tillage, sugar beet is a cover crop for four months of the year.  It is a broadleaf, sustainable crop that is very important in terms of nutrients for the soil.  It is also an important cash crop.  From an environmental point of view, what is the Department doing in regard to sugar beet?</p> <p>  On biogas, in respect of which Mr. Gleeson mentioned a pilot scheme, there are 8,000 functional schemes in Germany and 600 in England.  We have a problem here in terms of agricultural waste.  We are repeatedly seeking derogations in regard to slurry spreading instead of trying to find a way of sustainably dealing with this waste, which is disgraceful.  Mr. Gleeson's comment in regard to the unit cost of electricity is correct.  However, northern Italy is also using dried slurry as fertiliser, the benefit of which is that it can be spread on land dry such that one does not have to wait until a specified date in January to open up one's slurry tank.  I am sure the Secretary General, Mr. Gleeson, is aware of the problems this causes and the damage it does to the land.</p></speech>

Currently, approximately 4 million cu. m of timber are being harvested.  This will increase to 8 million cu. m by 2035.  The larger trees are used for timber and the smaller ones go towards making biomass for energy production to displace other fossil fuels.</p> <p>  The more afforestation we do and the more thinning that takes place, the more biomass is available.  Currently, there is approximately 2 million cu. m of material available for biomass and fibre.  On the use of willow and so on, we have a new measure in our forestry programme to incentivise the production and planting of eucalyptus and faster growing trees in an effort to bring more fibre into the marketplace earlier than it currently comes on stream.</p><p>Currently, we face a few mobilisation challenges.  We have over 22 forest owners in the sector and we must try to move the timber and manage the existing forests they have to put some of that material through areas like biomass and other markets.  The Department has therefore put in place a forestry roads scheme to facilitate the building of roads in that forest estate.  Once a forest road has been built into a forest estate, farmers will be able to thin their plantations.  The more thinning that takes place, the more biomass will be available.</p><p> I was asked about willow, for which the Department had a scheme a number of years ago.  However, the uptake for that was poor.  We are concentrating now on targeting our forestry for fibre scheme with a focus on faster-growing species like eucalyptus, aspen and poplar.  We have various planters-----</p></speech>

However, people in the industry have identified the cost of doing that at over &euro;400 million.  That is a significant investment.  In reality, sugar prices are approximately 50% off the peak they have previously reached.  As such, prices are particularly low on world markets.  While there is a commitment to review the matter, it is contingent on someone coming forward with a business plan that makes sense.  Naturally, state aid issues will arise in such a case and in any event no business plan has been brought forward.</p> <p>  The issues of waste and slurry were raised.  We consider slurry to be a fertiliser and therefore not waste.  Our messaging around that has been very focused.  I appreciate what was said about the emotions of calendar farming but if slurry is considered to be a fertiliser one must ask whether somebody would buy it during the current closed period and spread it.  The answer to that is generally "No".  Our focus has been to maximise the efficiency of that by supporting low-emissions technologies, including "trailing shoe".  From a standing-still scenario less then three years ago at the beginning of the targeted agricultural measures scheme, we now have 2,000 applications for that technology.  Over 4,500 farmers are being paid a targeted element under the GLAS scheme for using trailing shoe technology at farm level.  This technology increases efficiency and also increases the window of application because animals can be returned to land in a shorter period where such technology is used.  It is not for everyone, but farmers are voting with their feet and they are supported by the Department in doing so.</p></speech>

Whether applying dry or wet fertiliser, it will not be applied at best use except to grow a crop.  During the winter period, therefore, there should be no encouragement in any country to apply dry manure during the closed period.  Certainly, I am not aware of any.</p></speech>

He takes seriously the obligations on the farming sector and the industry generally.  By comparison with some of the other departmental officials who have come before the committee, Mr. Gleeson has been a breath of fresh air.  I note from Deputy Eamon Ryan with whom I shared a text that the bar has been set relatively low so far.  Mr. Gleeson is well ahead in that regard and can take it, perhaps, as a compliment.  Mr. Gleeson referred to the potential to do more and he is right that it would involve policy decisions.  Notwithstanding that, has the Department done any scenario planning looking at the impact of any policy imperatives or changes to do more?  Clearly, Mr. Gleeson has thought about it given his presentation.  He rightly identified that there would be significant knock-on impacts and costs to society.  While he may not have them to hand, perhaps he might share at some stage any metrics on various levels of increased activity.  Mr. Gleeson identified the dairy sector.  What are the implications of that and what might play out?</p><p>On carbon sequestration and increased planting, can Mr. Gleeson provide a view on the incentives that will have to be put in place and the costs associated with them?  That is a real issue.  Has any effort been made to look at State-owned land?  The State owns a great deal of land that is not necessarily looked at from a managed-forest perspective.  Could we do more to plant trees on parklands without destroying the other amenity benefits associated with our parks?  Local authorities own vast tracts of land.  If we were to do a multiple of the cover that currently exist, it might have some impact.  Certainly, there would be no significant loss of amenity.  Has any work been done to consider what lands are in public ownership and how we might increase the level of afforestation cover on it without it being managed forest <i>per se</i>?</p></speech>

Coillte is the largest landowner in the country with over 400,000 ha.  We have been in discussions with Coillte for a number of years on whether there is much capacity to plant more trees on the lands it holds.  Some of the land in the Coillte estate was planted in the 1950s and 1960s.  It planted the lower slopes of mountains it acquired from making large-scale land purchases at the time.  Some of the land which is unplanted is at the top of mountains.  As such, much of it is unsuitable for growing trees.  We have also looked at the National Parks and Wildlife Service which has a great deal of land on which there are no trees.  However, those lands are important for habitat purposes.  We have to juggle whether land is there as a good habitat for biodiversity.  These may be Natura 2000 sites or protected peatland sites which are unsuitable for growing trees.  Doing so might go against the conservation objectives of a particular site.  However, we have a number of schemes in place, including a native woodland conservation scheme with which the National Parks and Wildlife Service has engaged over many years to plant additional oak woodlands associated with its existing oak forests.  If other public bodies have available land, they can come to us and we can examine whether funding can be provided for planting.  Under state aid rules, we are prevented from providing certain levels of financial support but, to answer the question, we are in touch with Coillte and other organisations regarding the potential to plant lands.  Discussions are ongoing in that space.</p></speech>

A local authority may have some land and a car park where there is open ground which is suitable for planting trees.  From a purely amenity perspective, it can put in trails and picnic tables.  We also have Coillte forests adjoining urban population centres where there is scope to improve woodland use by looking at funding to provide centres of excellence with car parks and trails.  That can open up woods and provide members of the public with better access.</p><p>There can also be informal access in more remote areas, with no formal car parks but a forest gate and a place to walk one's dog.</p></speech>

It will be interesting to see how we decide to reform our policy in this area.  The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will be a key aspect and a new CAP is due to come in by 2020.  Does the Secretary General see the CAP as a catalyst to drive policy and change in the agriculture industry?  We have heard about the success of the trailing shoe and the major change it has made to the agriculture sector in just three years.  Most farmers are using the system, whether in or out of derogation, because they see the benefits of it.  What policy changes will there be in the CAP to enable us to transfer to a greener and more efficient economy?</p> <p>  I know that Teagasc is doing work in the area of biodigestion.  If there is to be a whole-of-Government policy, will it be led by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or another Department?  Biodigestion has been successful in Germany, the UK and all over Europe and it seems to be a major part of the agriculture industry.  Which entities, outside of industry, does the Department see playing a part in this?  Co-operatives could be a major catalyst in the branding of biodigesters, especially in the major dairy areas where there is a slurry by-product, which can be a great asset if used appropriately.  Teagasc is doing great work and the Department is the driver of the policy but how will industry get behind it?  I am concerned about the fact that we do not have one Department driving it forward.  What is the vision of the Secretary General in this area?  In my part of the world there are a large number of dairy cows and this issue is mentioned at every meeting.  Perhaps agriculture is the solution and not the problem and we will need to expand on the great work done by Teagasc.</p></speech>

One is through regulation, which we do through nitrates control and other things, and the other is the &euro;1.6 billion per annum we get from the European Union to support farm incomes and encourage developmental change in the sector.  The first thing we have to do in the next CAP round is protect the budget.  At the moment, there are proposals for a cut of about 5%, which would be a loss of approximately &euro;98 million a year to Ireland.  We have to try to maintain the budget we have because that allows us to influence things.</p> <p>  There is still an income issue in farming so we need to protect the Pillar 1 payment that provides the basis for income support.  However, we accept the Commission proposal for additional conditionality to be attached to income support in the context of climate change.  There would be some kind of an ecoscheme in Pillar 1 so that farmers would get a baseline payment and if they do a bit more for the environment, they will get a top-up.  I am not in a position to say what the shape of that might be.</p> <p>  Senator Marshall mentioned the debate between intensive farmers and smaller-scale farmers.  The reality is that we have to work with both groups and they deserve significant attention from the perspective of the environment and climate change because if we do not work with them, there are potentially damaging consequences for biodiversity and water quality.  We also need to recognise the public good which smaller farmers provide and reward that in some way.  We have accepted the principle of doing more for the environment while protecting Pillar 1.</p> <p>  Pillar 2 is the rural development programme, where the requirement is that 40%, excluding the ANC payment, has to be devoted to the environment.  We will have decisions to make on how we configure that policy and it could involve deciding what we support with investment.  Will we support productive investment or climate change investment?  Will we provide higher rates of grant for climate change investment?  Our job in respect of the Common Agricultural Policy is to ensure that regulations allow us to do what we want to do.  Step 2 will be to devise a national Common Agricultural Policy plan for Ireland for the first time ever.  In the course of developing that plan we will have a discussion on how we can support the climate change ambition.  This will involve wider consultation with the farming community and with NGOs and industry.</p> <p>  Mr. Callanan will talk about biogas but I believe industry has a significant role to play.  In the context of the scale of farming in Ireland and the investment that would be required in anaerobic digestion, it is not a realistic proposition to expect individual farmers to invest in the necessary technology.  It will require some kind of collective effort from co-operatives, processors and even producer groups if we succeed in establishing them.  We have to have a discussion with all stakeholders about how we approach the issue.  We will not be the lead Department in the development of anaerobic digestion.  It will be the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment but we will work very closely with that Department.</p></speech>

We will take a lead from that in terms of the next steps.  We had a dialogue with industry in June and it was very interactive.  We asked for ideas and we identified challenges.  A clear message was given by Teagasc, the Department and Bord Bia about the requirements in this space.  There are regulatory drivers as well as market drivers and it was quite evident that the industry realises the necessity to communicate its message about what it is doing and what its commitments are going forward.</p> <p>  A couple of farmers spoke too and they understood that industry was engaged.  They need it to be translated into language that they can understand so that they can know what is expected of them.  We need to focus on identifying what we are asking farmers to do and why we are asking them to do it.  I have dealt with calendar farming for a long time and I appreciate their frustration.  Unless we are able to communicate why the rules exist, we will lose.</p></speech>

We are almost ready to commission that.  We see the need for research regarding the best way of running digesters should the policy framework encourage the development of a significant anaerobic digestion centre.  The Senator rightly mentioned slurry.  The problem with running biodigesters on slurry is that our dairy and cattle farms do not produce slurry all year round so there would be no year-round feed stock to go into a bio-digester except possibly in the pig sector, which is small in Ireland, so we must co-digest with something else.  That is the same in most other countries.  In Germany, it has tended to be maize silage-----</p></speech>

The quantities tend to be low and localised.  Going back to Deputy Eamon Ryan's question, grass would be the cheapest form of co-digested material to use in a biodigester.  The research we will carry out will look at the optimised ratios of grass and slurry.  The technology around biodigestion is moving on in terms of being able to extract more gas from a given amount of material that goes in.</p> <p>  I have one other comment about the issue of grass.  Deputy Eamon Ryan correctly identified the significant difficulties we faced this year regarding grass growth.  If we had a significant biodigestion industry based on grass silage, one of the benefits would be that in a year where there is bad grass growth, we might have a stock of silage that would normally go into biodigesters but that could go back into the livestock sector if there was a shortage of fodder for cattle.  It is a co-benefit one would hope not to have to use too often but it could be a release valve.</p></speech>

The witnesses have given 3.9% as a land percentage.  They say Teagasc is working on what value that may have or that it will be included in our sequestration figures.  How soon will that be included?  Where is that work?  How long will it take?  How well will Teagasc be able to identify it geographically on an imprint of the island?  Where I come from, it involves small fields and ditches as opposed to other areas where there is a larger spread of land.  Will Teagasc be able to regionalise it?</p></speech>

We have a figure for our hedgerows but it is a statistical figure so we do not measure every hedgerow in the country.  We do a sampling and then we basically bulk it up.  There are roughly 280,000 ha of hedgerows in the country, which is probably in the region of 3.94% of our national estate.  There is another body of work to be done regarding the carbon aspects of that.  I am not too sure who is working on it at the moment.</p></speech>

One involves the actual value and volume in terms of the carbon sequestration.  There is a research project that quantified some of that.  The question then involves the actual contribution this can make to the national inventories, etc.  They are evolving and are at various tiers in terms of the level of material that is there so I would not like to suggest at this point that once we quantify it, we will get inherent value for it.  We are working through a process and the inventory levels will improve as information improves.  We have already identified that we will report in respect of land use in terms of grassland versus arable.  That decision is inherently there.  Within the IPCC structure, there is a capacity to evolve reporting and that will arise over time.  It is wrong to suggest that once we quantify it, we will immediately get credit for it.  It is an evolving science.</p> <p>  The position regarding methane is the same.  Professor John FitzGerald of the Climate Change Advisory Council identified that the knowledge in terms of methane, how long it stays in the atmosphere and its global warming potential over a period are being quantified as well.  Quite simply, everything is translated into carbon dioxide equivalents over a 100-year period.  Carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for thousands of years.  Methane, which is predominant emission from the agricultural sector at approximately 60%, has a 12-year cycle after which it breaks down.  The knowledge relating to that involves identifying that if this is the case in practice, provided that methane emissions do not go up, it does not have an additional global warming potential as a consequence.  That is why the primary focus of our interventions is on carbon dioxide, etc..  Those parts where we can-----</p></speech>

Let us be clear; it is an evolving science.  I would not claim that it is an answer at the moment.  I am not suggesting it as a get-out-of-jail clause either because it does have an impact in terms of the national herd but it is an evolving issue, the whole objective of the exercise is reducing the global warming potential and methane needs to be considered slightly differently to carbon dioxide in that discussion.  That is what I am saying.  We can send on the research paper.</p></speech>

These are figures I have quoted here previously.  It is now beginning to go in the opposite direction.  What can we learn from what we did from 1990 to 2016?  I know it was probably the introduction of REPS.  We were working off a blank page.  It is like running a marathon; while the first 20 miles might not be easy, they are the easiest.  It is the last three miles that are the hardest.  Can we learn anything from what we have successfully done in the past?  I know it involves extra production.  We can talk about Food Wise 2025 and I know that to an extent, they are aspirational figures, targets or predictions but the bottom line is that based on population growth, food production must increase by 50% by 2050.  We have a good track record in agriculture.  It is beginning to slip slightly.  What is the reason for this and what can we learn from what we were doing positively through achieving a reduction in emissions during a period of increasing production such as that from 1990 to 2016?</p></speech>

We know we can do that.  In respect of what has driven that kind of production increase over the years, in 1984, we probably had 65,000 dairy farmers producing 5.5 billion l of milk whereas today, we have 16,000 dairy farmers producing 7.5 billion l of milk.  This is being driven by efficiencies in the system.  A significant part of our abatement involves trying to improve efficiencies whether it is through beef data and genomics, better grassland or investment in the economic breeding index in the dairy sector.  They are the things that drive efficiency and allow for increasing production without a corresponding impact on the climate.  I am not sure if Dr. O'Mara wants to say more about that.</p></speech>

From 1990 - and even before then - until 2014, Irish farmers were continually improving the genetic merit of their dairy cows, beef cattle and so on.  They were improving grassland management, fertiliser use efficiency and the way they used slurry.  All those improvements contributed to a drop in the carbon footprint of milk and meat production in the country.  Due to the fact that we had a ceiling on the production of milk and because the beef herd was fairly static, overall emissions were tracking down.  Those efficiency gains are continuing and we see them as being very much part of the future contribution farmers can make as they continue improving their efficiency but when output is also going up and possibly going up more rapidly than the efficiency gains, we then get this increase in the volume of emissions.  The figures we track from the national farm survey show that on average, the carbon footprint of milk production is going down by approximately 1% per year.</p><p>This has been the trend for an extended period and we envisage it continuing.  I hope that as some of the additional mitigation or abatement measures are adopted, the decrease in the carbon footprint will accelerate.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about that.  We provide incentives.  We invest approximately &euro;10 million per year in the organic sector.  We could do more, perhaps.  My view, which is entirely personal, is that we may need some of the big players and processors to develop serious interest in organics.  They will be driven by market potential and the relative cost and by whether they can get some kind of premium from organic output.  The Senator is correct that it is an important sector.  We provide support for it.  It is something we would like to do more on.</p></speech>

There has been no mention in the discussion thus far or in the presentation paper of the role of the Department in mitigation and adaptation measures in the marine sector.  There has been no mention of the fishermen and fisherwomen and the supports being put in place to deal with the displacement of their industry owing to species migration.  What is being done to support the fishing communities around the coast with regard to climate change?</p> <p>  What is Mr. Gleeson's view on marine-protected areas in terms of sequestration?  With phytoplankton and zooplankton, there is great capacity for our seas, which are healthy, to sequester.  Does having marine-protected areas and low-impact fishing constitute something positive towards which the Department could work?</p> <p>  My next question is on soil fertility and health.  Healthy soil is good for sequestration and growth.  What research has been done in this area with regard to climate change?</p> <p>  My next question is on diversification.  For most of this meeting, we have spoken about agriculture, the supports in place, and the very good production efficiencies that have been achieved.  I do not know whether, when talking about efficiencies, we are talking about efficiencies achieved in lowering greenhouse gas emissions because they continue to rise.  What is the Department doing about diversification in horticulture and tillage?  I ask this because, when talking about efficiencies, Mr. Gleeson has spoken about moving from the farm to the food product.  We have not talked about efficiencies in terms of food miles, however.  There was a suggestion about Ireland feeding the world.  What is the cost of this in terms of efficiency and bringing food or milk from the farm gate to China?  I sometimes wonder whether we are considering the concept of efficiency holistically.  Is the Department just considering the concept in narrow terms?</p></speech>

Our team in Johnstown Castle have focused on it for many years.  In recent years, we have introduced a programme on soil microbiology.  It concerns the soil microbiome and recognising the importance of microbes in the soil in ensuring that nutrients are used as efficiently as possible, that plants grow as well as possible, that plants are as healthy as possible, and that the soil is what we call "healthy".  This is a new and important area of research for us.</p> <p>  Let me comment on food miles and horticulture.  Like the Department, we are very committed to the horticulture and tillage sectors.  With money provided by the Department, we have just invested &euro;2.5 million in new horticulture research facilities at our facility in Ashtown to help to support the growers.  We very much recognise the importance of fruit and vegetables in a healthy diet and would love to see the sector strengthened and more Irish food and vegetables.  It is a very tough sector.  The tillage sector is a very tough sector in which to make money because there is a global market.  The world price makes it tough for Irish farmers to produce and compete.  We give them whatever support we can through research and advice.</p> <p>  On food miles, let me give an example of where we have made a major contribution.  Sea transport of food is quite efficient in terms of energy and emissions.  Land transport, by truck or rail, and transport by air are very intensive in terms of emissions.</p> <p>  We have recently developed a means of making cheese from milk powder.  This has allowed Ornua to build a factory in Saudi Arabia.  The milk is dried in Ireland and all the volume and weight is removed.  The powder is shipped to the plant in Saudi Arabia and reconstituted to make the soft cheeses the consumers in that region want.  It is a very innovative and efficient way of moving food.  It still allows us to export but without a large volume.  If one transported the cheeses fresh, there would be much more weight and cost.  We are conscious of the issue, and the industry and Teagasc are working closely on it.</p></speech>

We are trying to encourage the establishment and functioning of producer organisations whereby people organise and market their produce collectively, giving them a stronger hand in dealing with buyers.  They can buy inputs collectively.  We recently published a producer organisation strategy to provide guidance to those who wish to engage.</p></speech>

I wish him well in his new role.  The importance of the agriculture sector, which has been mentioned, cannot be overestimated.  It has meant so much to the economy and rural areas.  We hear daily about the demise of rural areas, including in respect of school transport and post offices.  The agriculture sector is crucial to rural sustainability.  One must bear this in mind in the overall context of the conversation, while also bearing in mind that agriculture has to play its part in the climate change agenda.</p> <p>  A crucial part of the climate change debate we are having involves the need to develop an even better communications strategy.  Many around this table and the public are not aware of what has been achieved in the agriculture sector.  The rural environment protection scheme, REPS, the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, and the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, have made a great contribution but many do not realise that.</p><p>People are perhaps tired of hearing the same thing, but we are the most efficient dairy producers in Europe.  That is a key point to make.  However, we need to do more.  The communication agenda needs to be ramped up to educate not just the general public but also the farming sector on what has been done and on what needs to be done.</p><p> Forestry is a major issue.  It was mentioned earlier, but it can be very helpful in this whole discussion.  In certain parts of the country, there is huge negativity about forestry.  Other parts could play a bigger role.  What incentives could be introduced to encourage more farmers to consider going into forestry?  After dairy, forestry is the most profitable farming sector.  Many people are not aware of that, but it is true.  That fact should be more widely communicated.</p><p> Efficiency is crucial.  The report published by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine a year ago mentioned three key words, namely, "better before bigger".  The message in this regard needs to be communicated time and time again.  More can be produced from less.  There is no doubt about that; it has been proven.</p><p> Teagasc can play a major role in respect of this matter.  The professional voice is very important in the context of agriculture.  I would like to know the advice Teagasc is giving to its advisers who go out to farmers on a daily basis and seek to improve efficiencies.  One of the key issued discussed was Origin Green.  What benefits has it achieved?</p></speech>

It is important to have balance in public discourse, which tends to be dominated by extremes.  Agriculture is responsible for a significant proportion of our emissions and that will continue to be the case.  Emissions had more or less flatlined in recent years but they are starting to climb now so we have to take action.  That is the situation.  We acknowledge that we have to do more.  However, we also acknowledge the effort that has been made.  Perhaps we are not as good at communicating that aspect.  We worked hard on our public consultation on the Common Agricultural Policy in the context of talking about the environment.  A representative from the EPA was on stage with us and made a presentation to farmers.  We have to align farm policy and environmental policy.  Farm bodies and farmers are up for that, but it has to be explained to them in simple terms.</p> <p>  There is an issue with forestry.  If one looks at our dry stock sector, for example, it is clear that most of the participating farms have little stock.  The average stocking rate is 0.8 livestock units per hectare.  Most farmers have some land on their farms that could be planted and this could supplement their incomes.  They could carry on with the same beef production as they currently do but provide a bonus for themselves through the planting of forestry.  Perhaps Mr. Moore will talk about what we are doing in the area of agroforestry.  There are sincerely held concerns about forestry, some of which might be legitimate, but we should not allow those views to dominate discussion about forestry.  We need to encourage forestry.  I do not want to dismiss anyone's concerns.  I know people have concerns but they cannot dominate the narrative.  There has to be balance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.158" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergus Moore" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018110700002#O00300"><p>Afforestation levels have dropped in recent years.  That is obviously a concern.  The Department, working closely with Teagasc, will be involved in a promotional campaign over the next two or three years which will target all kinds of media outlets to increase the awareness of forestry.  We want to identify farmers who have planted previously and ask them for some good news stories in order to promote and sell the message.  We are also grant aiding knowledge transfer groups.  In recent months, the Minister announced a knowledge transfer scheme.  It will get like-minded foresters and forest owners together to talk about forestry and to discuss certain aspects of it, including how things can be done better.  We have also revised our environmental requirements.  There are many regulations in place which seek to control forestry in a certain way.  These regulations have given rise to increased negativity in recent years.  It is important that we stress that afforestation is a voluntary scheme, but it is important that it is done in a certain way.  We have had close engagements with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the EPA and our registered foresters and have held a public consultation on a range of different measures.  We have produced a document concerning environmental requirements which discusses the good things forestry does.  It informs people that when trees are put in the landscape they should be kept back from water courses in order to avoid damage.  It tells people to stay at least 60 m from houses, and it encourages an increase in the level of broadleaf planting in particular forests.</p> <p>  A mid-term review of measures we have taken to try and increase and promote the uptake of forestry shows that we have increased our grant rates and some of our premiums.  We have put a stronger emphasis on broadleaf planting; we know many members of the public like broadleaf trees.  At the end of the day, farmers are looking at this as a commercial enterprise, so we have to take that into consideration.  There are now higher premiums for the planting of broadleaf trees.  If, for example, a person was to plant a hectare of oak woodland, he or she would get &euro;645 per hectare for 15 years.  A Sitka spruce woodland would generate &euro;510 per hectare for 15 years.  There is a differential there which seeks to nudge people to make certain decisions on the type of trees they want to plant.  We are also looking at encouraging a greater range of species to be planted, including Douglas fir, Scots pine, birch, Sitka spruce, oak and beech.  There are many different species which attract different premiums.  There are higher premiums for broadleaf trees and lower premiums for conifers, generally speaking.</p> <p>  We are conscious that we have to sell the forestry message as a Department and promote the benefits.  Forests are not just about carbon.  They also provide timber, which displaces fossil fuels by providing fuel for heating.  It is important to look at the many benefits of forestry rather than focusing on the carbon sequestration aspect.  Forests provide a range of different services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.159" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Frank O'Mara" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018110700002#O00400"><p>I fully agree with the "better before bigger" slogan.  We emphasised that to dairy farmers in the post-quota era, telling them not to get bigger until they were sure they were doing everything as well as possible on their farms.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked what key messages our advisers take out to farmers, specifically livestock farmers.  There are five messages.  The first concerns better breeding, and reminds me of the old saying, "An ounce of breeding is worth a ton of feeding".  The idea is to improve the genetic merit of one's herd, which then is in place for ever.  We encourage farmers to use the tools at their disposal, including the economic breeding index, EBI, and the maternal index for beef cow breeding.</p> <p>  The second thing we talk to farmers about is grassland management.  Grass is the cheapest feed farmers have, and so the bigger proportion of the diet of cows that comes from grass the better for the bottom line.  It is also better for the health characteristics of the food produced, and from the point of view of the animals, which are out grazing.  Extending the grazing season within manageable limits is something we promote.  The win-win from the point of view of the environment is that the emissions of grazing animals are lower than when they are eating silage and concentrates.  Every day of extra grazing reduces emissions.</p> <p>  The third area concerns soil and ensuring good fertility.  It is important to maintain the phosphorus and potassium status and to make sure it is adequately limed.  It also concerns making the best use of fertiliser and manure, with the view to getting the most out of the manure produced on one's own farm, meaning slurry and farmyard manure, so that one can minimise the amount of bag manure that has to be bought and used.  Clover has a role to play in that as it cuts back into the grassland management area.</p> <p>  The fourth area we emphasise is animal health.  Having health animals means that they perform well, fewer are lost, and efficiency in the system is improved.  This is good for farmers, and also leads to lower emissions because fewer sick animals are being carried and fewer replacements are required.</p><p>The last piece of advice we always give to farmers is to always be conscious of cost.  Farming is not a high-profit business and farmers need a relentless focus on the cost of running a business.  Whatever farmers do, they need to keep the bottom line in mind.  One of the initiatives Teagasc has, in collaboration with Bord Bia, is to encapsulate those messages into what we call the carbon navigator, which is a process we go through with farmers to point out to them what they can do on their farms and how their own farm benchmarks against the norms for those measures I have just outlined and give them a direction that they could do a bit better on their nutrient management, or the herd economic breeding index, EBI, or getting cattle out to grass in the spring.  That is one of the initiatives Teagasc has done with Bord Bia and a lot of farmers have gone through the process of doing a carbon navigator with their adviser.</p></speech>

Mr. Maloney wants to comment on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.163" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Maloney" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018110700002#P00400"><p>Absolutely.  Farmers are given feedback about what their carbon footprint is relative to their peers.  Not only that, they are shown where the areas for improvement are, whether that is the length of the grazing season, the amount of fertiliser that is spread, the slurry that is put out, when or how it is put out and so on, or the EBI.  They are shown exactly where they can make improvement.</p> <p>  There was a question on the benefits of Origin Green and whether we got the best out of it.  Origin Green is a work in progress at this time.  It was put together back in 2012 and it is the programme we use to market Ireland's food and drink abroad.  That is what it is, in essence.  It provides the proof and data that substantiate any claims we make about the sustainability of Irish food production.  We have been building it since 2012 with the Department and Teagasc.  More than 50,000 farmers and 350 companies are in the programme.  I take the point that it is important we get the message out.  More than 90% of the beef produced in the country comes from Origin Green farmer members while more than 95% of dairy farmers are Origin Green members.  The 350,000 companies in Origin Green represent in excess of 90% of all our food and drink exports. </p> <p>  We did international market research this year and found that, across 13 markets globally, what resonates with trade buyers, in particular, is the importance of what we are doing with the Origin Green programme.  We are communicating the message on a business-to-business basis at this point, which is where we are getting the most value for our money, but what resonates with them and what they are finding good is that we are carbon footprinting all of the 50,000-plus farmers in the programme.  Every 18 months, they are carbon footprinted.  As Dr. O'Mara said, more than 200,000 carbon footprints have been done.  We are unique in terms of doing that.  We are not saying everything is perfect on all these farms but the fact that we are measuring what is happening on these farms certainly resonates with trade buyers.</p></speech>

We mentioned the CAP and the new policy will be the environmental CAP, as such.  How do we square the circle as there has been an increase in intensification, for example, in the dairy industry in the eastern part of the country?  At the same time, the new CAP is going to see a flight of funding to the west when the east may require additional assistance to develop systems relating to a climate change agenda.  How does the Department square that circle?</p></speech>

That may, in the final analysis, be mandatory as it is in the proposals now for member states, or it may be voluntary.  When we look at how we configure our plan, which is separate from the regulations, we have to consider all the environmental challenges and some of those relating to intensification and we have to consider how we assist the more intensive guys to farm in a more sustainable way.  We are doing that anyway at the moment.  We launched a programme the other day where we appointed, along with industry, which is playing a part in this, 30 sustainability advisers around the country to help more intensive farmers to protect watercourses and to farm in a way that is sensitive to the environment.</p> <p>  We have to configure our Pillar 2 payments in a way that provides some kind of support for the more intensive people but, equally, to allow, through Pillar 1 and also through this Pillar 2 payment, payments that recognise the environmental public good that is being provided by smaller farmers or by the beef sector.</p> <p>  There are other ways.  I mentioned before there are two ways to influence the impact of agriculture on climate.  There is regulation, which the Department is doing through nitrates, and then there is utilising the CAP.  We will have to address those twin problems.  We need to adopt measures that will help the intensive farmers to farm in a more sustainable way.</p></speech>

I note, in his presentation, that he held a sustainability dialogue during the summer.  Is linked to the national dialogue on climate action, or is it something the Department is doing itself?  What will the follow-up actions be?</p> <p>  There were a number of actions within the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine report relating to requirements for the transition within the agriculture sector in respect of climate action, which was referred to by Deputy Deering.  Is the Department looking to progress some of the suggestions in that?  If so, has Mr. Gleeson a timeline?</p> <p>  The additional abatement potential in the agriculture sector was mentioned.  Perhaps somebody from Teagasc might give me some specifics on that.</p> <p>  Is there much in the line of research being done on the addition of certain products to foodstuffs consumed by our cattle to try and help reduce the methane emissions?</p> <p>  There were references earlier to organic farming, but what else is the Department looking at in terms of land use?  For example, is it looking at re-wetting bogs to bring us towards being carbon neutral?</p> <p>  The other question was about the bio-economy and the circular economy.  Is the Department looking at policies around that and what are its plans?  We are in a challenging time and I wonder if Mr. Gleeson could answer some of those questions.</p></speech>

We claim we were a little ahead of the curve on that in June of last year, but the clear objective is to be able to communicate why we are doing things and to raise awareness and get feedback on the interventions.  We did it in an interactive format where we collected a massive number of comments from approximately 200 people who participated and we distilled that into a short report for the participants.</p> <p>  The message coming from that is that we communicate that and it is translated.  We have a working title of "Climate Wise for Agriculture".  We are articulating what agriculture is doing, but also identifying what needs to be done, or where the policy needs to go in that regard.</p> <p>  The Deputy's second question was about foodstuffs, etc.  There is work on two points.  One relates to protein content, which has an impact particularly on ammonia emissions, and that is identified in the Teagasc marginal abatement cost curve, MACC, as an intervention point.  Protein is required for growing animals, less so for fully grown animals.  There are opportunities to reduce protein content with a positive impact on ammonia emissions.</p> <p>  Regarding additives, there is a lot of talk about seaweed and all these types of additives.  We need to see evidence of that before there is a policy intervention.</p> <p>  There were 14 potential interventions within the Teagasc MACC.</p><p>The three biggest of those are, first, improving breeding, and we have the economic breeding index, EBI, in that regard.  The second is fertiliser, in terms of the use of protected ureas for example, as an intervention point.  Research work has been undertaken to ensure nothing appears in the final product as a consequence of that.  Safety of food is critical in that element of it.  We have provided funding for work to be done in that regard.  The final element is the trailing shoe technology, low-emission trailing spreading, for which we have financial support.  That constitutes  60% of the action points identified in the MACC that are working.</p><p> I addressed the bioeconomy earlier.  Agriculture is front and centre in respect of bioeconomy delivery.  Whether it is through work in UCD or the work of Glanbia on the use of whey permeate, it is a significant opportunity for agriculture.  The critical point is that it needs to reflect back to the primary producer as well and that this is not just value added that is gained by industry but rather contributes back to the original producer of the product.  That is reflected as well in Commission commentary.  That is the case whether we are talking about forestry owners or milk producers, among others.  That is the objective in the development of the bioeconomy.</p></speech>

Feeding has always been of interest to scientists.  I was an animal nutritionist and I spent a good few years of my earlier career in that area.  We always set out with the ambition of turning off methane by changing diet.  We found out that it is tough to turn off.  The production of methane is a natural process as the animal ferments forage foods in its rumen.  The only way to effectively turn it off is to change the diet radically.  If ruminants are moved to a high concentrate diet, so that they are almost being fed like a monogastric such as a pig, then that could dramatically change methane emissions.  Mr. Callanan mentioned protein.  The other option we considered was adding fat or oil to the diet of animals.  That is quite effective, but the economics of it are not great because it is expensive.  Sustainability is a major issue in terms of where one gets the oil from.  There is much controversy about the production of palm oil, for example, so the use of oil is not a simple equation.  We have it in the MACC but it is in there as a small point.</p> <p>  We are interested in herbs such as chicory and plantain as forage feedstuffs that might have an impact but much more research is needed on them.  There are always new suggestions coming along, such as seaweed, which we are currently looking at.  The feed industry is actively researching various additives that might be included in the diet, for example, that might act as a chemical inhibitor for methane.  I understand there is a promising initiative from an international company, which is almost ready to submit to the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA, for approval as a dietary supplement that would have a significant impact on methane.  That is what I was referring to earlier.  Being optimistic, research has the potential to bring further solutions as well as the 14 we mentioned in the MACC in the years ahead.</p></speech>

Quite a lot of work has been published on the one I mentioned from the international feed company, which shows it is effective at reducing methane emissions by approximately 30%.  It will take several years to get approval to use it on farms.  It needs to be fed not just every day but several times a day so it is suitable for animals that are indoors and being fed a TMR diet.  It is not suitable for grazing animals.  We are interested in working with the company to see if we could make a version that would be suitable for grazing animals.</p></speech>

As I understand it, there are approximately 300,000 ha of drained peatlands.  When peatland is drained, carbon is released.  As I understand it, we are currently counting that in our inventory.  A total of 300,000 ha of peatlands are emitting carbon because they were drained at some time in the past.  If they have become re-wetted through the drains breaking down over time, or if they were re-wetted, then there is potential to reduce the amount of land we are counting in the inventory at the moment.  I do not have the figure off the top of my head but that 300,000 ha would give rise to a significant emissions savings - almost 500,000 tonnes of carbon.</p></speech>

He said that output is outpacing efficiency gains in respect of the national herd.  He referred specifically to milk production.  In layman's terms, I would like to gain an understanding of how that gap is being narrowed or closed.  A question arises if the gap is narrowed and one has maximum efficiency gains, and one is still planning on increasing output.  If I understand the interventions correctly, output will keep increasing.  We will continue to produce beef and more milk or milk products or derivatives thereof.  If that is where we have put our eggs in terms of the market - Dr. O'Mara keeps referring to the market - then how do we close the gap?  If we close the gap between efficiency gains and increases in output and if we were trying to peg it out in years, at what stage of the process will we get there?</p><p>Will it be 2025, 2040, 2050 or 2100 by the time the gap is closed?</p><p> The IPCC's report has brought what we are facing into stark focus.  This morning I got a sense of the work the Department was doing, which is laudable, but there was no great sense of urgency, particularly in forestry and making efficiency gains.  I say this because tackling climate change requires resources.  In his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance spoke about the environment efficiency pilot scheme for the beef section, yet I do not know what is the overall figure for the scheme.  When one examines the initiative a little, it seems that it will cost &euro;40 per cow and that the weight of cows will have to be recorded at marts.</p><p> Has the rhetoric at the working groups of the European Union changed owing to the 40% figure in the CAP negotiations?  Can the rhetoric be tracked to dialogue within the Department that states, "If we keep going the way we are, we are going to far surpass the target set of 32.3% for Ireland's overall emissions in agriculture"?  I firmly believe we cannot maintain such a trajectory.  I am trying to be evidence-based in dealing with this matter.  Based on the interventions made today, it seems that there is no way in hell that we will be able reach the figure of 32.3% at the current rate of intervention.  It is just an impossibility.  I would prefer the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to tell us how much we need in pounds, shillings and pence, outline what policy interventions are needed and how much money is required for same. </p><p> My last questions are about forestry.  If I run out of time, the Secretary General can supply the committee with his answers in writing.  Is 18% of the land area of the country under forestry?  We are talking about schemes under which farmers will be paid X amount for 15 years.  Surely we need to be telling them, "Do not farm that land any more because this is what we are going to pay you in perpetuity and your antecedents," because otherwise, frankly, we are on a hiding to nothing.</p></speech>

I have mentioned that we have received credit for 28 megatonnes, which figure is attributable to agriculture and the forestry sector.  I have also mentioned that there are other things we could do.  At a maximum, we are talking about a figure of 17 megatonnes.  The national target is 90 megatonnes.  I have articulated the contribution agriculture can make in meeting the national target, based on the use of current technologies.  I stress that the technology will evolve.  There could also be feeding strategies and other things we could do over time.</p> <p>  Deputy Sherlock mentioned a new scheme.  It is on top of the &euro;300 million we are spending on the beef data genomics scheme.  We are putting &euro;4 billion into the rural development programme.  Please forgive me if I do not come across as an expert in this area, but I am catching up fast.  My Department has a lot of people with expertise and we have recruited two ecologists recently.  The Department has put big resources into tackling climate change as it affects the environment.  Therefore, I cannot accept the Deputy's assertion that there is no sense of urgency.  I am here to present the facts as I know them.  I have presented what agriculture could do based on current policies and technologies.  If one were to decide that it could do more, one could have long discussions on whether that would be wise.  I am sure people seated around the table hold differing views.  There are other things one must take into account, including the social and environmental impact globally.</p> <p>  On what the Deputy said about forestry, we provide very generous incentives.  The current level of forest cover is 11%.  Our target is 18%.  The European average is 35%.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether we should pay farmers not to farm.  That initiative would have environmental, biodiversity and other consequences.  He outlined his proposal but perhaps he was trying to be provocative.  Perhaps that is what he really thinks, but it remains to be seen.  We need to ensure that when we intervene in this space, we do so in a way that helps farmers to farm in more climate friendly and efficient way.  That is what we have tried to do. </p></speech>

In the CAP negotiations there is ongoing discussion of the regulations.  The current proposals require a 40% spend on environmental measures, something we have accepted.  Some member states, including some of our traditional allies, are resistant to the idea of conditionality, on which they have their own views, but Ireland has embraced the idea.</p> <p>  The discussion that is of more relevance to the considerations the Deputy has mentioned is on the defining of a national plan, or phase 2.  Phase 1 involves agreeing to the regulations which will give us discretion to do certain things.  They will require us to spend 40% of the budget on climate change and environmental measures.  They will also give us discretion to configure policy in a way that will suit our national conditions.  One of the big features of the new CAP will be more discretion for member states.  It is at the time when we define our national plan that we will get into the real hard discussion on what should be done with the funding.  That will be the subject of further engagement.  I am sure I will meet various committees of the Houses when it comes to consideration of the development plan.</p></speech>

Also, many of the issues I wanted to raise have been mentioned.  I want to ask questions about the type of land in the north west where I live.  It is marginal and results in low impact grazing, particularly on mountain land.  Has the impact been measured?  It is not intensive farming.  The biodiversity aspect clearly is much higher.  Farmers believe they already do an awful lot for the environment without the existence of a scheme or anything else.  Unfortunately, they have received very little recognition for doing so.  Has a comparison been made between low-impact grazing and intensive farming practices in the context of carbon sequestration?</p> <p>  There has been much talk about finding alternatives.  In a field not far from where I live there is an empty pit that was used for the production of flax.  Seventy or 80 years ago flax was grown as a crop in this country to support the production of linen.  Latterly, carbon or oil based synthetic products took over and the flax industry disappeared.  Should we consider the reintroduction of such industries that worked in the past and that may now have a future?</p><p>Another such crop is hemp, which can be grown extremely well in our climate but which has not been.  There are issues in this regard which need to be dealt with.</p><p> I come from a part of the country where we have a problem with the forestry because it represents a permanent change of land use.  It takes over entire townlands and parishes where very few people live and kills off communities.  We can say there are reasons for this and so on.  Furthermore, as for the biodiversity nature of forestry, it is generally monoculture.  It is all Sitka spruce, and a few evergreen trees are grown on the edges.  This is not working for communities and it is not what we want to achieve.  There needs to be a re-examination of the policy in this regard and we need to come up with alternative models of forestry, such as continuous-cover forestry.</p></speech>

Probably about 600 or 700 beef farms of all descriptions, including some of the intensive ones the Deputy has described, are surveyed.  The survey is primarily set up to track farm incomes, but we have been matching or boarding onto it the measurement of various sustainability indicators, including carbon footprint.  We have done this first for the dairy sector so we can produce a report on carbon footprint in the dairy sector.  This is the kind of information to which I referred earlier when I spoke of the carbon footprint of milk production having decreased by about 1% a year.  We are now also doing this for beef production and can stratify the data out by the intensive, high-stocked beef farmers versus the less intensive, lower-stocked ones.  I do not have the figures with me now or in my head, but the possibility is there to track this.  This methodology then gets rolled out into the Origin Green quality assurance scheme, so all farmers, once they are in the scheme, will have a carbon audit figure eventually, every 18 months, put on their farms.  As a result, we can see the carbon footprint range from this type of farm versus the more intensive type.  I will not speculate as to precise figures in this regard.  We will do similar work for sheep next year.</p> <p>  I will respond to the Deputy's other question about flax while I have the floor.  We have just recently appointed a new researcher to look at alternative crops for the tillage sector.  I can certainly take the Deputy's comment about flax and hemp back to her.  She will be looking at things like soya bean meal.  Apparently, 4,000 ha of soya bean meal has been grown in south Wales and south England this year.  I do not know how it fared, but we need to be constantly looking at the other alternative crops that are there.</p></speech>

Regarding marginal land and the configuration of the new Common Agricultural Policy, one thing we must do is pay for additionality.  That is one of the constraints under which we find ourselves.  When we are considering how to provide recognition for that, we must consider what kind of scheme can deliver some kind of additionality as well.</p> <p>  Regarding afforestation, I know the Deputy's part of the country so I understand the issues there.  There is an acceptance that we need to do more in respect of broadleaf trees.  This is why we changed our policy this year to require at least 15% broadleaf planting and to provide higher incentives for deciduous trees.  I understand the Deputy's perspective on this, but it is important that those concerns do not feed into-----</p></speech>

Again, we are looking at different ways of doing things to try to address some of the issues people have raised in the past.</p></speech>

I am very conscious that a very significant amount of our inputs in our dairy and beef production are imported.  This needs to be borne in mind in the context of Origin Green and so on.  If we are talking about closing the circle, we need to understand that everyone in the country - every farmer in every sector - is dependent on another sector.  As the tillage sector went a way down, it had an impact in this regard.  If we are dependent on Latin America and elsewhere in importing many of these inputs, this is part of a carbon footprint we may not be measuring.  Are we measuring it?  Does that come into it?</p></speech>

Whether it was imported or homegrown, we still count the carbon emissions associated with its production, so we are not ignoring the fact that this feed might have been brought in from another country.  It is a full measurement of the carbon footprint.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right about the value of the tillage sector.  We cannot have only one system of farming in the country, and this very much was borne out this year with the simple matter of the availability of straw, which brought it home to many people that we do need a tillage sector.  Unfortunately, however, the market dictates to farmers where they can make a profit.  We have seen a significant enough decline - I do not know precisely by how much, but perhaps 12% or 15% - in the acreage of tillage crops.  Much of this has gone into dairying because of the difference in profit margins.  I fully accept the Deputy's point, though, that the value of having a range of systems at a national level is very significant.</p></speech>

Many people have said today that Ireland has the lowest carbon footprint for milk production.  One of the reasons we do is the fact that we do not feed much concentrates into the diet here.  The typical concentrate level for dairy cows in Ireland is about a tonne a year.  In the Netherlands, it is probably 3.5 tonnes per year.  There is a carbon footprint associated with those concentrates, and when one counts it the intensive, indoor-type system must carry the cost of that production of grain in some other country when one measures fully the carbon footprint.  This is where we gain because we do not have a lot of the carbon footprint associated with grain production.</p></speech>

I specifically thank Mr. Gleeson for his.  I missed most of the proceedings as I have been in and out of another committee.</p><p>I had wanted to ask three questions but I will ask just two.  The first concerns a just transition for low-income farmers.  No other member mentioned this.  I was looking at the Teagasc survey for last year for farmer income, and there is a surprisingly high level of economic vulnerability, 30%, among farmers.  The figures are quite startling.  Something like 5% of that 30% earned less than &euro;10,000 in that year and 21% reported an income of between &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000.  Let us go back to the recommendations of the committee for the Citizens' Assembly on climate change.  Ancillary recommendation No. III states:</p><blockquote>The agriculture sector ... requires ongoing support to make a transition towards models of production which give rise to lower GHG emissions.  Cognisance must be taken of the impact which the sector has on the economy, particularly the rural economy.</blockquote> <p>Have the witnesses done an audit on the negative outcomes that might follow a transition in the lower income brackets of farm producers in agriculture?  Many supports will be needed.</p><p>I have another question about carbon footprints that has come into my head just in the past few minutes.  Can we get an understanding of the carbon footprint that comes from the cohort I have just spoken about and how it compares to the footprint from the cohort of multimillionaire ranchers who produce loads of dairy and loads of beef?</p><p>Do the delegates have a scale or measurement to compare the carbon footprint of very wealthy farmers with that of more marginalised and lower income farmers?  It would be interesting to see it.  We produce far too many cattle and do so to satisfy the markets of Saudi Arabia, China, Egypt and so forth.  It has been shown in all of our exports recently.  It is obscene and does not serve the planet very well.  However, as was said, the market dictates.  Part of the problem with climate change is that it is the market that dictates, rather than a sensible approach to production and economics.</p><p> My second question is about Coillte.  About a year ago at this committee representatives of the environmental pillar argued that there should be an independent review of Coillte and that it should be reformed to ensure a long-standing focus on native trees, which create a longer term benefit for biodiversity and the climate, was part of the policy.  That is not happening.  Mixed native woodlands are being sidelined for Sitka spruce and all of the problems that go with it.  Do the delegates agree that there is a need for a review?  Do they hope an outcome of that review would be a reversal of the policy of using a fast growing cash crop such as Sitka spruce and eliminating it for the benefit of the longer term, more environmentally and ecologically friendly broadleaf, from which there is much to be gained?  In addition, I agree with the comments made on looking at alternative crops such as hemp which is a good absorber of carbon.  If it is possible to get over the legal stuff connected with the growth of cannabis and eliminate the illegality and that complication, it could be used for many things, from the production of clothes to fences.</p><p> On Deputy Martin Kenny's contribution, while on holiday recently I met many farmers in his area who were very concerned about the impact of forestry and Coillte's policy on the Border, in the west and the north.  The farming community and the population of the region have been badly harmed by overproduction and the policies of Coillte.</p></speech>

She is absolutely right, which is why we need public support for farming under the Common Agricultural Policy.  There is an issue with the share-out of that support.  Under the last CAP we embarked on a programme of what was called "convergence".  We brought people who were below 60% of the average national payment per hectare up to 60%.  That moved approximately &euro;100 million from the highest paid farmers to the lowest paid farmers.  There is a new Common Agricultural Policy proposal that the lowest paid farmers be brought up to 75% of the average national payment.  That is a mandatory provision in the new proposal.</p> <p>  On carbon intensity, I am subject to Dr. O'Mara's confirmation, but more intensive farming on grassland produces lower carbon emissions per unit of output.  That is why our dairy units are so carbon efficient.  They are producing milk from grass.  Does Dr. O'Meara wish to elaborate on that point?</p></speech>

One can be very efficient and have a small operation.  Most dairy farmers are quite efficient.  As regards the carbon footprint of every litre of milk produced, it will not differ much if one has 50 versus 150 cows.  Obviously, one is producing more milk if one has 150 cows and the overall absolute emissions will be higher on that farm, but it will not vary that much per kilogramme of milk produced.  However, I need to get the figures and refer back to the committee.</p></speech>

It is not so much the carbon footprint per head of cattle that matters because obviously there are economies of scale and so forth, but the income brackets of farmers and examining the output in terms of the carbon footprint, from the most vulnerable to the most well off, and what it measures.  That is probably a socioeconomic question, but it relates to agriculture and the policy in how we move forward.  I would be interested in seeing the figures.</p></speech>

However, it is a question of how one looks at it and whether they are the overall emissions from the farm.  The low income farms are going to be smaller farms and will have lower total emissions.  One must also look at the emissions per unit of output, whether it is a litre of milk, a kilogramme of beef or a kilogramme of grain produced, and whether there is a difference in efficiency or the amount of carbon associated with each unit of food produced.  That is also an important metric to examine.</p></speech>

Every year it applies for a general felling licence for particular blocks of timber and we have many consultations with it about species choice.  To summarise, the forestry industry is worth approximately &euro;2.3 billion to Ireland and we harvest approximately 3 million km of timber.  It supports a very vibrant sawmilling sector which employs 12,000 people.  Obviously, the coniferous species is fast growing and provides the raw material for the sawmilling sector.  We also recognise that broadleafs have an important role to play.  They also provide timber and the Department is examining ways to improve its promotion in the wider economy.</p> <p>  As regards the Coillte estate, one can argue about the types of tree planted, but there are 8 million visits per year to the estate which many are using quite well for recreational purposes.  On diversification, Coillte is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council and makes various recommendations related to the estate.  In general, there is a wide range of diverse species planted across different areas of the Coillte estate, but because many of the areas planted historically would have included poor marginal land, the capacity to grow many species would be less.  Some of the coniferous species have better capacity to grow in these wet, marginal land and exposed locations.  From a felling licence perspective, Coillte includes a lot of broadleaf trees along roadsides in felling licences to try to improve the quality of and the impact on the landscape in some of the larger coniferous plantations.</p></speech>

There is a difficulty in gaining acceptance in rural communities of its value.  How will the delegates engage with farmers to ensure they will shift?  In the last couple of weeks we saw how Bord na M&oacute;na badly managed it with the people involved in bogs in the midlands.</p> <p>  According to the Heritage Council, there are three types of high nature value farming.  Has the Department carried out any study to characterise each farm in Ireland in terms of how it fits within it and of the figures in that regard?</p> <p>  Mr. Callanan mentioned the characteristics of methane.</p><p>How will the Department use that in how it deals with farming emissions?  That is dangerous, particularly because methane is much more aggressive, some 40 times more, than carbon.  I wonder why Mr. Gleeson raised it.  Is this to suggest that farming is not as bad as it could be?  I would like him to expand on that.</p><p> The timeframe for mitigation which is being discussed is out to 2030, 2040 or whatever.

The important message is that for most drystock farms in Ireland, including in the west and the north west, forestry and beef farming can coexist.  Most beef farms have very low stocking rates.  They have some marginal land that they do not need or that they under-use.  They can raise the same number of beef cattle on their farms and plant trees and make a decent living from the hectarage.  There is an economic aspect to this.  The most effective way to persuade people to do things is to persuade them that it is in their own best interests which is often their economic interest.  It is a message that we have to get out there, and we must get better at doing this.</p></speech>

Most planting is done by farmers.  While much of the narrative is around alternative systems of planting and ownership, most planting is done by farmers.  It is important to recognise that there is a commercial interest in forestry development which, apart from making farms more viable, involves the creation of downstream jobs in places such as Medite and similar processing facilities.  That is an important point.  It is really important that farmers understand that in many cases their current enterprise can coexist with forestry.  There are different models such as the agroforestry schemes, ideas around lower density forestry of deciduous trees and there is also the potential for farmers to have commercial stands of forestry where they will get a 100% establishment grant, a very significant income per hectare over the first 15 years and then they will have the potential to make a commercial income from thinnings. We have to do more on that with farmers.  It is important that farmers engage with this.  Part of the negative narrative around this is that it is not farmers that are engaging with it but that does not stand up to scrutiny.  There is a big forestry inventory which belongs to Coillte but demonstrably farmers are planting most forestry in Ireland.</p></speech>

We generally see lots of smaller side plantations being planted.  As Mr. Gleeson said, it is a part farm approach, with farmers planting part rather than all their farm, so that it is just the marginal land.  Our message for the next five or ten years will be to encourage people to plant the wetter fields of their farm rather than their whole farm.  We have different messages that we need to get out.</p></speech>

We are not hiding from any facts or inventing alternative facts, we are trying to deal with them.

Fundamentally, everything is done with the objective of reducing the rise in temperature.  That is translated into a structure which has given us targets, including national targets.  The Deputy is absolutely correct that the impact of methane is substantially higher.  This is all translated into a global warming potential over a 100-year period.  Methane has equivalence of 25:1 for carbon dioxide.  However, while it has a higher impact, it has a much shorter lifespan, where carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for thousands of years.  The structure is the structure.  The science is evolving in its knowledge of methane but it would make sense that there would be a particular focus on carbon dioxide given that once it is emitted, it remains in the atmosphere for thousands of years.  In the context of methane's impact on warming, if emissions are increasing, then the ratio is much higher than 25:1 - it is up to 100:1.  However, stable emissions are decreasing slightly , it is less than 0.3% and the hypothesis of the work is that it does not have the same warming potential.  I want to be very clear that it is not at a point which is translating into any targets at national level.  I am not advocating on that but raising awareness.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that high nature value land, HNV, as designated in Ireland, collates to our special areas of maturer lands, which is around 11% of our land area.  HNV-type farming is not a designation but rather a type of farming which at an intensity level which is quite low.  We already have measures which are identified in GLAS, for example, where we support that type of farming, such as low-input permanent pasture.  There are approximately 47,000 farmers involved in GLAS and they are being paid for low-input permanent pasture which is indicative of HNV-type agriculture.  As the Secretary General identified, the average stocking rate in large swathes of Ireland are quite low.  We commissioned some work to identify HNV-type farming.  Dr. James Moran in Sligo IT has done a good bit of work in this area.  It is not a designation of land type but it is a type of farming which is quite common in Ireland, particularly in the beef sector.</p></speech>

I want to be careful that I do not bind the hands of anyone in the future.  Carbon taxes are applied in some sectors.  I will not comment whether or not they should but there should be reflection on some considerations if they are to be applied on the agriculture sector.  Traditionally, carbon taxes are applied at the point of consumption, which would be consumers' food.  That would have an impact on consumer prices but not on production practices.  Then there is the question of the impact of a carbon tax being applied on the production sector in Ireland.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith referred to the number of farmers who are in income-vulnerable positions.  There are low-margin farmers.  The tax would impact on farm margins and would take a chunk out of the income subsidies that come from the European Union.  I am not sure whether it would lead to behavioural change because I do not know whether the technological fixes are available to adjust behaviour beyond what we are already trying to do.  It is a policy option, and a tough one, but there are things that must be considered carefully, including its impact on the income of farm incomes and the socioeconomic impact on rural areas.</p></speech>

If 2 cent were put on a litre of milk or 4 cent on a kilogram of beef, as Alan Matthews is suggesting, the assumption is always that the farmer should take the hit.  That needs to change.  The power imbalance in the system is the problem.</p><p>If we were to add the 2 cent and the farmers did not take the hit, the revenue raised could go to other farmers.  The problem is we are tolerating a system under which farmers do not have any power and the plcs have all of it.</p></speech>

Wiser men than me have been trying to deal with it for a long time and trying to improve the system.  One of the things we have done is encourage the establishment of producer groups in the beef sector.  They have certain dispensations from competition rules under the Common Market organisation regulations and the CAP.  We are conscious of this.  Committee members will probably be aware of the regulations being developed in the European Commission on unfair trading practices.  If the issue was easy to deal with it, we would have dealt with it a long time ago.  However, I agree with the general proposition that farmers tend to be price takers, which is not ideal.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and his officials to our meeting, the purpose of which is to consider the Finance Bill 2018.  The Bill was referred to the select committee by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 25 October 2018.  It is proposed that we will adjourn at 10 p.m. and that we will suspended proceedings between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m and between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.  With agreement of the members, depending on progress a short break may be taken at 11.15 a.m.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The meeting will also be suspended for any D&aacute;il votes.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  In order to provide for the smooth running of the meeting, any Deputy acting in substitution for a committee member should formally notify the clerk now if he or she has not done so.  Divisions on the Bill will be taken as they arise.  Members attending the meeting in accordance with Standing Order 95(3) should be aware that, pursuant to Standing Orders, he or she may move his of her amendments but may not participate in the votes on them.  We will now proceed to section 1.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.252" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#B00600"><p>I move amendment No. 1:</p><blockquote>In page 8, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:&ldquo;(3) Within 6 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall produce a report on the benefit of abolishing the  universal social charge on all income below &euro;90,000 and replacing it with 4 new income tax bands for income earned between, &euro;100,000 and &euro;140,000; &euro;140,000 and &euro;180,000; &euro;180,000 and &euro;250,000; and over &euro;250,000.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>The Comptroller and Auditor General recently produced a report which confirmed something that some of us have been saying for a long time, namely, that the richest people in Ireland do not pay their fair share of taxes.  He revealed the quite astonishing fact that 90 high-net worth individuals, defined as people whose average income is in excess of &euro;50 million a year - a tidy sum for those who earn that money - paid less tax than the average worker.  He cited loopholes, tax allowances and so on as the mechanisms by means of which some of the richest people pay less tax than the average worker.  One can imagine how that would stick in the craw of the average worker.  Coming from a source like the Comptroller and Auditor General is a serious fact that is difficult to dispute.</p><p>It comes on top of the fact that Ireland's income distribution is one of the most unequal in the western world.  It changes after social transfers but in the basic distribution of income there is a shocking level of inequality in the distribution of income.  We must begin to discuss, therefore, making the very wealthy in our society pay their fair share of tax.  In our alternative budget submission we have a whole range of measures in different areas, but this one relates to income tax.  The USC has been a punitive austerity tax for low and middle income workers and it cannot continue to be justified.  If what we see as punitive taxes on workers are to be removed, which would be justified, the money needs to be found elsewhere.</p><p>We emphasise that we believe in balanced budgets and one of the measures we propose to provide a balance is to have a whole series of new bands of taxation for people on the highest earnings in excess of &euro;100,000.  Our specific proposal is that people who earn between &euro;100,000 and &euro;140,000 would pay a rate of 50%, those who earn between &euro;140,000 and &euro;180,000 would pay a rate of 55%, those who earn between &euro;180,000 and &euro;250,000 would pay 60%, while those who earn in excess of &euro;250,000 would pay 65%, on the earnings over those amounts.  I should add that those people would benefit from our proposals to abolish the USC for earnings less than that as well as the abolition of property tax, for example.  On the earnings that are in excess of the figures I mentioned, however, they would pay much higher rates of tax.</p><p>While they might seem radical to the Minister and many in the D&aacute;il, it is worth saying that those levels of taxation on high income were not unusual for much of the post-war period.  The most successful period of expansion of western capitalism, for want of a better word, was probably in the post-war period when there were taxes of that sort on wealth.  The corollary of having those higher taxes on wealth was the provision of a welfare state.  Expansions in public housing, improvements in access to education and the provision of the health service and so on in much of the western world were based on the wealthy paying higher taxes.  More money was available for universal access to third-level education, more public transport, more public housing and national health services.  We are an outlier in European terms in the way we tax wealth and income.  It is not surprising in that context that we have the sort of crises we face in the very areas where a fair tax system would provide the revenue, namely, health, housing, education, infrastructure and so on.  All of these things are creaking at the seams, crumbling or in severe crises because, in essence, the rich do not pay their taxes.</p><p>This amendment seeks to require us at least to have a serious debate about these issues and about what the potential impact would be of moving in this direction.  The Minister will say the rich will scream and run out of the country and the economy will go down the tubes if we dare to ask them to pay a little extra tax, but I do not buy that for one minute.  We costed this proposal with the Department and, according to the Minister's response to a parliamentary question, these measures would raise &euro;2 billion, which is a tidy sum, to help shift the unequal distribution of wealth in Irish society, which is a fair and reasonable thing to do.  It would not impoverish the people who would have to pay these taxes and they would still be well off but it would begin to challenge the significant inequalities in wealth that exist in our society.  On that basis, it is a fair and reasonable measure to consider.</p></speech>

There are a considerable number of issues with the Deputies' proposal, namely, the cost to the Exchequer, the erosion of our tax base, increased complexity of our tax system and an impact on the competitiveness of our national tax code.  The Deputies' have not specified the income tax rates that would apply under the proposal they are putting forward, but it is estimated that the removal of the application of the USC on incomes below &euro;90,000, as suggested, would cost in the region of &euro;2 billion in a single year.  Assuming no other policy changes to the structure of the charges, it is likely the new income tax bands would need to be as high as 71.25% to raise the same level of revenue for the Exchequer and ensure this is a cost-neutral proposal.  In the event of this being levied as USC, the rates could be as high as 76%.  Neither of these estimations takes account of any behavioural change that could result from any significant increase in marginal rates of taxation.</p><p>To introduce any higher rate would increase the marginal rate of tax.  High marginal tax rates have an effect on behaviour and could also harm our international competitiveness.</p><p> The considerable progress that has been made in recent years in restoring our economy cannot be taken for granted, particularly in light of current challenges in the international arena.  Introducing a USC exemption for all those earning up to &euro;1,700 per week would have a considerable effect on our tax base.  The current exemption threshold is &euro;13,000 per annum and it is now estimated that 28% of all income earners will not be liable for USC in 2019.  To further increase this entry threshold to &euro;90,000 would exempt over 90% of income earners from USC.  This would significantly narrow the income tax base and expose our economy to significant risk in the event of a future economic downturn.  We have a very progressive personal income tax system that plays a crucial role in the process of income redistribution.  Our redistributive tax system has recently been acknowledged by the IMF, the OECD and the ESRI.  Deputies will be aware that during the economic crisis and the period before it, we reached a point where 45% of all income earners were exempt from income tax.  That was not sustainable.  It placed an unfair burden on those earners who were contributing to the income tax base and exposed the vulnerability of the income tax system to economic shocks.  It is my view that a broad-based progressive income tax system where the majority make some contribution according to their means is the most fair and sustainable income tax system in the long term.  The Deputies' proposal could also introduce considerable complexity to the tax code.  We would go from a two-rate system to either a five or six-rate system.  This would be a considerable additional complexity.  It could, in turn, lead to an even more complicated system of taxation.  Against a background where we have a partially individualised system, a multi-rate band income tax structure along the lines proposed would be very complex to design and operate.  Having regard to all these issues, there is no need to carry out a further analysis of the proposal outlined by the Deputies.  For this reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

As a result, I will not labour the point too much.  I do not buy the complexity argument one bit.  One could not get anything more complex than some of the stuff that is in this Finance Bill.  When one looks at some of the reliefs, formulas and equations that we have for various aspects of our tax code it seems we have a very competent Revenue Commissioners and Department of Finance that can do this.  I am absolutely amazed every year just looking at the work that goes into it and the complexity of it and the difficulty of getting one's head around it but it all works as it is supposed to most of the time.  Things get tweaked and tightened up and that is part of what we do but the idea that it is just too complicated to tax the wealthy is ridiculous.  I do not buy that for one second.</p> <p>  The Minister stated that there may be behavioural consequences for people on these very high earnings if one was to levy these kinds of tax rates on them.  That is possible, although when one looks at the behaviour of many of these high-net-worth individuals even as it stands, one sees that their loyalty to the country is minimal.  In many cases, they are tax refugees based elsewhere.  They do not want to pay tax and do not believe in paying tax.  I do not think we should pander to these kind of people who have absolutely no care at all about the consequences for Irish society of people as wealthy as them not paying tax.  I do not really buy that.  It is essentially saying the rich have us over a barrel.  If we dare to touch their wealth, they will sabotage the economy.  I do not think we should accept that approach.  There would be positive behavioural consequences as a result of our proposals were they to be implemented, which is that ordinary working people who tend not to be tax refugees because they live and work here and spend their money here and will not move whatever is done to them, actually contribute.  The more income they have, the more it contributes to the domestic economy and the high street in their localities.  There might be some behavioural changes on one end of the spectrum but they would be easily outweighed by the positive impact of people having more money in their pockets and actually contributing to the real economy here.</p> <p>  I also think it would deal with a lot of the concerns the Minister might have about tax bases and so on because the more ordinary workers have income, the more it generally feeds into the cycle of money going into the economy.  It results in more economic activity and that generates revenue at a range of levels for the Exchequer.  I do not really accept the Minister's argument but I know he is not likely to be swayed by my opinion on this.  Nonetheless, I think it is important to have these debates.  One of the unfortunate features of the past 25 or 30 years and what I see as the neoliberal revolution is that certain political and economic debates which used to be had stopped being had.  It was assumed that neoliberalism and that particular approach to organising an economy was the only game in town.  I remember debating with Senator McDowell's brother, the economist.  I forget his first name.</p></speech>

He pointed out that after the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989, they stopped doing comparative economics.  We do not debate alternatives any more.  I think that is wrong.  When one looks at the state of the global economy generally and the crises we have had recently, the idea we do not discuss alternatives is wrong and will lead us into trouble.  It has led us into trouble.  We need to debate these alternatives and that is why I put the amendment forward but I do not expect I will get the support of the Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#C00500"><p>I understand the principle behind the amendment.  The Deputy has raised a very important issue, particularly in the context of his reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which shows that high-net-worth individuals are calculated by Revenue as those with assets of more than &euro;50 million.  I think it is significant to say that is high compared with how other jurisdictions do it where they have a far lower threshold.  It is fair to say that it was a shocking report for many members of the public because it shows that 90 of those individuals were paying less income tax than a person on an average income.  We know they did it not as a result of the rates of tax but as a result of different measures which were introduced in previous Finance Bills, many of which are being expanded in this Bill.  There are good intentions behind them but it results in high-net-worth individuals being able to write off their tax, whether by using capital allowance or write-offs of business investment or other measures which reduce their effective tax rate to below what they are actually paying their tax planner in the first instance.</p> <p>  The problem with the amendment is that increasing the rate does not deal with the issue I have outlined.  It is other parts we need to deal with if we genuinely want to tackle that and it is something we need to do.  I would like to see a report on how we can ensure that high net worth individuals are paying a fair share of tax notwithstanding the general need for some of these schemes to be in place.  For example, I am not arguing that we get rid of capital allowance if carrying forward loss or investment in business.  These are proper things.  When one has &euro;50 million worth of assets and one is paying less tax than somebody who works in the local hairdressers or Tesco is paying, there is something seriously wrong.</p> <p>  The proposal from the Deputy is not the right one.  Suggesting that those in the top 10% of income earners, which would be the &euro;90,000 bracket, would not pay USC for the income they earn up to that is not appropriate.</p><p>What we need to do is to increase the taxation base overall.  The revenue needs to come from those with higher incomes so we can provide additional services.  The proposal is not the right one and my party would not support it, notwithstanding the fact that I recognise the Deputy has raised a genuine issue regarding how we deal with the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p> I agree completely with Deputy Boyd Barrett that the Minister's argument on the complexity of the tax code is not a real argument.  We have argued for a third rate of tax and we will continue to do so.  Ours is not a tax-neutral position because it would actually bring in more tax, with a view to ensuring we can provide decent services to deal with the issues bearing down so heavily on ordinary families.  Families are at their wit's end.  They are working their socks off day in, day out.  At the end of the week, they simply do not have enough or anything to put by.  They are struggling because of high costs, including the costs of childcare, rent, trying to get on the housing ladder, basic survival and car insurance.  All these costs are bearing down heavily on people and that is why we need to raise additional income tax revenue.</p><p> I do not support the Minister's point.  The complexity in the tax code does not represent a genuine argument.  There are numerous rates of PRSI, for example.  We are well equipped to introduce other rates of taxation if we wish.  I agree that if one raises taxes to a certain level, there will be a behaviour shift.  This comes down to judgment.  The last thing we want to do is move income offshore.  Therefore, it comes down to determining the rate.  If one taxed people at 90% or 80%, of course there would be an immediate impact, but there is sufficient scope for those at the higher end to pay additional tax.  When I talk about the higher end, I mean the 3% with individual incomes above &euro;100,000.</p><p> I do not want to elaborate any further.  The amendment is coming from the right place but it is completely the wrong idea to abolish the USC.  The first part of this amendment is nearly identical to what Fianna F&aacute;il proposed during the last general election campaign.  It would have cost us billions of euro and we would have had a huge hole in our public finances as a result.  Introducing income tax rates will not deal with the issue.  While we are proposing an increase in an income tax rate, it does not deal with the issue in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p> Introducing an income tax rate is not the most efficient or the best way of capturing the wealth.  We know the USC is better because it taxes not only PAYE income and the income of the self-employed but also other sorts of income.  For these reasons, we will not be supporting the amendment.</p></speech>

A point Deputy Boyd Barrett made with which I completely agree is that we are not open to debating options.  By comparison with extremes that are currently being debated, what he has put forward could be seen as the kind of conventional left-wing policy of recent years.  We have been afraid to debate options.  We got ourselves into a place in which a form of politics has been put forward that suggests there is no choice other than to do what we are now doing.  I reject that completely.  That is the wrong way to conduct politics.  Despite what the Deputy and others on the committee might feel, I am not a neoliberal.  I believe in taxation.  I believe tax is a contribution all of us should make to society and we should be open to having debates on that.</p> <p>  I differ from the Deputy on a domestic matter, which I will highlight in a moment.  I will also refer to what Deputy Pearse Doherty said in this regard.  A fundamental area of difference between Deputy Boyd Barrett and me concerns the behavioural piece but I believe there is a broader piece regarding the kind of economy we are in.  In the period in which the Deputy anchors his argument - the so-called golden era of the post-World War 2 period - there was much lower integration of international economies with the global economy than there is now.  Labour markets were far less integrated.  Capital flows were far less integrated.  The process of European economic integration was significantly less advanced than it is now.  That is a reason the Deputy's proposition would not work for the Irish economy.  The Irish economy is now operating in a completely different place than in the period to which the Deputy referred.  Medium-sized companies with which I engage quickly reach a point where they want to diversify and employ people.  Even for these companies, the manner in which our tax rates stack up by comparison with those elsewhere is far more important now than a number of decades ago.  The notion of competitiveness, in which I anchor many of my arguments, reflects the fact that we are more integrated than we were in the past.  It is just an area of difference between the two of us.</p> <p>  Regarding the argument I put forward, Deputies Boyd Barrett and Pearse Doherty touched on complexity.  The point on complexity was the last point I made.  Both Deputies are correct that the Irish public administration is capable of doing really complex things.  The complexity argument was one of the latter arguments I made but it was not the key argument.  The key argument I made has two policy anchors.  The first is based on the fact that I do not believe it is appropriate that a large number of taxpayers make no contribution at all.  Second, it is my strong view that there would be behavioural and competitiveness consequences as a result of what the Deputy is proposing that would damage our economy.  It is for that key reason I do not support it but I agree with him that we should be far more willing to have a debate and not demonise views, as has happened in the past.</p></speech>

The proposal concerns the USC and the gradual reduction of the tax base.  The benefit for someone on an average income would be very minor.  We know when we look at the package of tax cuts that it takes &euro;284 million out of the tax base this year.  That is money that is needed to deal with the issues I raised earlier.  It is needed to deal with some of the serious pressures weighing down on ordinary people.  There are two ways of thinking about this.  First, should we give as many people as are covered money back - in some cases &euro;1 per week and in other cases &euro;6 per week?  Second, do we try to deal with some of the sources that are pressurising people in dealing with a more ambitious programme, such as a programme concerning childcare or basic costs, be they insurance costs or the costs of utility bills, or concerning rent relief or renters who are paying the highest rents in the history of the State?  We heard this morning driving in here that a family becomes homeless every eight hours.  I have a different approach.  While the measure in section 2 is part of a wider package of tax proposals, the reality cannot be ignored that, in the past three budgets involving Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, tax cuts in the order of &euro;750 million have been made.</p><p>The reality cannot be lost that over the last three budgets between Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il &euro;750 million of tax cuts have taken place.  That is at a time wehn we are seeting record numbers on hospital trolleys, the highest ever numbers in the hisotry of the State, when we have the highest number of people on wiating lists in the history of the State, when we have the highest number of families in the history of the State without a place to call home and who are in emergency accommodation, and when numerous children with special needs are waiting for a diagnosis while their paretns are at their wit's end in terms of the concern that their child will not reach their full potential because they cannot get access to a service that should be availble so their child's condfition would be diagnosed and they would ahve the wraparound supports they deserve in order to meet their full potential.  That is where we signifciantly differ on this.  In the past the Ministre has made argumetns thta the tax take is increasing, as a pot, but that was exactly the same thjing that happened during the Charlie McCreevy era.  We cut income tax to a point that was unsustainable and Charlie McCreevy and the PDs, who were driving that agenda at the time, were able to say that the tax take was increasing, which it was.  It was increasing because we had a high level of employment but it was also because we had other sources of tax, namely, stamp duty, that provided a cushion for the public finances at that time.  We are in a very similar position.  What has been done in recent years is a hollowing out of the tax base, which is reducing to an unsustainable base, in my view.  It is mirrored by the fact that whjile we are not at full employment we have a larger number of our people in employment and, therefore, the tax take is increasing, and we have corporation taxes that are at a record high, and very signficantly higher than the percentage taxation take in our European competitors.  There is a danger here.  I sat in this room during the banking inquiry, when there were two very distinct issues.  Obviously, there was the recklessness of the bankers and all of the policies that surrouned that, which we will not go into, but there was also another issue.  Two crashes took place, one of hwich was a fiscal crash.  During that period, the State and the Gvoernment reduced income taxes to a point that was unsustainble.  We saw clearly what had to happen.  When the tide went out, it was very clear that, as Deputy Noonan used to say, we were swimming naked.  That was the problem.  There is a danger here that if we continue on this trajectory, we will be in the same positoin.  I have serious concerns in ergard to what we are diong in terms of a fiscal point of view but I also believe that the tax packaage does not deal with the source of the pressure that is on people at this point in tmie.  That tax is already gobbled up by increases in energy, insurnce, rent, child care and all of those issues.  While it migth feel good for people to hear they are getting &euro;1 or &euro;5 back every week, depending on their income, the realtiy is that this time next year they are not going to feel any better becayuse the sources of the pressure that aer ensuring they are strugglnig to get by   I am not talking about poeople who are on low incomes but about teachers who are in the sysetm for ten, 12 or 13 years, people who have two incoomes conming into the house but who still feel that despite the fact they are working full-time, sometimes in the public sector and private sector combined, they aer still not able to have that rainy day fund.  This is the wrong approach, in my view, and that is why I oppose section 2.  Despite the fact it is a very small tax giveaway, it needs to be looked at in the collective.  I ask the Minister, given it did not appar in his speech, what is the current position in regard to USC.  Although his party had posters about abolishing the USC, I undersatnd that is no longer the case, and that Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party have also ditched that pre-election promise.  The qusetion is what is teh current position.  The latest position we had from Governmetn was at budget time last year, when it was going to be merged with PRSI.  However, we have no paper on that or no announcement on budget day as to what is happening, and all we have is, again, just a redduction of USC.  Is there some long-term thinking in this regard, given there is an issue?  When one looks at taxation, in particular taxation on income, where we are completly out of kilter is in regadr to PRSI.  That is where our rates are below </p><p>This is at a time when we see record numbers on hospital trolleys, the highest ever in the history of the State, when we have the highest number of people on waiting lists, when we have the highest number of families in emergency accommodation and without a place to call home, and when numerous children with special needs are waiting for a diagnosis while their parents are at their wit's end with concern that their child will not reach their full potential because they cannot get access to a service that should be available so their child's condition would be diagnosed and they would have the wraparound supports they deserve to meet their full potential.  That is where we differ significantly on this.</p><p> In the past the Minister has made arguments that the tax take is increasing, as a pot, but that was exactly the same thing that happened during the Charlie McCreevy era.  We cut income tax to a point that was unsustainable and Charlie McCreevy and the Progressive Democrats, who were driving the agenda at the time, were able to say that the tax take was increasing, which it was.  It was increasing because we had a high level of employment but it was also because we had other sources of tax, for example, stamp duty, that provided a cushion for the public finances at that time.

Obviously, there was the recklessness of the bankers and all the policies that surrounded that, which we will not go into, but there was also another issue.  Two crashes took place, one of which was a fiscal crash.  During that period, the State and the Government reduced income taxes to a point that was unsustainable and we saw clearly what had to happen.  When the tide went out, it was very clear that, as Deputy Noonan used to say, we were swimming naked.  That was the problem.  There is a danger here that if we continue on this trajectory, we will be in the same position.</p><p> While I have serious concerns about what we are doing from a fiscal point of view, I also believe the tax package does not deal with the source of the pressure that is on people at this point in time.  That tax is already gobbled up by increases in the cost of energy, insurance, rent, childcare and all those issues.  While it might feel good for people to hear they are getting &euro;1 or &euro;5 back every week, depending on their income, the reality is that, this time next year, they are not going to feel any better because the sources of the pressure that ensure they are struggling to get by will remain.  I am not talking only about people on low incomes but about teachers who are in the system for ten, 12 or 13 years and people with two incomes coming into the house but who still feel that, despite the fact they are working full-time, sometimes in the public sector and private sector combined, they are still not able to have that rainy day fund.  This is the wrong approach, which is why I oppose section 2.</p><p> Despite the fact this is a very small tax giveaway, it needs to be looked at in the collective.

Where I agree with Deputy Pearse Doherty is that the provisions in section 2 are very modest, undoubtedly, although they represent further progress in terms of the third budget under the confidence and supply agreement.  We have to acknowledge the fact incomes are rising for many people and the CSO figures to the end of the second quarter of this year show incomes rose by 3.3%.  If the Minister does nothing, more of people's income will move up through the USC bands and the same principle applies to income tax, so people will end up paying up more tax.  That is not fair at a time when the economy is going well and while people deserve some relief, the relief here is very modest.  What these changes do not do is result in more people being exempt from USC.  The entry point remains the same, which is a principle we support, and the benefit of this is capped at income of &euro;70,000.</p> <p>  It should be acknowledged that while the USC was a tax introduced during the emergency, it was an amalgam of the old income levy and health levy, although it was more than that and was higher than the combined effect of both of those.  It is important that the burden is eased.  USC is paid not just by workers but by pensioners too.  This is a modest change.  Where I agree with Deputy Pearse Doherty is on where the real pressures are for people, for example, cost of living expenses, principally accommodation costs.  We all know the direction rents are going in and there are also mortgage costs, insurance costs, energy and utility bills, and so on.  There is a need for a renewed focus on all those issues.  This is a very gradual, modest change in USC, with a focus on low and middle incomes.  As a party, that is something we support.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.269" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#E00500"><p>Thank you.</p> <p>  On section 2, I find myself facing criticism in regard to these changes from two competing schools of thought.  The first would say this budget has too little in terms of tax changes and the other would say I should not do anything at all in regard to tax reduction and reform for people on low to middle incomes.  I will comment on each school of thought.  For those who contend I should do more and should have brought in bigger changes, we have been down that path before.  We have been down the path where a massive tax change is put in place, people feel instantly better off the next day and we then find out over the passage of a number of years that it is not affordable.  At other points in the economic and political cycle, what has happened is that the resources of the State have been used to put in place income tax and social welfare packages that are many multiples of what this budget has put forward.</p><p>The figures that came out of the Wright report, that looked at some of the issues  Deputy Pearse Doherty touched on, on the combined value of the tax and social welfare packages at comparable points in the economic cycle versus where we are now were between &euro;1.6 billion and &euro;2.5 billion.  The combined value of the tax and social welfare packages for the last two budgets I have done, including this one, has been between &euro;800 million and &euro;900 million.  To those who argue that I should do more, which, in fairness, nobody here has argued but which has been argued elsewhere, my response is that we have gone down that path previously, it clearly did not end well, and if one looks at where we are in terms of income growth within the economy, modest tax changes that are highly focused combined with income growth that is happening in the economy has the potential to have an effect on people's take-home pay, and I believe that is happening.  To those who would argue that I should not do anything at all, which is nearer what Deputy Pearse Doherty has advocated in terms of him not agreeing that I should have made these changes, I would say in response that if I had not made those changes I would be accused of bringing in stealth charges through the income tax code and the USC code.  What is happening is that as people earn more, they are moving up through our tax brackets, particularly when they make the transition from part-time work or what had been low-income work to full-time work on a higher level of income due to wage growth that is happening in the economy.  I have tried to put together a proposition that concentrates tax relief on those areas of our economy that, I believe, otherwise would face even more pressure due to incomes going up and more jobs being retained.</p><p> What I have done is very different from what happened previously in two respects.  First, none of the changes I made has influenced the thresholds of USC, income tax and PRSI and the entry point into each of those three collection systems is unchanged.  Any of the changes I made will not result in fewer people paying tax, which is what happened in the past during this point in the economic cycle.  I have ensured that the entry points into those three different codes are unchanged.</p><p> Second, as we have gone through this period in the economic cycle, I have removed tax changes that happened elsewhere with exactly the view of broadening the tax base.  This is why I made changes last year in stamp duty and the VAT rate.  These are the kind of changes that at other points in our recent economy history did not happen where reliefs were brought in and were left in place and when the economy started to do well again, they were not reversed and we ended up with an impaired tax base.  As I understand it, Deputy Pearse Doherty wants to abolish the local property tax, which many would argue is one of the most conventional ways of broadening the tax base.</p><p> For all those reasons, I would reject entirely the view that anything I am doing here is consistent with what has happened in the past.  The combined value of the income tax changes reflects the fact that we have an economy that, from an income point of view, for many although not for all, is doing well to okay.</p><p> In terms of the other pressures Deputies have touched on which I acknowledge are having a big effect on people's living standards, for instance, childcare, that is the reason we made the second year of progress in the affordable childcare scheme.  I note the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, has been in front of this committee on a number of occasions outlining the work of the Government on insurance and there is some evidence, at least in relation to medical premia, that progress has been made in terms of them stabilising.  I hope in time we will see further changes there.  I am as aware as any Deputy around the table of the effect of rent costs on people's living standards.  We have brought in rent pressure zones to deal with this issue.  More needs to be done in this area.  This is why we have put in place measures to increase the supply of rental accommodation as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.271" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#F00200"><p>The points I make here are identical to those I would make in opposition to section 3 and I will not repeat them.  Both relate to the tax package.  While acknowledged that the tax package in the context of the overall budget is not huge, we are in a position where we still do not have a balanced budget and we need to look at what are the resources.  The Minister compared the McCreevy budgets with the budgets he delivered over the past two years.  It is like comparing apples and oranges given that Mr. McCreevy was running quite large surpluses and under the fiscal rules we must achieve a structural balance, etc.  Even within those constraints, over the past three years there has been &euro;0.75 billion of tax cuts.  I would argue that is not the most efficient or best way to deal with the problems people have at present.  Median disposal wages has increased by 8% since 2012 and yet, according to Daft, rents have increased by 60% and house prices have increased by 40% in the same period.</p> <p>  The Minister spoke of insurance.  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy's reports are not going anywhere.  I was talking to a businessperson who employs local people in a rural part of the country whose insurance premium was &euro;32,000 three years ago and is over &euro;120,000 now.  Others, who are in the haulage sector, talked about a loading which has been put onto them because of accidents that are being contested, and even after these are successfully contested the loading is still put on them.  It is a rigged system.  It is not only pressurising individual consumers in terms of car insurance but it is also a serious challenge, particularly small and medium-sized businesses throughout the country.  There is no light at the end of the tunnel unless the Minister wants to show the reports, which are not going anywhere.  That is the reality.</p> <p>  We still do not have a fraud unit in the Garda.  We all agree fraudulent claims need to be prosecuted but we still do not have a unit.  These are some of the basic solutions that could be applied.  One of the bright ideas from the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, when he was Minister of State, was that the industry should fund the fraud squad.  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, does not agree with that.  The State should fund a fraud squad on insurance.  That would be one of the better ways to spend some of the money.</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, talked about childcare.  The childcare package here has already been gobbled up in increases.  The problem is it is not sufficient or ambitious enough to deal with the pressures that people are feeling today.</p> <p>  There is a risk, when one looks at this package collectively.  There is a risk that the tide may go out and we will be left exposed because we have reduced taxation to a point.  What is missing from all this is an indication from us, as a finance committee, of where this is going.  That is the point I made earlier to the Minister which we still do not have any answers to.  If we continue to go through Finance Bills, one after another, which continue in the same trajectory of reducing personal income taxes to a point at which, I believe, they will become unsustainable, we will be at a serious danger point.  There is no indication.  In fairness to Fianna F&aacute;il, it is clear it wants to continuously reduce the USC.  It is aligned with its policy of abolishing USC up to a certain point.  However, we do not know where the Government stands.  Is this merely another part?  Will next year see more so that in a couple of years' time, we will see that it is not &euro;0.75 billion but &euro;2 billion that we will have taken out of personal tax?  That is not sustainable.  It is also not the right course of action.</p> <p>  I raised the following question, which the Minister did not reference.  What is happening with USC?  Will he continue to reduce it or is it being merged with PRSI, and when are we likely to see any paper on a policy proposal that was announced over a year ago?</p></speech>

He has said that the effect of my budgets and policies is the same as the effect of what happened in the period in question.  Deputy Doherty has made that charge against me previously.  I appreciate that he is now acknowledging that there are significant differences.  On the question of any future imbalances we might create, I would like to go back to a point I have made previously.  As I understand it, the Deputy is in favour of the abolition of the local property tax.  In the past, the Deputy has quoted many commentators and economists who would consider the local property tax to be an example of the kind of tax broadening we need to facilitate.  I understand the Deputy is also saying we should borrow more.</p></speech>

I am very happy to debate them with him.  The Deputy is happy to advocate that more borrowing should take place.  Others, including those who advise the Government, are saying that at this point in the economic cycle we should be looking to reduce borrowing rather than add to it.  I am saying all of this in response to the Deputy's point about how what we are doing compares with what was done in the past.  He mentioned that the combined impact of recent tax changes has been between &euro;700 million and &euro;800 million.  We went through a cycle in which tax changes of between &euro;700 million and &euro;800 million were made in a single budget.  That is not what is happening here.  My objective is that the combined effect of the various budgets I am introducing will deliver a cumulative effect that helps people in our society and our economy.  The combined impact of the move in the standard rate cut-off point across two budgets has been &euro;1,500.  That kind of contribution can make a difference to people on the relevant income levels.  There is ongoing work on the objective of integrating the USC and PRSI.  I want to ensure any paper I publish sets out various options for doing this.  I am working on that at the moment.  We have to look at some key issues.  Under the current USC and PRSI regime, different kinds of incomes are taxed differently and people are taxed differently at different stages of their life cycles.  We are analysing such issues at the moment.</p></speech>

It seems from the points he made about Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendment that Sinn F&eacute;in is falling into a bit of a trap that has been set by the Government and by right-wing commentators.  It is playing into the idea that those who are seen as left-wing and progressive stand for substantial rates of taxation on middle-income earners.  The point we should be getting at is that the big income is in the top 3%, the top 10% or the corporations.  That is where the money is there to be raised.  It is important from the point of view of solidarity to be with workers who understandably hate the USC, hate the context in which it was introduced - it was supposed to be an emergency measure - and want to see it abolished.  Obviously, this section of the Bill is completely inadequate.  We could oppose it on the basis that it should go much further and should involve the abolition of the USC, but we are in favour of it on the basis that it is a tiny step in the right direction.  The problem is that the measures with which it is combined do not do the things we think they should do.  I understand the point that is made in response, which is that the USC is a particularly good way of capturing income.  While I accept that, I suggest that the alternative is to use the USC model to provide for a social charge that kicks in above a high level of income, as opposed to a universal social charge.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.278" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#G00700"><p>I would like to make a couple of final points about this section of the Bill.  We are dealing with where we are now.  That is the context in which we have to judge this legislation.  I agree with Deputy Paul Murphy.  It can be seen in our alternative budget that we have advocated for additional taxation from higher incomes.  We want a real property tax that is not just a tax on family homes.  A real property tax would start to deal with the issue that was raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett earlier.  It would be a wealth tax that would deal with different forms of assets and not just the family home.  I want to make it clear that the tax which is proposed in the legislation we have published would include property and homes.  We want to abolish the family home tax, which is paid by many people who are in negative equity and have serious debt as a result of having property, and replace it with a real net wealth tax.</p> <p>  The Minister picked up on what I said about apples and oranges.  My point is that the things he is doing are the same as, or similar to, those that were done by Charlie McCreevy some years ago.  The difference is that he was doing it at a time of surplus.  Therefore, his giveaways were bigger than those of this Government, which is operating at a time of deficit.  That is the context in which I spoke about apples and oranges.  At least the Minister understands that he is following the same trajectory as Mr. McCreevy, albeit at a different scale because of the restrictions we face at present.</p> <p>  The Minister knows that it is not inappropriate to borrow to service a country, as long as that borrowing is not above a certain level.  Under the European fiscal rules, a balanced budget is a budget with a structural balance of 0.5%.  This recognises that a balanced budget is not a balanced budget as one might have in a household, where income must balance with expenditure.  I know why the Minister has made his remarks about borrowing.  It is an easy giveaway.  He developed or designed a budget that was based on a 0.1% deficit.  Our alternative proposal, which met the structural deficit requirement, involved an Exchequer deficit of 0.2%.  In light of where we are at in the context of the information that came with the White Paper, questions can be asked about whether there will be any deficit under the Government's budget next year.  It is likely that it will be in surplus.  Similarly, if we were to implement our proposals, it would be in surplus as well.  Extra money has become available which was not available to the Opposition when we were designing our alternative budget.  The actual reality is that when we had the figures at the time, we thought that our alternative budget, on which we engaged with the fiscal advisory council, would involve a deficit of 0.2%.  In light of the announcement in the White Paper, it is likely that neither the Government's budget nor our alternative budget would require borrowing next year.  That is the reality.</p> <p>  When the Taoiseach was seeking to be elected as leader of the Fine Gael Party early last year, he announced that PRSI reform would be one of his election proposals.  This means that we are a year and a half into the process.  However, we do not yet have an indication of what will be done.  I understand that it is deeply complex to get one's head around PRSI.  It is challenging to merge the USC, which is simpler, with PRSI, but I do not think it is so challenging that it should take a year or a year and a half.  I do not think it is so challenging that we cannot be given an indication of when we will see where it is going.  The point I am making is underpinned by the requirement on us to deal with taxation not in a piecemeal fashion but along a wider trajectory.  We need to know where we think taxation should be in five years.  The committee might not agree on this matter, but it is important to understand the need to consider it.  The point I made earlier was that if the &euro;300 million reduction in the USC and in income tax this year is followed by a &euro;400 million reduction next year and so on, an extra &euro;5 billion will be taken out over the next five years.  Maybe something different is planned.  The idea that we should proceed year by year, depending on the resources that are available to us or the political or fiscal pressures we are facing at the time, is the wrong approach.</p><p>We should have a long-term, collective view if possible.  It is important that the Government states its view as to where this is heading.  This is where we are completely in the dark.  We need a statement from the Minister in this regard.  While he does not have the paper and he wants to ensure that all the figures are accurate and so on, we also need to get an indication of whether we are going to see it this year.  Will we see it next year?  Will it be in the first quarter or the fourth quarter?  Is it going to be in the budget next year?  Is there any indication of when we are going to see some type of proposal?  This is a complex matter and it needs to be teased out.  It should be teased out over a sufficient period and, as the Minister stated in his very welcome opening comments, with all relevant opinions obtained.  Such opinions should be shared and we should get this right.  We may disagree at the end of the day but we have all raised valid points.</p></speech>

I have always accepted the validity of other parties and the views they put forward.  I have also always been very clear in spelling out that some of what has been advocated would be very dangerous for the economy and our society.  I am aware that some of this will continue into section 3 and I am conscious of how we are managing our time.  We can pick up some of these matters then.</p> <p>  With regard to the timing for me publishing a paper, or the options for USC and PRSI, the issue I have to deal with is that the amalgamation of all of this affects 2.5 million different income earners and &euro;7 billion worth of income.  There are a number of options being developed by my Department in respect of doing it.  I expect it would probably take me the rest of this year to complete this work and to evaluate it before I come forward with some options.  When the debate on this Finance Bill is concluded is the point at which I will put forward some options on it.</p></speech>

I wish to raise the question of whether there is an under-claiming of that credit.  I have raised this issue in the past by means of parliamentary questions to the Minister and with Revenue.  The reply has been along the lines that Revenue provides this credit automatically where it has sufficient information to do so.  When one considers the overall figures, however, the number of people who claimed the credit last year was just under 86,000 families but the CSO data around the number of family units where one parent is staying at home to care for children is in the region of 147,000 families.  I am aware that we cannot compare them directly because we do not know the income of those 147,000 families, one does not know if there is a tax liability that can be sheltered by the home carer tax credit, and low income families may not have sufficient income to generate a tax bill that could be sheltered by this credit.  From dealing with this issue in my area and from the queries raised with me, I get the sense that there are people who are entitled to this credit who are not claiming it.  They are not claiming it because they are not aware of it.  There are cases where the tax credit is not being automatically granted where those people are entitled to it.  This is the purpose of raising the issue; to try to establish if more could be done by Revenue to give the credit automatically where people are entitled to it, and whether to raise awareness of the existence of this credit.</p><p>I welcome the increase in the credit to &euro;1,500.  A &euro;300 increase is significant and very welcome.  For families that are more or less dependent on one income, it is of significant benefit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#H02200"><p>The amendment would provide for a report to be laid on the proportion of people who are eligible for the home carer's tax credit, but who are not in receipt of the credit and ways in which the take-up of the credit can be improved.  I do not believe that the compiling of such a report is necessary and I also do not believe that the take-up of the tax credit is low.  For 2016, the most recent year for which data is available, 85,900 taxpayers received either the full credit or the partial credit at a cost of &euro;78 million.  I am aware of media reports about the home carer's tax credit and the suggestion that a large number of families do not avail of it.  I would point out, however, that 85,900 is the estimated number of people who would benefit from the increase.  This contrasts with data from Revenue that indicate some 131,000 families claimed the credit in 2016.  As a result, it is not accurate to suggest that people are not aware of their entitlements.  There are genuine reasons that people may not have been able to use the credit.  It could, for example, be the case that potential claimants' entitlements to other tax credits were sufficient to reduce their tax liability to nil without the need to avail of the home carer tax credit.</p><p>It is very likely that that is the key reason there is a gap between the CSO figures to which Deputy Michael McGrath referred and the figures I am sharing here.</p><p> Revenue estimates that the number of claimants in this position was 47,000 in 2014, 44,000 in 2015 and 45,000 in 2016.  Furthermore, in some circumstances, it may be more beneficial for a family to claim the increased standard rate band for two income families which is an alternative to the home carer credit.  The administration of the tax code is a matter for Revenue but I have been advised that the Revenue contacts PAYE taxpayers to remind them that there is a four year time limit for claiming additional tax credits and reliefs.</p><p> For example, in late 2017, letters issued to all PAYE taxpayers who had not claimed additional credits or reliefs from 2013 to 2017, reminding them that they may be entitled to make a claim on or before 31 December 2017.  An additional 291 claims were made for the home carer tax credit following the issue of this letter.  Similar letters will issue this year.</p><p> Furthermore, the Revenue prepopulates the annual tax returns of self-assessed taxpayers with the home carer tax credit where it was claimed in the previous years.  Revenue also automatically grants the home carer tax credit where it identifies eligible persons whose circumstances indicate that they would benefit from the credit.</p><p> Regarding the substantial &euro;300 increase in the home carer tax credit I announced in budget 2019, this information is included in Revenue's summary budget leaflet, published on its website, and it was announced in the Government's highly publicised Budget Statement, as it has been for the past four budgets.</p><p> For these reasons, I am satisfied that everything has already been done to ensure that everyone gets the full value of his or her tax entitlement and I do not see the need to carry out a report, as the Deputy has suggested.  I have agreed that my officials would carry out a report into the home carer's credit as part of the upcoming early year strategy that will be launched by my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth affairs, Deputy Zappone.  The purpose of this review is to undertake research and analyse the utilisation and effectiveness of the home carer tax credit scheme, in line with tax expenditure guidelines.  For the reasons I have already outlined, I, therefore, believe this report and this process will deal with issues in relation to the administration of the credit and I do not believe at this stage that a further report is needed.</p></speech>

That is a point I mentioned in my introductory remarks.</p> <p>  What I want to do is to encourage Revenue to continue to highlight this credit and to provide it automatically where people are entitled to it and to explore if there is more that can be done in that area.  An issue sometimes arises where one spouse is out of work for part or most of a calendar year and is one illness benefit, carer's benefit or on maternity leave.  This is where a person in the normal course of events is working full-time but the family is not in a position to benefit because for one year its income is much-reduced as someone is out of work for one reason or another.  In those cases people can miss out on it.  The more we talk about it, the more we raise awareness of it and the more people who are entitled to it will claim it.</p></speech>

One will find quite frequently that people are unaware that they can claim back medical expenses.  Unfortunately we are not having a debate on relief on trade union subscriptions here but when one looked at the data on trade union membership and those claiming the relief when it applied, there was quite a significant mismatch there.  This was also the case when other reliefs were applied.  One will see that some third level institutions are raising awareness among their students in relation to the availability of tax reliefs for student fees.  When there is a second student in a family who would be paying student fees, that student can claim tax relief on that.  The assertion is being made that families are unaware of this and are missing out on a significant amount of relief.</p> <p>  There is a broader question, notwithstanding Deputy Michael McGrath's specific issue on this particulars relief, as to how there can be a greater awareness among people of the range of reliefs available.  I am aware that is difficult because not every household has a student or a home carer and there is quite a large number of reliefs.  We need to examine a better and a consumer-friendly way to inform people of the reliefs.  Families may be missing out on the support they could be availing of.</p></speech>

The short answer to Deputy Michael McGrath's first question is "Yes".  We believe the key reason here for the gaps in the different figures put forward is the fact that the tax circumstances of those who would be able to claim the relief means that the actual value of them getting the relief is nil.  To put some more flesh on this, the CSO figure of 147,000 that is quoted does not necessarily reflect the credit recipients.  The credit is available only to married couples and civil partners who are jointly assessed for tax.  The 85,000 figure used by the Department of Finance is the estimated number of people who will benefit from the budget 2019 increases.  However, data from Revenue indicate that 125,000 families claimed the credit.  They just did not all benefit from the credit.  The reason for that is that the family income may be insufficient to absorb the credit, or it may be due to one of the reasons Deputy McGrath put forward or, indeed, it might be more beneficial for them to claim the increased standard rate band for two income families.  There are two different reasons.</p> <p>  On the different points Deputies Michael McGrath and Pearse Doherty put to me and where we are on the different entitlements that are available, on 1 November the Revenue Commissioner issued a press release explaining to citizens all the different allowances available to them and reminding them there is a four year time limit in place by which they can claim such refunds.  The deadline for 2014 claims is 31 December of this year.  The potential is still there for citizens to claim that which they are entitled to.  What is now going to happen is that the Revenue Commissioner will write to all taxpayers who have not claimed any reliefs at all over the last four years.</p></speech>

People may have claimed for certain reliefs but are not aware of other reliefs that they could claim.  Some of the reliefs are more known than others.  The press release is important but the unfortunate reality is that we do not know how many people heard it or read it.</p> <p>  Last week there was a moneylender at my door handing out leaflets telling me exactly how much I could get.</p><p>I do not refer to individuals.  However, moneylenders and such institutions are parasites in terms of trying to get people to sign up to high interest loans while under pressure coming up to Christmas.  That is the most direct message.</p><p> Revenue regularly sends information to taxpayers relating to their tax credits.  It would be worthwhile to include the information contained in the press release - which I did not see - with that documentation.  Every year, sometimes on multiple occasions, information is sent to taxpayers relating to the standard rate cut-off threshold and so on.  It would be efficient and cost-effective in terms of postage and so on to include the list of tax reliefs with that documentation.</p></speech>

The single affordable childcare scheme was introduced in budget 2017 and is due to come into operation in budget 2019.  This necessary legislation was passed by the Oireachtas in July of this year.  The scheme will provide for a graduated State contribution towards cr&egrave;che fees depending on the income of the families involved, which will be assessed by means testing.  In addition, a limited universal State contribution will be made available to those who do not qualify under the means assessment.  For those who qualify for the means-tested element, the State contribution may be as much as &euro;6 per hour of childcare at participating cr&egrave;ches.  The universal element will amount to a State contribution of 50 cent per hour of childcare at participating cr&egrave;ches in respect of children under the age of three.</p> <p>  In the absence of any relieving legislative provisions, certain payments made under the Act would fall to be taxable as they are made on behalf of parents or guardians as a contribution towards cr&egrave;che fees.  In order to avoid this, section 7 inserts a new section 194AA into the Taxes Consolidation Act of 1997 to provide an exemption from income tax for parents in regard to certain payments made by or on behalf of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  In addition to payments under the single affordable childcare scheme, payments under the following existing schemes are to be exempted: the community childcare subvention, community childcare subvention plus, community childcare subvention resettlement, the transitional payment for the community childcare subvention resettlement scheme, community childcare subvention universal and the training and employment childcare scheme.  The section also provides that payments made under the forthcoming affordable childcare scheme will be exempt from income tax in the hands of the parents.</p></speech>

Is there an issue of tax being claimed back?  If there was not, is the legislation retrospective?  Does it apply from now onwards?

Clearly, the clarification provided by the Minister to some extent negates my reason for contributing, which was to inquire as to whether there would be any tax liability for the payments that have been made since the end of last year.  Is it the Minister's intention, in conjunction with his colleague, the Minster for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, to vary what is likely to become the Finance Act over the coming 12 months to make provision for the affordable childcare scheme when it is introduced?  As the Minister is probably aware, the computer system being created between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is due to go online next year.  The ambition is to have it up and running before October.  Is the Department of Finance aware whether that will require any additional changes or is it confident that the measures being introduced in the Bill will be sufficient to cater for any future targeted payments by the Government and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to children and service providers?</p></speech>

The affordable childcare legislation lays out a set of different payments and the Finance Bill puts in place the principles of how we will deal with those.  The short answer to the question, as things stand, is "Yes".  To bring to life the number of children this will affect, the number of children now registered in the universal scheme is 45,833.  The number registered in the subvention plus scheme is 29,000 and the number registered in the core childcare subvention scheme is 17,959.  We have the bones of 90,000 children already registered in these schemes.  As long as the future development of the scheme is consistent with the legislation now in place for the childcare scheme, the Finance Bill will interact with it.</p></speech>

In 2017, I directed that a working group be established to examine benefit-in-kind issues identified in payments of the Defences Forces.  This group comprised representatives from the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Defence.  The Revenue Commissioners provided advice on technical taxation matters.  The group completed its work and recommended that an exemption from benefit-in-kind should be provided for living-in accommodation and certain medical treatment provided to members of the Permanent Defence Forces.  Due to the nature of their work, members are required to be physically fit and in a position to discharge their duties.  They are required to undergo medical checks and to use the authorised medical service provided such that it is considered an offence under military law to refuse health treatment.  As such, it is not therefore unreasonable to provide an exemption from benefit-in-kind on such costs in a similar manner to that provided in the UK and other countries.  On living-in accommodation, it is policy that Defence Force members are accommodated in barracks to be available to be mobilised at short notice in the event of an emergency arising.  This accommodation is also used when training courses are being undertaken.  The charges levied are modest due to the basic and frugal nature of the accommodation and, therefore, I believe it is justified that an exemption from benefit-in-kind is provided in respect of such accommodation. </p></speech>

It is the same net issue anyway, which I will cut to .  In last year's budget, the Minister introduced a benefit-in-kind, BIK, exemption in respect of the treatment of electric vehicles provided by companies - company vehicles.  That was welcome.  It was a progressive measure which was well received.  He gave clarity at the time that it was his intention that the zero-rate relief, while initially being introduced in the Finance Act 2017 for a one-year period, would remain in place for a minimum of three to five years.  </p><p>He has clarified the position in this Bill.  The relief will now be in effect until the end of 2021, but he is imposing a &euro;50,000 cap on the exemption.  There will not be much sympathy for people with expensive company vehicles, but there is an issue of equity in this regard.  I do not know how many companies purchased a vehicle at a cost greater than &euro;50,000 and provided it to an employee in 2018 but perhaps the Minister has the data at his disposal.  There is a retrospective element to his proposal, which is unfair.  If one wanted to put that cap in place for purchases from this point forward, that would a different matter, but as we go through debate, the Minister will make the argument on other matters that we should not seek to change the system retrospectively in respect of onshoring and so on.  He will argue that people onshored intellectual property based on a certain regime and that we should not seek to change that retrospectively.  I imagine a small number of companies purchased these vehicles, which are expensive, under the regime as announced but now the Minister proposes to change it.  I ask him to reconsider that net point in respect of vehicles provided during 2018.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.358" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#N00400"><p>I will address amendments No. 5 to 15, inclusive, together.  I extended the BIK exemption for electric vehicles until 31 December 2021 to support policies to reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector.  This forms part of a broader series of measures to support the uptake of electric vehicles which includes vehicle registration tax, VRT, relief of us to &euro;5,000; a Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grant of up to &euro;5,000; low motor tax of &euro;120 per annum; a 50% discount on toll fees; and 0% benefit-in-kind on electric charging.  Having regard to value for money and tax equity considerations, a cap of &euro;50,000 on this exemption is applied such that an electric vehicle with an original market value exceeding &euro;50,000 will be subject to the standard rate of BIK on the amount in excess of &euro;50,000.  I contend that this is a reasonable threshold.</p> <p>  At the marginal tax rate, this could provide a large tax expenditure of up to &euro;7,800 per annum to the person driving an electric car valued at &euro;50,000.  While there is no breakdown of BIK vehicle data available, the Department, through Revenue VRT and SEAI data, estimates that the vast majority of persons availing of the BIK will not be affected, or the effect will be marginal.  Without a cap, the quantum of an annual tax expenditure to a person driving an electric vehicle valued at &euro;150,000 could be of the order of &euro;23,400.  Over three years, the tax expenditure to the person driving that vehicle worth &euro;150,000 would be more than &euro;70,000.  </p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Ryan's amendment, vehicle BIK is chargeable where, by reason of employment, a vehicle is made available to an employee and is available either for that individual's personal, private use or for that of his or her family or household.  The charge is applied for every tax year during which the vehicle is made available and does not consider when the vehicle was first made available. The cap will, therefore, apply to all electric vans and cars made available to employees in the tax years, 2019 to 2021, where the original market value of the vehicle exceeded &euro;50,000.  </p> <p>  Deputy McGrath's amendment seeks to postpone for one year the introduction of the &euro;50,000 cap on the BIK exemption.  The introduction of this cap is based on applying value for money and tax equity considerations.  Without a cap, the tax expenditure of the employee driving the high-end vehicle, the value of which could be in excess of &euro;150,000, would be several times greater than the home insulation grant to low-income households under the SEAI better energy warmer homes scheme while the benefit of such grants lasts for many years.  It could also be many times greater than the annual allowance for low-income households under the national fuel allowance scheme.  In addition, the total tax expenditure for an electric vehicle with an original market value of &euro;150,000 without the application of the cap would equate to relief for at least four times the value of the most popular electric vehicles on the market.  </p> <p>  Regarding the report requested by the Deputy, I am satisfied that officials from my Department keep tax expenditure under continuous review.  The BIK exemption for electric vehicles was examined in the Department's tax strategy group papers which, as the Deputy will be aware, were published earlier this year.  I appreciate that some Deputies have raised the review of tax reliefs in a value for money context.  It is with similar considerations in mind that I have introduced this &euro;50,000 cap.  With that rationale in mind, these amendments are not needed.</p></speech>

I do not argue with the application or principle of a cap but he is moving the goalposts for people who are availing of the exemption arising from the announcement in last year's budget and the provisions of the Finance Act 2017.  I recall the discussion well.  The Minister gave an assurance that the exemption generally would be there for a period of three to five years.</p><p>The Minister wanted to legislate for just one year because he wanted to conduct a review.  A number of members would have made the point that companies investing in a company car need to have greater certainty and need a longer time horizon in mind when making that decision.  </p><p> Some people have availed of this exemption during the course of 2018 on the basis of what was said and what was promised.  The Minister is shifting the goal posts.  It would be damaging to people's confidence in new incentives in the area of climate change the Minister might be announcing if he changes the goal posts for those who have already completed a transaction.  I do not have an issue with the Minister applying the cap for vehicles purchased from now on, however, for the small number who bought electric vehicles under the regime announced and enacted last year, the goal posts are being changed.  I ask the Minister to consider this point.  I do not expect an answer here and now but I think the Minister should reflect on it.</p></speech>

There is a basic principle that if we raise expectations, we do not raise false expectations.  There were communications from Government on several occasions in the past year and in all communications there was a declared expectation that there would be an extension of at least three years up to five and there was never any mention of a cap.  That is the difficulty.  Had a cap been mentioned at the start, it would be fine.  I do not think anybody objects to the cap that is being set out, but if we have given false expectation, we should try to avoid the consequences.  It is very limited, as it only applies to those who might have purchased a car in the last year between the budget and now.  Prior to that there was no such expectation.  It should not apply to anybody going forward.  I do not disagree with the cap, but for those people who did purchase a car, whatever the number, it has consequences.  For some who would be wealthy, it would not be an issue, but for others pushed to the pin of their collar who want to do the right thing it would have financial consequences.  We should try to avoid that.  The amendments ensure this would only apply to those who might have been caught in the past year by the false expectation that was created by the advertising in which the State engaged of which I have some examples.  This would be unjust to the small number who purchased the electric vehicles.</p></speech>

All I am committing to doing is examining it to see if it offers a reason to assess what I am doing.  I genuinely do not believe that the policy we are putting in place in the Bill will cause significant financial hardship to anybody, should one be in a position to buy a vehicle that costs more than &euro;50,000 - many of them cost a great deal more than &euro;50,000.  I strongly believe that the role of tax relief and tax expenditure is targeted to provide support to people to help them to make a decision which they otherwise would not make.</p> <p>  I note that neither of the Deputies is disagreeing with my decision in terms of its direction, but their comments relate to those who may feel they have been affected in the past.  It is in the spirit that everybody feels this is the right thing to do in the future, that I will see if there are figures that may give me a reason to think about it.</p></speech>

The benefit-in-kind exemption, if it is capped, will affect the employees and result in a greater tax bill for them.  That is not related to the affordability of the car for the company.</p></speech>

This is the right decision to make moving forward.</p> <p>  Deputy Michael McGrath made the point about retrospectivity; there is no retrospectivity but it affects people moving forward from this date.  We are not changing the relief people would have got in the past, so I would think differently from the Deputy on the retrospective piece but having said that, the members who have spoken on the section acknowledge that the move I am making is the right one.  I will see how many people could have been affected by this and if this offers a reason to consider the matter on Report Stage.</p></speech>

As Deputies may be aware, this programme was introduced in last year's Finance Act but information I have received suggests that to date uptake has been less than expected.</p> <p>  Section 11 proposes a number of changes which I expect will enhance the attractiveness of the scheme to SMEs with high potential.  Under the scheme there are restrictions imposed on the total market value of schemes which can be granted by the qualifying company to a qualifying employee.  The restrictions are set out in paragraph (d) in the definition of "qualifying share option" in subsection (1).  The first amendment, which is subject to a commencement order changes the restrictions applied at employee level whereby the limit of &euro;250,000 in any three consecutive years of assessment is replaced by a lifetime limit of &euro;300,000.  The limit of 50% of the annual emoluments in the year of assessment is increased to 100% and the second change amends subsection (8) to provide for the collection of information required for State aid publication purposes for the qualifying company's annual return.  </p> <p>  The measure is subject to State aid approval by the Commission and so contains a commencement provision to allow for that to happen before it comes into effect.</p></speech>

The level of interest in the scheme, as originally structured, has been disappointing.  I accept it is early days yet but a number of the restrictive elements of the scheme have been highlighted by business representative bodies and by a number of SMEs directly as well.  It is a really important programme for attracting and retaining talent in the SME sector.  It remains to be seen whether these changes will have the desired effect but I think we need to put them in place and measure over time what the impact will be.</p> <p>  I welcome these changes. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.406" nospeaker="true" time="09:30:00" ><p>This section introduces a new section 480B into the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which is related to the calculation and remittance of income tax under the newly modernised PAYE system that will be going live on 1 January 2019.  This new section will increase the value of certain tax credits, reliefs and rate bands in specific circumstances to ensure that weekly and fortnightly workers do not suffer a reduction in take-home pay solely because of administration issues relating to the day of the week on which they are paid and the number of weeks in a calendar year.  This is considered particularly important for lower-wage workers where even a &euro;1 or &euro;2 per week difference in take-home pay would have a material effect.</p><p>In most years, a weekly-paid employee has 52 pay days in a tax year.  When calculating the amount of tax that is to be remitted to Revenue under the PAYE system each week, the applicable tax credits and standard rate bands are divided evenly over 52 weeks.  However, the tax year follows the calendar year and is comprised of either 52 weeks and a day or 52 weeks and two days in a leap year.  As a result, every five or six years a weekly paid worker will have 53 pay days within one calendar year instead of the normal 52.  This extra pay day is commonly known as a week 53 pay day.  Fortnightly paid and four-weekly paid employees also experience the same issue, albeit less frequently.</p><p>The impact of the week 53 pay day is that, unless measures are taken, because a person's statutory tax credits should be divided by 53 rather than 52, in a week where they have a week 53 pay day they will end up with less weekly take-home pay across the whole year as reflected in their weekly payslips when compared with the previous or following years.  This arises solely by virtue of the week 53 payday, depending on the particular day of the week on which they are paid.</p><p>Special administrative arrangements were previously in place to ensure this did not happen but, because of the legislative changes made in the Finance Act 2017 to allow for PAYE modernisation, there is no longer a legal basis for the administrative arrangements.  Therefore the legislation is being amended to ensure that there is no reduction to take-home pay by increasing the value of certain tax credits, deductions, exemptions and rate bands by 1/52 when a week 53 pay day arises.  This treatment will apply to all applicable rate bands and identified credits and exemptions that have a fixed value or where there is an annual cap.  This includes the most commonly used credits such as personal tax credit, the PAYE tax credit, the earned income tax credit and the single parent child carer tax credit.  An anti-avoidance measure is also being provided to prevent manipulation so the treatment will not apply if an employer changes the pay day during the week, during the year or during the previous year, or if a payment including a notional payment is made to an employee on 31 December and this is not the employee's normal payday.</p><p>In the broader context of PAYE modernisation, this amendment is expected to be generally cost neutral from an Exchequer perspective.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.409" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#P01100"><p>On the section, if I may, in respect of the PAYE modernisation programme, I would like to ask the Minister if he is satisfied with how the preparatory work is going in terms of the level of contact with employers.  In the last couple of weeks, a number of small business have been in touch with me to share their experience.  I have some concern for people who are self-employed and paying themselves a wage, or for very small businesses that require an accountant or payroll operator to process their payroll every week, fortnight or month.  Now that we are moving to a real-time payroll system and a lot more information will be exchanged between the employer and Revenue on a frequent basis, is the Minister satisfied with the preparation, which is now at a very advanced stage?  Is he satisfied that it will not result in significant extra costs on self-employed persons and small firms that rely on a third party to process their payroll?  In the past they might have only required contact with their accountant every few months.  Will they now require much more frequent contact and therefore incur extra costs?  This is coming down the track.  I know Revenue has done a huge amount of work and we have been aware of this for quite some time.  I hope it will go smoothly but in recent weeks some issues and concerns have been raised with me in respect of the self-employed and very small businesses that do not process their own payroll.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#P01200"><p>The short answer to the Deputy's question is that I am satisfied with the preparation that has gone on so far.  As he acknowledges himself, it should be evident to any employer that this change, which is the most significant change in how we administer our PAYE tax code in nearly the past 50 years, has been on the way.  A significant amount of engagement has gone on.  In respect of small and medium-sized companies, I guess I would split them into two sections.  For those companies that use payroll software to run their payroll, Revenue has engaged extensively with the software industry as opposed to the employers to make sure the software has been coded appropriately and changes made ahead of 1 January 2019.  In respect of employers who do not use payroll software, Revenue has provided an easy-to-use process within the Revenue Online Service, ROS, system to capture payroll data for each employee.  The process includes data screens that the employer will be obliged to complete for every employee each time a pay run is completed.  The burden associated with this work will be offset by the abolition of a set of forms that employers previously had to complete.  My anticipation is that the saving in time and cost that will be made by the abolition of those data reporting requirements will be an offset to the fact that there will be a need for employers who do not have payroll systems to engage in the ROS system in the way we have described.</p><p>The data required are in line with what employers are currently required to provide on an employee's payslip under employment law.  It is important to note that there will be no changes to the dates by which PAYE liabilities are paid to Revenue.  Crucially, as this is done properly, there should not be any effect on cashflow for employers as the dates on which the PAYE liabilities are due to be paid to Revenue are unchanged.  That said, should any employers have difficulties as to where they stand in this regard, additional staff and resources have been provided to the helpdesk for this area, the telephone number for which is (01) 7383683.  That helpline has been available for some time.</p><p> On Second Stage, Deputy Fitzmaurice raised a concern about costs for accountants who focus on small and medium sized companies.  We have looked into this issue.  I will not name any companies, as that would not be appropriate and it is not my business to direct business to other companies, but we found that costs can be as low as &euro;7 per month for companies of up to 25 employees.  Some companies charge up to &euro;149 per year and we found a free service for employers with only a single employee.  Our examination showed a diverse range of costs.  Revenue has also been informed by some payroll software developers that they have been contacted by employers who use a payroll agent and have decided to do their own payroll, probably because they have become aware of the level of optionality and resources available directly through the Revenue online service, ROS.  I will continue to monitor the position.  I cannot comment on the level of charges which some accountants may levy but I will play a role in ensuring that widespread opportunism does not develop as small companies make this change.  </p></speech>

However, I note that the budget day booklet estimated that Revenue will collect an additional &euro;50 million from increased compliance levels among taxpayers.  The expectation is that workers will pay more tax because of better compliance arising from the system.  In simple terms, I understand that the Minister is saying that where an employer has a payroll software system, and runs payroll weekly, fortnight, monthly or whatever, that information will be shared automatically online with Revenue in real time and in a seamless manner.  However, employers who do not operate such a system and outsourced providers that run the payroll on their behalf will have to go online every time they run the payroll and make a declaration to Revenue using the key numbers each time.</p></speech>

A number of social welfare payments are taxable in law but tax is not collected in the vast majority of cases in question.  Revenue and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection have examined the tax treatment of social welfare payments in anticipation of PAYE modernisation, and my Department has now joined these discussions.  Arising from the work of this group to date, I decided on First Stage statutorily to exempt from taxation approximately 30 payments, as listed in the amendment, including jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's transitional payments through this Committee Stage amendment.  The full list is set out in the amendment.  The guiding principle on the outcome of this process has been that no recipient of a social welfare payment should be worse off as a result of these changes.  <br/><br/>In addition, as I mentioned, despite being taxable in law, tax was never collected in the vast majority of cases.  Where tax was collected in the case of the guardian's payment, both contributory and non-contributory, it was at a nominal level.  The purpose of the amendment, therefore, is to ensure the Revenue's current treatment of the payment in practice will continue after the introduction of PAYE modernisation on 1 January 2019.  To follow on from this initial process, I asked my officials to further examine the tax treatment of social welfare payments in a second phase.  The work will be done in conjunction with officials from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection with technical support from the Revenue Commissioners.  <br/><br/>Other payments may well also be made by various parts of the State's system that need to be considered in the same way as social welfare payments.  To the extent that such other payments require attention, arising from the introduction of PAYE modernisation, the relevant Departments will be included in the process.  A number of matters need to be carefully considered and fully thought through, such as costs to the State and wider policy implications of any legislative change in social welfare payments.  My first step, therefore, is to ensure as far as possible there is consistency in treatment within groups of payments such as social welfare and across the wider set of State payments.  The task will take time to complete to ensure we capture all relevant payments and we make the right decisions.  I expect it to take a few months to do.  Pending completion, Revenue will maintain the <i>status quo</i>in its approach to social welfare and other State payments that fall for consideration under this process.  There are other payments, the breadth of which I must determine.  Over the period we do this work, the <i>status quo</i>in the administration of those payments will not change.</p></speech>

The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on tapering out income tax credits for incomes between &euro;100,000 and &euro;140,000 at a rate of 2.5 per cent for each &euro;1000 earned.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>This amendment relates to the tapering out of income tax credits for those on higher incomes.  The proposal is for a tapering out of incomes between &euro;100,000 and &euro;140,000 at a rate of 2.5% for each &euro;1,000 earned.  The formula means that by the time one earned more than &euro;140,000, one would have exhausted or lost all of one's income tax credits.  It would not affect any other tax credits of which an individual of that income may avail.  </p><p>A similar system is in operation in Britain, having been introduced a number of years ago by the Labour Party.  The Irish tax system is renowned for its generosity with tax credits that provide a cushion for low-paid workers, which is right, but it is time to ask whether it is appropriate for those on higher salaries to avail of income tax credits for relief.  </p><p>For the first time ever, we know the data on individual incomes as opposed to tax pair units, which I tried to pursue for a number of years and which I am grateful to the Revenue Commissioners for providing.  For the first time, we can clearly the see the income earned in the State on an individual basis as opposed to trying to establish whether an income of &euro;160,000, for example, was a couple earning &euro;80,000 each.  From those data, we also know that the top 10% of income earners earn one third of all income in the State.  The data show that the top 1% earn 11% of all income in the State and 10,000 people have a combined income of &euro;5.6 billion - that is, some 10,000 people in the State who, on average, have an income above &euro;500,000 each.  It is not appropriate that we provide tax credits to those people through our tax system.  I understand and support the rationale behind tax credits but there needs to be a point beyond which we should not subsidise that level of high income tax through the taxation system.</p><p>My proposal is for a tapering out of those tax credits.  Nobody would lose them in one go but they would be lost at a rate of 2.5% for every &euro;1,000 earned above &euro;100,000.  At the point where one reached &euro;140,000, one would receive no tax credits.  For incomes below that threshold, a portion of the tax credits would still be received.  I accept that this would require changes for Revenue.  I am on record as saying how impressed I am by Revenue and the systems it operates.  It is feasible to discuss tax credits now and, while this amendment would not increase the marginal rate of tax, it would have an impact on the effective rate of tax for high earners.  This proposal is worthy of consideration and what it asks the committee to support is no more than considering a report to look at the impact of a tapering out in order that the committee, with the benefit of the work of the Minister's officials and in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, could make informed decisions about the direction in which we should or should not go in the tapering out of tax credits for this 3%, because only 3% of income earners in the State earn more than &euro;100,000.  Some 10,000 people, however, earn more than &euro;500,000, which is fine and they have doubtless sought employment or have other ways of generating that income.  The question for us is whether we should, at this stage, support through a tax break that type of high income by allowing them to avail of tax credits.  It is only fair that we start to look at reducing tax reliefs for incomes in excess of that level.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.446" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#R00500"><p>The amendment refers to a report on the tapering out of income tax credits at certain incomes.  Substantial research has been published on this subject, and it is estimated that the tapering out of the personal income tax credit, the PAYE credit and the earned income tax credits in the manner outlined by the Deputy could raise in the region of &euro;671 million per annum.  The income tax reform plan published by my Department in July 2016 examined this issue due the programme for partnership Government containing a commitment to consider the removal of the PAYE credit for high earners as a part of the medium-term income tax reform plan.  It pointed out a number of technical and policy issues that would need to be addressed to achieve a tapered withdrawal of income tax credits, particularly for PAYE employees.</p><p>A significant issue arising with this amendment is that it would have a negative effect on the marginal rate of tax.  The tapering out of a tax credit would result in a higher marginal tax rate within the taper zone that would apply at higher income levels.  For example, if the personal tax credit of &euro;1,650 was tapered out at a rate of 5% per &euro;1,000, it would result in a loss of just over 8% per additional euro of income.  The marginal rate within the taper zone would be just over 60%.  Once the taper period has expired, at income over &euro;120,000 in this example, the marginal rate would revert to &euro;52,000.</p><p> Another issue that has been pointed out in previous research is that tax credits and rate bands operate on a cumulative basis as Revenue issues a payroll notification to the individual's employer who then uses the information contained in the notification to calculate the tax to be deducted each time the payment is made.  If it is known from the beginning of the year that an employee's income will exceed the chosen threshold, the application of the taper of the credits would be applied from the outset, thereby spreading the tax burden equally over the year.  However, where it appears during the course of the year that the employee's income may exceed the chosen threshold, Revenue will need to update the payroll notification to withdraw the relevant credits and this will result in the calculation of arrears from the next payment of salary by the employer, resulting in an uneven distribution of the employee's liabilities over the year and an uneven distribution of yield for the Exchequer.</p><p> I am aware that the UK tax system incorporates a personal tax allowance which is subject to a tapered withdrawal for individuals whose income is in excess of &pound;100,000 per annum.  However, that threshold was chosen as all individuals with income above that level were already obliged to file a tax return each year and this facilitated the operation of the taper.  By contrast, there is no similar liability to file a tax return based on income level in Ireland.  Liability to file a tax return in Ireland is determined in most cases by the type of income earned and an individual whose total income is taxed through the PAYE system is not, in general, obliged to file a tax return.  An obligation to require individuals in similar circumstances to file a tax return would add to the complexity and administration of the tax code.</p><p> Tapering the tax credits could also affect the relative position of different categories of taxpayers.  For example, consideration would need to be given to how the taper would work in the case of jointly assessed individuals, such as whether the value of a single personal tax credit or that of a married personal tax credit would be subject to the taper and what income threshold would apply to a single income couple.  In addition, the effect of a deduction such as a loss available in respect of one spouse would need to be considered where the couple are jointly assessed to tax.</p><p> These issues are being considered by my Department and Revenue on an ongoing basis and have been examined in published reports such as the income tax reform plan and tax strategy group papers.  In my view, a report regarding the tapering out of income tax credits would not be a good use of resources at this time and, for that reason, I cannot accept the amendment proposed by the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.448" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#S00200"><p>The Minister opened his contribution by saying we should listen to other ideas and so on.  I am asking him to assist us in teasing out an idea that we favour and that is applied in a different format but on the same principle in our nearest neighbouring jurisdiction.  The Minister put a number of figures on the record which I believe are inaccurate, or may not be up to date.  For example, he indicated the cost of this would be &euro;650 million.  That may be on the assumption that this is a taxpayer unit, as opposed to individual incomes.  Based on the Department's costings, the full year effect of this proposal would be &euro;220 million and a partial year effect would be &euro;180 million.  That is maybe just a difference between units and so forth.  I want to clarify that the proposed measure would not apply to taxpayer units and relates to individual incomes.  I made that point when I referred to the data the Revenue has provided for the first time.</p> <p>  I listened to the Minister's concerns.  He referred to a tapering off at a 5% rate, whereas the proposal is for a tapering off at a rate of 2.5%.  This would mean someone earning &euro;101,000 would lose &euro;82.50 of his or her tax credit.</p> <p>  There would obviously be logistical issues, and the Minister talked about that in terms of how the Revenue deals with calculations and so on.  I think we can agree that all of those issues could be overcome if the principle was accepted.  The Revenue Commissioners have dealt with far more complex issues than what we are suggesting in terms of tapering out individual tax credits.</p> <p>  This is an issue of principle.  How should tax credits apply in the tax code?  Why are they provided in the first place?  The Finance Bill has dealt with an increase in the self-employed tax credit, which is welcome, although it should have gone further.  There are many other tax credits in place to support people.  The PAYE tax credit should not support the highest incomes in the State.  It is not appropriate to provide a tax credit for the 10,000 people who are earning, on average, in excess of &euro;500,000.  </p> <p>  We are asking the Minister to assist us in this regard.  This type of report does not take much time.  Revenue has done a significant amount of crunching on this and we have done considerably preparatory work on this issue.  This is an issue of principles and whether we want to continue to provide a cushion for the highest incomes in the State or whether we believe, as has been done in other jurisdictions, that when one starts to reach an income of a certain level, which is multiple times of the average wage, the State should not provide this tax break.  At that point, the taxpayer one is able to paddle one's own canoe.  There are many other tax breaks.  Many of the 10,000 individuals who have incomes in excess of &euro;500,000 are able to reduce their tax liability, as we discussed with the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, through other measures and reliefs.  Why we are providing them with this break is seriously questionable.  </p> <p>  I am disappointed by the Minister's response and I ask him to reconsider.  The proposed report can be published and there is no requirement on the Minister to commit to it.  At this point, a report can be done by the Revenue officials in the Minister's Department.  It could be published within a short period.  We have stated in this amendment that it would be six months.  If the Minister required longer, I am open to hearing that.  This is a matter of principle.  This can bring in a significant amount of resources, whether &euro;180 million or &euro;220 million, which could be pumped into areas of society where we need to relieve pressures.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to consider this proposal.  A similar measure was introduced in Britain by the Labour Party.  The measure would increase the effective rate of tax for higher income earners.  There are no two ways about that but it does not increase the 40% rate, which these taxpayers will continue to pay.  This is not a radical move.  The Tory Party implements this in Britain.  The Minister should be comfortable with this idea.  This is not way out there.  This is about fairness and who needs and does not support.  The idea of tapering out reliefs for those earning between &euro;100,000 and &euro;120,000 or &euro;140,000 is to ensure there is not a dramatic increase in the effective rate of tax that would be applied.  Under the model applied in Britain, which is different, tapering out applies in respect of incomes between &pound;100,000 and &pound;120,000 and the effective rate of tax increases at a much sharper rate than in the model we are proposing.</p><p>It has not scared off investment in Britain, or indeed scared off employees.  It is accepted, par for the course, and has been in place for many years.  We have something in our tax code that has always been the way, but that does not necessarily mean that it should be the way we operate.  This is the time to consider it, and I ask the Minister to support this amendment and allow his officials to produce such a report.  </p></speech>

The Deputy has acknowledged that this is a difference of principles regarding tax policy.  I believe we have high effective tax rates in place already for those who are high-income earners.  If one earns more, one should pay more.  My concern is that if we increase the effective tax rate for people above a certain level of income, it will affect decisions being made in our economy.  I have heard the Sinn F&eacute;in health spokesperson, who attended a recent conference on consultants, make the point that more should be done on the issue of recruitment and retention of consultants.  Measures such as those proposed by Deputy Pearse Doherty affect all of that.  There is a certain group of people within our economy which earns more than the average income earner and which pays more tax as a result, as is correct.  All the international comparisons with our tax code state that we get the progressivity right in the main.  While I am not going to give a commitment to produce a report in the Finance Bill, given how much work we have already done on it, if the Deputy needs any information or needs anything to help develop his policy in this area, I will supply it to him through a parliamentary question or via any other format.</p></speech>

As discussed earlier, we would go a hell of a lot further in trying to use the tax system to generate more equality in the distribution of income in Irish society.  The Minister has concerns about this particular amendment and the production of a report.  His earlier responses were thoughtful in that he offered to listen to ideas and to provide information to people who are developing alternative policies.  He speaks about progressivity and worries about the effective rate going higher, but he has not really acknowledged the point that emerged in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report suggesting that those general statements are not accurate.  What the Comptroller and Auditor General has said is deeply troubling.  It angers me, and I suspect a number of workers out there, that we actually have a very substantial cohort of very rich people who are not paying high effective income tax rates because of loopholes, allowances, credits, deductions, etc. that they are able to avail of.  This measure is only a small measure in that regard, but at least it is moving in the right direction.  Does the Minister acknowledge that there is an issue?  Was he alarmed by what the Comptroller and Auditor General found?  Does he think it behoves the Government to look at it as a matter of urgency to ensure that we do not have a situation where very wealthy people are paying very low levels of tax because they are able to find means through the tax code to substantially reduce the amount of tax they pay?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.452" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#T00400"><p>It boils down to ideology and principles.  The 10,000 people with incomes above &euro;500,000 should not be getting a tax break of &euro;3,300.  That is it.  Sin &eacute;.  That is the black and white of it.  This amendment provides for that.  The report would look at different options, but the Minister is sitting there, with full knowledge of the levels of inequality in existence in this State and of the many people with dramatically less incomes than this who are working every hour that God sends yet still face pressures at the end of every week because of all the things we have talked about, including rent, insurance, childcare and other things.  Knowing all of that, the idea that the Minister would defend a tax break of &euro;3,300 for the 10,000 individuals who earn in excess of &euro;500,000 per year is unjustifiable.  There are no two ways about it.  This is a tax break.  There is a rationale for such breaks for those on low and middle incomes, and even for those on higher incomes.  We are talking about the top 3% of earners.  We are not even talking about taking away that tax break all at once.</p> <p>  The data from the Revenue Commissioners are stark.  The top 1% has 11% of all the income earned in this State, and is being provided with a tax break.  This is the time to fix it.  Just because this has always been the way we have operated does not mean it is the correct way to proceed.  It is modest.  A person earning &euro;500,000 a year will pay an addition &euro;3,300 in tax as a result of this measure.  We would prefer to go much further, but I know there is no point in putting down other proposals in terms of an additional USC charge on top of that.  This is something very basic.  Tax on these individuals brings in a hell of a lot of money - some &euro;220 million - that we need, which could be used to deal with the cost of living pressures bearing down on so many people.  It is mind-blowing.  Perhaps it is not, actually.  It is an ideological issue.  The Minister can wrap it up however he likes, but the people earning that amount of money do not need a tax break from the taxpayer.  People who are working and struggling to get by are paying their taxes, and that tax break, while giving them some benefit, is also benefitting the highest income earners in the State.</p></speech>

That 1% of income earners is in receipt of 10.5% of income and will pay 22% of total income tax and USC in our State.  Those are the figures.  That, by any measurement, ensures that those who are at the top are paying what they need to pay to contribute to the funding of public services in our State and making their contribution to the social contract.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised a point about the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There are other figures concerning that report, relating to the situation in 2016.  They show that those earners in our State earning more than &euro;400,000 had an average effective tax rate of 30.1%.  When USC was included the percentage rose to 40.9%.  For those who had an income of approximately &euro;400,000 or more, the average tax rate was just under 41%.  I would contend that an average tax rate of 41% is proportionate for somebody who is earning &euro;400,000 or more.</p><p>The Deputy put a point directly to me in asking for my view on people with a tax liability significantly low below the average rate.  My view is that if somebody is paying tax at a rate below an average of 41% because he or she is availing of reliefs in the system that, in turn, are tied to the person doing something related to a policy objective such as the creation of employment or the work of a small business, the argument in favour of somebody's tax liability being below the average rate is justifiable.  That is if the people concerned are, in turn, doing something the Government or the Oireachtas wants them to do.  If people are paying tax at a rate that is below the average rate to which I have just referred because they are seeking to evade their obligations to the State, I expect the Revenue Commissioners to go after them with all of the resources available to them.  In my experience, that is what they do.  For example, the most up-to-date figures I have indicate that 149 taxpayers in 2016 paid an additional &euro;225.8 million that they would not have paid if we did not have the high income restriction in place.  Even today there is information from the Revenue Commissioners on the resources they will make available to go after people who are not meeting their obligations.</p><p> To respond to Deputy Pearse Doherty's comments, I go back to the argument I have just made about what the top 1% are paying.  It is 22% of the total income tax and universal social charge take.  I have said a number of times across the morning that a change in the tapering as proposed by the Deputy would have other effects that would not be in the interests of the economy and the provision of public services.  I absolutely believe people who are earning more should be paying more.  I contend that the progressive nature of the tax code and the figures I have shared indicate that, by and large, this happens.</p></speech>

If the Minister wants to start calling the marginal tax rate the rate at which people pay tax on the last euro they earn, he should start dealing with it properly.  In the first place, nobody pays tax at the 41% rate because of tax credits.  I have never shied away from the fact that this measure would increase the effective tax rate.</p> <p>  This is an issue of principle and I do not dispute what the top 1% pay in terms of overall tax take in the State, but we must also acknowledge that the top 10% of earners have one third of all income earned in the State, while the top 1% have 11%.  There is a significant number of people who are correctly exempt from paying income tax and the universal social charge because of their low levels of earnings.  It boils down to a simple question.  There are 10,000 people earning, on average, in excess of &euro;500,000 in the State and the Minister believes it is justifiable to continue providing a tax break in the region of &euro;3,300 for each and every one of them.  It is not.  They simply do not need that tax break and it is not what the tax code is for.  It is not fair or appropriate.  It will not shift the numbers outlined by the Minister in a significant way with respect to the total amount paid in tax.</p> <p>  This is an issue of equality and fairness.  Those with that type of income do not need support from the State.  I ask colleagues who may row in behind the Minister to think about this.  If there was no such thing as income tax credits and for the first time the committee was deciding whether to introduce them, they would be worthy of support.  However, would we provide almost &euro;3,500 of tax credits for individuals such as the 10,000 with an income in excess of &euro;500,000?  We would not.  If the Minister made such a proposal, there would be uproar and people would say it was unacceptable.  That is my point; just because it is and has been the way does not mean that it should be.  There is no way Fianna F&aacute;il would support the idea because its members know what the public reaction would be.  They would argue that tax credits should be directed towards those on low and middle incomes.  That is what we are doing in this proposal.  It is not even restricted to those on low and middle incomes as 97% of income earners in the State would continue to avail of tax credits.  Even a large section of the 3% of people who would be left would still be able to avail of a portion of the tax credits.  If this issue was coming before the committee for the first time, there is no way any member could support what is now in place because he or she would be crucified politically.  Providing tax breaks for the wealthiest people in the State is not acceptable.  That is why I will push this modest amendment.  Whether the Minister supports the idea or wants to amend it, the amendment seeks a report to get the ball rolling on a debate this state needs to have on how it deals with inequality in wealth creation in society.  It is a modest proposal that is, as I stated, being enacted by one of the most right-wing governments across the water where it is not seen as being something dramatic.  The Minister knows that in Britain for everybody &pound;2 earned above the figure of &pound;100,000, &pound;1 is lost from the allowance.  That is how sharp and focused it is, but there is no uproar because it is fair.  My measure does not even go that far, but we cannot get Fine Gael or, I assume, Fianna F&aacute;il to support it.</p></speech>

The issue I am raising relates to persons who are aged 65 years or over.  The income exemption limits have been &euro;18,000 for a single person and &euro;36,000 for a couple for a number of years.  As the Minister will know, for persons who are aged 65 years or over, there are a number of ways by which they can be subject to income tax.  They include the income tax exemption limits system, the marginal rate relief system if their income is marginally in excess of the limit and, lastly, the normal income tax system that applies to persons under 65 years of age.  As the figures have remained static for some time, they have lost value as time passed.  I would like to establish whether the Minister is satisfied with how the system operates.  Recently, people in my constituency approached me to share their documentation with me.  A couple qualified for inclusion in the income tax exemption limit system as their income was less than &euro;36,000 but because they had not applied for the tax exemption, they were being taxed under the normal income tax system.</p><p>I wish to raise two issues, the first of which relates to the thresholds.  The income tax bands have remained the same for a number of years.  Is the Minister satisfied with how the system operates?  Second, is he satisfied that people are availing of the optimal option for them, whether it be the marginal rate relief system, the income tax exemption limits system or the normal income tax system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.461" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#W00100"><p>The Deputy's amendment refers to the age exemption limit as set out in section 188 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which provided an income tax exemption for persons aged 65 years or over and who have annual incomes that do not exceed &euro;18,000 for individuals or &euro;36,000 in the case of married couples or couples in civil partnerships.  These thresholds may be increased where there are dependent children, and marginal relief is also available on incomes up to twice the threshold amounts.</p> <p>  The purpose behind the exemption is to strike the appropriate balance between ensuring that those who are in receipt of an income pay some tax and contribute to the Exchequer against the need to safeguard against poverty in retirement.  I am, therefore, satisfied that the current limits are appropriate.  In 2016, this measure benefitted 74,400 taxpayer units and I am not aware of evidence to indicate that the current exemption limits are causing any undue financial hardship for those over the age of 65 years.</p> <p>  It should also be noted that age exemption is only one of many types of relief available at retirement age, as those aged over 66 years are exempt from employee's PRSI and those aged over 70 years benefit from a reduced rate of USC.  Other income tax credits may also be available depending on the personal circumstances of the individual, for example, the personal tax credit, the widow's or widower's tax credit, the credit for blind individuals and so on.</p> <p>  At the current limits, the age exemption has an Exchequer cost of &euro;73 million per annum.  Therefore, even a modest increase would have a significant cost.  For example, a &euro;1,000 increase for individuals and twice that for couples would cost an additional &euro;39 million per annum.</p> <p>  Any consideration of an increase in the age exemption would need to be cognisant of the significant changes in projected demographics in the medium to long term.  It is estimated that the share of the population aged over 66 years will more than double between 2016 and 2071, while life expectancy rates will increase by six years for men and seven years for women over the same period.  Even without making further changes, there will consequently be significant pressures on the Exchequer to fund expenditure in areas such as health and social welfare.  Therefore, I am of the view that the current income exemption limits are reasonable and are being implemented in an appropriate way, taking account of the various other State supports for those over the age of 65 years.</p></speech>

A pensioner couple, each of whom is 66 years of age, with a combined income of less than &euro;36,000 should be exempt from income tax.  If that is not happening in practice, though, is the onus on the couple to ensure the exemption limit is claimed?  Does Revenue have systems to recognise that the couple should be exempt and therefore apply the exemption automatically?  I have encountered cases where it is not being applied automatically.  We have contacted the tax office and got the issue rectified.</p></speech>

This amendment is designed to improve the administrative effectiveness of the scheme.  It will not impact on the types of products which may qualify for the scheme or the cost of the scheme.  Members will be aware that capital allowances for plant and machinery are usually deductible at a rate of 12.5% per annum over a period of eight years.  This scheme provides that certain energy-efficient equipment may qualify for an accelerated rate such that the full amount of allowances may be claimed in the first year.</p> <p>  My amendment removes the necessity for the detailed list of eligible products to be updated by statutory instruments, SIs, every six months.  It provides instead that the broad qualifying criteria will be specified in legislation by means of a list of the ten classes of technologies.  The detailed qualifying criteria will continue to be updated by SI as is the current practice.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, will then be able to amend the eligible product list as appropriate, within the qualifying criteria, and publish the list on its website.</p></speech>

Obviously, this is a departure given that we are allowing for capital allowances to be granted under qualifying criteria without reference to primary or secondary legislation.  I ask the Minister to ensure that information flows and that we consider how the provision is applied after it has operated for a period.  I ask for that in order to make sure that the provision is not excessive because we are losing oversight regarding the type of equipment to which this will apply.  We would usually deal with this by means primary or secondary legislation.  I do not oppose the provision in principle but we need the commitment I have outlined.</p></speech>

We are trying to get away from SIs, which contain very minute information that is invaluable in the context of products that meet the relevant criteria.  Instead, we are trying to ensure that the criteria are set in legislation and then allow the SEAI to determine which products should meet the criteria because it is the expert in the area.  Absolutely, I do not want this to run away with itself.  In order to change the criteria, one requires a statutory instrument.  We will, perhaps in the run up to next year's finance Bill, update the committee regarding how this has worked.</p></speech>

This scheme provides an accelerated wear and tear allowance, available for capital expenditure incurred between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2021.  While capital allowances on plant and machinery are usually deductible at a rate of 12.5% per annum over eight years, this scheme provides that relief may be claimed in full in year one.  The scheme, therefore, provides a cashflow benefit to those who will avail of it and there is no additional cost.</p> <p>  As Deputies will be aware, the use of natural gas or biogas is a more environmentally friendly, lower carbon emission substitute for diesel or petrol in large vehicles. The introduction of this scheme contributes to the work of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's task force on low emitting vehicles and will help make a contribution to our national target of reducing our emissions.</p></speech>

The Minister has mentioned that the amendment is just typographical.  I understand that it provides additional restrictions because the original section was never given a commencement order and that it would not be available or accessible for use by the general public.  It was one of my questions that I asked.  Given that the number of contributions on Report Stage is limited to two, I never received a response to my question.  However, I raised my concern that the provision could be used whereby others, as opposed to employees, could access the service and, therefore, the provision would not meet with the intended, I assume, spirit of the amendment.  Amendment No. 19 now clearly ensures that the provision will only apply to employees so that is a significant restriction on this section.  I ask the Minister to clarify the position.</p> <p>  Last year, I raised a second issue with the Minister but, again, because of the constraints relating to Report Stage, we did not receive a response.  My second query was about a small company creating a gym that is attached to residential premises where a company operates from or, indeed, the company itself.  If the gym part of the premises ceases to provide that service to its employees after a period of three years, is there any clawback?</p><p>Where are the anti-avoidance measures?  Someone could avail of this scheme to construct a facility, get the 100% capital allowance on the equipment and, after a period of operation, close it down.  Having benefitted from the capital allowance, the premises could then be used for purposes for which they were not intended.  I agree with the principle but that question arises.</p></speech>

That ensures that this scheme is only available to employees of the company within which the facility is located.  On his second point, the only clawback that is currently available to us is on disposal of the equipment located in the facility.  In the course of Committee Stage, I will revert to the Deputy and indicate whether any further clawback provisions are in place.</p></speech>

The Minister indicated he will ascertain whether further clawback provision is warranted.  Should we examine if this measure could potentially be abused in providing office space?  This is a lifestyle issue and pertains to the healthy Ireland strategy, all of which is positive.  However, there is potential for this to be abused.  I could set up a gym and use it for three years, although I am not sure if a particular timeframe is specified.  Then, having availed of the capital allowance, I could close it down and use it as a storage facility for my company.  I would welcome either an assurance from the Minister that this cannot happen or an amendment to address the issue on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Section 438A extends the scope of the income tax charge under section 438 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This section is also an anti-avoidance provision which imposes a charge to income tax on a company where a participator or shareholder withdraws profits from the company in the guise of loans.  The scheme is extended by section 438A to cases where a company itself does not make the loan, but sets up or acquires a subsidiary to make the loan to the participator or shareholder.  It has recently come to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners, from an examination of a matter arising from information in the Panama Papers, that an avoidance scheme is being exploited to avoid the application of the section 438 charge.  This scheme in particular involves the provision of a loan by a non-resident company owned by the promoter of the scheme to another non-connected company also owned by the promoter, and a subsequent onward loan to the Irish participator or shareholder.  This loan is being used to subscribe for shares in the first mentioned company which are then sold to the shareholder's company.  The participator or shareholder has received funds from his or her company, and it is argued that no capital gains tax arises as the amount received is equal to the amount subscribed by the shareholder for the shares.  This scheme, which should be caught by section 438A, does not currently fall within its remit as the provision is too narrowly drafted.  I am, therefore, making this change to shut down this scheme and ensure the section operates as intended.</p></speech>

First, the section amends section 657, which relates to income averaging, by extending the availability of income averaging to farmers who, or farmers whose spouses or civil partners, carry on another non-farming trade or profession or are directors of companies which carry on a trade or profession.  At present, such farmers are not entitled to elective income averaging.  Income averaging is a useful mechanism for smoothing out the income volatility associated with the farming sector through the taxation scheme.  This change is intended to assist those farmers dealing with income volatility by maximising the number of farmers who are eligible to opt into the regime.  It should allow for increased uptake of the scheme.  The Irish Farmers Association, IFA, has estimated that some 5,000 farmers were unable to enter averaging as a result of the current restriction on those with off-farm trading income.</p> <p>  Second, the existing general 25% stock relief for farmers and the special incentive stock relief of 100% for certain young trained farmers and 50% for members of registered farm partnerships are being extended for a further three years to 31 December 2021.  Stock relief in various forms has been in place since at least 1997 and was last rolled over in 2015.  The 2014 agri-taxation review found that stock relief is an important aid to encourage investment in improving stock quality, and that there is a positive relationship between investment in stock and output.  Technical amendments are made to sections 667C and 667D to correct incorrect cross-references in those sections.</p> <p>  Finally, the section amends sections 667B and 667D to ensure conformity of those sections with the applicable rules on state aid under the agricultural block exemption regulation.  Provision is made for aggregation of reliefs granted to young trained farmers under section 667B, 667D and 81AA of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to ensure that the &euro;70,000 limit provided for in the regulation is not exceeded.  In addition, the definition of "micro-enterprise or small enterprise" is updated in line with the European Commission definition.  </p></speech>

Income averaging for farmers already exists, as it should.  It is also cost-neutral over a budgetary period.  This is particularly important in the farming sector where incomes can be highly volatile.</p><p>I am concerned that the Minister did not choose to go beyond what he has done in the Bill by providing for the IFA proposal that a farmer should be allowed to step out of income averaging more than once in a five year period where the farmer is not carrying an unpaid deferred tax amount from the previous step-out.  Did the Minister or the Department consider the proposal from the IFA?  Obviously, if they considered it they decided against it and, if so, what is the rationale for not going that much further given that it is tax neutral over a period of time?  This is not about if the tax will be paid but when it will be paid.</p></speech>

There are two reasons I did not do it.  The first is that I was concerned about how such a scheme would be operated.  I did not have a plan or was not able to develop a plan that would be implemented without giving rise to other risks we could face.  Second, I believed that through the maintenance of other reliefs and the change I am making here within the resources available to me, I was making a proportionate response to the needs the farming organisations raised with me.</p></speech>

This is an important incentive to support growth in the Irish small and medium sized business sector.  Start-up ventures have a key role to play in generating economic activity and providing new jobs.  While unemployment rates have decreased, enterprise survival rates over the past five years show that start-up companies continue to struggle.  The relief supports the survival of new start-up companies which should in turn lead to a very gradual broadening of the corporation tax base.</p> <p>  A review of the relief, conducted this year by my Department and published on budget day, found that it is an important support for new businesses.  In 2016, the relief supported 1,051 companies that employ 15,597 people.  Based on the expenditure cost of &euro;5.7 million, the average cost per scheme supported in 2016 was &euro;352.  This section will extend the relief for a further three years until the end of 2021, at which point it will be assessed again.</p></speech>

This change is an acceleration of the rate of restoration of the full value of this relief, which was already due to increase to 100% by 2021.  In 2009, the interest deduction for landlords of residential property was restricted in the context of the financial crisis.  In 2018, it is difficult to justify continuing this restriction on the private residential landlords who are an essential feature of a functioning housing market.</p><p>Interest payments are generally considered to be legitimate business expenses so it is difficult to rationalise why it is not allowable for residential landlords as compared with any other business or even commercial landlords, who have never been subject to such a restriction.  The current interest restriction may incentivise investment in commercial rental property over residential rental property.  Restoration of full interest deductibility for residential property would remove any such possible distortion and should encourage more investment in residential property, thereby improving the supply of residential rental accommodation for tenants.  Furthermore, by improving the net cash position of residential landlords, it is hoped the change will discourage private landlords from exiting the rental market as house prices increase.</p><p>The existence of a restriction on the profit-making capacity of a business incentivises it to increase income streams.  For landlords this means increasing rent.  I am seeking to address at least one incentive to increase rents that is within my direct control at a cost of &euro;80 million in a full year.  I am not suggesting that this will solve all matters in the housing market, but I am determined to ensure that, within the resources available to me, we make contributions to dealing with this grave issue.  This modest amendment is an important measure in budget 2019.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.512" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#EE01300"><p>I do not agree with the section, nor I do agree with the Minister's comments on it.  This is a key reason the budget was labelled a landlords' budget.  It is a giveaway of &euro;80 million a year to landlords.  The Minister might confirm that is the cost.  The &euro;80 million figure is the cost of increasing the rate of relief from a projected 90% to 100% rather than from 80% to 100%.  The total cost of moving from where we were would have been &euro;44 million, according to replies to parliamentary questions.  The Minister has not provided a reasonable justification for the public giving a further tax expenditure to landlords, a group that is doing very well in general from the housing crisis, although there are exceptions.  We have the highest rental yields in the European Union and double the percentage rental yields of those in Britain or Germany.  There is no problem with a private landlord being profitable or incentivising more of them to enter the market.  Those incentives exist.  The problem is the absence of affordable private rented accommodation, and the biggest problem is the absence of affordable public housing.  However, the Government is obviously focused on simply incentivising landlords repeatedly, despite the fact that the housing crisis gets worse daily.</p> <p>  Related to that, is the Minister concerned that this could end up inadvertently incentivising evictions?  One of the ways a landlord can qualify for this interest relief is for making improvements, but substantial improvements are also one of the bases on which a landlord can legally evict people.  Unfortunately, it is one of pretexts used by landlords who wish to get rid of existing tenants so they can hike rents above the existing rent controls.  This measure gives them an extra incentive to take that road.  Has the Minister or the Department considered if that could be a possible effect of the proposal?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.513" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#EE01400"><p>I oppose the section and I agree with Deputy Murphy's comments.</p><p>There is already 100% interest relief for mortgages.  That is for landlords who participate in the HAP scheme.  The effect of this will be to take away that incentive.  That is one issue.  The other major concern is that there is no conditionality whatsoever in this in terms of length of tenure.  There is also no conditionality on affordable rents or security of tenure.  What it does, as has been mentioned, is create the potential to incentivise evictions because, legally, one is permitted to evict a family or individual if one is carrying out substantial repairs.  This incentivises a landlord to carry out major repairs and it is something which, at the bare minimum, should be deleted from the legislation.  It also provides, in a market where there is an issue of supply, a greater incentive to landlords to compete with others.</p><p> The one point on which I agree is that landlords are an essential part of a housing market. That being said, as I mentioned earlier, the prices landlords have been charging have increased by about 60% since 2012.  They are the highest rents ever in the history of the State.  We rightly talk about the housing crisis and the most acute aspect of it, whether it is rough sleepers or the thousands of children and their families who are in emergency accommodation, but it is way broader than that.  There has been a large increase in the number of adults living in the family home.  People in their 20s and 30s cannot aspire to, and do not see a way in which they will, own a home or, in some cases, be able to rent in the capital city because of where rents are at.  This was the big initiative from Government regarding the housing crisis.  It is pathetic, to say the least, and it is without conditionality.  It is a sop to that sector.  It is not appropriate and it shows a Government that is lacking in imagination and which is at a loss as to how to deal with the major crisis and social travesty which has been unleashed as a result of the Minister's party being in government for the best part of almost a decade.  We have a housing crisis that is out of control.  This measure does not fit the Bill.  It has the potential to make things worse with regard to evictions.  I do not know if people come to the Minister's clinics.  I represent a constituency in Donegal where the housing crisis is not as acute as in Dublin, the surrounding areas and in major cities across the State, but it still exists.  One of the mechanisms by which landlords are looking to evict people is carrying out repairs.  Why is there no conditionality?  </p><p> When mortgage interest relief increased to 100% from 75%, a condition applied, which was that a landlord had to be part of the HAP scheme.  The idea of conditionality with mortgage interest relief has been established in finance Bills and approved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There should be conditionality at the very least.</p></speech>

There is no doubt in my mind that is what it is.  I know of several examples in my area where it is being done or has been attempted.  Most notable is one example I have raised on a number of occasions in the D&aacute;il which is a property owned by Apollo Global Management, an enormous asset management company that bought an apartment block from NAMA in central D&uacute;n Laoghaire for a song.  First, it attempted to increase rents by 70%.  It sent people the notification that it would increase the rents the day before the 4% rent cap came in and the residents resisted and kicked up a stink.  I kicked up a stink in the D&aacute;il and it backed off on that but then it came back saying, it would carry out substantial refurbishments and everybody had to leave because it was doing substantial refurbishment to the apartment block.  It was pretty strange because a small number of people in that multi-unit complex had purchased and were not tenants and they had heard nothing about substantial refurbishments.  Substantial refurbishments of the sort this company was talking about would have required the entire place to be done but those apartment owners had heard nothing so it was a ruse to get the tenants out in order that the company could jack up the rent because it had been unable to get the rent increased by 60% or 70%.  I am glad in that case, because we publicised it in the national media and because the residents fought back, Apollo Global Management backed off, although the insecurity it created for many tenants in the block led some to just give up and get out.  It is just one example but people need to know what this stuff means in reality.  Approximately ten of the units in that block, which are perfectly good units, are sitting empty because Apollo Global Management wants to see the value of the property clock up, detenant the place, make life difficult for the other tenants until they all leave and at some point flip the property.  This is where we are at and where our policy of courting - not just incentivising - these people into the property sector supposedly as a means to professionalise the rental sector has been a total disaster.  It has been the biggest mistake ever.  Instead of the Government recognising it has been a disaster and that we need a radical shift in policy away from courting, incentivising and pandering to these people to using public moneys to invest directly in providing affordable housing, we continue to do this kind of thing.  It is madness.  I could not be more strongly opposed to what the Minister is doing here.  What is the point?  I suppose the Minister will argue we need people to provide rental accommodation.  What is the point in rental accommodation that is unaffordable for the majority of people?  I refer to what I-RES REIT tried to do close to my area in Sandyford recently.  We forced it to back off because we kicked up about it in here and the residents protested and so on when it tried to increase the rent by 30% using another loophole.  When I met the residents, the existing rent was &euro;2,200 and the trust wanted to increase it to &euro;2,800.  Who can afford that?  What is the point in supply at that rent?  There is none except to make profit for these guys and to extort people. Ultimately, it is an accident waiting to happen because, at a certain point, even these guys will realise there is no point in them supplying at that cost because nobody will be able to buy or rent it.</p><p>Why would the Minister incentivise these people in that way?  It beggars belief when public money could, and should, be put into directly providing accommodation that is affordable and is not based on profit margins but on making accommodation available that is affordable to people who need it.</p></speech>

This market failure, as I am sure the Minister will be aware, is leading to a significant number of social problems, including homelessness but also, as I am sure many employers have told him, it is difficult for younger people to move to work in Dublin, unless they are from Dublin, and to afford rents.  That is a problem for a country that is selling itself as having an able and eager young workforce.  It is increasingly referenced by employers along with public transport, as being one of the reasons why Ireland and Dublin is, in some cases, quickly pricing itself out of the market in respect of the attractiveness it had for employment creation up to three years ago.  I do not see in the context of the market failure that is the experience of most people, and with which most economic commentators agree, what exact function the amendment serves and I would be grateful if the Minister could explain that.</p><p>Furthermore, because of the market failure and because there are so many voices in the debate, it is important that the Minister makes available to us any lobbying by anybody involved in the rental and property markets in Ireland in the run-up to the budget and the Bill.  We should have made available to us the content of any lobbying that was done, either by way of presentation or in writing, to either the Minister or to his officials.  At this point in time it is difficult to understand where the market is going.  We know where the market is at.  Rents are increasingly unaffordable and the rental market compares with some of the most expensive locations in the world.  That is not where we want to be in the context of our attractiveness for economic development.  Given the difficult challenges that we are faced with on the Brexit front, we need to retain, insofar as we can, some level of competitiveness in order that young people, for whose education taxpayer paid significantly, can aspire to renting at a fair cost a reasonable standard of housing.  Ultimately, perhaps a couple of years later if they are settling down and starting a family, they can aspire to taking out a mortgage.  Much that is now being put back by about ten years.  People who used to buy in their late twenties are now only able to enter into such arrangements in their middle or late thirties and for some it has become almost impossible. </p><p>That has enormous economic consequences.  We are owed an explanation from the Minister on his view of the rental market and his view on how landlords should be treated in the rental market <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>,for instance, renters or purchasers in the market.  If an economic assessment was conducted on the likely impact of these measures for the market and for people, what did it show?</p></speech>

I live in, and have for a long time represented, a constituency that has had to deal with a significant housing need and now has to deal with a different level of housing need.  I am as familiar with the anxiety or worry that this creates as anybody here is.</p> <p>  The focus on housing within the budget is best demonstrated by where we are from an expenditure point of view and the commitment that has been made to housing through Ireland 2040 and the commitments that we have for the next number of years.  The figures speak for themselves.  The total funding for housing in this year's budget is &euro;2.3 billion.  If we compare that to budget 2018, this is an increase of &euro;470 million or a 26% increase.  That funding is being used through the delivery in budget 2019 of 10,000 new social housing solutions.  It will be a mix of building, acquisition, and leasing and looks to provide an additional 17,600 solutions, if they are needed, through the HAP and RAS.</p> <p>  In dealing with the charge that is put to me frequently, particularly by Deputy Boyd Barrett, that we are not doing enough on direct build - he and I have had this debate on a number of occasions, most recently during oral parliamentary questions - for 2019 and beyond, we have a plan in place that will build more social homes every year and looking to build more the year after that.  I was briefly in a meeting earlier, during which it was said that in 2014 for the reasons we are all familiar with, there were approximately 400 homes built directly by the State.  Next year it will be more than ten times that; in 2020, it will be 7,000 units; and, in 2021, it will be 9,000 units.  A key part of the budget overall is the resource commitments that we are making from an expenditure point of view to deal with the great level of need that exists in our society in respect of housing.  </p> <p>  More broadly, as was not touched on by anybody, over the past year or so, the number of homes being built in Ireland increased significantly.  Between 18,000 and 20,000 homes should be built this year, with approximately 25,000 homes built next year.  Supply is a major part of how we will address the difficulties but I accept that it is not the only part.  I accept that there are other measures need to be taken.  This is why we have made the multi-year investment through the serviced site fund to try to further dial up our supply of affordable housing and this is why we have a programme in place.  It was criticised by a number of the members in respect of RPZs.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Murphy, has said that through legislation that he has in hand that he wants to examine ways to make the Residential Tenancies Board more effective.</p><p>There is a focus that respects the level of need that exists within our society.</p><p> I will now turn to some of the specific questions that were put about why I am putting in place such a measure.  I re-emphasise that this is looking to bring forward a scheme and a change that we had committed to doing anyway.  I am just making it happen sooner.  Why am I making it happen sooner?  It is my judgment that on the basis of changes we will see in our housing market across 2019 and beyond, there is a heightened risk of a certain form of landlord looking to leave the sector.  The figures available to me, of which many Members are already aware, show that 86% of landlords in Ireland supply two or more homes.  I have seen with my own eyes in Dublin central what happens when these landlords leave our communities, and a number of Deputies have also experienced this in their own constituencies.  When they leave our communities the tenants either go looking for rental accommodation in an already high income level rental sector, or they cannot get a accommodation at all, which then leads into the social crises of homelessness or really short-term rental accommodation.  By bringing forward this measure my objective is to try to make some kind of contribution to ensure that this kind of landlord continues to have a role to play in the provision of rental accommodation in the State.</p><p> Private landlords are needed in the rental sector.  We need private landlords and we need more kinds of landlords.  We need more of the type of landlord who currently supplies one, two or three homes to one, two or three tenants to stay in the sector.  Given the changes that are under way in house prices and in construction, especially in Dublin, and on the basis of engagement I have had with my Department, it is my judgment that this measure could play a role in dealing with that issue.</p><p> On the issue of engagement with my Department up to this point, I was not lobbied on this matter by any stakeholder.  The origin of this measure was contained in the Report of the Working Group on the Tax and Fiscal Treatment of Landlords, which was published last year.  This measure was one of ten options laid out in the publicly available report, some of which my Department suggested could have an impact on the level of housing need we have depending on the level of resources available within the budget.  This responds to the charges that have been made against us over not recognising the level of housing need within our society currently and the process that got us to that point.  That is my rationale for the measure.</p><p> The final question, which was asked by all Deputies, was whether or not I believe it could play a role in stimulating further evictions beyond what is happening now.  My answer to this question is that I do not believe that is likely to happen because we were due to introduce the measure anyway and we have just brought it forward.  The total amount of additional new resources going into this huge sector as a result of bringing this measure forward is &euro;18 million.  In the context of the hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayer resources that are already going into that sector, I do not believe this &euro;18 million would significantly alter the incentives that are open to landlords.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.520" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#HH00200"><p>The Minister's explanation of why it would not lead to an additional incentive for evictions is not at all convincing.  The idea that it was going to happen anyway does not change things.  Maybe that extra incentive would have been in a couple of years' time when it was due to be implemented, and we would have kicked up about it and opposed it then, so that is not an answer.</p> <p>  The Minister said that we are talking about only &euro;18 million versus the other amount of money that goes into housing is.  Again, this is not relevant to the question of whether a landlord should receive an additional incentive - that they did not have and were not due to have before the budget - to evict a tenant using the grounds of substantial refurbishment and also in being able to benefit from a tax incentive in this instance.  I do not know if the Minister has a better answer or response as to why this measure will not lead to increased evictions.  If the Minister does not have a better answer, then those listening to this debate would have to conclude that it is likely the measure is some additional incentive being provided for landlords to evict tenants.  Given the scale of the housing crisis it is a pretty poor decision for the Government to make.  I accept that this is not the reason or the purpose for which the Government is making this decision but it seems to be a pretty clear inadvertent consequence of that measure, which has now been flagged, and the Government should pull back from going ahead with it at the time of this housing crisis.</p> <p>  We will discuss the broader question of social housing and if the Government builds enough of it.  This is to be measured in actual bricks and mortar, and in the numbers of houses delivered.  So far the Government falls dramatically short, not just marginally short, of what was promised and is needed.  Unfortunately I do not believe this is going to change.  We will see, but as with Fianna F&aacute;il, the Government is ideologically committed to incentivising in various guises the private sector to deliver housing as opposed to the massive State investment that is needed.  The Government likes to deny this but it is seen in the evidence of what it does.</p> <p>   I will now deal concretely with the measure in front of the committee today.  Even if it was the case that the Government was doing everything necessary in respect of social housing, given the current state of the rental market I would still be opposed to giving &euro;18 million extra to landlords in a tax relief.   Even if there was some positive incentive there is clearly a massive deadweight involved.  Given the levels of profits that exist for landlords there is no crisis of profitability.  I referred earlier to the highest rental yields in the European Union.  The figures in the CSO national income and expenditure accounts indicate that the total amount spent on rent was &euro;3 billion, and this is taking out imputed rent in the 2017.  This compares to &euro;1.6 billion in 2010.  That is almost a doubling of income going to rent in this State over the course of seven years.  That money comes from workers' pockets.  This transfer of wealth is already taking place, but it is now added to by this measure.</p> <p>  The Minister said that if we do not keep giving more incentives to the landlords, and not just the incentives that already exist, landlords will exit the sector.  This has echoes of the argument made around corporations, that is, that these corporations will leave if we increase corporation tax, or if we tax them even at the 12.5% we are supposed to.  I would be in favour of increasing the corporation tax.  Whatever water that argument holds in relation to mobile corporations such as Google, Facebook, Apple and so on, a landlord can exit the sector but the house still exists.  The landlord cannot take his or her house or apartment elsewhere.  It remains in the market in some form or other.  It is true that it could go from being a private rented unit to being owner occupied but that is precisely where the State steps in.  If landlords are seeking to exit the sector, and I do not believe there is any evidence for that because the profits in the sector are so massive, the State should be buying those properties and using them for social housing.  There is a massive need for social housing.  If that is the issue then it can be dealt with.  Landlords cannot take their properties and go off somewhere else with them.  The properties exist and are part of the housing market.  They are not able to move away from that.  The argument that every year we should just throw more and more money to landlords does not hold water.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.521" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#JJ00100"><p>The Minister mentioned that 82% of landlords had two or more properties, but I think it is two or fewer properties.  There were a large number of accidental landlords, these being people who entered the market during the boom period.  It is very clear that the Government cannot handle the housing crisis, nor has it been able to get a grip on it during the boom, the bust or into the recovery period.</p> <p>  The Minister said in his Budget Statement that we are making sufficient resources available to meet the demand.  He said that with a straight face and I do not know how he pulled it off.  There is no way the Government is making the necessary resources available to meet the current needs.  There is not a chance of that.  If God spares us and if next year, in whatever capacity, we are debating the matter in the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Taoiseach, I can guarantee that the Government will not have got to grips with the housing crisis nor with the fact that so many people are in need of social housing and so many younger people and couples are unable to get into the property market.  Whereas the indications are that the State is increasing the level of building, and there is increased building, it is nowhere near the level necessary to deal with current levels of demand, not to mind catching up because of the lack of investment for years.</p> <p>  If the Government was genuinely going to drive the issue, instead of letting its ideological viewpoint direct the housing response, we would not have a situation where the Minister is a major shareholder in one of the banks and a substantial shareholder in two other banks, which combined hold 1,000 properties that are lying vacant as we speak.  The banks did the same thing last year.  Every time the banks come before us I ask them to state the number of vacant properties on their books.  They will tell us the number.  I was coming into the office today and there was a radio advertisement where a mother in a hotel room was talking to her child about the house they may have, and then she breaks down.  I do not know the context of that advertisement, but that is indicative of where we are at.  The budget completely fails to deal with the housing crisis.  The Bill has the potential to do the opposite.</p> <p>  It is not as if the Government has been given one go to deal with the crisis.  The Government has been in office for years, but the housing crisis is getting out of hand and is getting worse.  The budget is the time we decide how we allocate resources and we speak of our values as a nation.</p> <p>  We will come to different sections as we progress through the Bill, for example, the intangible assets and bringing them onshore.  The Chairperson of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council stated to our committee that the 80% cap should apply from a time three years ago and this would bring in &euro;750 million.  The Minister does not want to do that.  A sum of &euro;750 million could go a long way to meeting some of the needs of families.  The Minister could, for example, bring in genuine rent relief.  Such a measure, which we argued for in our alternative budget, could provide relief during a three-year period until we would deal with increasing the supply of housing.  This would allow options for people in the sector to be able to get rent relief equivalent to one month's rent per annum.  The Minister decided not to do that but instead he has given a tax break to those renting out property, designed from the pens of Fianna F&aacute;il.  That does not make sense.</p> <p>  I mentioned the Tory party across the water.  Even its members are saying the opposite and are going in the opposite direction from the Minister.  The Minister is proposing more incentives to landlords, despite the fact that landlords have never charged higher rents to tenants in the history of the State.  Despite that, the Minister is proposing more incentives to landlords, whereas in Britain they are getting rid of mortgage interest relief completely and it will go by 2021.  It is a profitable sector.</p> <p>  There are statistics from the Residential Tenancies Board that show that a number of landlords are leaving the system because of registration.  They also show that there is a concentration of properties in certain hands.  There is another factor, which is that if house prices continue in the present direction, they will reach peak again and there will be an incentive for some accidental landlords to sell up and cash in on a property they never wanted.  People who bought a second property as an investment for their pension or for the benefit of their children are cashing in now.  This is a bad idea.  The Minister did not address the issue of conditionality.  At the bare minimum there should be conditionality.  We have 100% tax relief for landlords, but those landlords must take housing assistance payment, HAP, tenants.  There is a social good in that.  Incentives should be based on changing direction or a social good.  The reality is that the only social good in this provision is that the landlords will have deeper pockets.  Landlords will be incentivised in some cases to evict their tenants.  There is nothing to ensure security of tenure for individuals.  The tax relief incentive for participating in the HAP scheme will finish once the Finance Bill is enacted.  Some landlords who were getting 75% mortgage interest relief decided to participate in the HAP scheme to get 100% relief, but there will be no incentive for them to continue because of what the Minister is doing.</p> <p>  The Government is out of touch with what is required to deal with the housing crisis and the point is that as the months roll on we will hear the number.  Right now we can decide how we can generate additional resources so as to ensure we allocate those resources to get to grips with the housing crisis.  This is where the Minister is completely and utterly failing.  The Minister has not failed just this year.  I am speaking to the Minister as a member of the Cabinet which takes collective responsibility, and the Minister for Finance has failed in each of the years in the past seven years.  There is no other reading of the situation.  The current Minister is going to continue to fail because of the type of measure he is coming up with.</p> <p>  Will the housing situation be eventually resolved?  Of course it will and then the Government will beat the drum and say it sorted it.  The point is that we as legislators should not wait for the market to deal with it when it will become so profitable for them that they will start to build houses.  We need to intervene.  There is a complete market failure, but the Minister is not willing to intervene.</p> <p>  We talk about rent pressure zones.  The European Commission published a report earlier this year stating that rent pressure zones were not working.  The data show that rents are rising through the roof.  That is why families cannot afford to make ends meet.  Look at some of the accommodation that is offered on the websites.  We have crowded accommodation that is appalling.  This strips bare what the Minister and his party stands for.  It exposes the ideology of the party in terms that the market will decide what we need to solve this problem.  It has been tried before, with help to buy schemes, extra incentives to landlords, and extra incentives to developers.  What we need is the State to intervene in a meaningful way with the necessary resources to meet the proper targets and not what was announced in this year's budget.</p><p>We need the Minister to intervene as the major shareholder in AIB.  What is he doing to make sure vacant houses are not being held by banks in this State like AIB, Permanent TSB and Bank of Ireland?  They did not appear in the last year.  They have been doing it for the last number of years.  There is a housing crisis right before us.</p><p> I would like to respond to the comments that have been made about homelessness in Dublin by referring to what has been happening in recent days.  Families with children are walking the streets and looking to self-accommodate, but they cannot get accommodation.  Banks are holding onto empty properties that we own.  It is absolutely immoral.  It reminds me of Christy Moore's great song about the Famine - I hope the Minister knows it - which describes how we shipped our food off in our boats to Britain at a time when people here were starving.  The Minister needs to get to grips with this.  He has direct responsibility.  As Minister for Finance and as the major shareholder in the banks, he can take serious initiatives to make sure some of these houses are released.  The wrong decision has been made.  As I said earlier, conditionality should be inserted into this measure as a bare minimum.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.523" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#KK00200"><p>As the Minister has said, we have debated this at length.  Sadly, we are going to continue to have to debate it.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government acknowledged recently that the housing crisis has not peaked.  While this is a very grim prospect, all of us in here know it is true and everybody else fears it is true.  It is difficult to imagine a situation that is worse than the one we have now.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has admitted frankly that the housing crisis is going to get worse.  That is a pretty hopeless space for us to be in.  It is a national shame that the people at the acute end of this crisis are in homeless accommodation.  Children who are being brought up in these circumstances go to school without knowing whether they can face the humiliation of telling their classmates they live in homeless accommodation.  They are unable to bring their friends home to play or for sleepovers.  Every one of us is dealing with families in these circumstances.  I am sure the Minister is dealing with these families as well.  It is shameful.  It pushes us towards despair when we are in our clinics.  Floods of people who are facing these desperate circumstances keep coming to see us in the hope that we can offer them some hope.  However, the situation is continuing to get worse.</p> <p>  The private rented sector is the issue in almost every case.  That is where these people come from.  They have found themselves homeless because of the private rented sector.  When people who are in this dire situation go to the council, in some cases after two years or more in emergency accommodation, they are told to find a HAP tenancy in the private rented sector.  Such tenancies might well exist in places throughout the county where the crisis is not as acute, rents are lower and HAP limits mean something, but in those areas where the crisis is most acute and rent levels are way in excess of the HAP limits, we might as well tell people to go to Mars as tell them to find HAP tenancies.  All we can do in such areas is beg the council to increase the HAP limits to a more appropriate level.  While we have no choice other than to pursue such an approach in the immediate sense, it is a disaster in the macro sense.  This point applies to the Minister's entire housing plan.  Approximately 80% of that plan depends on the private rented sector.  It is not a solution.  The Minister has said that the direct provision of council housing is going to ramp up.  Given that we are starting from a base of almost nothing, of course the percentage will look impressive if the figure increases to 4,000.  Having been at a point where very few council houses were being built, we are now hoping to get up to levels which will not come anywhere close to matching the scale of the crisis.</p> <p>  The vast majority of the solution being offered by the Minister involves the private rented sector.  If it succeeds, the public finances will be looted on a massive scale.  I asked him about this the other day.  Has he calculated what will happen if Rebuilding Ireland works and he gets the 100,000 social tenancies he is hoping to get from the HAP, RAS and leasing schemes?  How much will that cost the State over a period of 20 or 30 years?  The amount of money it will cost is terrifying.  Between &euro;30 billion and &euro;40 billion will be going out over that period of time.  That money could and should be used to invest in the construction of public housing on a massive scale.  Of course the upfront capital investment would be significant, but it would save the State money in the end while providing a much more secure and genuinely affordable form of public housing at the same time.  People living in such houses, unlike every single HAP tenant, would not have to run the risk of the landlord pulling out of the HAP tenancy whenever it suits him or her.  Even if it works, 80% of the Government plan will depend on a precarious form of social housing which will continue to produce a stream of people going into emergency accommodation.  In addition, it will cost the State a fortune.  In fact, it will blow a massive hole in the public finances over the long term.  The Minister, having to failed to acknowledge that this is madness from any point of view, is now going a step further by giving a further tax incentive to these people, which signals that he believes they can help us to solve the housing problem even though that is absolutely not the case.  There is not even a link with affordability.</p> <p>  I would like the Minister to answer a question I asked earlier.  Does he recognise that rents are out of control?  What is the purpose in this case of incentivising a supply of rental property which is unaffordable?  I repeat that I would like to know what the point of that is.  Does the Minister think rents will decrease because of it?  If he does, he is living in cloud cuckoo land.  It is not going to happen.  These guys are pushing for rent increases all the time.  The Minister intends to incentivise them to move into this market.  The only reason they will do so is that they can command these massively high rents, which are useless to anybody.  In the case of the HAP scheme, the State is not even willing to pay these rents.  If such rents are paid, they will blow a black hole in the public finances.  They are completely unaffordable for the vast majority of people looking for rental property.  I will repeat the question I asked earlier.  Who can afford a monthly rent of &euro;2,200?  One would want to be very rich to afford it.  Such rents are being sought in vast swathes of Dublin, where the crisis is most acute.  What is the point of this approach?  The Minister has said he fears that some of these people might pull out of the rental market.  Deputy Paul Murphy provided an answer to that when the said that the houses will remain.  These people cannot take them away.  They cannot put the houses in a suitcase and get on a plane with them.  If it is the case that these people might leave houses sitting empty, as many of them are doing because they do not want the hassle of tenants and prefer to make easy money, we need to put in place severe laws that make it illegal for people to sit on empty properties that could be used for residential purposes, or impose punitive taxes for so doing.  That is how we should deal with the problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.524" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#KK00300"><p>I want to ask the Minister about the Home Building Finance Ireland Bill 2018, which was passed by the D&aacute;il in February of this year having been announced with quite a fanfare.</p><p>I felt it could be helpful.  It would allow a single individual on approximately &euro;50,000 or a couple on up to &euro;75,000 to purchase either a new or second-hand home on the condition of being a first-time buyer.  There has been a fair bit of interest in that Bill.</p><p> The Minister was optimistic about how matters were.  A report published yesterday showed that, across the four Dublin local authorities - I do not know about places like Donegal and the rest of the country - including the two local authorities within my constituency, those being, Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council, only 60 mortgages had been drawn down despite there having been more than 1,000 applications for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan since it was launched to considerable fanfare.  I am discussing areas that the Minister and I know well, for example, newer developments in Dublin 15 and low-cost housing that could be identified as doer-ups in various parts of Dublin 7.  It is feasible, particularly if one or both parties have relations in the building trade who can help with doing up the property.  In much of Dublin 15, one can just about scrape by and get a mortgage of &euro;300,000 on a 30 or 40 year old three-bedroom house that requires doing up.  I am in favour of that.  As I am sure the Chairman is aware, there were in previous decades low-rise mortgages all over Ireland, particularly Dublin, as well as rent-to-buy and shared ownership arrangements.  For instance, many Army privates bought in places like Dublin 15, Carlow and Kilkenny to house themselves and their families.  I am in favour of a return of that approach.  Instead of houses falling into the hands of just some landlords because others have been forced by banks to sell because the value of the property has risen, they have the possibility of selling to an individual or couple who want to buy the house for their home.  That is positive socially.  To put the icing on the cake, such a couple in an area like St. Mochta's in Dublin 15, which the Minister knows well, would be lucky to rent a three-bedroom house for between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,400 per month but could get a mortgage at a monthly cost of &euro;800 or &euro;900.  The figures outside of Dublin are better, as rents there are not quite as high.</p><p> I appreciate the Minister's positivity and goodwill towards the housing market, but he funds this departmental scheme.  It is finance based in order to allow people to purchase after saving up large amounts.  This is part of the dysfunction of the market.  The cost of a mortgage is significantly below that of renting.  If that is not a broken market, I do not know what is.</p><p> Many people are interested in this scheme, but I know some who have been turned down.  I do not know whether the officials working in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government or the councils understand the economics of people's ordinary lives.  For example, I know of a well-established tradesman who is married to someone who has a well-established small hairdressing business.  They have one child but do not have large childcare costs because their child is in fourth class in primary school.  They were passed for this scheme but were turned down overall.  I do not know why because everything about their income and so on stacked up.</p><p> There is a problem with Government leadership, in that it is not facilitating.  The Government is all about spin and there is not enough information on this scheme to help people, including civil servants on lower wages in the Minister's own Department who might be ideal candidates for the starter element of this scheme.  It does not add up.  The Government launched the scheme and it received great publicity.  I have been trying to track how many mortgages have been drawn down, but I could not find any for a long time.  I wondered whether the scheme was even operating.  Now I am told that the number of mortgages drawn down is 60 out of more than 1,000 applications.  What else can I say about how dysfunctional everything has become?</p><p> Many of the accidental landlords who were referenced are being forced to sell by the banks.  Could someone take note and check to see what the problem is with the scheme so that we can get people to take it up?  These are families who, instead of renting, would like to get on the property ladder.  Every previous scheme was able to function, so I cannot understand why the Government cannot get this one to do so.</p><p> Many people want to quit being landlords.  If the Government remains unable to address a dysfunctional and failed market, this tinkering around will not do much to incentivise them to stay in the scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.526" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#LL00200"><p>This is a particular narrow issue within a much wider crisis.  The context is the need for much greater capital investment in affordable housing, social housing, cost rental and so on.  On this issue, though, there is no getting away from the fact that, given the RTB figures, there has been a reduction of 2,000 in the number of tenancies and almost 3,000 in the number of landlords in 12 months.  Where are the people who were in those properties 12 months ago today?  Some are in emergency accommodation, be it a family hub, hotel or something else.  I do not think that anyone present has said interest should not be a legitimate deduction, although the rate can be argued.  I believe it is a legitimate deduction for what is a trade or business and should be at a rate of 100%.  When one speaks to landlords who have left the market, they say that they did so because of the hassle of being a landlord of just one or two properties or because their properties were loss making and they were paying tax on a loss, which is the reality for many landlords in the market.</p> <p>  This provision is a modest measure and will make some difference to a certain number of landlords to help them stay in the market.  It is not going to turn the crisis in the other direction though.</p><p>The 3,000 landlords who left the market in 12 months are not the big institutional investors or the REITs, they are the people who own one or two properties.  In addition to having blocks of apartments bought by investors, we need to have rental properties peppered around the place in every housing estate.  There needs to be a supply that is diverse and spread throughout rural and urban Ireland.  Those are small, domestic landlords who actually own the properties.  From our point of view, interest on a mortgage associated with an investment property is a legitimate deduction.  Being a landlord is a business and it should be treated as a legitimate deduction in that regard.  The easiest thing in the world is to vilify landlords.  We talk about a housing crisis and we need builders to build houses.  We talk about the rental market and we need landlords to provide supply in a rental market.  This is a very modest step.  It will not turn the crisis in the opposite direction but it will help.</p></speech>

I am not being unduly positive.  I am not trying to sound in any way inappropriately optimistic about the level of need that exists or about the level of anxiety that I know this issue causes for many.  I am stating some facts in addition to the other facts that are being presented by Deputies.  The fact I am stating is that the number of homes being built in our country is increasing.  It will go up again next year.  We are building more social homes directly than was the case in recent years.  We will build more this year than the year before.  We will look to build more across the coming period.  We are committed to delivering that.  Amid the level of need to which the Deputy is referring, there are also many other needs that she expects me to meet; for example, in the context of our healthcare and education systems.  What I try to do on behalf of Government is allocate the proceeds of what we raise through taxes to fund those competing demands.  My contention is that there has been a significant increase in funding this year.  These are the facts.  There has been an increase in funding.  We will see more homes being built.  We will also see a growing number of homes being delivered through either social housing solutions or direct build from the State.  If Deputies are entitled to express their values and acknowledgment regarding the level of worry and pain that is being caused to citizens, then I am equally just stating the fact that in a number of areas, through resources we are making available or changes in homes that are being built, progress is being made and that we need to make more and do more.  I see at first hand the issues the Deputy is referring to.  I see them every day.  They are a reminder to me of what further progress needs to be delivered.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked me for my view on rents.  I acknowledge that rent levels are too high for many families and citizens.  I want them to stabilise and be affordable.  There is a certain kind of landlord that we need to keep in the sector and, unlike the Deputy, I am of the view that private landlords have a role to play.  It is not my role to offer, on behalf of the taxpayer, resources to landlords that are too high.  However, the latter have a role to play.  This is a really targeted measure that looks to treat expenses in other kinds of businesses for small business owners in the same way for landlords expenses regarding mortgage interest.  That is all it seeks to do.  As I have said on a number of occasions, my view, on the basis of engagement I had with my Department, is that this can contribute to keeping a certain kind of landlord in the sector.  In the absence of such landlords, the level of social need we face could increase even more.  That is why I am making this decision.  One can decide that it is right or wrong, but that is why I am doing it and that is why I have put it in place.  That is the rationale behind it.</p> <p>  On the question Deputy Burton posed about the scheme, I will come back to her on the drawdown to which she refers.  I imagine the reason is the amount of time that has to elapse for the evaluation of mortgage applications but I am not aware of the latest figures the Deputy referred to - I was not here during the week - but I will follow up on it and come back to her with a note on it.  There should be a good reason for the issue the Deputy raised.  If there is one, I will find out what it is and come back to the Deputy on it.</p> <p>  On the point Deputy Pearse Doherty put regarding my values and my role in this, I fully accept my role as a member of Government in respect of where we stand from the point of view of housing.  However, I will point to the funding we are putting into housing and the variety of policy measures that are being put in place beyond this very narrow measure we are discussing.  It is my contention that, in its totality, this represents a Government looking to fully understand this issue and looking to make a very significant further effort to deal with this issue in 2019 and beyond.</p></speech>

I appreciate that we have to move on.</p> <p>  We have had this debate nearly every year in the recent years and we have the same response from the Minister for Finance, namely, that efficient, necessary resources are going in to deal with the crisis.  The reality is very different.  I acknowledged there has been a reduction in the number.  Many of those people who have left the sector owned houses that are now owned by the banks and which are lying empty.  The Minister did not respond to that.  He is the Minister.  He is the person who holds the shareholding in AIB on behalf of the Irish State.  He is the person who holds the shareholdings in Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB.  There are 1,000 houses lying empty.  The Minister talked about facts.  These are the facts.  I am not disputing the Minister's facts but let me tell him other facts.  Michal was the 27th homeless person to die on our streets in the past 16 months.  He died this week.  That is appalling.  When Jonathan Corrie died four years ago across the road from Leinster House the whole nation was talking about it.  We all knew his name because it was so close to the seat of power and it was unique.  Unfortunately, it is no longer unique because 27 homeless people have died on our streets in the past 16 months.  This Christmas, 4,000 children will spend Christmas in emergency accommodation.  That does not rest with an act of God.</p><p>The Government decided in the past and has decided now that the market will sort this out and that it will provide resources, but not a sufficient amount, to deal with this issue.  That is the reality and it may be painful for the Minister to hear.  I know him personally and that he is a good person but the reality is that the policies the Cabinet is introducing has made this crisis worse.  I would not be doing my job if I did not point that out, and I will continue to point that out every single bloody year until we sort this out.  We are far better than this, far better than seeing citizens, whose names we do not know, dying on our streets because they have no homes.  We can take collective action to gather the necessary resources and deal with this issue on an emergency basis.  This measure is not greatly significant in the overall context.  It is an example of where the Government is at in addressing this issue.  It is that market ideology that is making this crisis worse.  People do not have the time.  Michael did not have the time and the other 26 people who died in the past year and a half did not have the time.  Major damage, emotionally and psychologically, is being done to children across this State because of their living conditions.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.545" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#NN00200"><p>I will make a brief comment as we have had this discussion.  Unfortunately, the discussion has had to move on to the streets because I do not believe the Government really gets it.  The anniversary of Jonathan Corrie's death will be on 1 December.  The National Homeless and Housing Coalition, which was set up in response to his death and held a vigil outside the Dail two years ago, has called for another national demonstration for 1 December, following the 3 October Raise the Roof protest.  People protested on 3 October in the hope that in this budget the Government would change tack, and that it would encompass a radical move to address a crisis that the Minister with responsibility for this area has acknowledged has not peaked.  This may be one of the few opportunities in the debate on this Bill that we get to discuss what could have been included in the budget to provide for housing.  This amendment sticks in the craw because even though it is a relatively small one, it is part of an approach the Government seems to be taking underpinned by a belief that the private rented sector will substantially help us to solve the problem when in fact it is the dysfunctionality of the private rented sector and of the private market generally which has helped generate some of the worse aspects of the crisis.  We accept, for the time being at least, that there will be private landlords and some of them will provide accommodation that will assist in addressing the situation but the problem is that it is not a secure sustainable basis to solve the crisis.  The bulk of the Government's housing plan, Rebuilding Ireland, depends on this sector and the bulk of the Government's policies seem to be focused on supporting, incentivising and pandering to people who see the provision of accommodation as a means to make money.  It is that commodification of housing that has reached very extreme proportions in Ireland that is at the base of the current crisis.  That is the frustration.  There is nothing in what the Minister said that gives me much hope that the Government will change tack.</p></speech>

I am delighted the Minister will follow up on the fact that while 1,000 applications were received under this measure only 60 loans were drawn down.  He has oversight of our national finances.  A great deal of public relations effort and promotion was put into the launch of that measure which has resulted in only resulted 60 loans being drawn down.  I am referring to people buying houses supported by a loan to the value of &euro;240,000 to &euro;280,000, depending on which part of the country the person is living in, plus their deposit.  We are talking about the middle to the lower end of the private housing and usually the second-hand market and "doer-uppers".  The price of many of the new builds in Dublin 15 and Dublin 7, which I am sure the Minster is familiar, is around half a million euro.  That is the price to which they have moved.  I draw the Minister's attention to the new houses being built on the main road in Glasnevin.  I believe they will cost much more than that, possibly &euro;600,000.  We have a responsibility to people on relatively low incomes, teachers, nurses and civil servants starting out in their careers.  Something is going fundamentally wrong in Irish society when people like those who are working hard and contributing to the economy have little, if any, hope of buying a house.  The Minister can disagree with my views on that but socially that is a disaster.</p></speech>

I have to offer their families and communities more than just my sympathy.  I must offer them what we are seeking to do to respond to their loss.  As part of this budget, I have made between &euro;40 million and &euro;60 million available to respond to that level of need by this Christmas.  When I stand in front of projects such as O'Devaney Gardens that are being built and in front of hubs being turned into homes and accommodation in the part of the country I know best for people who are homeless, that is my response to that issue.  That is what I am seeking to do to respond to the tragedies to which the Deputy has referred.  Their loss of life is something to which I must respond in more than mere words.  In this budget and in recent budgets I have introduced that is what I have sought to do.  The fact that we have seen a reduction in rough sleeping does not offer me any comfort, rather it demonstrates the reason we need to reduce it even more.  As a rich democracy we must get to a point where all those who are homeless have the option of a bed and accommodation.  The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has stated that is his objective and in decisions we have made in this budget we have sought to  back that up.</p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Boyd Barrett's comments, I do not believe that free markets can operate in such a way to meet social need on their own.  Neither do I believe his claim that a person earning a living from providing housing to somebody in and of itself commodifies the supply of housing.  Private landlords and the private sector has a big role to play in providing homes.  No state on its own can meet the level of housing need its citizens have without doing many other things that, in my view, would be unacceptable to their citizens.  We need to have a mixed market responding to that.</p><p>It is a small measure which looks to prevent a further type of landlord leaving this sector.  If we have the honour to be back here in this room in a year's time and even more landlords have left the sector, the Deputy will be asking me why I did not do more to stop it happening.  I am trying to do that.</p></speech>

The purpose of the measure is to ensure that the relief operates as intended to increase the supply of residential accommodation provided on a home-sharing basis.  Rent-a-room relief was introduced in 2001 as an incentive to increase the supply of residential accommodation for rent.  The amendment is an anti-avoidance measure that puts beyond doubt that the relief does not apply to short-term tourist accommodation based on home-sharing, including that provided via Internet booking sites.  The amendment introduces a minimum continuous rental period of 29 days to exclude tourist-type lettings from the incentive expressly.  It will not affect the existing application of rent-a-room relief to certain types of shorter term residential accommodation that are not leisure or business related.  These include the provision of accommodation for respite care, language students or four-day-a-week "digs".</p> <p>  The section introduces a new subsection (3C) into section 216A and provides that the relief will not apply to that part of the income that arises from stays shorter than the minimum continuous rental period of more than 28 days.  The subsection also provides legislative confirmation for the existing Revenue position that income from certain short-term lets, including lettings for respite care for incapacitated persons, accommodation for full or part-time students, including language students, and four-day-a-week digs, qualifies for the relief notwithstanding that the stay may be of shorter duration than the new minimum period.  The new subsection also provides that, where the income arises from stays of shorter duration, Revenue may seek proof from the individual availing of the relief that the accommodation was provided for respite care or students or as digs.  The section will apply for 2019 and subsequent years.</p></speech>

A particular issue arises where a company has raised investments under the employment and investment incentive, EII, scheme over three years, as many research and development companies do.  The earlier investors will wish to be bought out, but that will trigger a reduction in relief if the later investors are still within their compliance periods.  If a company has successfully used EII-supported funding to grow and, for example, launch a product such that it can now raise cheaper bank financing, then the State should not prevent that company from switching its source of capital.  I am proposing, therefore, that buying out earlier shareholders will not trigger a clawback of relief in the following circumstances.</blockquote><p>The first condition is that it has been 18 months since the company last raised EII funding.  The intention of this timeframe is to ensure the cash raised is not used to fund the buy-back of shares.  The second condition is that the company does not raise EII funding for at least 12 months after the buy-back.  Again, the intention is to ensure EII funding is not used as cashflow to fund the buy-back.  If a company has successfully transitioned to alternative financing, the hope is it is unlikely to need to raise EII funding again.  However, I recognise that things do not always run smoothly for new businesses.  Therefore, while it is hoped, once companies are in a position to raise alternative funding, they will not need the support of EII, I do not want to close the door on them in raising EII funding again.  The proposed 40-month period between EII fund raising rounds strikes an appropriate balance between protecting the Exchequer and supporting start-up companies.</p><p> Amendment 107 clarifies that where the withdrawal of relief is from the company, the company cannot offset losses or charges against the tax arising.  Equally, the close company surcharge which would ordinarily apply to amounts charged to tax under Case IV of Schedule D does not apply.  Both of the proposed clarifications are in recognition that the charge to tax is simply a collection mechanism for a tax relief no longer due, as the company has not actually earned any income.</p><p> Amendment 108 is an anti-avoidance measure.  Where investors are connected with the company, as they can be for investments under SCI, the proposed new measure for micro start-ups, there was a concern that arrangements could be entered into whereby any clawback of relief from the company would not be paid.  Therefore, I am proposing to allow a secondary recovery mechanism against the investors where such arrangements are entered into.</p></speech>

That will come later in the form of the Bill as amended on Committee Stage, but perhaps the Department might provide us with a readable summary of the changes we are actually making.  It is far from ideal to try to read the changes proposed, relate them to the Bill and then the principal Act.  We need to know exactly what is being changed.  We are likely to be discussing this issue again on Report Stage.  If we could see a consolidated version of what exactly we are doing in advance of the next Stage, it would be very helpful.</p></speech>

It includes legislating for the extension of the relief beyond 2020, providing for a regional uplift, subject to state aid approval, implementing a new application procedure and putting applications for the relief on a self-assessment footing.  Should Deputies wish me to expand on any of the aforementioned items, I can, at their request, read the speaking note on section 24.  For the moment I will be speaking only to the proposed Committee Stage amendments to the Bill, as published.  </p><p>As I have stated, the Bill will provide for a new application process in order to obtain relief.  It will separate the current application process between the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Revenue Commissioners.  The new procedure will result in the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht being provided with taxpayer confidential information for the purposes of the application.  Amendment 122 amends section 24 of the Finance Bill to introduce a provision which will designate the aforementioned Department as a &ldquo;service provider&rdquo; for the purposes of section 851A of the 1997 Taxes Consolidation Act.  The change will ensure personal and commercial information revealed to that Department for tax purposes under the new application process will be protected against unauthorised disclosure.  Additionally, the remaining amendments provide for a number of technical amendments to the legislation, as published, to ensure the provisions introduced as part of section 24 will operate as intended.</p></speech>

I pointed out that it would be a clarification of a condition already attached to section 481 tax relief, which requires that the relief produce quality employment.  Essentially, my amendment sought to define and clarify the meaning of "quality employment".  I do not understand how the ruling could have been made.</p></speech>

If anything, we need to increase investment in film industry and the arts generally.  The film industry has enormous potential.  We have a massive pool of creative talent, with a fantastic tradition in acting, film making and writing, as well as excellence on the technical and construction side of film making.  These talented people have produced an amazing legacy of film production in Ireland.</p><p>We could do a hell of a lot more.  We are underperforming compared with where we could be.  In the same way as Ireland has a literary tradition that internationally punches way above its weight for a small country like ours, we could do exactly the same with film.  I favour dramatically increasing the amount of public investment in film production.  However, I have a big problem with the manner in which it is being done.  Much of that problem relates to section 481 tax relief.</p><p> The current tax relief has a condition that film in order to qualify for section 481 tax relief should "act as an effective stimulus to film making in the State through, among other things, the provision of quality employment and training opportunities".  When representatives of the Irish Film Board and Screen Producers Ireland appeared before the Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht essentially to make the case for the continuation of section 481 relief - there has been a pretty sustained media campaign by certain people in the film industry to try to ensure the continuation of section 481 - they claimed the industry sustained 17,000 jobs, which is a lot of jobs.  This relief is worth &euro;70 million to &euro;80 million a year, added to which is &euro;10 million to &euro;15 million in Irish Film Board grants: we are talking about a lot of public money.  As I said I do not begrudge that: in fact I would like to double it.  However, it is supposed to be conditional on "the provision of quality employment and training opportunities".  If it were true that there were 17,000 quality jobs with training opportunities, one would say it is money well spent, but the problem is that just is not true.</p><p> The Minister has a responsibility to look at that very closely.  Generally as he knows, all these tax reliefs which are worth billions of euro every year need to be examined very thoroughly to ensure they are achieving the objectives they are supposed to achieve.  In the case of this one, it simply is not true that there are 17,000 jobs in the industry.  Today if one looked one would probably find a few hundred people are working in the film industry in Ireland - not a few thousand and definitely not 17,000.  If one looked a bit further one would find a tiny minority of them, if any, are working in what might be described as quality employment.  Hence the amendment I tabled.</p><p> I ask the Minister directly to define what is quality employment.  Employment in the film industry is absolutely precarious because people who work in that industry are effectively a "hire 'em and fire 'em" workforce employed on an if-and-when basis from production to production by special purpose vehicles which are established for making a particular film and then disappear when that film is complete even though standing behind those special purpose vehicles are other companies that have a permanent existence.  I do not know how familiar the Minister is with this.  For each film production a new special purpose vehicle, SPV, is set up.  The company standing behind it gets the money but the SPV employs the workers and then disappears.  It appears like a mushroom and then disappears in a puff of smoke leaving the workers with absolutely no rights and entitlements.</p><p> Only about eight to 12 companies get the bulk of section 481 tax relief.  The workers, who never get formal employment by the parent company but are working for the same people again and again, are not treated as employees, or if they are treated as employees they are only treated as employees for the duration of that production.  They have no guarantee when the next production comes along that the company will take them back if the company decides it does not want to take them back.  It is totally precarious.</p><p> Thursday's "Prime Time" programme did a veritable hatchet job on workers who were protesting about precarious employment in the industry.  In that programme a contractor in the industry said that when he entered the film industry he did not expect any security of employment, permanent employment or continuity of employment.  If a contractor wants to have a totally precarious existence because that is their business, that is up to them.  I do not understand why anybody would want that, but it is up to them.  However, it is total precariousness that every worker in the industry should have to expect that and put up with it.  I think he actually used the phrase, "You're only as good as your last job", and that is defined by the production company that gets the section 481 relief and has no obligations to employees it may have employed on and off for 15 or 20 years.</p><p> Those workers were then vilified by RT&Eacute; in a shameful "Prime Time" programme.  I have great time for RT&Eacute; and public service broadcasting.  However, what it did on Thursday bordered on being unethical in its treatment of workers who are protesting about the total precariousness of their employment conditions.</p><p> Some workers may have worked for the same parent company again and again.  However, if they ask for their rights and say they did not want to work hours in excess of the working time directive, the company may refuse to take them back.  If they are transport workers and it is unsafe to work excessive hours when driving to transport equipment but they dare to say anything about that, they will be considered troublesome and the contractor who employs the transport workers for the SPV, which in turn is really working for the parent company that gets the relief, may refuse to take them back because they are insisting on working what are legally safe hours.  It is totally unacceptable.  I should add that none of these people has pension entitlements.  I met people on sets who had been working for 20 years with no pension entitlements at all.</p><p> The representatives of Screen Producers Ireland have agreed that they need to do something about training.  However, nothing has actually been done about training.  There is no training pathway that stipulates that after a particular amount of hours working on film productions a trainee then becomes qualified and is entitled to certain entitlements as a qualified person in that particular grade of film production.</p><p>That does not exist.  Someone can be a trainee for years and never be deemed to be actually qualified because it suits the film production companies and they get people cheaper or whatever the case may be.  This is not acceptable and it does not fit any definition, unless the Minister can tell me how these working conditions for people who, I repeat, in many if not most cases have worked for the people who are getting all this relief and who have a permanent existence with their companies but those companies state they have no obligations to these workers even though they have worked for them many times, can be defined as quality of employment and training opportunities.</p><p> To back up my argument, much of the defence of the status quo by the film producers and film board in this regard is based on stating that film is different, that people do not understand how it is different and that is just the way it is in film.  Recently, I met somebody who works in animation and animation does not work like that.  Animation is about making animated films, and I presume just like with normal films there is a certain precariousness in terms of when people will get a project, yet animation companies manage to employ people on a permanent basis with pension entitlements and rights as employees.  They seem to have got it right.  In fact, the Irish animation industry, based on what I would call more proper quality conditions of employment and training, is a world beater.  The Irish animation industry is a big hitter on the international stage.  The idea we must accept total precariousness in film production is disproven by what is happening in animation.  There is no justification for the continued precariousness that those who are the recipients of section 481 seem to insist has to exist in the industry.</p><p> I believe the "Prime Time" programme was directly related to this debate and the fact this section of the Bill deals with the renewal of section 481 relief.  It was part of the very sustained campaign to retain this relief.  It is very disappointing that "Prime Time" waded in in the way it did in a very biased manner on one side of the debate and essentially tried to smear those who have a different view on how the film industry should be organised.  I was interviewed for the piece.  The journalist involved put on camera contractors who defended the precarious situation and who stated groups such as the Irish Film Workers Association that are demanding security of employment are just trying to control the industry, just want a closed shop and all this other stuff that was thrown at them.  The journalist stated he had offered film workers the opportunity to come on camera to talk about the allegations they are making about blacklisting of union activists or people demanding their rights but that he could not find anybody to go on camera.  The public was completely misled on this and I will cite the evidence because it is important in terms of the Minister's consideration of this issue and the section generally, and my proposed amendment that was ruled out of order.</p><p> In one of these committee rooms, at the first hearing of the Joint Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Equity representative from SIPTU, not the Irish Film Workers Association that was maligned very badly in "Prime Time", was asked by me whether there is blacklisting in the industry.  I sent the journalist the transcript of that meeting before "Prime Time" aired and stated if he was telling me he could not find evidence of people in the industry saying there is blacklisting that he look at the arts committee hearing where the SIPTU Equity representative stated there was widespread blacklisting.  The Equity representative went further at that meeting and stated Equity had done a survey that, if I remember correctly, indicated approximately 70% of people surveyed were in fear of blacklisting and not being re-employed in the industry if they rocked the boat.  Furthermore, dozens of members of the GMB union, not mentioned largely in "Prime Time" and, again, not the Irish Film Workers Association, attempted to phone the journalist to state they would speak to him on camera about blacklisting in the industry.  That was not acknowledged on "Prime Time".  The journalist did not talk to them and refused to take their calls but then stated he could not find anybody to speak about these things.  Furthermore, on a protest outside Ardmore Studios the journalist did interviews on camera with people who said they had been blacklisted but he did not present those recordings as part of the documentary.  He completely misled the public as to the other side of the debate.</p><p> There is a sustained campaign to deny the fact there is a serious precariousness problem in the industry.  I want to say to all of those involved, including the Minister and the film producers, this is not good for the Irish film industry.  The retention of this relief should be absolutely conditional on a clearly defined definition of quality of employment, which would involve some level of security and continuity for employees.  I want to stress those employees recognise the work is project to project.  In decent parts of construction, not where there are bogus self-employment issues but where it is done properly, people are employed directly for a job by a particular construction firm.  That project may end but unless the person has done something absolutely appalling the firm will take the person back on for the next project.  People build up pension entitlements and rights as an employee which accumulate.  This is not the situation in the film industry.</p><p> I put it to the Minister this has to be the definition of quality employment and giving out this very generous tax relief must be conditional on it.  I want it noted in this regard that an all-party Oireachtas committee, at which all parties here were present, made a recommendation that we need to look at the question of continuity of employment, quality of employment and a proper structure in terms of training and career progression.  It also made a recommendation that there should be a stakeholders' forum for the film industry for the various grades, including contractors, producers, politicians for that matter and anyone with a genuine stake in it.  It should include all grades of workers and no organisation should be excluded from it.  The campaign of recent weeks has been to try to exclude specific groups on the basis of hearsay-type allegations.  I have no doubt, by the way, this has got very bitter on both sides but there should be a will on the part of everyone to get over the bitterness.  The only way this can be done is if all sides state they are willing to sit together in a room to try to work this out to the benefit of everybody.  The Minister needs to set down a marker that giving this relief will be contingent on convening that forum recommended by the all-party committee.</p><p>He should set down a marker that this stuff cannot go on in terms of precarity of employment and that having a genuine stakeholder consultative body where issues and problems can be ironed out in a fair and reasonable way should be the condition of getting this film relief.</p></speech>

It is great to hear him acknowledge that in the context one area of creativity, this country is living in a golden period because I think we are with regard to literature.  Wonderful things are afoot across many genres from many young and more established writers.  I fully agree with the Deputy about that.</p> <p>  I assure him that all the decisions regarding section 481 and the amendments relating to it were made well before that edition of "Prime Time" and were based on other factors.  The Deputy asked about employment and the scale of the sector.  According to their analysis of section 481 applications received in 2016, the Revenue Commissioners estimate that the number of employees directly engaged in section 481 productions is 2,158 full-time equivalents.  A cost-benefit analysis carried out by my Department estimates that a further 902 people are involved in direct employment.  On the basis of work by the Revenue Commissioners and my analysis and that of my Department, our judgment is that between 3,000 and 3,100 people are directly employed on section 481 projects.  In respect of other figures that have been quoted to us, a study carried out by Olsberg SPI found that the audiovisual sector supported approximately 14,370 jobs.  It is important to note, however, that this study included a very broad audiovisual sector as opposed to just film.</p></speech>

I look at the work happening in animation, whether it be the companies located in the Chairman's constituency where the success has been amazing or the great work done by Cartoon Saloon and Brown Bag Films, a global employer of Irish origin.  These are two local companies that are now successful globally.  In the aftermath of my Department's review of it, we believe that section 481 can play a role in preserving the interests of industry, ensuring its long-term sustainability and, hopefully, creating a platform from which it can do even better in the future.</p> <p>  The other area that will be increasingly important is creative content that we supply and that is then provided through what are now established channels, namely, Netflix, Amazon and Apple TV.  Small screen creative content represents a significant opportunity for Ireland in the future.  If we can get creative clusters together, which we are doing, we have a great opportunity to be able to do well within that medium.  As I look at what has been the rationale for this relief in the past, I have identified two areas that will be even more important to me in the future.</p> <p>  I listened carefully to what the Deputy said because he has raised this matter with me on a number of occasions.  I am aware of some of the debates that are developing.  In respect to a forum within Government by which this matter could be considered, an audiovisual steering group has now been established within Government that includes officials from my Department.  As a result, my Department will participate in this along with the Revenue Commissioners.  In addition, the group will involve the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, which one would expect, along with the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Education and Skills.  The effective operation of this tax credit will be one of the early items on the agenda.  This group will participate in the screen industry education forum.  I do not know if the Deputy is aware of this forum.  Perhaps this is a way of pulling together a group of all stakeholders in the way to which the Deputy referred.  The forum will hold its first meeting on 19 November next.  My understanding is that the aim of this forum is to focus on how skills can be developed within the sector and opportunities with the sector.</p> <p>  There is a point worth making - and the Deputy did touch on it - about the nature of this industry.  The fact that it is production to production means that work patterns are very different to those in other parts of our economy - even construction, to which the Deputy referred.  It operates project to project but it does tend to happen within large and existing companies that are able to move their workers from project to project.  The nature of some creative industries is determined by the fact that they are project to project.  The employers behind those projects differ.  This means that work patterns are different.  I am laying out that I will keep this relief in place for a further four years.  I have outlined the reasons for this.  As my officials will participate on the working group.  We will look at issues regarding how we can ensure that this industry is more sustainable in the future and ensure the skills development and quality employment referred to by the Deputy that are carved out as qualifying criteria for this relief can be developed.  I will rely on feedback from my officials with regard to progress and take that progress into account in terms of future decisions I make with regard to the operation of this relief.</p></speech>

I welcome the news about the screen education and training forum.  On that point, there have been commitments and promises about having a proper structure for training for quite a long time.  There has been report after report that this would be done but nothing was done.  To give the Minister some sense of what is at stake, one of the people I met on a recent protest at Ardmore Studios.  The protest in question involved workers who believe they are being blackballed out of the industry because they have, essentially, asserted their rights.  Many of them are involved with the Irish Film Workers Association and the GMB.  The young man in question rang me the following day.  I had never met him before.  Perhaps he did not want to bring it up because he was embarrassed.  He is an apprentice painter trying to make his way in the film industry.  During our phone conversation, he revealed that he had done his entire apprenticeship trying to make his way in the film industry while living in emergency accommodation.  In fact, he went from one form of homeless accommodation to another.  He has children who he could not see because he does not have a stable place to live.</p><p>I spent last week interacting with Mr. Brendan Kenny in the housing department of Dublin City Council.  In fairness, we came to an agreement that would sort things out for this young man who for four years has been living in emergency accommodation while trying to pursue his painting apprenticeship working in the very precarious environment that is the film industry.  It is just not on.  The Institute of Art, Design and Technology, IADT, is in my area.  It is a fantastic institution, with wonderful people and equipment put in in recent years.  It also has great training courses, but is this level of precarity the future for those who graduate?  People will not know where they stand from film production to film production.  I refer to those who have the power to make decisions and whether people are liked.  There are many allegations and a level of bitterness on all sides of the dispute ongoing in the film industry which is both unfortunate and depressing.  It is such a pity that that is the case when we have this fantastic potential about which we have spoken.  The issue could be resolved if we made the public moneys going into the industry conditional on providing some level of security, for continuity of employment, entitlements and rights in order that there would be an actual career path.  How is it supposed to be possible for people to take out a mortgage, pay rent or even find a landlord if there is no security of employment for them next month or in six months' time because of the nature of the business?  If the industry was not so heavily publicly subsidised, we could say it was just the private market.  However, a lot of State money is going into the industry. Surely the provision of State money should be conditional on something much better.  I refer to trainees or, in this case, apprentices not living in homeless accommodation or people not being able to take out a mortgage from a bank because their employment status is completely precarious and dependent on them "not rocking the boat".  I use the words of the Equity spokesperson.  </p><p> I take the Minister's point which is why I have mentioned this issue.  I am glad that he acknowledged the point about the animation sector.  It proves that it does not have to be like this.  How can the animation sector maintain continuous, decent and secure employment for its employees and at the same do a fantastic job such that it will be a player on the international scene?  It is able to compete with the absolute best and sought after.  As it can offer proper conditions of employment and standing companies, I am happy to give it backing, all of the backing we can possibly give it.  It is quality employment.  It is something into which people might go and see career progression, but that is not what is going on in the rest of the film industry and that issue has to be addressed.  We cannot just have promises that we will look at training and all other issues as we have had in the past.  We need the Government to state the issues in the film industry will be addressed now.  There are peculiarities to the film industry, but there are ways to deal with them.  The animation industry shows that it can be done, even with those peculiarities.  Screen training is a good start, but the forum that was promised needs to happen.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, need to state nobody is being excluded from it.  If we start to operate on the basis that groups will malign each other and with mud being slung all over the place, there will not be a forum or we will not have one that will mean anything because half of the people affected by its decisions will have been left outside the door.  That is not going to work.  Everybody has to be involved.  As the Minister rightly said - it is fantastic that he has said it - the number involved in the industry have turned out to be a fraction of what was stated to the committee by the Irish Film Board.  It came here and stated it was 17,000, but the Minister is saying it is 2,800.   There should be questions about that.  How could it have come here and stated the number was 17,000 full-time equivalents when it has turnsed out there are only 2,800?  I do not know what the breakdown as between PAYE workers and contractors, etc. and would be glad if there was extra scrutiny.  I would like to think, however, that the Minister would give some assurance that the forum for stakeholders would happen, there was to be a timeline for it and everybody would be included.  It should also be ensured quality employment and training opportunities would be policed and that receipt of the relief would be strictly conditional on people adhering to that requirement.</p></speech>

It is entirely possible - I expect it to be the case - that the figures from the former Irish Film Board are right and that the figures I have given are also right.  The figures I have given which are available directly to me through my Department focus purely on section 481.  My other colleagues might be referring to a broader variety of employment categories, but even within them, it is still a fact that the companies that claimed section 481 relief directly employed 2,158 people in 2016.  That is the scale.</p> <p>  On Deputy Boyd Barrett's second point, I want to be clear about what it is I am saying.  The Deputy has referred to many issues that fall outside the scope of tax policy such as level of income and how a company looks to recruit.  Those are decisions a company has to make.  It is the job of the National Employment Rights Agency to look into all of the issues and make sure matters are properly regulated.  </p> <p>  Third, the legislation lays out what the objectives are.  I have stated in the Finance Bill that I will extend the relief for a further four years.  I will use the feedback from my officials who are participating in the group to assess if further changes are needed in meeting the objectives laid out in the legislation.  It is open to me as Minister for Finance to decide if I need to make further changes.  </p> <p>  The forum is a matter for the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan.  I am sure she is playing a role in it.  Like any forum that is established, these things only work if there is a breadth of inclusion and if it is a forum within which everybody has an opportunity to put forward his or her point and feels like he or she has been heard.  That is the general principle, lesson and my view.  However, it will be up to the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, if she is playing a role in it, to decide how it is to be set up.</p></speech>

Even the legislation, as it stands, includes a specific reference that I have mentioned to the Minister.  The measure is already conditional on the provision of quality employment and training opportunities.  That is something that falls within the remit of the Minister.  I did not write the legislation and did not propose the amendment.  As that is what is included in the legislation, these are issues that are directly relevant to the Minister, this section and amendments to it.  </p> <p>  I asked the Minster one question which he did not answer.  I do not think he is avoiding it as we are having an expansive discussion.  Given that it is included in the legislation, will he define for me and, more importantly, the people who benefit from the relief what is meant by "quality employment and training opportunities"?  I ask because it is a condition of availing of the relief.</p></speech>

I do not have sufficient knowledge of the sector to answer that question but that is where the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht plays a role.  It has an understanding and appreciation of that sector and, I hope, an appreciation of the various matters raised by the Deputy.  In the context of the Finance Bill, it is worth pointing out we have now changed the certification process for claiming this relief.  The production company will now have to engage with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht before any work begins on a project.  In particular, that will and should allow earlier engagement on how training is delivered than has been the case until now.  We have split the certification process and are now requiring a production company that seeks to access section 481 relief to engage with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. </p></speech>

CFC rules, which we committed to introducing when we agreed the EU anti-tax avoidance directives, ATAD, are an anti-abuse measure intended to prevent the artificial diversion of profits from controlling companies in the State to offshore subsidiaries located in low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions.  CFC rules are more commonly associated with territorial tax regimes and are designed to prevent certain tax avoidance behaviours rather than to raise revenue.  As a result, no recurring annual yield from this measure was included in the budget arithmetic.</p> <p>  For the purposes of the CFC charge, a company is considered to have control of a subsidiary where, in broad terms, it has direct or indirect ownership of, or entitlement to, more than 50% of the share capital voting power or distributions of that subsidiary company.  The CFC rules operate by attributing to the controlling company the undistributed income of the subsidiary which has arisen from non-genuine arrangements put in place for the essential purpose of obtaining a tax advantage.  The question of whether an arrangement is non-genuine is determined by analysing the extent to which the CFC would hold the assets or bear the risks that it does were it not for the controlling parent company undertaking the significant people functions, SPFs, in regard to those assets and risks.  To determine if profits have been diverted to a low tax or no tax jurisdiction, a comparison is required of the tax paid in the foreign jurisdiction by the CFC and the tax it would have paid in Ireland had the profits been earned in the State.  Profits may come within the scope of the CFC charge where the corporate tax, including any tax on chargeable gains, paid by the CFC is less than half the tax that would have been paid had the income been taxed in the State.  This is the effective tax rate test and it is a highly complex undertaking as it requires a recalculation of the profits of the foreign company under Irish rules, and a calculation of a hypothetical Irish tax liability that would have been payable on those hypothetical profits had the CFC been Irish resident.  In recognition of the significant administrative burden imposed by this test this provision, which originally formed part of the definition of a CFC under the ATAD, has been repositioned as an exemption of last resort.</p><p>This will allow companies to consider all the other elements giving rise to a controlled foreign company, CFC, charge, and the other potential exemptions that may be available, before undertaking the effective tax rate test.  Where it has been determined that a CFC charge is appropriate, the amount of income to be attributed to the Irish parent company is determined by reference to an arm&rsquo;s length assessment of the value of the significant people functions, SPFs, undertaken by the parent company and by reference to the controlling company&rsquo;s shareholding in the CFC.  The anti-tax avoidance directives, ATAD, require that these rules are a proportionate response to tax avoidance risks, and therefore allow exemptions to be provided for companies with low accounting profits and low profit margins.</p><p> Although not a requirement of the ATAD, I have also provided for a grace period for newly-acquired CFCs, such as a subsidiary company acquired as part of the acquisition of a group of companies, to allow the new parent company a period of up to one year to address the factors giving rise to a potential CFC charge.  This is a conditional grace period only.  If the subsidiary remains as a CFC giving rise to a CFC charge in the second year, the grace period exemption will be withdrawn and the CFC charge for the first year becomes payable with that of the second year.</p><p> In order to prevent double taxation, credit is available against the Irish tax liability on the attributed income for any foreign tax paid on the same income.  There is also relief from double taxation on certain disposals of shares or securities in a CFC.</p><p> The new Part 35B also includes anti-avoidance rules, including rules to apply a CFC charge where the significant people functions are undertaken by another company on behalf of the controlling company, and provisions to ensure that distributions which are not subject to tax on receipt cannot be used to reduce the quantum of undistributed profits for the purposes of the CFC charge.</p><p>The legislation will take effect for accounting periods of controlling companies beginning on or after 1 January 2019.</p></speech>

Under the anti-tax avoidance directives, Ireland is obliged to choose model A or B to implement the CFC rules model and it has done so.  The Minister is aware that model A is the most effective and that model B, which has been chosen by the Government, is the most relaxed measure that can be taken in dealing with the anti-tax avoidance directive.  I acknowledge that either model may be chosen but it is important to note that the vast majority of our European partners and the international community are singing off the same hymn sheet in choosing model A which implements more rigid anti-tax avoidance measures.  We have chosen the model opted for by Luxembourg, Belgium, Slovakia, Estonia and Latvia.  Members will be aware that some of those jurisdictions have been identified in multiple reports as operating tax haven models similar to that in operation here.</p> <p>  The purpose of the CFC rules is to lay down strictures and enhance existing tax laws and to identify what type of income will be taxed.  There are several problems with model B.  It does not deal with non-distributed income, which includes income from interest, dividends, share sales, royalties, banking, insurance and financial leasing.  None of those sources of income will be taken into account because of the model chosen by the Minister, but in most other jurisdictions, all those matters will be covered.  As the Minister mentioned, model B will only cover income sent to subsidiaries in jurisdictions with a corporation tax rate 50% lower than our headline corporation tax rate.  Thus, in the light of our low corporation tax rate, the measures will only apply in jurisdictions with a corporation tax rate of 6.25% or less, which rules out much of the world.</p> <p>  There are serious questions about this measure.  It is not surprising that the Government has again decided to go with the least stringent anti-tax avoidance measure and is out of kilter with much of the rest of Europe and the international community in so doing.  The Department of Finance has estimated that no additional moneys will be collected as a result of this measure.  What analysis was carried out by the Department to inform the decision to choose option B rather than option A?  What are the benefits of the weaker CFC rules under model B at a time when we are supposed to be tackling international tax avoidance measures?  What does the Minister have to say to the fact that the majority of Europe has gone with the more stringent model A?  He mentioned that in dealing with the exit tax issue the Department looked at the applicable rate and at international comparisons.  However, it obviously ditched that approach when it came to dealing with anti-tax avoidance measures because if it had looked at international comparisons, it would have chosen model A.</p> <p>  It appears from the consultation process that those who are involved in or assist with this type of tax avoidance were successful and got what they asked for, which was the least effective model.  That is not surprising.</p> <p>  This is not something for which the Minister should be patted on the back because we are obliged to implement it under the anti-tax avoidance directive.  However, he has decided to go with the weakest model, which is in keeping with how we are dealing with our international responsibilities in terms of international tax avoidance.  This is deeply regrettable because, as I have stated on numerous occasions, we need to get our house in order.  The State suffered reputational damage as a result of not dealing with issues in a robust and timely manner.  This section will copper-fasten the image and reality on the international stage and domestically that Ireland will do as little as possible to tackle tax avoidance.</p></speech>

The key reason for choosing option B is that it is the option most consistent with our tax policy focus on the taxation of activities with substance in Ireland.  It also aligns with our long-standing policy in developing anti-avoidance rules based on principal purpose tests.</p> <p>  I have included in the rules three additional provisions which are not expressly required under the ATAD directive and which I believe are necessary to ensure the objectives of the CFC rules.  For the purposes of determining control, I have provided for the aggregation of rights which a person is entitled to require at a future date and also for the aggregation of holdings in a company which are held through associates who are individuals.  I have extended the definition of a chargeable company.</p><p>I have also restricted the definition of distributions to ensure a CFC cannot use distributions to an intermediate company in a no tax or low tax jurisiction to avoid a CFC charge.  I have taken a model which is consistent with our approach of taxing activities that have substance in Ireland.  I had added to that a number of additional provisions to deal with issues I judge could arise in the future.  Deputy Doherty referred to a number of income streams he believes are exempt from the model I have outlined.  I believe he is wrong but at this point, with the Chair's agreement, I might request a technical briefing on it and ask one of my colleagues to run through all of the income streams that are included in order that I can support the point I have made.</p></speech>

Will the Minister tell us, if he has the figures, about the latest available figures on inter-group transactions, reliefs and credits?</p> <p>  I have before me a list produced by Revenue with data for up to 2016.  It is the Revenue list of tax allowances, credits, exemptions and reliefs.  Does the Minister have the latest available figures?  The transactions come under a particular heading, which is the largest heading of all the reliefs that are available.  In 2016, a total of &euro;9 billion in intra-group transactions was recorded.  Companies are able to deduct these transactions from taxable income.  Initially, they would be part of the gross trading profits.  Then, their taxable income is dramatically reduced through mechanisms such as intra-group transactions.</p> <p>  The focus of the directive is precisely to get at that.  We all know that is where the devil is in this whole question.  It is through the intra-group transactions, royalty payments, licence payments and whatever name they use.  A company pays off a subsidiary in a low-tax or no-tax jurisdiction and consequently does not pay tax on what are in actuality profits.  They are not really costs and should not be allowed to the degree that they are allowed.</p> <p>  I am keen to know the latest available figure.  Do we have projected figures for what we are likely to get next year or the year after on these intra-group transactions and allowances?  I find it astonishing that, according to the Minister's explanation, a measure that is supposed to address this issue will produce zero.  He explained that is because we do not know what the figures might be from year to year.  Does he believe this measure will curb and address such conduct?  If not, I do not see the point of it.  It does not seem that the option chosen by the Minister will curb this kind of tax avoidance activity by multinationals.</p></speech>

This is behaviour we are trying to prevent.</p><p>If we are wrong in that assumption and revenue comes in against it, it is still highly unlikely the same amount of revenue will come in the following year.  Therefore, to use such a revenue gain in my budget forecasting would not be the right thing to do.  On the Deputy's second question on the most up-to-date information on the table, the table is available on the website of the Revenue Commissioners who publish the most up-to-date figure available to them shortly after they have it.  If the Deputy got that figure from the Revenue website, it is the most up-to-date one.  I would not have any figures available to me which I could share publicly that are more up-to-date than that.  It is worth bearing in mind that much of what is in the figures the Deputy talks about relates to money flows which focus on companies located here relocating or moving their profits back to their parent companies.  That is entirely different from what we are discussing here.</p></speech>

Normal repatriation of profits to parent companies might see incremental or even substantial increases but not the level of jump we saw between 2015 and 2016.  That is why I am curious about the 2017 figure.  The figure for intragroup transaction allowances, or "loopholes" to the layperson, which is to say tax-deductible allowances, goes from &euro;2.9 billion in 2015 to &euro;9.1 billion in 2016.  I do not know what it is in 2017, but it is a dramatic increase in the claim being made by multinationals for a relief on their taxable profits.  To me, that suggests something untoward.</p></speech>

However, the Deputy may claim that intragroup transfers involve tax avoidance or people acting in the wrong way but I disagree strongly.  This is the way very large companies which are internationally organised and have a presence in Ireland frequently repatriate to a parent company the proceeds from economic activity which is associated with Ireland.  That is a core part of how these very large companies work.  Having said that, I will certainly look at the significant change to which the Deputy refers and see if we can offer an explanation for it prior to Report Stage.</p></speech>

This cap applies to limit the amount of capital allowances for intangible assets and any related interest expense which may be deducted from trading income arising from those assets in an accounting period.  The relief is capped at 80% of the related trading income for claims relating to capital expenditure incurring on intangible assets on or after 11 October.  This technical amendment is being made to ensure that the 80% cap applies as intended by explicitly requiring companies to split their relevant trading income for the accounting period between that which relates to expenditure incurred before the introduction of the 80% cap, namely, prior to 11 October 2017, and expenditure incurred after the introduction of the 80% cap.  The amendment is being made to clarify the operation of the 80% cap in circumstances in which a company has relevant trading income in an accounting period relating to qualifying expenditure incurred prior to and after the introduction of the cap.  This puts the Revenue guidance issued in January 2018 on a legislative footing.</p></speech>

What I do know, however, is that the way in which the Minister is dealing with this cap is contrary to what was recommended by Mr. Seamus Coffey when he produced his report.  He argued, if I remember correctly, that the move back to 80% from 100% should capture income from before it was reduced, not just going forward.  By doing that, one would capture the onshoring of assets which took place after the double Irish was closed down.  That was the previous mechanism through which aggressive tax avoidance was pursued by Apple and others and which has done significant and, frankly, justified damage to Ireland's international reputation and copperfastened our reputation as a corporate tax haven.  Mr. Coffey would not describe himself as a radical lefty or someone who wants to threaten the welfare of the Irish economy and is probably, in fact, a defender of existing corporate tax arrangements.  However, even he said we should have applied the 80% rather than the 100% relief the Government allowed for that window period during which the massive onshoring of intangible assets took place.  That would have raised approximately &euro;700 million more but the Minister chose not to do it.  Perhaps, the Minister might explain if the clarification relates to that decision.</p></speech>

To copperfasten that policy, I am bringing that technical note into primary legislation.  As such, I am now bringing into law the guidance the Revenue Commissioners issued.  I am doing so in recognition of the sensitivity of this area and because of the value of some of the assets at stake.  That is what this section seeks to do.  On the point about Mr. Seamus Coffey, he did not actually include that recommendation in the report on our corporate tax policy.  While he made in the report on corporate tax policy some recommendations on section 291A, he outlined subsequently in a blog post his view in relation to timing.  His view on timing was not contained in the report he supplied to me.  As to why I made the decision on timing in the way I did, a core part of our corporate tax code is that we have certainty around it.  As such, any changes are forward looking from the moment at which a policy is changed.  My judgment was that if I had made this policy change with a backward effect, it would have challenged that reputation for predictability.</p><p>The Deputy has to bear in mind that the change I made year last year itself changed another decision that was made on this matter in 2014.</p></speech>

I would have thought it is more important to improve our reputation with those who are legitimately and correctly, in my opinion, expressing concern about how Ireland has been used by these corporations to avoid very large amounts of tax, first, through the double Irish and, subsequently, through the window that was created by the 100% relief on intangible assets.  In regard to our previous discussions, it may be the case that when the Minister tries to ascertain why the figure for inter-group transactions jumped from 2015 to 2016, they will be accounted for by the reliefs being claimed, such as the 100% relief available in that period for the massive onshoring of intangible assets that took place in the window that was created for those years.  In fact, I am certain that it is what he will find.  We created the window that they jumped through and we gave them relief which allowed them to avoid billions in tax.  That is reprehensible.</p></speech>

Obviously, we are looking for a report because we cannot put down a different type of amendment due to the rule that we cannot impose a charge on the people or the State.  Nonetheless, I have raised this over and over again with the Minister, including last year during all Stages of the Finance Bill.  I will make my contribution now as opposed to speaking to the amendment later because they are linked and there is no point repeating ourselves.</p> <p>  The Minister commented on Seamus Coffey's proposal in the report and said Mr. Coffey did not propose any timing.  It is accurate that recommendation 18 of the original report did not say this should apply from today but let us look at what he recommended.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.874" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#KKK00700"><p>I will speak later on amendment No. 133, which is linked to this section.  At recommendation 18 of the report, Mr. Coffey states: &quot;In order to ensure some smoothing of corporation tax revenues over time, it is recommended that the limitation on the quantum of relevant income against which capital allowances for intangible assets and any related interest expense may be deducted in a tax year be reduced to 80%.&quot;  What he did not say is that we should exempt claims in the future and allow a 100% relief to apply, but that is what the Minister has done.</p><p>This is not retrospective.  To use the Minister's own words in response to Deputy Michael McGrath earlier, when he questioned whether a previous measure in regard to electric vehicles was being retrospective, the point the Minister made was that it is not retrospective, that we are not going back looking for additional taxation and that it is about how we apply the rules going forward.  That is exactly what Mr. Coffey had argued for in his recommendations and in his blog, and what Sinn F&eacute;in has argued in all the amendments and proposals we have put forward.  This is not about going back to 2014 and saying to those companies, &quot;By the way, you need to pay additional taxation because we have changed the rules and it is now 80% as opposed to 100%&quot;.  The issue is that, in future years, as Mr. Coffey said in recommendation 18, the rate should apply at 80%.</p><p>We currently have a two-tier system in this State.  We now have a situation where intangible assets onshored post-Finance Bill 2017 can be offset at 80% in future years, whereas 100% can be offset for those assets that were onshored between 2014 and 2017.  Therefore, there are two different ways to tax intangible assets for future years, that is, for this year, next year and every other year.  This is not about retrospection.  Mr. Coffey was before this committee in, I believe, his capacity as chairperson of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, although I am sure he suggested he was not speaking from that point of view.  At that meeting, I asked him what he would say to the argument that this is retrospective taxation, and I will read out what is now on the public record.  He stated:</p><blockquote>No, I do not believe it is retrospective taxation.  It does not change the amount of capital allowances that are available.  The total quantum of capital allowances remains the same.  All that changes is the amount that can be claimed in future years.  That is limited to 80% of the taxable income that is earned.  It is not retrospective taxation.</blockquote> <p>That is the issue.  This is not about reputational damage, which is a point I also put to him.  It is about not wanting to tax some of the most profitable companies in the world appropriately.  It has been acknowledged that the increase to 100% was a wrong policy choice and that is why it is now at 80%.  The Minister may not acknowledge it was wrong and maybe he will not use those words, but it is now at 80%.  I believe it was very unfair of the Minister to say that Mr. Coffey did not mention a date in his recommendation.  He referred clearly to &quot;future years&quot;.  What the Minister has done is the opposite, and he has said that for future claimants in future years the 80% would not apply.  That is regrettable.</p><p>Mr. Coffey is a person of huge standing and I do not want to drag him into this, and maybe I should not have made that last point.  Mr. Coffey, the person the Minister commissioned to carry out this report, is an expert on corporation tax.  The policy he has argued for will bring in &euro;750 million in 2019, so we are not talking about small potatoes.  We are talking about a huge amount of money that could be at the disposal of this State to deal with some of the pressures it is facing and that citizens, individuals and families right across the State are facing - I have mentioned all the cost of living pressures and other pressures people are under.</p><p>This is ideological.  I bring the Minister back to the discussion that took place between the Department of Finance and the then Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation at the time.  Although the proposal in 2014 was to increase it from 80% to 90%, a senior tax policy adviser in the then Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation wrote down that he disagreed on reputational grounds.  Let us remember that we did not go to 90%, we went further to 100%.  However, even on the 90% proposal, the tax policy adviser wrote: &quot;I disagree on reputational grounds, this would reduce the potential minimum effective tax rate from 2.5% to 1.25%, as 1.25% is too low and such a change could backfire&quot;.  It did not end at 1.25%; the effective tax rate ended at 0%.  It was hugely damaging to our reputation.</p><p>When the Panama Papers came out, this is the measure that was discussed internationally in major newspapers in America and elsewhere because this was one of the mechanisms that was used by Apple to deal with their restructuring of their activities to keep their tax liability as low as possible following the ending of the stateless company rule that was part of our tax code.</p><p> This is a policy that should be changed.  It is changed for other companies going forward.  Yet, if company "A" has intangible assets onshored here, it is able to offset 100% of it against its profits in any given year.  But if company "B" in the same year has intangible assets here, it is only able to offset 80%.  It makes no sense that in 2019 we have two tax rates for two different companies and the Minister is saying that this is reputational: it is not.  If it was retrospective and we were going back to claw money off them it would be reputational damage and people would say it is wrong and one cannot do it.  We are a sovereign nation and every company knows that we can change rates and conditions and that we do it in every single Finance Bill.  It is usually of benefit to them.  Sometimes, as we dealt with on the issue of electric vehicles, it is a disadvantage to them.  What we do not do, however, is go back to them and say the rules today are such and such and we are applying them for the last ten years so we need more money from the company.  That is not what is being proposed here.</p><p> This is big money that could be pumped into housing or our health system or used to deal with the pressures that individuals are under and there is no justification for this.  The Minster's justification before to the committee, which I was alarmed to hear - I was outside the Chamber and was watching it on my phone - was to suggest that the date was not an issue as to the recommendation.  That is a bogus argument.  Anybody reading that would know well that what is suggested there is the rate that should be applicable going forward is 80%.  What the Minister has done is say it is 80% for some companies and 100% for others.  That is not what was proposed in recommendation 18 of the report.  I believe the Minister should acknowledge that.</p></speech>

I have moved it back to what I believe it should be at which is 80%.  In the midst of all of the claims that have been made on the effect of this, I hoped there would have been an acknowledgement that I have made what I believe to be the right policy decision for our State.  It is appropriate that it now stands at 80% and I will deal with the specific points that are being put to me.  The tone of what is being raised with me would be more appropriate if I had made no changes at all.  I have made a change or I did make the change last year.</p> <p>  Specific points have been put to me, first my recollection of Seamus Coffey's report and what I have said.  Seamus Coffey is chairman of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  The former Minister, Deputy Noonan, asked him to do this work and not me.  I hold him in the highest respect.  I will review what I have said.  I will review the text of his report and if there is a difference between the two, as Deputy Doherty may think there is, I will be happy to correct that when I come in next time.  I received his report and I read what he said subsequently on the blog.  I have to make a decision then on what I consider is appropriate for our tax code.  The judgment that I made is that the then Minister for Finance made a change in 2014.  On the basis of a decision he made between 2014 up until I then made the change of moving it to 80%, decisions were made regarding the location of assets on the basis of tax policy as it was then.  I believed, in the context of a significant policy change for me, that it was appropriate to implement this from the date forward.  As Deputies will be aware, in the midst of the &euro;720 million that we are referring to, what is at stake here is the time at which that money comes in.  We are talking about the period over which the cap will be run down, and the additional funding will come in.  The &euro;720 million or &euro;700 million that the Deputies are referring to will still come in at a point in the future.  We are talking about overall corporate tax take for next year which will be in excess of &euro;9.2 billion.  What I look to do is to get the balance right between the competitiveness of our tax code and making a change that I believe was in the interests of our State and that is what I did last year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.881" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#LLL00700"><p>The Minister's suggestion in the way he used Seamus Coffey's report is to reference that he did not mention a date.  That is bogus: it is unfair.  What the Minister did was very different.  He set two rates of tax going forward, 100% and 80%.  The Minister has stated that Deputies did not acknowledge a change.  We have acknowledged the change.  I acknowledged the change earlier.  I acknowledged the change last year but what I have also acknowledged is that there is absolutely no change for the hundreds of billions of euro of intangible assets that were onshored during that period of 2014 to 2017.  When that change happened in the Finance Bill, a huge amount of intangible assets were onshored here.  That is why the value of it is so big.  That is why it is &euro;750 million each year until those capital allowances are exhausted.</p> <p>  The other point is where I will direct the Minister again to Seamus Coffey's blog, which the Minister mentioned in response to Deputy Boyd Barrett.  He makes the point very accurately, as we all know, that there is no guarantee that these companies and their structures will be here so that that profit is taxable at a time when their capital allowance is exhausted.  Yes, they have the capital allowance.  If they stay here and keep exactly the same structure, we will get the same tax over time.  This raises two points.  First, we need the tax now because there is a lot of pressures in this State now.  Second, if one looks at some companies, for example, a mobile phone company in question which is no longer operable in Ireland, if it were availing of this 100%, by the time the capital allowance was exhausted it would have left the country.  We know that companies like Apple are highly mobile and can move and restructure where certain parts of the companies are based.</p> <p>  On the idea that this is just a matter of timing, maybe that is the case and there will be no change.  It would be seriously dangerous to think that everything will remain the same over the next number of years and that we will collect this tax at a later point in time.  The case in point is Apple.  When we changed the law, Apple changed its structure, and it availed of this change to our finance law.</p> <p>  If the Minister's big argument against this is that we never give him a pat on the back for changing it in 2017, we in fact did give the Minister a pat on the back where the measure brought in &euro;150 million for companies going forward.  What we will not give the Minister a pat on the back for is when he proposes no change to hundreds of billions of euro that were onshored at that time.  Indeed, we will give out to the Minister for making it very clear in the Finance Bill that those assets will not be taxed this year, next year, the year after, the year after, or the year after, which leaves the taxpayer of this State &euro;750 million short in each and every one of those years.  That is where it is wrong.  I do not know how the Minister justifies that.  It is an ideological thing again where these are not small businesses.  Apple is the main beneficiary of this.  The beneficiaries are major multinationals with the State cosying up to this.  This should be about fair taxation.  The idea is that we have two different tax rates for two different companies which both have intangible assets in this State.</p><p>That we apply two different sets of rules to them for next year and every year thereafter is not fair.</p><p> The Minister did a wee little deal in the Finance Bill 2017 that carved out a special place for those companies that availed of a measure that should never have been in place in the first place.  The senior adviser in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was saying it would cause reputational damage and could not stand over it and that was at a point when the measure did not even go as far as the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, brought it in 2014.  The former Minister did not listen to the advice of the adviser of the then Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton.</p><p> There is no paper trail from any freedom of information, FOI, request to elicit where the figure of 100% came out of because all that was being talked about was 90%.  The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, which was lobbying for this, only argued for 90% and then lo and behold it was 100%.  We cannot get the minutes from the meeting between the Department and Apple, the major beneficiary of that deal, when the Finance Bill 2017 was going through and this issue was being discussed.  In the interest of transparency that should be provided by the Department.  If we cannot get it from an FOI request, it should be released.</p></speech>

My Department made it clear to the Deputy and I affirmed it to the Deputy in a debate on the Finance Bill 2018 that I had not been lobbied on this.

That is why I have done this and why I made the decision on changes to the Finance Bill 2017 on that night and the Deputy knows that the vast majority of finance Bill changes are made to take effect on the night in question.  I recollect bringing in the resolution that night to make that change immediately.  I have done this to make a change in something that I believe is the right thing to do.  I am not looking for pats on the back nor am I weighed down by the Deputy giving out to me about particular matters.</p> <p>  I listen to everybody's opinion, I look at the evidence and I decide what is the right thing to do.  I also have commitments on investment and jobs in our country and I have to get that balance right.  That is what I believe I have done in the decisions that I have made.</p></speech>

He probably did make the decision based on his belief that it would essentially scare the horses if the assets that were onshore during that period were captured by reducing the cap to 80% and that companies such as Apple would be very upset by that which might have implications for investment decisions they make here.  I would say that is the reason the Minister did this.  It is not good or acceptable logic because it is the logic of those companies having their guns to our head to prevent us from doing what is right in terms of fair taxation and tax justice because the original window that was opened in 2014 - which I consider to have been a little deal because the coincidence is remarkable that the double Irish was closed down - that had big implications for those companies and lo and behold a new window opened up which allowed them to onshore all these assets.  It beggars belief that there was not a nod and a wink arrangement in that case.  It is too convenient and the benefit of that window being reopened for the companies was very significant.</p> <p>  The Minister closed it down but he is allowing that stroke to stand.  It was a stroke because hundreds of billions of euros worth of assets were onshored and a tax relief of 100% was given.  Those assets will continue to benefit from that 100% tax relief based on what was a stroke and the Minister should not have done that, it is wrong.  The Minister did it for what we would have considered to be pragmatic reasons such as the security of the economy but let us be clear about what that means.  It means that we let bygones be bygones on the basis of a stroke.  It was a stroke and that must be said publicly.  The double Irish was a stroke and that had to be closed down due to pressure but lo and behold a new window was opened.  To my mind that is wrong.</p></speech>

Does the Minister have a figure for the quantum of capital allowances that are still in the system in relation to intellectual property, IP, that was onshored under the 100% regime?  We know that in quarter 1 of 2015 some &euro;250 billion of intangible assets was onshored so do we know the quantum of capital allowances still in the system and yet to be used relating to that IP that came in under the old 100% regime?</p></speech>

The expert has elaborated on that recommendation in his blog and repeated it on numerous occasions.  He said that it would not cause reputational damage and it is not retrospective taxation.  We know that it brings in &euro;750 million.</p><p>Why does the Minister dismiss the views of the person he asked to author the report on corporation tax because it cannot be seen as anything else?  The Minister talks about ideology.  My opinions are formed by ideology as well.  That is not a bad thing, but the different ideology is a point.  The Minister has not done so but he could possibly dismiss this by saying that this is all coming from the left.  This is the view of somebody he chose to carry out this report.</p><p> On the decision to carve out the arrangement for the hundreds of billions of euro of intangible assets that were on-shore during that window of three years, what consultation or advice did the Minister take?  We are dealing with the Finance Bill here that is minuscule in comparison with this one measure.  At &euro;0.75 billion, this was the biggest measure in the Finance Bill 2017.  We have reports, assessments and cost-benefit analyses for other measures put forward.  What consultation did the Minister take on the decision?  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett's view.  We all knew that close to &euro;300 billion of intangible assets were on-shore during that window.  We knew the facts.  We knew it was not a local supermarket or a local hairdresser.  We know it was a certain group of companies.  I do not see this logic of this.  The Minister made the argument in this committee last year that this was retrospective taxation.  I hear that he is not making that argument now.</p></speech>

In fact, these only claim for 2015 and 2016.  The short answer is that we do not have available the figures the Deputy seeks.  I will see if they are available to us and if they are, I will give them to him.  I only have the figures for 2015 and 2016.</p> <p>  On the question about consultation, the only consultation I had on the matter was with my officials.  To the best of my recollection, the matter was not raised with me in any pre-budget briefings or engagement I had.

It is one of the lowest headline corporate tax rates in the western world.  It is lower than havens of capitalism like the United States, Britain and so on.  It is a very generous rate of tax on profits already and, as we all know, the actuality is that after reliefs, deductions and allowances, the corporations do not pay that very low level of corporate tax; they pay much less.  If we calculate the effective rate based on the proportion of tax actually paid by corporations as against the gross trading profits of those corporations, before all the reliefs, deductions and allowances kick in, the real rate of corporate tax in Ireland has actually reduced in recent years.  If it is calculated in that way, in terms of the amount of tax they paid versus the gross trading profits, the effective rate was 5.8% in 2012, 5% in 2013, 5.1% in 2014, 4.3% in 2015 and 4.5% in 2016.  The effective rate of tax paid by corporations in this country has gone down 1.3% since 2012.  That happens through the myriad of tax loopholes that are detailed on this very interesting document the Revenue produces under headings such as inter-group transactions, losses brought forward, research and development tax credit and others.  It is important to emphasise that that is how they get their taxable income down from what are astonishingly high figures.  While the effective rate on those gross trading profits has dropped since the Minister's party came into government, the gross trading profits themselves have doubled.  In 2012, gross trading profits were &euro;74 billion.  In 2016, and these are the latest figures available to me, they were &euro;158 billion.  All I can say is "wow".  That is a story people do not know.  The aggregate profits of corporations in this country have more than doubled in the past five years.  When we talk about economic recovery, that is a recovery, but have the incomes of people doubled?  Is the quality of life and the quality of services twice as good as they were in 2012?  As we know, they most certainly are not.  We have creaking public services and housing, health service and infrastructure crises.  In terms of people's income, public sector workers are still earning less than they were earning before all the austerity cuts came in.  Even now, so many years into the recovery, people are earning less than they were earning in 2008, but the profits of corporations have more than doubled and the effective rate they pay has actually reduced.  Again, all I can say is "wow".</p> <p>  Against that background, does the Minister not think it would be reasonable to make them pay the 12.5%, as a minimum?  That would be very reasonable and it would produce approximately &euro;8 billion in additional revenue for the State, and they would still be paying a lower rate of tax.  I know the Minister's comeback will be to say there are all sorts of reliefs and that the nominal headline rates in other countries are not the real rates either.  All of that is true.</p></speech>

I do not dispute that the narrative coming from some of the critics of the Irish system is self-interested, that they have all their loopholes and so on, that they are annoyed that we have even more loopholes and that we are better tax pirates than they are in the game of tax piracy.</p><p>Even if we did make them pay the 12.5%, we would still have, to use the Minister's term, an extremely competitive corporate tax rate.  The latter is not a term I particularly like.  I do not think there would be a mass exodus of corporations on foot of having to pay 12.5% on astonishing profits, because they would still be making significant profits.  It is a very reasonable demand.</p><p> We could go into some of the individual loopholes but I will do not do that because it is getting late.  All I will say is that there are myriad such loopholes.  I do not see how the Minister can justify many of them.  I will just pick one.  The second of my amendments that was ruled out of order focused on one of these loopholes, namely, the research and development tax credit.  I would very much like to make this point because it is becoming increasingly important after the Irish Universities Association pleaded with the Minister about the need for increased investment in universities given what it sees as the significant declining proportion of investment per student and the need to dramatically increase investment.  In that context, the &euro;700 million we give out in tax reliefs, which mostly benefit the same gang, namely, Apple, Facebook and others.  These companies are the main beneficiaries of the research and development tax credit.  Instead of giving them &euro;700 million in the form of such tax relief, imagine what would happen if we gave the same amount to the universities.  Would that not make a difference to the universities that are tumbling down the international rankings?  If one carried out a cost-benefit analysis in respect of giving &euro;700 million to most of the multinationals or to the university sector, I wonder which would have a more positive long-term significant impact on the economy, its sustainability and viability.  To me, it is a no-brainer that we should give the &euro;700 million to the universities.  The money would be far better spent on the universities than giving it in research and development tax relief to a load of multinational corporations.  That is the sort of thing that a minimum effective rate would allow us to do.  It would close down some of what is going on and claw back some of the money which we could then put into universities, infrastructure and key areas where we are chronically deficient in the levels of investment that we need.</p></speech>

The phrase "tax piracy" is nice but it does not do any justice to the reality of changes that we have made in the tax code.  In addition, it does not recognise the reality of where the country stands.  Ireland has a small, open economy and there are lots of big changes happening around it.  In the past 40 years, we have managed to facilitate an extraordinary overhaul of our economic development.  We did that on the basis of being open and competitive, a concept Deputy Boyd Barrett appears to find repellent.  Part of that competitiveness is what we do and how we have structured the tax code.  It is part but not all of it.  All of the companies, the names of which Deputy Boyd Barrett tosses around with disdain, employ thousands of people in this country.  Has he ever been in any of the factories or plants that gain and benefit from the research and development tax credit?  Has he ever seen the number of people who are employed in those facilities?  I might get some of the figures wrong but I think Apple employs 6,000 people here, as does Facebook, and Google employs between 7,000 and 8,000.  Those companies are all really significant investors here, although I acknowledge it is mainly in the cities.  They have made significant investments in the State.  I do not know whether Deputy Boyd Barrett acknowledges that.</p></speech>

That is what happens.  That is the reality of the world in which we live.  Tossing around phrases such as "tax piracy" does little justice to the competitiveness of the environment in which a small open economy like Ireland operates.  We must make careful choices about changing elements within the tax code to ensure they meet the standards that now exist.  I have a particular responsibility to ensure that we make decisions which allow us to keep jobs in the country.  The Government also has a responsibility in this regard.  I cannot help but feel some of the time that if I did some of the things sought by Deputy Boyd Barrett and it resulted in job losses he would then criticise me for that.  I hope he would not but I suspect he might.</p></speech>

We can all have a constructive engagement with each other but that is the Deputy's agenda, is it not?  If a big change happens - perhaps in line with some of the things the Deputy wants - then Deputy Boyd Barrett would say he was right all along.  What solace would that be to people who lost their jobs?  What compensation would that offer to the kind of factories that employ people to make things, many of which avail of our research and development tax credit?  That is not a responsibility that weighs too heavily on Deputy Boyd Barrett's shoulders but it weighs on mine because I have to make these decisions.  I assure him that, based on the experience I have had doing this job, to be in a place where we have a minimum tax rate would be a recipe for the investment agencies in other countries seeking to take jobs out of this country.  That is based on the experience I have had in assisting State agencies to create and retain jobs here and in understanding the environments that exist elsewhere.</p> <p>  Reference was made to a particularly country being a capitalist haven.  Such countries do things that we will not do in order to get companies to locate factories in their jurisdictions.  We offer a broad, low tax rate.  There are many other things we will not do that our competitors do.  In my experience of trading within a world which the Deputies do not like - because they do not like a global economy that is organised on the basis of capitalism and that is something they want to get rid of it-----</p></speech>

However, I do not want to go there because I have not seen it work in any country.  If he is successful in embarking on that journey, it does not take away from the world in which we live now.  A message from the Government to the effect that it wants a minimum effective tax rate belies the fact that we have lots of different companies, many of which are involved in different kinds of economic activity which , in turn, allow them to access reliefs.  None of that is compatible with a minimum effective tax rate.  In my experience of this kind of work in recent years, it is my strong recommendation to the Deputy that going down the route outlined would be dangerous for jobs.</p><p>If those jobs and investment were to be threatened, the Deputy's hopes of nationalisation would be of little solace to people who lose their jobs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.922" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#PPP00200"><p>I will speak to the substance of amendment No. 134 now and formally move it later as this debate also relates to that amendment.  While I agree with the sentiment behind Deputy Boyd Barrett's amendment, amendment No. 134 also calls for a report on increasing corporation tax to 25% for big corporations.  That would bring our rate to approximately the world average.  It would also introduce a differential rate under which small corporations would continue to benefit from the 12.5% rate, while large corporations would pay 25%.</p> <p>  There are many problems with what the Minister said.  There is a sound economic reason and a moral reason to reject the Minister's logic.  In regard to the economic reason, I agree with him that we are in a world that is changing fast and where there is much uncertainty in the global economic picture, with Trump, Brexit and developments within the European Union.  Things are uncertain.  To the extent that Ireland and the leaders and political representatives of Irish capitalism have sought to create a certain niche for themselves and a certain level of competitiveness, an important part of which the Minister agrees is tax competitiveness, that position may well be undermined by global factors.  If Trump were to win a second term and continue on the trajectory he is on in terms of corporation tax rates and treatment of corporation profits, that would probably create a significant incentive for large multinationals to bring profits and operations home.  If Theresa May carries through the bargain basement Brexit she would like to carry through, which we will see whether she is able to do, Britain will be more aggressively engaged in competition with Ireland for the kind of niche in which Ireland has been positioned.  Some eastern European countries are also looking to reduce corporation tax rates.  Ireland no longer has the lowest rate, at 12.5%, and more will go in that direction.  </p> <p>  The Minister's response to this changing world is to acknowledge it and say we must stick to the 12.5% rate that we have, even though it is really 4.5%, 5% or whatever, because it is what brought multinationals here and we hope they will stay here.  It is not a sustainable project, however, for the very reason that a race to the bottom can be won by other, bigger powers.  If we compete on the basis of our low corporation tax rate or the low effective rate of corporation tax paid by big multinationals, another country will come along and beat us at that game.  The road to sustainability, therefore, is not to stick with that model.  While it may have been effective in particular circumstances, such as those that gave rise to the Celtic tiger, in providing a significant impetus for foreign direct investment and attracting American corporations seeking to act as aircraft carriers into Europe, as it were, that is extremely unlikely to happen again because the model is not sustainable.  It is just hanging on with one's fingernails and hoping the world situation does not go extremely bad and undermine the whole basis for the model.  While it may justifiably seem to be a radical alternative that People Before Profit and Solidarity are putting forward, it is ultimately a more sustainable alternative to say we need a different economic model based on significant public investment in education, research and development and so on but also in public ownership of key sections of the economy.  On that basis, the economy can be sustainably developed environmentally and economically.  </p> <p>  The Minister can perhaps say that he is for that socialist vision of a democratically planned economy, but we are where we are.  If one wants to get to where one wants to be, one must take actions that point in that direction.  Those actions break away from the current developmental model of Irish capitalism, which goes absolutely nowhere, and instead point in a different direction.  An important part of that change is taxing corporations properly.  Corporations overstate the extent to which raising corporation tax by X percent would encourage them to leave.  They overstate that for their own purposes and it is in their interests for them to create that impression.  It is possible that increasing corporation tax can lead to corporations leaving, but that is why we should use the resources we have and which we should use, for example, the Apple tax, to create a different model for the economy that will be far more sustainable in order that we are not reliant on attracting multinationals to come here.</p> <p>  The morality of the issue is not some abstract concept but concerns solidarity with our fellow human beings around the world who lose as a result of Ireland's tax policy.  In the rates that appear on paper as opposed to the rates that are paid, corporation tax globally has fallen from 49% in 1984 to 24% in 2018, and the downward trend is continuing.  Due to the global free movement of capital, this notion of tax competition has obviously caught on and has become a way for countries to try to obtain a share of foreign direct investment.  It is not a coincidence that inequality has grown substantially in the same period.  I think it was Oxfam that recently found that 82% of the wealth produced in the world last year went to the top 1%.  That outcome is a product of policies such as tax competition.  </p> <p>  Ordinary people in this country lose to a massive degree.  If we had the Apple money, one wonders what we could do with health, education and so on.  We are not the only ones who lose, however.  People in the developing world lose more than anyone else.  According to relatively conservative estimates, some &euro;100 billion a year, which could go health, education and so on is lost, robbed from those countries.  It is does not end up in the pockets of ordinary people in this country but rather in the profits of corporations, which is why the whole notion of tax competition is bogus.  Taxation is not the same as competing on the basis of education level or public infrastructure.  </p> <p>  In tax competition, the only people who win in the medium to long run are the corporations.  While one can beggar one's neighbour by undercutting him or her at 12.5%, 4.5% or whatever, if the trend in global taxation rates continues, in 30 years' time corporations will not be paying any tax and the average rate of corporation tax will be 0%.  It is important, therefore, for Governments to take a stand to reject the race to the bottom and instead seek global co-operation.  We could can start at a European level where there is a possibility of a common consolidated corporation tax base, and discuss setting the bar progressively higher in order that those who are making and holding onto vast amounts of wealth pay tax and contribute to society.</p></speech>

The endpoint of that is the vista of a government, probably led by Deputies Paul Murphy and Boyd Barrett, overturning the 40 or 50 years of an economic model based on openness and competitiveness, which has created tens of thousands of jobs in our country, and going down a route that has more in common with Latin America than Europe.  If the best answer the Deputies can give me about how this worked is something France did nearly 40 years ago, then that tells a story about the likely effect of this.  I am aware of President Mitterand's reign.  The Deputies are probably talking about his first term and what he did in 1981, 1982 and 1983.  He ditched that approach in the rest of his term of office.</p></speech>

That says a lot about how that approach would work in France, let alone Ireland, with our size and scale.  I will address the arguments relating to economics and morality.  It is important to bring morality into discussions such as this.  We should be willing to have arguments based on acknowledging that we have different beliefs, ideologies and approaches.  I will cover that argument.</p> <p>  The Deputies made an economic argument, in which they think there are changes which are right because of the global environment and the need for Ireland to carve out a different economic model.  My judgment is that the economic environment Ireland will be in for the next few years is likely to see key large trading partners that we trade and compete with see their top line tax rates come down.  The French finance minister is talking about reducing the corporate tax rate.  America has already done so.  Prime Minister May and Chancellor Hammond have said they will do it.  In an environment in which top line and effective tax rates are likely to come down, the Deputies' recipe for the prelude to having to nationalise some of these companies is to put the top line and effective tax rates up.</p></speech>

It is worth clarifying that the endpoint of what the Deputies are talking about is considering nationalising companies.  That is not a recipe to retain jobs, let alone create new ones.  With regard to the argument on morality, I acknowledge that with much of what we have to do and which I have worked to do while dealing with the pressures I face in the here and now, there will have to be changes to global tax collection.  Large companies are repatriating their earnings to their home country and the leading example is America.  I welcome that happening because those tens of billions of euro being in the global ether was delegitimising the global tax code and risking international tax co-operation.  We had either already taxed that money or had no taxing rights against it.  I welcome that it is going back to America and have said that with the engagement I have had with the Department of the Treasury in America.  It is an important and positive change overall.</p> <p>  The Deputies may differ and we got a taste of this earlier in the discussion on the anti-tax avoidance directive and on the intangible taxing regime.  They may differ with regard to specific decisions and the direction in which I am taking it.  I am trying to bring our corporate tax policy in line with new best practice that has developed while also acknowledging that it is a feature of the competitiveness of our economy, and at the same time seeing big economies which are located really near us beginning to take their tax rates down.  It is a balancing act that would unravel spectacularly if the amendments the Deputies have here relating to the policy, not the report, were to happen.</p></speech>

We were trying to be brief.  It is an important discussion because of the consequences of how we deal with that.  The Minister is correct to say that the Trumps and Theresa Mays of this world, among others, are further accelerating the race to the bottom for corporation taxes.  The Minister is saying that is the way corporation taxes are going and that we have to accept that is the way it is going without doing anything that would endanger our position.  It is worth saying that possibly even Trump himself has indicated at times that his tax policy was a reaction to what places like Ireland had done.  We helped to spearhead it.  There has been much commentary on it internationally.  It is not that we cannot do anything now because of what they might do.  What they are doing is, to a significant extent, a reaction to what we did.</p></speech>

I know the Minister does not like to admit it because it would be a big admission.  That is what is being said, including in the <i>Financial Times</i>.  It is not just being said by Trump, although he has referred to the Irish tax rate and Irish tax piracy, although I do not know if he used that exact phrase.  I am not saying it for rhetorical or hyperbolic reasons.  I think we have been spearheading an international race to the bottom on corporate tax.  Nobody could dispute with a straight face that the biggest corporations in the world are aggressive tax avoiders which have gone to extraordinary lengths to avoid paying tax on staggering amounts of profits.  That is beyond dispute.  Is it a coincidence that they are all located here and that the whole world is saying that Ireland is a tax haven?</p><p>Even Trump, as obnoxious as he is, is sort of saying he must reduce corporate taxes in the United States.  He wanted to do that anyway - do not get me wrong.  He would find any excuse but the fact that he has cited Ireland must tell us something.

I would rather not be in politics.  I would rather get on with something other than politics but the reason I am involved in politics is a real concern about problems that we simply cannot ignore and that are getting worse, such as the environment.  The world is proving incapable of dealing with the environment because the politicians will not take on these corporations.  That is what is happening.  Why is there an infrastructural crisis in the western world?  It is not only in Ireland.  We are one of the worst but there is a housing crisis all across Europe.  There is a housing crisis in the United States.  A housing crisis that did not exist 20 years ago exists now all across the western world.  Why is there a crisis in health services all across the western world?  Why is it we could do better 20 years ago, in health, in housing, in education and in infrastructure, than we are able to do now when we are richer than we were then?  Is that not a conundrum?  We are worse in all the key areas of infrastructure than we were 20 years ago but we are richer today than we were then.  That is a contradiction.  The Minister's perspective is not acknowledging that is a problem and that we somehow need to move in a different direction to address it otherwise we will be in big trouble.</p> <p>  I will finish on this.  I cited the example of the universities versus the research and development.  The Minister did not respond directly on it.  He can make all the cases he likes for Apple and the level of investment but I beg him not to try to convince me that it is better to give &euro;700 million to Apple, Google and Facebook than to Irish universities because I do not buy that.  From an economic point of view, from a social point of view, from a sustainability point of view and from the point of view of moving in one direction rather than another, it is self-evidently the case it would be better to give it to our universities than to give it to Google and Facebook.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.954" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#RRR00700"><p>I move amendment No. 132:</p><blockquote>In page 108, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following:<b>&quot;Report on restricting banks from carrying forward losses</b><br /><br /><b>27.</b>The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann a report on restricting banks from carrying forward losses against taxable profits in a manner which could result in many institutions paying no corporation tax for the foreseeable future by introducing a 25 per cent cap on profit that can be written off by carried forward losses in any given year and an absolute ten year limit on the use of losses for this purpose.&quot;.</blockquote> <p>The issue at hand here is the issue of the carry forward of losses in the Irish banks and my party has put forward an amendment.  It deals with the issue of a report with specific recommendations, which we submitted to the Minister in our alternative budget.  I am sure the Minister has seen our policy position paper on this because I sent him a copy.</p><p>The Department has already published a paper on the factual position on the carry forward of losses in the financial institutions.  I will not go into examples from 1982 but I will talk about the current situation and how Ireland is an outlier in how it deals with the deductibility of tax losses.</p><p>Ireland's position is that the carry forward of losses is unlimited, that is, it is indefinite.  It can continue for 50 or 60 years, if such losses are acquired.  There is no limit on the deductibility of tax losses.  We allow for 100% of tax losses to be carried forward or deducted from profit or tax payable in any given year.  That is not the case in Austria, Canada, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, Britain or the United States of America.  Indeed, when we look at the international comparisons, we are very much out of line with the vast majority of OECD countries.</p><p>What we are dealing with here is bank losses.  I have heard the Minister make a number of arguments as to why the proposal my party is putting forward should not apply.  One argument the Minister talks about is the loss of value where we have large shareholdings in the banks and receive dividends from them.  That does not apply across all the banks, even those in which we have shareholdings.  Some of the shareholdings are smaller than others.</p><p>The Department's paper, which was helpful in informing the debate, showed that there would be a loss of value in the Irish banks if one restricted the carry forward of losses in them.  We would never dispute that there would be such a loss of value.  The Department's paper estimated that such reduction in value would be &euro;420 million.  Let me say, first, I disagree with the policy of selling AIB anyway and that loss dwarfs into insignificance if one holds the position that one will not sell it anyway.  Even if one were, if one wants to measure it in terms of the value of the banks, a potential drop in value of the banks of &euro;420 million if one were to restrict the carry forward of losses is a minor issue in comparison to the tax that would be payable.  Within just over two years, the amount of tax that could be brought in, calculated at &euro;175 million per annum, would exceed the value that would be lost in terms of the shareholding of the State in the three institutions.</p><p>This comes down to an issue of fairness.  There was a policy position, which was introduced at the time of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, to restrict losses in financial institutions that were bailed out by the State to 50%.  The former Minister, the late Deputy Brian Lenihan, introduced that with a foresight - obviously, there were calls for it at the time - that despite the banks incurring a massive amount of losses at the time, there would be a point when these banks would become profitable again and at the earliest opportunity they should start to pay their fair share of tax and make an appropriate contribution through the tax regime in terms of paying their way.  The banks have returned to profitability.  The three banks, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB, between them recorded profits last year of &euro;2.6 billion.  The problem is that they were able to use deferred tax assets to offset their tax liability in the State.  In one case, a bank making profits of &euro;1.5 billion is not paying corporation tax in the State because of these deferred tax assets.</p><p>One can look at the matter from two ends.  One can look at limiting the amount of time that the banks can carry forward the tax assets for.  For example, throughout the OECD, there is a limit.  The limit in Finland is ten years; in Greece, it is five years; in Iceland, it is ten years; in Turkey, it is five years; in Switzerland, it is seven years; and in Portugal, it is 12 years.  There are different rates.  Ireland provides that the banks can use these deferred taxes until the losses are exhausted which means AIB, for example, has to make in excess of &euro;20 billion of profit before it starts paying corporation tax in the State.</p><p>The value of the deferred tax assets is in excess of &euro;4 billion, which is a huge amount of money.  We have been told AIB will not pay corporation tax for 20 years.  Bank of Ireland will not pay corporation tax until &euro;9.6 billion of profit has been made or &euro;1.2 billion of deferred tax assets is used up.</p><p> The Minister will say we have a banking levy and that is how we get a contribution from the financial institutions.  Let me compare what happens here with what happens in Britain.  It was not radical lefties out to punish big banks,  institutions and so on but rather under the Tory Government a bank levy was brought in.  It brought in &pound;3 billion in 2017.  Like Ireland, the UK has a bank levy and like Ireland, its banks pay corporation tax.  Obviously, its corporation tax is higher than our rate of 12.5%.  In Britain, in the summer of 2015, a surcharge on corporation tax for banks was introduced.  Not only do the banks have to pay the appropriate corporate tax that is applicable to other companies in Britain, they have to pay 8% above that, on top of the fact that, collectively, they must pay &pound;3 billion bank levy.  Recently, as a result of a change in 2016, which applied in 2017, I understand its changed the rules to allow a full 100% carry forward of losses.  Like Irish banks, British banks incurred significant losses yet the rules were changed so that they could only carry forward 25%.  I made those points to ground this discussion in international facts.  My earlier point related to how we treat companies.  I do not suggest that we change the rules for companies.  However, it is not accepted international practice that companies can carry forward 100% of losses and do so indefinitely.  Ireland and another nine states are outliers in terms of the OECD in that regard.  The vast majority have restrictions on either time or the percentage that can be carried forward in losses and numerous jurisdictions apply both criteria.</p><p> This is an issue of tax fairness.  These banks have caused much damage to ordinary people.  People just get a kick in their guts when they hear the massive profits now being made by financial institutions yet they do not pay tax.  I raise these issues all the time and I raise them directly with the banks.  I talk to people who come in from work at 6 o'clock and who work on construction sites in weather like we have today so they might be wet, tired and have blisters on their hands.  These people pay their taxes.  They have seen not only how the banks have behaved in recent years but how they behaved during the crisis period and during the time that led up to the crisis.  These people cannot understand, when one explains it to them, that these three Irish banks in which we have significant shareholdings made a &euro;2.6 billion profit but because of a rule we introduced do not pay any tax and, indeed, some of them will not pay tax for the next 20 years.</p><p> I argue strongly that we adopt a similar approach to that in Britain.  We should keep the levy.  I am not arguing that we do what Britain has done with corporation tax.  In Britain, an 8% surcharge on the profits made by banks has been introduced, so they must pay additional corporation tax.  I suggest that we restrict the carry forward of losses to 25%.  If the Minister did that, it would bring in an additional &euro;170 million this year.  Would the banks be able to continue with their losses?  Of course, they would but they would just carry them on longer.  There should be a time limit on this because it is not fair.  My eldest child is 12 years of age, so he was born during the time of the crisis.  When he is over 30 years of age, AIB will still not be paying corporation tax despite the fact that if it continues on the same trajectory, it will make over &euro;1 billion in profit.</p><p> I have heard Ministers make the point - I am not sure whether the Minister made it - that this could lead to an increase in interest rates.  That is just scaremongering.  These banks are making serious profits.  When one strips everything away, this needs to boil down to fairness and to what is right and what is wrong.  Why do we ask teachers, nurses, garda&iacute;, members of the Defence Forces and hairdressers to pay tax and yet have a system that allows companies that make billions of euro in profits not to pay tax for the next two decades?  That is what my amendment is about.  If we ask one section of society to pay tax, we should also ask the other sections to pay tax.</p><p> Whatever about the justification for why this measure on the capitalisation of banks was changed, that no longer exists.  There is no reason whatsoever not to do this bar, as I have mentioned before, ideological reasons.  It is just like how we deal with the onshoring of intellectual assets.  It is like the different conversations we have had.  The Minister's party and Government protects these special interests.  It is a Government for the few and not the many.  When one reads the Finance Bill, one can see who is being looked after.  One can talk about small tax cuts, which we talked about earlier, but the big money is in issues like this one.  It does not get the same attention and will not get the same headlines, because maybe it is a wee bit complicated, but it is very simple when one strips it all back.</p></speech>

Obviously, the Minister must consider the implications of reinstating the restriction that was removed by his predecessor.  I understand why it was removed in terms of the capital position of the banks and the changes that were being introduced under capital requirements directive, CRD IV.  I read the paper made available to this committee at the end of August.  It set out the overall conclusion and laid out the factors that would need to be considered if a change was being suggested.</p> <p>  I want to ask the Minister about the capital position of the banks.  The paper addressed that aspect and estimated what impact it would have on the banks in which the State holds shares.  I ask him to advise the committee in light of the recent stress test results at a European level whether the estimate needs to be updated in terms of what the likely impact would be.  Again, the estimate was based on certain assumptions in terms of what the impact would be on the market value and the State's shareholdings that would come in in excess of &euro;400 million.  Put against that, the Minister is saying the additional yield of reinstating the NAMA restriction would be &euro;117 million per annum.  I do not think anyone is suggesting that making the change would be without consequence or cost free, because clearly it would not be.  There may be consequences from the points of view of capital, share capital and dividends.  I do not know what the Minister's intentions are at this stage in terms of the possible sale of further shares in AIB.  I am conscious we are in an open forum and are talking about listed banks that have obligations to the Irish Stock Exchange and so on and that the Minister is the shareholder.  Can the Minister give us his perspective?  Is his position as summarised in this report, which I understand was not published?</p><p>I believe the Minister called this a technical paper, which was provided to the committee.  </p></speech>

The paper laid out the consequences of different options that could be open to a Minister.</p><p>I will deal first with the points made by Deputy Doherty.  When I hear the Deputy talking about garda&iacute;, nurses, teachers and those who work in construction it strikes me that more garda&iacute;, nurses and teachers have been hired and more work is being done on our construction sites as a result of economic choices made by me and my predecessor.  An economic recovery, which the Deputy did not think would happen, is under way.  I remember many of the contributions he made during and after the crisis.  We now have an economic recovery which has benefitted people, allowed us to hire more public servants and enabled more work to be done on construction sites all over the country.  While there is much we need to do and many social challenges we need to rise to, some of which we touched on in this long debate, it is still the case that policy choices made by me and the current and previous Governments have led to positive changes in the economy that the Deputy claimed would never happen.</p><p>An element of that feeds into choices that we now have to make regarding the banking system.  Deputy Doherty touched on a number of cases and made many comparisons.  He compared the Irish and British banking systems, for example.  The UK banking system is very different from the Irish banking system.  We have a small number of banks operating in a highly concentrated banking sector.  We need more competition in the sector but we have some significant legacy issues that we still have to deal with.  These relate to non-performing loans and investment the banks still need to make.  Other issues, which are not legacy issues, include mortgage interest rates, the costs of doing business with the banks and the amount of credit the banks are providing for investment.  None of these are at the levels they should be at and they are definitely not where they need to be when compared with those of other countries in the European Union.  This has to change and I want to see that change.</p><p>The paper, which I shared with Deputy Doherty, was prepared by officials in my Department at a technical level and I saw it before it was published.  The Deputy did not acknowledge some of the other aspects of the paper, including the change to the way we will manage losses in the future.  Most notably, the paper states: </p><blockquote>What can be said, however, is what the DTAs, primarily comprised of losses, represent as a percentage of each bank&rsquo;s transitional CET1 as at 31 December 2017, before any purported write down, and this is set out in Table 3 below.  In summary, for AIB it represents 3.7 percentage points of its ratio of 20.8%, for BOI it represents 1.8 percentage points of 14.0%, and for PTSB it represents 2.3 percentage points of 17.1%.</blockquote> <p>The way in which we currently account for those losses within the balance sheet in turn has a significant effect on the amount of CET1 capital the banks hold.  The paper addresses the capital ratio of the banks using careful language.  It states:</p><blockquote>It cannot be said what the reaction from the regulator would be if some or most of this value was removed from each bank's capital ratio.  This is a matter for the European Central Bank, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), and it would vary by bank.  However, at a minimum, it could be expected to impact the quantum of dividends the State could receive from these banks in the near term and could colour the regulator's views on their non-performing loan (NPL) reduction strategies given concerns that disposals may negatively impact on capital in the coming years.</blockquote> <p>I hope this point on the capital holding of the banks addresses the point made by Deputy McGrath.</p><p>The paper also makes points on the effect of the proposed change on the valuation of the State's investment.  While this is not a matter for this debate, I do not believe the State should be an owner of the Irish banking system in the long term and I want the position in that regard to change.  I want the banks to stand on their own feet.  If, God forbid, the State ever faces the kind of global economic shock we experienced a decade ago, I do not want to be in a position where it still owns the majority shareholding in two of our banks and a minority shareholding in one smaller bank.  It is in the long-term interest of the State that the banks are owned privately and that one bank, in particular, makes the transition to private ownership and the State no longer has a majority shareholding in it.  If we were to make changes to how we account for losses, all of these matters would be affected and the paper outlines the reasons for that.</p><p>The paper also examines two different options that would be available to us.  The first would be to confine the proposed change to retail banks.  If we were to do that, which retail banks would we choose and how would that work?  Would the change extend to KBC Bank and Ulster Bank in addition to the three banks in which the State has shares?  While it is for the banks in question to speak about the effects the proposal could have on them, I will say that it is in our long-term interest to have competition in the banking sector.</p><p>With regard to the effect the proposed change would have on consumers, it would change the nature of the banking system and the banks' balance sheets.  The paper lays out that it could have an effect on other issues that matter to consumers, for example, charges and the competitiveness of the services the banks offer their customers.  For all of these reasons, the proposed change would not be in the interests of delivering the other outcomes we want from our banks.</p><p>The Deputy referred to what the UK did but did not refer to the relaxation of other restrictions in the UK loss release scheme.  The UK made other changes in its tax code in addition to the change proposed by the Deputy, including allowing most carried forward losses incurred from April 2017 to be used more flexibly against total tax profits, rather than particular types of profits for a company.  The UK, in making a change, also introduced another change that will impact on the banks or companies that are affected by the first change.  It made a set of changes to the way in which the accounting of losses are dealt with.  As I stated, while it is fair to compare our tax code with the tax codes of other countries in respect of how this issue is addressed, we also differ from other countries in terms of the small number of banks we have, the number of issues faced by the banks here, the State's large shareholding in the banking system and my desire to have more banks and greater competition in our banking sector.</p><p>I of course can understand the political attraction but were that change to be made, other things would happen that would be of concern to our citizens.  That is what this paper aims to lay out.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.963" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#UUU00300"><p>I wish to speak one last time on this.  The changes Britain made in 2017 to reduce losses that can be carried forward from 100% to 25% applied to six banks of the 18 institutions and brought in &pound;300 million.  The changes were negative on the banking sector.  </p> <p>  I did refer to the capital ratio, perhaps the Minister did not pick it up, in respect of the justification of the change at that time.  That justification was related to the fact that these deferred tax assets would be accounted for with regard to the capital ratio.  Therefore, if they were not there, the State's requirement to recapitalise the banks would no longer exist.  The Minister rightly points out that the paper refers to the amount of deferred tax assets and the percentage they make up of the capital ratio of each bank.  It also is important to acknowledge that the proposed change on restricting the carrying forward of losses would not remove that percentage entirely.  What it might do, as the paper outlines, is require the auditors to make a revaluation, through writing down the current value of the deferred tax assets, because if the losses carried forward are restricted to, for example, 25%, then the deferred tax assets still exist.  However, a question which cannot be answered - I cannot, and nor could the Minister's officials - is whether auditors would require a write-down of the deferred tax assets.  No one is suggesting they could not be accounted for in any shape or form, given their value,  The value in the case of AIB, for instance, is &euro;2.6 billion.  Therefore the question is by how much would the auditor require that to be written down, given that the &euro;2.6 billion of deferred tax assets continues to exist.  My point is that the impact on the capital ratio of the banks would not be of such significance in respect of the current position compared with the position when the change took effect.</p> <p>  The Minister can park all that and decide.  Britain is different to us but principles about taxation are similar.  Poland and Italy are different to us, everywhere has a different tax code, but there are trends.  I used Britain as an example to show that this is not something that has not been done before.  A bank levy, a surcharge on corporation tax over what other companies would pay and a restriction to 25% on carried-forward losses is what applies in Britain.  If banks had losses in other countries, for instance in Hungary, they would only be able to carry them forward for five years and at only 50% of the taxable income per year.  I chose Hungary at random from a list of 23 countries that have restrictions on carrying forward losses.  </p> <p>  The crucial point is that we had this in our tax code but we did it at a time when it did not have any effect because the banks were not profitable.  However, AIB is now one of the most profitable banks in Europe.  Its profits are a huge credit to it, but they are being generated on the back of high interest rates and some of them relate to the mortgage interest scandal and so on.  AIB is hugely profitable and a bank that is seriously profitable and is still gouging the Irish public should be asked to pay corporation tax.  </p> <p>  The worst thing about this is evident when we look at the banks' accounts.  Take Bank of Ireland which has operations in Britain.  Its accounts show the corporation tax it pays in Britain, including the surcharge, because it generates some profits there, but in Ireland there is no corresponding figure.  It is zilch.  That is not right.  We are fools to allow this to happen.  It is not appropriate.  These are no longer small entities.  Whatever about Permanent TSB, AIB made &euro;1.5 billion in profits while Bank of Ireland made &euro;1 billion, and that is likely to be repeated if not exceeded, but they are not paying corporation tax.  The Minister made the point about doctors, nurses, members of the Garda and so on.  I am not so naive to think that an economy in a recession will never recover, just as I made the point about the housing crisis, of course we will get out of it.  It is wrong for the Minister to suggest I said there would never be a recovery; of course I acknowledged there would be a recovery.  The point I made, and which I stand over, is that the Government's policies deepened and lengthened the recession, and that is also what the Government is doing with the housing crisis.  I hope not, but will a Fine Gael Minister for Finance sit across here in ten years and say I claimed we would never get a handle on this housing crisis?  We will of course but the issue is that the current policies are making it worse or are dealing with it inadequately.  </p> <p>  The Minister is deflecting from the fact that the guy coming home from work and the nurse coming off her shift are paying their tax, while the bank that is charging them interest rates twice those charged by any other bank in Europe and is making profits of more than &euro;1 billion is not paying any tax.  The people who are to blame for that and who allowed that to happen are sitting around this room.  I definitely am not one of them but this is where these decisions are made.  This is completely unfair. </p> <p>  Finally, on the report, I acknowledge the Minister brought it forward.  I do not want him to write another one and to waste his time, I want him to act on behalf of the Irish people and stand up for the ordinary Irish person instead of protecting the banks.  Protecting the banks is what this is about.  Various scenarios are being mooted were we to do this or that, but it is nonsense.  These are hugely profitable banks.  Our competitors across the water can do this and they do this in other countries across the OECD but we will not.  Why?  The Minister has outlined no good reason here.  The loss of value in shareholdings, even if he disposed of them all, would dwarf the amount of money that can be brought in.  The technical paper that was produced was based on a 50% loss relief, I am arguing for a 25% rate, similar to that in Britain.  The deferred access is not an issue.  The point that AIB would be obliged to pay some tax on its &euro;1.5 billion is no justification for increasing interest rates or fees.  These are profitable banks.  </p></speech>

The Deputy can make all kinds of claims against me, which is one way of conducting politics, but I am making a different point.  I stand by my point, which is not deflection, but which cuts to the core of economic policy.</p><p>I have debated against the Deputy many times and regularly still do.  I debated against him, in particular, many times during the crisis and the darkest moments and I do not recall him ever saying a recovery would happen.  All that was happening was that the Government of the day was slowing it down.</p></speech>

The Deputy said in an earlier part of his contribution that we should park for a moment the effects that this tax treatment change would have on the banks' balance sheets and capital ratios.  The Deputy might be able to park that but, as Minister for Finance, I am not able to.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.975" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#VVV00500"><p>I am using the language and addressing the point that the Deputy made.  He might be able to do it but I am not.  The paper lays out that a change like that alone will have an effect on the capital ratios of the banks.  That will have two effects, only one of which I can reasonably offer my judgment on.  The other is based on what happens, and what has happened, on the valuation of our banks at different points in the recent past.  That effect would then lead to other things happening that I do not want to see happening.  I do not want to be in a position where the capital ratio of our banks is further compromised by a decision like this because I think it will do other things to our banks and economy that I do not want to see happening.</p> <p>  The second point is that the Deputy has a different view regarding whether the State should be a shareholder in our banks.  I want to get our money back.  The Deputy said many times that it was wrong that the Irish taxpayer is putting money into the Irish banking system.  If the Deputy made that charge then, perhaps he could now accept the value in trying to get that money back.  I want to get that money back.  In time, I want to be in a position that we get back the nearly &euro;11 billion we still have in our banking system, reduce our debt or, if another Government is in place with different views about that, it can use that money in a good way.  I do not want it wrapped up in a banking system and I certainly do not want us to be in a position that, in a changing world, we are still in a position where we own large elements of the Irish banking system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.976" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018110700002#VVV00600"><p>The Minister made a fine job of getting the money back from Anglo Irish Bank, fair play to him.  How much did we get back there?</p> <p>  We should never have pumped money into broken banks.  We should not have socialised the debts and privatised the profits.  When the banks are profitable, we should be getting it.  This is not just coming from people like me.  Directors of AIB have argued the same thing.  We should not just be privatising a profitable bank after taking all of the pain.  </p> <p>  Let me go back to the substance of the issue because I talked about the value of the bank.  The issue of whether the Government wants to sell it or not is a different issue.  I talked about the value of the bank and acknowledged that there would be a drop in value.  I am not disputing the Department's Estimates but restricting the losses that can be carried forward would dwarf any loss of the bank's share value.</p> <p>  Everybody has their own debating tactics, but when I said to park the issue of the effects on the banks' balance sheet and capital ratios, I did not mean to forget about it completely.  I made the point that the Minister's assertion to the committee gave the impression that the capital ratios of the banks would be wiped off by this amount.  If the Minister read the entire piece, he would understand that is not the case.  The Minister also makes the point that the report says that it will reduce the capital ratio in the banks.  It does not say that.  The report says there is an increasing likelihood that the auditors will require a reduction in value of the deferred tax assets.  It does not say it will.  There is no certainty whatsoever.  It is an assumption of what may happen as a result of carrying forward losses.  It says: "This would increase the likelihood that bank auditors would seek a write-down on the current value of the DTAs."  If that is the big issue that the Minister is holding onto, then it is a very weak one.  </p> <p>  I apologise for my tone of voice earlier, but I am passionate about this and I do not get it.  This is where the Minister should cut out all the Bill.  This is where he should act on behalf of interests, not personally, not like he has gone to AIB and asked what can he do for them; he is protecting that interest.  The Minister is making choices.  I have made this point to the Minister time and time again.  He is making choices.  The choices he and his Government made have resulted in some of the crises we are facing.  The housing crisis did not happen by accident.  It was Government policy that decided not to invest in sufficient resources in housing.  The trolley crisis did not happen by accident.  The Government has not opened hospital beds that were closed down during the Fianna F&aacute;il era, or invested in our health system in the capacity that is required to meet the needs of patients who are ill, vulnerable and suffering.  The Government has acted to protected vested interests in three financial institutions.  The Minister asked whether this amendment would apply to KBC or not.  The amendment is not clear, but I have been on the record time and time again that this is about the bailed-out banks.  This is about reverting to a position, and going beyond that, and taking it in line with Britain to restrict losses not to 50% but to 25%.</p></speech>

It states: "Restricting tax losses would impact capital and put additional pressure on PTSB."  Table 3 then shows what the deferred tax assets represent as a percentage of each bank's CET1 capital at the end of December 2017.  The heading reads, "Restricting tax losses would impact capital and put additional pressure on PTSB" but, within the commentary, there is no further particular reference to Permanent TSB.  Are there additional concerns relating to that bank arising from any change which is not spelled out here but which warranted a mention in the sub-heading for one bank but not the others?</p></speech>

He is right, I can see from scanning the text that Permanent TSB is only mentioned in the same way as the other two banks are and that is particularly the case in the third paragraph of the report.</p></speech>

It is only mentioned in the same way as the other banks in the text.  My view is that a change like this would have a particularly acute effect on Permanent TSB.  That is a consideration for the policy and should have been spelled out more in the text of the report.</p> <p>  As to what Deputy Doherty has said, I am equally passionate in putting my views forward and I have outlined the views and the reasons I believe this change would ultimately inflict further harm on Irish consumers and taxpayers.  That is my view.</p></speech>

I will restate it.  It is fine for the Deputy to laugh about it; it is no laughing matter for me.  A further effect on Irish people who depend on banks and have shares in banks is something that should be avoided and if, as the Deputy said a moment ago, he believes the money should not have gone into our banks, surely he will then join with me in efforts to try to get the money back.  That is what I am trying to do.</p></speech>

I take issue with the 12.5% tax rate.  I welcome the fact that we have a strengthening of the exit tax - obviously, the last one was not fit for purpose - but I am concerned about the rate applicable.  I believe the 33% rate should apply.  Even if the Minister were not to go with that, one would imagine that exit tax would be at the rate of corporation tax on non-trading profit, which is 25%.  Perhaps the Minister could provide clarification on the tax strategy papers because they say the responses to the coffee consultation focused primarily on the rate to be applied in the case of exit tax, with the majority favouring a 12.5% rate.  From my scanning of the submissions, I understand only KPMG proposed a 12.5% tax rate.  As far as I understand, only one submission actually suggested a rate.  If there was only one submission, that submission is the majority, but it is not really the majority.  I am concerned that the rate chosen here is too low and not appropriate.  The corporation tax rate on non-trading profit, at 25%, would at least be more appropriate, but the exit tax rate should be set at 33%.</p></speech>

The anchor they used for their exit tax was what their rate of corporate tax was and is, so I made a decision on that basis that our exit tax would be consistent with our existing rate of corporate tax.  I brought this regime in earlier than I had previously indicated.  The introduction of an exit tax regime such as this is an important part of what we need to do for our overall corporate tax regime.  As I said, by introducing it at a rate that is consistent with our corporate tax, CT, rate, I am doing what some other jurisdictions have done.</p></speech>

I would be interested to hear the Minister's views on such a case.  The origin of this proposal was a case in which a couple had moved into one of the partners' mother's home for a number of years, caring for her prior to her death.  During this time the couple rented their own house out.  They are now selling that house and will use a proportion of the proceeds to pay the remaining siblings to allow them to remain in their mother's house as it is mobility-adapted, which also suits their needs.  However, as they did not live in their own home for a number of years, they are liable for CGT, although with a partial exemption.  The question I am raising in proposing the preparation of a report is whether there is a case to be made for a person who moves out of his or her home to act as a carer for a family member to be exempt from CGT altogether.  I think there are a limited number of such cases, but the Minister can understand that the current position could be a deterrent to someone doing something that is right and appropriate in moving into his or her parental home to care for a parent, as a result of which, because the individual was not living in his or her own home, which he or she is now selling, there is an issue with CGT.</p></speech>

Is that right?</p></speech>

Furthermore, I assume the Deputy is referring to the possible changes to the operation of the existing capital gains tax principal private residence relief.  Principal private residence relief provides that any gain made by an individual on the disposal of his or her dwelling house together with land occupied as its gardens or grounds up to an area, exclusive of the site of the residence, of 1 acre is exempt from CGT.  For full relief to apply, the dwelling house must have been occupied by the individual as his or her principal private residence throughout his or her period of ownership of the house.  There are strict rules concerning the operation of principal private residence relief.  For example, where a wife and husband own two properties, one of these properties is deemed to be the residence for the purposes of the relief.  Where the house is not occupied full-time during the whole period of ownership, only the proportion of the gain applicable to the period of occupation is exempt and any other part of the gain is taxable.</p><p>In this regard, the dwelling house is treated as having been so occupied for a period of up to a year after the cessation of occupation, that is, up to the final 12 months of ownership may be deemed as a period of occupation.  This is usually intended to meet the case where the owner occupier puts his or her house up for sale and moves out but cannot find a buyer immediately.  Therefore, in the case in which a person or family moves into a parent's or other relative's home and then seeks to sell the original home, an exemption from CGT will be available on the portion of the gain for the period in which the original home was the person's only or main private residence.  I would have concerns about the potential impact of introducing changes or expanding the operation of principal private residence relief for the following reasons: that relief is a generous relief available to all individuals who own and occupy a dwelling house.  It is important that this relief is not undermined.  The operation of the relief is currently straightforward and transparent and the extension of the relief to include the scenario presented by the Deputy may include unintended consequences which could open up the relief to potential abuse.  Thus, it would be possible for an individual to establish principal private residence relief on one property and then move to their relative's property allowing the person potentially to acquire two properties with either a reduced rate of CGT or no CGT.</p><p> There are further operational matters such as defining a carer because, as the Deputy will appreciate, caring can cover a short period.  In any event, the current operation of principal private residence relief permits individuals to move in with their relatives to carry out caring duties.  Depending on the particular facts of the situation, if the individual disposes of their principal private residence within 12 months of moving out of their home, then full relief from CGT is available.</p><p> Those are the reasons I do not think we can do this.  It does imply to me that if I make this available to the Deputy he is looking for a report and in fact what I have read out is a brief report on the matter.  If the Deputy wants I can write to him with a summary of these reasons.</p></speech>

This is just a hard case and I imagine there are only a few of them but the Minister can imagine the individual feeling hard done by because they are doing the right thing which the State should support but we penalise it through the tax code when they sell their primary residence.  I may consider it again on Report Stage.</p> <p>  Real consideration is needed to find a way to deal more compassionately with people in these circumstances without these unintended consequences, notwithstanding the issues the Minister has raised of how to prove they have moved in, who is a carer and all of the complexities that come from that.  Maybe in the course of preparing tax strategy papers or whatever this might warrant further consideration. </p></speech>

The basic increase in betting duty and the way that it is formed will have a major impact on small retail outlets.  We have argued for a long time for a 3% betting duty to be placed on winnings and to be paid by the punter.  That existed many years ago at the higher rate of 10% and more.  I have engaged with different parts of the sector which disagreed with the proposal.  During those conversations some of them showed me their books and that is how I know an increase of 1% on betting duty will wipe out their profits.  It will also create a playing field that is not level because the large operators, which are well-known to us all, can absorb this and the small retail outlets cannot absorb it.  That is why I think it is important that it is on the winnings where it does not make much difference because the percentage of winnings relative to the stakes is quite high.  It is imposed on the individual.</p> <p>  If we want to consider betting as a vice, as opposed to increasing the level of revenue generated by the sector, that is one of the better ways to deal with it because an additional &euro;3 would have to be paid on a &euro;100 punt.  I am seriously concerned that this will have an impact on the sector and on jobs, primarily in rural Ireland.  The Minister should consider a different approach and, rather than impose the levy on the profits of the retailer, impose it on the individual placing the bet.</p></speech>

The question is how to do it in a way that minimises damage to employment in the domestic economy.  I understand that the Irish Bookmakers Association has made an alternative proposal.  I am not sure if the Department has had an opportunity to assess that properly but it proposes a tax on gross profits at the rate of 10% for retail bookmakers and 20% for online bookmakers.  The suggestion from them and others is that if the proposal as announced on budget day and in the Finance Bill 2018 proceeds it will result in the closure of hundreds of outlets.  We have to probe that and not take it at face value.</p> <p>  I too have looked at some accounts and think it is undoubtedly the case that going from 1% to 2% will result in the closure of some bookmakers.  Is there any other way of doing this that does not cause so much damage, particularly to retail bookmakers and the employment they provide?  What engagement, if any, has there been between the Minister or the officials in the Department with stakeholders since the announcement on budget day and is there any scope for an alternative measure which would bring in additional revenue but perhaps not have the same consequences?</p></speech>

A number of audited accounts have been circulated by various smaller operators, some of which are in my constituency.  Turnover taxes are crude by their nature.  They do not reflect profitability because they are based on turnover.  I was looking at the certified audited accounts of one particular small chain, all of whose outlets are located in provincial rural Ireland, which were accompanied by a letter from the chain's accountant.  The accounts show that it had a profit of &euro;307,000 after taking a reasonable level of remuneration for directors out of the business.  It is currently paying taxes of &euro;839,000.  That is made up of VAT, corporation tax and PAYE.  It pays rates of &euro;66,000.  If this proposal to move from 1% to 2% was to go ahead that profit of &euro;307,000 would become a loss of &euro;448,000.  That business would essentially no longer be viable and its 109 employees would be made redundant.</p> <p>  I know that we are in a growing economy but any jobs in rural Ireland have a premium attached to them because we are trying to advance a policy of balanced regional development.  It will be very difficult for people of that nature and with that skill set to be redeployed in rural areas.  I therefore have to question the projected yield of the increase in tax if a lot of small independent bookmakers will almost certainly go out of business.  The business will be centralised into a small number of international players.  Tax is often levied for public policy purposes and in the interests of the common good.  One generally tries to ensure taxes are fair and equitable.  It is unusual to see a tax that, if implemented, would necessitate immediate job losses from small independent bookmakers in the sector.  That concerns me.</p> <p>  Last week a lady who works in a small independent bookmakers came into my clinic.  She has got a mortgage and bought a house in rural Ireland.  She is of the view, as am I, that her job will definitely be gone if this tax is implemented in the manner proposed.  It is worth pointing out that when this levy was first changed, at the height of the recession in 2009, that change was reversed within two months.  That was when we were in a crisis.  We are now in a time when there is more money available.  I am not disputing the increase in the tax.  How we structure it is critical.  There are ways to structure a tax that will not penalise those at the bottom of the market - those who are struggling and finding it very difficult to make ends meet.  That is where I would be concerned.  We need to have some fairness and to structure this tax in a way that allows smaller operators to survive.</p></speech>

To open with a broad point, this is a sector that has done well.  The turnover and profitability within it are very significant.  Across the period in which the sector has been getting to this point, the taxes levied on it have changed and decreased.  I am of the very strong view that all sectors of our economy should be making an appropriate level of contribution to funding public services and all of the needs we have.  We went to the industry last year as part of the operation of the tax strategy group.  When we published the papers I indicated that this was something at which I wanted to look.  I wanted to look at how more of a contribution could be made by the sector in its tax contribution.  We looked at each of the points being put to us now at that time.</p> <p>  We put the idea of taxing the punter forward and discussed the proposal last year.  It was completely rejected by the industry.  This was not a route it wanted to go down.  It did not want to be in a place in which the punter would be taxed.  It was rejected by the sector.  Even leaving aside the fact that the sector is rejecting it, this is not a change I would want to make either.  In the future we could look at whether we need to ask the punter to make a further contribution, but I believe it is the economic activity in the sector that needs to make more of a tax contribution in the future.  If we move to the punter making the contribution the amount all those involved, whether big or small, would pay would be nil.  That is not sustainable.  It should change.</p> <p>  To look at the views put to me in respect of gross profitability, again we went through an open consultation with the industry last year.  There did not appear to be any interest in this then.  We received a proposal in respect of gross profitability from the industry last week.  I am willing to look at it and consider it, but we went through all this last year.  We had engagement with the sector last year and we could not get unanimity with regard to a new way to make a contribution.  I am happy to engage with the industry on how this could change in the future, but the measure in the Finance Bill, the change we seek to make that I announced on budget day, is the right policy for next year.</p></speech>

Given those audited accounts, is he aware of the impact this measure will have on these bookmakers' profitability or on taking them out of profit into loss?  How does the Minister respond to that?</p> <p>  I acknowledged that the industry does not want a tax on the punter.  A consultant economist has written a paper on this which suggests that winnings are recycled.  I do not necessarily subscribe to that idea.  I do not think people just go and bet.  I bet myself the odd time.  I do not think we should close the system down but I acknowledge that there are people who are addicted to gambling and that it can be very dangerous at times.  That is why it is important to place a tax on the consumer.  I have made this point numerous times.  I can remember going to the bookies with my father as a child and there was a 10% levy at that time.</p> <p>  That sound outside the room must be the winds of change blowing.</p></speech>

I find myself in a difficult position because I have advocated for an increase in this tax for many years but I cannot support increasing the tax in this form because it will have a real negative impact on jobs and outlets in the most rural parts of Ireland.  The only beneficiaries in the long term will be the Paddy Powers of this world.  I am not taking anything away from Paddy Power and its operation, but that is where this is going to go.  I understand there is no unanimity in the sector.</p></speech>

If one is trying to find ways of raising additional revenue, there is no way to do it that does not create a risk for somebody else.  <br/><br/>I have not seen those audited accounts the Deputy referred to, but staff from my Department have seen some of them and I have been briefed on them.  I am aware that this creates an additional significant risk for smaller independent bookmakers.  It will create difficulty for them, and they will have to make choices in how they respond.  My Department went through this last year.  We engaged, and we published the tax strategy paper, which makes clear to anyone reading it that I want to consider this issue.  Deputies might remember that there was a fair bit of media commentary last year, and an expectation that it was going to happen but it did not happen.  We engaged in consultation with the sector, and even now there is no support from within the sector for some of the proposals being put forward by the Deputies.  Perhaps we can learn from this that when the Minister of the day indicates that a sector needs to make more of a contribution than it has in the past, it will means that the <i>status quo</i>will not continue into the following year.  We could not get agreement on any other option.  The idea of the gross profit tax was shared with us last week.  If this is a concept that the industry is genuinely interested in and is something in which it wants us to engage, we will do so.  However, I am clear that the measures I am bringing in will not be changed.  We went through this a year ago and we could not reach agreement on an alternative model.  I have to look at the choices available to me. </p></speech>

I practised in tax, and I cannot think of a single sector in which unanimous agreement could be reached on how it should be taxed.  The Minister has to take decisions, and he is used to taking and making difficult choices.  Regarding the structure of this, I question the yield projected on the basis that if one takes a particular decision, the smaller elements in the industry will be wiped out.  My concern is that it creates a significant risk for our smaller operators.  From the audited accounts on view, the only option available to those businesses is closure because they will not be able to finance the loss caused by the increase in tax.</p></speech>

There is a subtlety in this regard.  If there is a risk to life or health in an emergency, it is obvious that there must be a physical examination.</p></speech>

The matter was raised at the time of a consultation that would be of greater depth than would normally happen during a medical examination, for example in the event of there being a possible pre-existing condition or to determine whether there is a risk to the health of the woman which could in turn lead to a risk to her life.  The amendment is well placed.  It covers two issues, namely, the need for a medical examination and for a discussion with the patient to take into account all of the circumstances and past history.</p></speech>

I am very much in favour of trying to use more inclusive language when it comes to the word &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;, while having to recognise, as Deputy Durkan said, the fact that in an emergency situation, one could, for example, find a woman unconscious.  I am trying to come up with the appropriate wording.  As I said yesterday, I will be looking at how we can improve this by working with colleagues before Report Stage.</p></speech>

The view has clearly been taken by some people outside the Houses and in this committee room that the person involved is not central in the current wording, although I know that was not the intention.  I think the language that is currently used is a bit unfortunate but the Minister has indicated he will come back to us.  I echo what Deputy Donnelly said last night in requesting that we have those suggestions in a timely manner and that we would have the Minister&rsquo;s revised wording in enough time to enable us to table amendments if necessary.</p></speech>

When the Minister is considering what consistent wording to use, for me there are two tests. One is that the voice of the woman is put front and centre in the various sections.  It is potentially more nuanced and complex in this section because it provides for an emergency case and the woman may not be conscious.  That can be reflected by means of terms such as &ldquo;where possible&rdquo; or &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;, or whatever the right language is such that the woman&rsquo;s views are ascertained.  We will come to an amendment I have tabled for a later section which provides that a termination be actually requested by the woman.  That is missing from various sections.  It is more nuanced because, in an emergency situation under section 11, or indeed in the case of a risk to life under section 10, although it may be the case that the woman may not be in a position to give her views, in many cases she will be.  When the Minister is considering the wording, these are the two tests I would like to see met - namely, that the voice of the woman be placed put front and centre and, where it is practicable, that a termination be requested by the woman.</p></speech>

It also includes a discussion with the woman about what course of treatment is the most appropriate.  Therefore, "medical consultation" is an all-encompassing term.  It includes taking a history, an examination and a engaging in discussion.  In the context of what Deputy Donnelly stated, it takes into account the wishes of the woman, which would be paramount in the context of any decision.  "Medical consultation" is a wider term for what happens than "examining" the pregnant woman.  Would Deputy O'Connell like to come in given that this is her amendment?</p></speech>

I apologise for being late.  We discussed this yesterday and I completely agree with the Chairman.  It does not seem right that we would prescribe in legislation what a doctor would do.  For example, if somebody was five weeks' pregnant as a result of a rape, we would not want a doctor to think that he or she would have to tick a box to say a physical examination had happened in order to ensure compliance with the law.  The doctor and the woman together can make this decision in a consultative, two-way process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.1073" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110700002#C01300"><p>This is an area in respect of which we can make improvements.  Going back to one of our many conversations yesterday, there is a question as to how much we include in the legislation.  I very much take the point that while the word "examination" is in the legislation, there is a sense that there is a more appropriate phrase and I am very committed to delivering that.  Where we go beyond adding more words, we have to make a judgment call, as a committee and as an Oireachtas, regarding whether that helps or hinders doctors.</p> <p>  Going back to the conversation as to where some of this should reside, there is an argument that it should reside in clinical guidelines and in the fact that the Medical Council is already the regulator of doctors.  Deputy Donnelly has rightly said that there is nuance.  If the woman is unconscious and it is an emergency, the principles of consent already apply.  How we get that balance right is one of the tests I will have to apply so there is not an accidental lack of clarity for doctors.  We all know where we want to get to.  We do not like the concept of the word "examined."  Deputies O'Connell, Donnelly, Durkan and O'Reilly have all referred to the voice of the woman and I am fully in agreement with them in that regard.  My officials and I think we can improve the wording.</p></speech>

My understanding of the section might need some direction as well.  During the referendum campaign, the Minister indicated that he would not allow a situation where there would be an abortion where an unborn child had reached viability.  In this section, we are discussing the risk to life or health in an emergency.  That is a very serious situation and nothing should be done in such situations to put the life of the mother in danger in any way.  However, as we discussed yesterday, in many cases it is a tragic situation that arises and in most instances the mother would seek the survival of the child.  The section states, &quot;Notwithstanding the generality of <i>section 10</i>, or any determination made or pending pursuant to <i>section 17 </i>of an application under <i>section 14(2)</i>, a termination of pregnancy may be carried out in accordance with this section by a medical practitioner ...&quot;.  The definition of a termination of pregnancy is the ending of the life.  My instinct is that it might be necessary to add that the child has not reached viability.  What is the Minister's view?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.1083" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110700002#D00900"><p>As I said during the campaign - I will continue to say it because it is the truth - doctors in hospitals always endeavour to deliver babies where possible and they always endeavour to save both lives in doing so where that is possible.  I do not believe any of us, regardless of our perspective on this, would know or be able to find an obstetrician working in our maternity services who would say he or she would do anything else.  I appreciate that the Deputy has referred to the fact that women in these situations will rightly and understandably also wish to see their babies delivered.  We have doctors who wish to save the life and women who wish to have their babies delivered, so the issue is how to deal with an absolute emergency.  This is the emergency provision in the legislation in respect of circumstances where there is an immediate threat to the life or risk of serious harm to the health of the woman.  If the procedure is not carried out straight away, the woman may die and, as the Deputy said, nobody wishes to see that happen.  I am not being pejorative in that regard.</p> <p>  In these situations it would not be appropriate to stipulate that the procedure may not be carried out in cases where the foetus is viable.  Doctors often have to make decisions in an instant in such situations.  This is not a policy deviation.  If we accepted this amendment, the emergency provisions would be more restrictive than those in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  That Act does not include the viability test in the emergency provisions, and that law was drafted to comply with the eighth amendment to the Constitution.  Now that the amendment has been repealed the idea that we would introduce legislation that would be more restrictive in its emergency provisions than the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act would not make sense.  I understand what the Deputy is trying to do, but I believe it happens in hospitals in any event.  It is what doctors do and it is what women want.  In an emergency situation such as this, however, doctors must be allowed to use their clinical judgment on how best to deal with the situation.</p></speech>

It seeks to encode equality in the abortion legislation.  The Minister and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, are on record many times as stating the legislation will not allow for abortion in the case of a disability.  We note that where abortion is used in the case of a disability, it has a shocking effect.  For example, in Britain 90% of babies diagnosed within the womb as having Down's syndrome are aborted.  I do not think anybody wants to see that happen.  Countries such as Norway which has a liberal abortion regime, as well as Denmark and Iceland are analysing what is happening among their populations on this issue.  In Britain there is an organisation called Don't Screen Us Out which was set up by people with disabilities following their realisation that people with similar disabilities were not being born to the same extent as elsewhere.  We know that where abortion is allowed up to 12 weeks, a person can have a non-invasive pregnancy test.  In Ireland this can be achieved within three days.  The test is 99.9% accurate in determining whether the unborn has a disability such as Down's syndrome.  I understand this is leading to certain hospitals having high rates of abortion in cases of Down's syndrome.  The purpose of the amendment is to provide that it would not be a legal ground on which to have an abortion and that, to used the words used by the Minister during the referendum, it would explicitly not be a condition within the regulation for an abortion.</p><p>The other aspect is gender selection.  There are approximately 100 million women missing from the world owing to gender selection abortion, foeticide and infanticide because certain cultures do not value unborn baby girls to the same level as unborn baby boys.  It is shocking to us in this part of the world to see that happen, but it is happening at a phenomenal rate.  It is also distorting populations.  We are fooling ourselves if we believe it does not happen in Ireland also.  I have spoken to a woman who, as a result of pressure exerted by her family, had an abortion in Britain because her unborn baby was a female.  In Britain the Labour Party is bringing about amendments to make gendercide illegal.  In other words, they are to make it illegal for an unborn baby girl to be aborted because of her gender.  In developing legislation we look at best practice internationally.  Given that other countries that some people would consider progressive on these issues are rowing back from these two situations, logically, in our legislation we should seek to prevent those situations from occurring.</p></speech>

I wish to do so because, like many others in the room, during the years I have had the privilege of seeing many of my close friends having children with Down's syndrome.  I have known these children since they were small babies and had the pleasure of being in their company on family occasions and at other times.  Every time I meet them they bring such brightness and happiness to the occasion.  That is why I wanted to ensure this amendment would be discussed by me and my colleagues in front of the Minister.  It has been tabled with the very best of good intentions.</p> <p>  I have studied what has happened in places like England where it seems there seems are selective births.  If a person knows there is trouble with a pregnancy and a child could have Down's syndrome, that child could be denied the right to life.  I want to see the amendment discussed and voted on in order that we can protect such babies and give them the same right to be born as I or anybody else in this room has had.  It is a serious and important matter.  Every one of the people who have signed their names to the amendment has done so for nothing but the very best of genuine and heartfelt reasons.  That is why I would like to hear what others have to say about it.  I would certainly like to hear what the Minister has to say about it.  I remind him that when the campaign was ongoing, he made absolutely clear statements indicating that such children would be protected as the referendum was not about being selective on grounds of gender and disability or abortions being allowed in such cases.  I would never get up in the morning and set out to wrong anybody or put something in a person's mouth that he or she did not say.  If I am wrong about what I believe he said during the campaign, he should, please, tell me and I will stand corrected.  My understanding is that at the time the Minister gave very clear commitments which I appreciated during the debate, despite him being on one side and me being on the other.  When he made that statement, I was very happy and thought it was great because at least if the process went ahead, this category of children would be protected.  That is what I was sure of and understood.  It is what I am now worried about, with my colleagues who have signed their names to the amendment.  </p> <p>  As I do not want to take up any more time, I thank the Chairman for allowing me to speak.</p></speech>

With everybody who campaigned for a "Yes" vote, I said during the referendum campaign - it is true - that in Ireland disability would not be a ground for termination.  Many of the people in the room, including Deputy Mattie McGrath, sat on the all-party committee that had to make a decision on whether as a country we wanted to include disability as a ground for termination or whether we wanted to limit it to fatal foetal abnormalities.  I read the report again yesterday and the committee's view was very clear that in this country fatal foetal abnormalities, not foetal abnormalities, would be grounds for termination.  There are no grounds in the legislation related to disability.</p> <p>  As always, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae's contribution was courteous and respectful in tone; therefore, I do not mean the following in a provocative sense, but I was struck by the comments of Down Syndrome Ireland during the referendum campaign when its members asked us all not to politicise or weaponise their children in the debate.  That is an important point.  Women have children with disabilities for many reasons, not just because the eighth amendment stopped them from having a termination.  It is a mindset around which I find really difficult to get my head.  I do not intend to reopen the discussion which took place during the referendum campaign, as the amendment might do, that children with Down's syndrome had only been born in Ireland because of the eighth amendment.  That is so disrespectful to the parents of those children who, as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae correctly said, have brought such joy, but there is the idea that those children, many of whom have grown into adults, could witness this debate and think the only reason they are alive is the eighth amendment.  That is not true and it is not fair to the parents of children with disabilities.</p> <p>  I said the following so many times during the referendum campaign and may as well say it again.  Comparing our law with the law in Britain is not fair game.  I do not wish to criticise the law in Britain because for a very long time legislators in these Houses were happy enough for Irish women to be exported to Britain to use British law to access a termination during a crisis pregnancy.  The law in Britain is very old and has a much broader range of terms and grounds.  When we drafted our law and the committee was drafting its proposals, it was not the British system that we were trying to emulate.  There are heads and grounds allowed in Britain that are not allowed and specifically banned in our legislation.  It is proposed that in Ireland in early pregnancy a woman with her doctor can be trusted to make the decision on the continuation of her pregnancy.  That was done because the members of the special committee had considered the matter at great length.  If we had tried to be overly prescriptive, we would have got into all sorts of difficulty with respect to matters related to rape, sexual assault, etc.  There is no specific indication in early pregnancy up to 12 weeks.</p> <p>  I should be clear that the Bill, as drafted, does not provide for termination of pregnancy to be carried out on the grounds of sex, race and disability.  It provides for termination of pregnancy to be carried out in cases where there is a risk to life or of serious harm to the health of a pregnant women in an emergency.  It provides for it where there is a condition present that is likely to lead to the death of the foetus and where the pregnancy has not exceeded 12 weeks.  We had a discussion during the referendum campaign and will have it again today.  Members will suggest this law is trying to do something it is not; not only is it not trying to do it, but it explicitly goes out of its way in listing grounds to ensure the reason in question will not be one of those grounds.  It will not come as a surprise to Deputies to hear that I do not intend to deviate from what we told the public through the general scheme.  Therefore, I do not intend to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

During the referendum campaign the Minister made numerous commitments to the people that discrimination against people with disabilities would not be permitted in the legislation.  During the course of the campaign numerous consultant obstetricians argued that so-called non-invasive pregnancy tests, NIPTs, consisting of blood tests in the ninth week of pregnancy, could be used to detect a baby's DNA and indicate the sex of the baby and whether he or she had a condition such as Down's syndrome.  These tests are available in Ireland.  When the Minister criticises us, he chooses to say we exported Irish women to England, but when we want to ensure a safe process and hold him to commitments he made during the campaign, he argues that we are bringing British law and that of other countries into the debate.  Why would we not compare ourselves with other countries such as Finland, as the practice has indicated that in some countries Down's syndrome will be eradicated?  These countries boast that they will be 100% free of Down's syndrome by 2020.  It is very important that we hold the Minister to his comments.  Can he be held to anything he said?  He made those statements clearly on numerous occasions, but he is now seeking to wriggle out of them when dealing with the Bill.  He is demonising us for tabling the amendments, but we are trying to hold him to something to which he committed.  That is despite him changing his attitude throughout his career.  I have letters on my phone that prove it.</p></speech>

The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, was quoted in <i>The Irish independent</i>on 14 May 2018 as saying that the Government &quot;specifically excluded disability for grounds for abortion in the legislation&rdquo;.  He stated that disability, including Down's syndrome, would be excluded as a ground for abortion in any legislation.  That was just a couple of months ago, but there is absolutely nothing in the Government's Bill ruling out abortion on these grounds.  I rest my case.  We all know what is going on here.  We cannot believe anything that comes out of this Minister's mouth.</p></speech>

We had huge discussions at the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  We came to a conclusion and we had a vote.  There is absolutely no suggestion that the scenario the Deputies are seeking to prevent will actually happen.  I personally find it objectionable that the men here seem to think that the women of Ireland would only progress with a pregnancy where a child had a disability because of the eighth amendment.  That is a disgusting attitude to women, but it is what it is.  This is unnecessary.  The Chair used the word "provoke".  This amendment is designed to restart a debate.  For the avoidance of doubt, more than 58% of people in Kerry voted "Yes", as did 69% of people in Meath.  The result was two to one in Cork and the "Yes" vote was more than 59% in Tipperary.

In fact, the committee specifically excluded Down's syndrome.  We have qualified that on the basis that everybody knew people with Downs' syndrome and that they were not a burden on society.  As they were everybody's friends, there was no reason to introduce any particular threat to them.</p> <p>  This is a serious issue.  Insofar as is possible, we need to avoid making suggestions that are not accurate, because they scare people.  They will scare pregnant women who may be facing a crisis pregnancy.  We should avoid that, particularly when those circumstances do not exist.  The suggestion that an unborn child might be discriminated against on the basis of sex or colour is outrageous.  It is totally and grossly unfair to women, to the medical profession and to everything we have spoken about in the last year. We need to dwell on that for a moment.  To make that suggestion is to suggest that women treat this in a frivolous fashion, that it is a sort of social add-on.</p> <p>  The committee also excluded socio-economic circumstances as a ground for abortion, termination of pregnancy or whatever we want to call it.  We need to have some consideration for the circumstances that prevail where women seek a termination of a pregnancy.  We have talked about the health issues, the threat to health, life and their mental and physical condition.  Those are serious issues that can have very serious consequences for everybody involved and for their families.  To suggest that we did not have that debate last year and to avoid altogether the discussions we had is unfair.  It is unfair to the committee that sat for a very long period last year, it is unfair to the discussions in the Citizens' Assembly which devoted a considerable amount of time to the subject, and to all who were involved in those discussions.</p> <p>  What most impressed me during the hearings was that women clearly did not wish to seek a termination of pregnancy as some kind of social add-on.  That was not their consideration.  Their considerations were much deeper than that.  They felt genuine worry and fear for their situation and their health.  It was to address those issues that the committee spent so much time talking over the possibilities, what might happen and what has happened in the past. </p> <p>  The last point I want to make is simply this.  That was all done against the backdrop of some tragic situations that have developed over the years, of which we are well aware and have read about and discussed at length.  In those circumstances, certain suggestions are unfair to women who might seek a termination of pregnancy in the future, to the medical profession whose responsibility it is to assist in those situations, to Members of this House and to the very large body of people who discussed the issue both inside and outside of this House.  We need to treat those women with a great deal of seriousness and acknowledge that they have responsibilities they know about and want to exercise.  They only approach this kind of situation when they have genuine concerns. </p></speech>

We are protecting children with disabilities as was promised by the Minister and others during the campaign.  It looks as if others here can move dozens of amendments to this Bill, but when we move a few that we feel could lead to the protection of a child with disabilities we are talked down to.  I would like to ask the Minister where in the Bill children with disabilities are specifically mentioned.  That is a very important aspect of this.  The feedback I get indicates that this protection is not in the Bill.  There are a lot of words, but specifically mentioning children with disabilities is hugely important for a lot of people.  Down Syndrome Ireland may have spoken, but I have spoken to dozens, maybe hundreds of parents of children with Down's syndrome who have had major concerns since the referendum and before it.  Down Syndrome Ireland certainly was not speaking on behalf of all those people, and if it was, it certainly did not speak to them before making its statements.</p> <p>  I will obviously be supporting this amendment, simply because I do not see mention of children with disabilities and their protection anywhere in the Bill.  To satisfy me, we must add that wording to the Bill.</p></speech>

We should do our damnedest not to close down debate but, rather, to facilitate it even if we find it very difficult to accept the views of others on this issue.  Minorities have the right to have a voice in this forum.  An exit poll conducted by RT&Eacute; on the day of the referendum indicated that a majority of voters, even those who voted "Yes", did not agree with abortion on the grounds of disability.  It is patronising to say that people with a disability have a uniform view on this issue and that one organisation can speak on all their behalf.  People with a disability, like any other people, hold a diversity of views.  Similar to Deputy Michael Collins, many disabled people have told me that they want abortion on the basis of disability explicitly precluded in the Bill.  On 14 May 2018, the Minister stated that disability had specifically been excluded as a ground for abortion in the legislation.  There is no specific mention of the preclusion of disability as a ground for abortion in the Bill.</p> <p>  Thankfully, there is a great culture in this country and parents love their children and want to see them survive and thrive.  We know legislation is a significant element of social norms.  When legislation changes, so do social norms.  We are not making up these statistics.  They are flashing warning signs from all over Europe.  Such countries are beginning to row back on the idea that disability should be a ground for abortion.  The Minister stated that it is not included in the Bill.  However, the Bill allows for it and that is the key element.  Abortion on the ground of disability is facilitated by the availability of abortion up to 12 weeks for no indication.  If one allows abortion on request up to 12 weeks, one facilitates abortion on the basis of disability.  We are suggesting an amendment to specifically preclude that.  The amendment would be very difficult to implement, but it would send a wonderful message to people with disabilities that we, as a State, want to ensure in the best way we can that we will not allow for abortion on the basis of disability.</p> <p>  On gender selection, which is discounted by some but is happening all over the world, the British Labour Party stated that non-invasive pregnancy tests should not be allowed to check for gender because it is morally wrong for abortions to be carried out on the basis of gender.  If the Government wanted to address this issue, it would take a practical step to prevent it, rather than stating that it is not providing for such grounds for abortions even though they will be possible under the Bill.</p></speech>

If the committee sought to exclude life-limiting conditions or fatal foetal abnormalities from the amendment, I would be open to that.  The amendment simply seeks to encode equality in the legislation and to give effect to the explicit commitments made by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister, Deputy Harris, during the referendum campaign.</p></speech>

I take the point made by Deputy O'Reilly in that regard, although she might not agree that every word or line was transposed.  This is an attempt to have a "gotcha" moment.  Everything in the Bill is lawful.  Everything not allowed for in the Bill is unlawful.  One does not list in the Bill everything which it does not permit.  One lists in the legislation those measures which are lawful.  We had a very robust debate yesterday about offences and so on and what is not lawful.  We do not want to list everything that is not lawful.  The Bill states what is lawful and everything else is unlawful.  Following extensive debate and consultation with the people of Ireland, the Oireachtas decided that abortion would be available without specific indication in early pregnancy up to 12 weeks.  That was the decision we made.</p></speech>

The Deputy gave a little hint of from where this amendment is coming.  It aims to make a section of the Bill  inoperable.  The Deputy acknowledged that the amendment could not be enforced.  It would force doctors to second guess women.  I refer to its phraseology, such as "sought because of".  I disagree with the way in which the Deputy is approaching the decision-making process which women go through with their doctors.  Leaving aside the fact that the amendment is unnecessary, how would it be operable?  I believe it is a subtle attempt to render the key "no specific indication" provision inoperable.</p> <p>  Disability is not a ground in the legislation.  The committee on the eighth amendment had the opportunity to specifically include disability as a ground for abortion.  It rightly decided not to do so, which means that the situation here in that regard will be very different to that in the United Kingdom.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and I will not agree on this and we are, to some extent, reopening the debate of the referendum.  On several occasions, he referred to the commitments I made to the Irish people.  I committed to introduce a law along the lines of the general scheme published in March.  The Bill does not deviate from the grounds of that scheme.</p></speech>

The Minister stated on Thursday, 1 February, that abortion on the grounds of disability would be confined to cases of fatal foetal abnormality.  I asked the Minister would it be possible and he stated that it would not.  The Minister's view in that regard contradicts all of the scientific evidence that has been put forward.</p> <p>  Members have tabled amendments left, right and centre.  I have approached this process with the view that they did so for their stated reasons.  The amendment seeks to codify the Minister's commitments and ensure equality within the Bill.  It would be a shocking message for the country if we were unwilling to put that into legislation.</p></speech>

The Minister stated that he would meet representatives of the transgender community to seek their input on the wording of the Bill because words are important.  The same level of importance is not being given to these words which would allow for the preclusion of abortion on the grounds of disability.</p></speech>

It is an unfair portrayal of my position.  Of course, words matter.  Yesterday, I outlined the difficulty that the wording of the Bill could cause for the transgender community.  I will meet representatives of that community to discuss the Bill and explain the wording to them.  The Deputy's amendment is unnecessary.  However, in terms of impact it is an attempt to make the legislation inoperable.  There is no intention to allow or any ground for allowing termination on the basis of disability in the Bill.  No matter how many times the Deputy says that it will be possible, I will continue to restate that point.  We made a conscious decision to exclude disability as a ground for termination.</p></speech>

The Bill states, "where abortion will be allowed", but because disability is not mentioned, it means that disability is not grounds for abortion.  I ask the Minister to say directly to me that this is his intention.  </p><p> If disability is brought in, it would weaken the legislation.  Who defines "disability"?  Some parents might not be able to cope while others will.  There are different levels of disability.  In that context, it would be better to leave it out because its inclusion would weaken the Bill.  That said, I want the Minister to look me in the eye and say that the intention is that disability is not a grounds for abortion.</p></speech>

It is not that I need to admit anything.  Deputies Donnelly and Kelly, who are sitting on either side of Deputy Murphy O'Mahony and I, as well as everyone else on this side said the same during the referendum campaign because it is the truth.  In the general scheme that we published, based on the Oireachtas committee's report, we specifically took a conscious decision to exclude disability, unlike the British law which uses language that most people in this room and in society at large would find offensive, in terms of how it describes people with disabilities.  We took that decision to exclude it.</p></speech>

The Minister has just outlined the position clearly.  It is disrespectful to suggest to those who have family members with Down's syndrome that such members are only here because the eighth amendment protected them.  it is not the preserve of those on the opposite side to appreciate the joy that somebody with a profound disability can bring to a family.  I would not like the impression to be given that it is only one side at this committee that is standing up for people with Down's syndrome.  There are many people who voted "Yes" in the referendum and who campaigned for a "Yes" vote who have family members with Down's syndrome.</p> <p>  The UNCRPD states that the right approach is not to have a disability group in the legislation as it is stigmatising to that group.  It also holds that the law should not specifically preclude a group because it would grossly interfere with access to abortion.  Under the 12-week provision, the pregnant woman would have to be interviewed, tested and examined, with the foetal DNA present in maternal blood after nine weeks being tested and re-tested.  An ultrasound would have to be conducted to confirm a disability, whether physical, genetic or otherwise.  This amendment undermines the "without indication" aspect of the under 12-week provision.  It is deliberately designed to inflame the situation and to re-run the referendum in this committee.  I find it quite difficult to listen to some of the commentary this morning.  While I understand that minorities need to be represented, I would like to remind all present that the women of Ireland are a majority, not that one would know it sometimes.  It is about time that the 52% of us stand up and not take the sort of rhetoric and language that is being used with regard to this issue this morning.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.1192" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110700002#J00900"><p>I will also oppose the amendment.  As has been laid out, it would make the section inoperable.  It would make early term terminations impossible.  Including a list of prohibitions, be they intellectual disabilities, physical disabilities, Down's syndrome or whatever, would weaken the protections.  Such a list is essentially a hierarchy of reasons and conditions, which would cause confusion.  The legislation is black and white.  It is an offence to be involved in a termination, except on specific grounds and those grounds do not include disability of any type.</p> <p>  There is communication work to be done and this conversation is part of that work.  People have contacted me, including legislators, who have said that they were told that disability would not be a ground for abortion but that when they read through the legislation, they could find no reference to it anywhere.  In that context, they are asking what is going on.  I have explained that disability is not referenced in the Bill because everything is prohibited, except for the exceptions laid out in sections 10 to 13, inclusive.  People have to understand the legislation to understand that point.  </p> <p>  I accept Deputy Durkan's point that for members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution and of this committee, it is frustrating to keep hearing this but in reality, the public were not on those committees, were not in attendance at the Citizen's Assembly and are not as familiar with the legislation as we are because they have lives and other things to do.  It is our job to understand the legislation.  It is not crystal clear to the casual observer, for whom disability not being a ground for abortion is important.  If such an observer does a keyword search for "disability" in the Bill, he or she will not find it and will worry.  Many people have genuine concerns but those concerns are met through the legislation by following a logic that holds that everything is exempt, including disability, except what is on the list.  It is worth our while, as legislators, to reflect on that.  The protections are rock solid.  However, one has to understand how the legislation works to see that.  There is a job to be done with regard to communication in order that the casual observer who has better things to be doing than poring over detailed sections of a Bill understands what is being done here.</p></speech>

It is connected with what has happened on the other three days here.  They are all part of the same thing.  I wish to speak to amendment No. 89 as well.  The amendment is tabled on its own but they are linked.  It is a question of either-or with our amendments.  They all relate to the mandatory waiting period.  Perhaps we can discuss it with the later grouping.</p><p>Our amendments are a question of either-or.  Amendment No. 82 deletes the mandatory waiting period in its entirety.  The reason is that it was a feature of the deliberations of the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution that timely access to abortion is key.  We want to avoid any scenario where a waiting period might be used as a barrier.  All the evidence provided by all the organisations supports this approach.  I was particularly struck by the observations of the Guttmacher Institute and the evidence-based research behind the associated deliberations.  They showed that the cost go higher the longer a woman waits.  The number of available option providers tends to decrease as the pregnancy progresses.  Delay in any sense is not good.</p><p>All the evidence shows that women spend a good deal of time on this and make the decision carefully.  It is a little patronising to assume that they need additional mandatory time to be sure to be sure.  Anyone who makes the decision has thought about it.  In many instances, women have made up their minds when they consult their medical practitioners.  In other instances, they consult them as a sounding board because they may want extra time, but they will make that decision for themselves and we do not need to force them to do that in legislation.</p><p>Providing for a mandatory waiting period was not something that came out strongly in the committee hearings.  It is in place in other jurisdictions.  I have been struck by countries like Netherlands, which people may have been a little surprised about.  We should note that the Netherlands waiting period is provided for in the context of open accessible abortion provision.  It is different because we are coming from a different stance.</p><p>Our preferred option is to remove the three-day period altogether.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.1199" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110700002#K00300"><p>Sorry, it is amendment No. 88, which is in this grouping as well.  That would delete the date of certification as the starting point of the three days and substitute it with the date upon which an appointment with the medical practitioner referred to in section 13(1) is requested.  This is an absolute minimum.  We would prefer its removal entirely, but if the Government is hell-bent on having a waiting period, then it should be constructed from the date the person makes the appointment rather than the date of certification.  This is in the context of ensuring that there is no possibility that the waiting period could act as some sort of arbitrary barrier to care.  The WHO has stated that mandatory waiting periods are a barrier.  We should be careful about putting one in.  We need to ensure the period will not be used as a barrier.  That is a key point.  The best way to ensure that such a period is not a barrier is that it forms part of the protocols and guidance developed by professional bodies rather than be provided for in legislation.  Such guidelines represent a better way of dealing with a waiting period.  It could be dealt with as part of the care pathway and so on.  Again, if the Government is saying that three days is the absolute minimum, then it must begin from the date of the woman's request for an appointment with a medical practitioner if it is to be workable at all.  We do not want someone who is at nine or ten weeks being dragged into a scenario where she is suddenly over the 12-week period and out of it.  We think it is very important.</p></speech>

Amendments Nos. 83 to 88, inclusive, are related and are physical alternatives to amendment No. 82.  Amendments Nos. 86 to 88, inclusive, are physical alternatives to amendment No. 85.  Amendments Nos. 87 and 88 are physical alternatives to amendment No. 86.  Amendment No. 88 is a physical alternative to amendment No. 87, which is what she has said more or less.</p></speech>

The rationale behind amendment No. 88 is based on the fact that we have been told repeatedly that the three days has to be provided for.  It bears repeating that three days was not recommended by the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  We did not view it as necessary.  It was a political construct and was not looked for by doctors.  It was not looked for by that committee but it made its way into the public arena.  On that basis, we chose to concentrate on how, in the context of the three days being a matter of public discourse, we could ensure access.  For example, let us consider the position of a young woman in direct provision.  She may not be capable of visiting a doctor twice.  It is a barrier.  The more barriers we put in place, the more likely we are to not do what we have set out to do, which is to ensure that women can be cared for at home.  In fact, the more barriers we put in place, the more attractive we make it for women to self-medicate.</p><p>We have all agreed that while abortion tablets are safe, it is not ideal that they would be taken without medical supervision.  Equally, I refer to access for women living in the North.  The Minister has given a commitment that the North will be next, which is fine.  It is a great phrase; one can put it on a piece of cardboard and hold it up.  However, it has to have some meaning.  We cannot keep saying "The North is next" or "There has to be access for women living in the North."  The requirement to visit a doctor twice will serve as an unnecessary barrier.  I am not suggesting the Minister put the phrase on a piece of cardboard, but it was put on one.  That is what I am saying.  The idea of a requirement to make two visits to a doctor where one lives in rural Ireland or is in a situation of domestic violence is one we considered at the committee where we took the view that access was paramount.  Ultimately, the test of this legislation will be whether we reduce the numbers of women accessing terminations via tele-medicine and who are forced to travel.  If we put unnecessary barriers in place, we will fail that test.</p><p> I accept that the three-day period formed part of the public discourse in the run-up to the referendum campaign, albeit I would like to see it removed.  In that scenario we need to consider how best we can maximise access for those who need it.  The only way to do so is to minimise the requirement to physically attend a doctor.  By the time a woman comes to see the doctor, she has made the decision.  She has deliberated.  The idea of a cooling off period is associated with insurance, which is not right.  It has been referred to, not by me but by others as a cooling off period and I do not think that is right.  However, making two visits to a doctor, even where they do not have to be paid for, is still a requirement to obtain an appointment and attend physically.  The clock should start ticking from the moment the appointment is made.  Where a woman has had the opportunity to deliberate and talk to her partner or friends and come to the decision on her own, like a grown-up, making two visits is unnecessary.</p></speech>

I am not at all convinced that the three-day waiting period is an obstacle to a woman receiving the necessary service at the time she wants it.  My grounds for so saying formed the basis on which I campaigned during the referendum.  I spoke on the same basis at the committee hearings where it was generally accepted.  I cited Germany and the Netherlands as two countries which had waiting periods which were a little longer.  That waiting period was included for a purpose.  The medical practitioners from the Netherlands who appeared before the committee pointed this out.  That is where consultation comes in and it is very important.  As this is a serious matter, consultation is required.  The woman is entitled to receive the best possible advice which is non-directive to meet her particular circumstances.  The practitioners from the Netherlands said that in some cases the woman changed her mind and sometimes did so more than once, as she is entitled to do and may be prone to so doing in the circumstances, depending on her situation.  </p> <p>  We also found in the course of the hearings that women did not go out to seek an abortion just for the fun of it.  In fact, they treated the issue very seriously, even and particularly where there was a disability.  I forgot to mention this earlier.  They went out of their way to be conscious of the need to care for, nurture and do everything possible to bring the child to a natural birth.</p> <p>  We spent a lot of time at the committee discussing the issue of counselling.  After the referendum somebody mentioned that counselling was not part of what was being provided, but it needs to be.  That is a fact which was illustrated clearly during the course of the hearings.  There is a lack of adequate counselling and education, including sex education in schools and elsewhere.  There were some very interesting issues brought to our attention where people found themselves alone without advice and left to fend for themselves.  To whom does a woman turn who finds herself fending for herself alone?  She needs to talk to someone who will give her non-directive advice.  That is the least we should expect and something we need to do.  One of the practitioners who appeared before the committee said the first decision was not always the one with which the woman proceeded.  We also need to keep that in mind.  It may well be that she simply wants to seek and access advice.  The three-day waiting period is necessary to allow that to happen.  It is in place in other countries for a reason.  It does not prevent access to the service the woman ultimately seeks.  It does not prevent access to it in the Netherlands, Germany or other European countries.  Some Irish women travel to the Netherlands and Germany for a termination and are confined to the same procedures, including the three-day waiting period.  As such, the three-day waiting period or a derivative thereof must be retained in such a way as to show the people that what we felt we were doing at the committee has substance and that we stand over it.</p></speech>

It is about the time at which the clock starts to tick regarding the three-day waiting period.  My party firmly believes the construct of the three-day waiting period and the proposal for its inclusion happened after the debate.  However, it is included in the discourse and we must, therefore, look reluctantly at leaving it there, given that the people voted in a certain way.  That is obvious.  The rigidity of the construction of the three-day waiting period in the legislation is, however, something at which, at a minimum, we need to take a look.  My amendment proposes the following wording:</p><blockquote>a period of not less than 3 days has elapsed from the date on which the pregnant woman made arrangements to attend the medical practitioner for the purpose of the examination referred to in <i>subsection (1).</i></blockquote> <p>It refers to contacting the medical professional to make arrangements for this pathway.  In that regard, we must, at a minimum, come up with a wording.  I am not necessarily locked into my version of the amendment over the wording proposed by one of my colleagues.  It is whichever one works best for the Minister or a variant of all of them.  At a minimum, however, the Minister will have to do something.  This is an issue that will be voted on if there is not some format by which the Minister can propose to deal with this issue.  It is something about which a lot of people feel strongly for the right reasons.  I hope the Minister will be able to come back to us on it.  If not, we will be voting on the issue today and, possibly, on Report Stage also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.1208" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1434" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110700002#L00700"><p>We have established in previous discussions that this was not sought by the committee on the eighth amendment and that it is not supported by doctors in Ireland.  Doctors have come before the health committee and said it is unworkable and will create problems.  It is not necessary because it is patronising, patriarchal and involves the idea that women need a second visit.  It is what used to be called a "cooling off period".</p><p>People are not using that terminology but that is essentially what they are saying, namely, women need a chance to change their minds.  The problem with it is that vulnerable women and young girls, whether in direct provision or otherwise, as well as women who are victims of violence, be it physical or psychological, find it difficult to get out to a doctor's surgery twice.  This is also the case for ordinary working women.  Let us look at the practicalities.  They would need half a day or a day off work for a visit to a GP because they could be sitting in the surgery for two to three hours, certainly in an urban area, although I cannot speak for other areas.  They have to organise childcare for that if they have children, which the majority who have abortions do.  They then have to organise the same thing again, which means another day off work.  If the woman is a nurse or a teacher, that will be extremely difficult, so there is a practical problem.</p><p> The other practical problem is that this will add unnecessary expense to the health service.  Some of those who spoke yesterday were concerned about taxpayers having to pay, yet they are also extremely concerned to build in all of these extra things.</p><p> Obviously, people can change their mind but they can do that without having a three-day waiting period.  If a woman goes for a consultation with her GP, she then has a chance to go home.  She is may be given a prescription, for example, for the medical abortion pill, and she has a chance to change her mind before she takes that.  If it is a referral for a surgical abortion, she will also have time to change her mind.  We do not need to build in a second visit.  This is a problem because it has been found by studies internationally that where these have been imposed, they actually lead to delays of more than three days.  If the woman's appointment with a GP is on a Wednesday and she is told to come back after three days, how will that work?  The surgery is closed on Saturday and Sunday, so, presumably, she comes back on the Monday, which is a five-day delay.  These are serious issues.  People think this does not matter but it will cause a lot of practical problems.</p><p> Although some people get all hazy when we talk about these issues, the way the pregnancy is calculated is not from conception; it is actually from one's last menstrual period.  Therefore, the woman will be under even more pressure to fit into the 12 weeks.</p><p> The other problem in busy cities, urban areas and towns is that people can wait up to a week to see a doctor, certainly to see their own doctor.  They should be able to see their own doctor to discuss something like this.  The way it works in the surgery near me is that there are seven or eight doctors and it is rare for anyone to see the same doctor twice.  If a person wants to see her own doctor, she will have to wait perhaps two weeks.  That is the reality.  To discuss something as important as this, there will be a time delay in any case.  It is very important that people do not think this does not matter because it will inflict unnecessary delays on people.</p><p> We have to give women credit that they will have thought about this before they pick up the phone.  Most people usually find out they are pregnant through a pregnancy test that they buy and they do not need to go to the doctor for that.  They have time to think and they think about nothing else.  We have to take people's word that they are able to make up their own mind before they ring.</p><p> I support both amendments.  I support the deletion and I also support it being applied in a way that does not create these problems.  However, the way the legislation has been phrased is not that when the person rings, the clock ticks.  It has been phrased in a way that is really strict, and people are very surprised by that.</p><p> On the idea that this formed a major part of the debate on repeal, I challenge that view.  While some may say this is the big thing they used on the doorsteps, it certainly was not for me or for many other people and groups I was canvassing with.  We talked about the issue and why the change was necessary.  I do not think the three-day waiting period was foremost in the minds of voters when they went to the polls.  Some may have relied on something like that but it certainly was not a big thing.  I agree it does not need to be in the legislation.  This is being nailed into law and it will make matters extremely difficult.  The Minister could have put into the medical guidelines that doctors would be asked to try to have a three-day delay during which people could consider their options.</p></speech>

This was part of what the people of Ireland understood they voted for.  It was in the legislation proposed by the Minister and the Government.  To take this out now, or to reduce or minimise it, would be seen as disingenuous by the people who voted.  I do not think three days is that much to wait to get professional advice.  It is reasonable to let it stay in the Bill as I feel it is what the people voted for.</p></speech>

It was said that we cannot put pressure on women.  Ending the life of a human being is a very important thing and is something the woman will have to live with for the rest of her life.  I have met women in my constituency who had an abortion and regretted the decision.  I have also met women who had an abortion and were happy with the decision.  I am pro-life so I presume that is why people speak to me of their regret, and I see a lot of regret.  The biggest regret they have is that they did not talk to someone beforehand.  If they feel that all they have is 12 weeks to make up their mind, we have to consider the amount of pressure that puts on them.  I am not a woman and I am not going to pretend I know how a woman feels, but I have made a lot of pressured decisions in my life and I sometimes regret those decisions.  The biggest regret I have in my life was not talking to someone about the decisions I made.</p> <p>  The Minister will play a very important role in this regard.  I sat through the whole of the eighth amendment committee hearings and the thing I got out of it is that there is not enough help out there for people in making decisions, before and afterwards.  I plead with the Minister in this regard.  I was told at the committee hearings that this would be dealt with by the HSE and so on, but there is no one out there to help.  It is a massive decision for someone to end the life of an unborn child and no one is going to make it lightly.  Can the Minister please put something in place for those who want to keep the child and do not know what options are out there, as well as for those who want to get rid of the child?  It is important both ways.  That decision cannot be reversed.  If a person has an abortion, that person cannot turn around and change their mind.  At least when the person has the baby, there are options.</p> <p>  There is no way I am going to be the judge and jury of any woman.  I will respect any woman who makes a decision as it is a very hard decision.  However, as a Government, and with the Minister as head of the health system, it is important that provision is made to have consultants or agencies available.  We are talking about investing &euro;50 million for abortion.  How much will go towards helping people to make the decision and to make the right decision?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.1214" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110700002#N00100"><p>I accept the bona fides of the men in the room who are pro-life and who speak of a three-day cooling off period.  I resent the term "cooling off" because it suggests that a woman facing a crisis pregnancy is somehow hot under the collar and needs to calm down, and that there is some kind of overheating going on in her head, body, decision-making or life.  This is not the case.  A woman who faces a crisis pregnancy faces the decision that she is about to make or has made every day.  It is something with which she wakes up, goes through the day and goes to bed.  Once the decision is made, it is of utmost importance not just for the woman but also in terms of the procedure, that the procedure takes place as early as possible.  With all due respect for those who are pro-life, I do not understand why they want to elongate that period because their ethos and belief are that the foetus is a baby.  If it is nine weeks old, it will be possibly ten or even 11 weeks old if we allow this mechanism to stay in the legislation.</p> <p>  As I stated yesterday, we have a crisis in general practice care because there is a shortage of general practitioners.  The Minister knows that because he has spoken about his efforts to hold on to GPs and recruit new ones.  There is always a queue to see doctors and women will be left waiting in any event.  If a woman has to wait for three days after seeing her doctor before seeing her doctor again, the wait will be longer again.  It will not be for three days because the period will be dragged out.</p> <p>  A point was made to me on the date of certification.  This could require a scan, depending on the circumstances and the woman's knowledge of her body, for instance, the date of her most recent period and so on.  If she has to wait for a scan, it will cause another delay of one week or possibly two weeks.  The procedures that members are arguing should be included in the legislation will delay the time by which a woman can have an abortion.  The logic of this is that the termination will take place later than is necessary.  This will cause great distress to the woman and flies in the face of medical science indicating that abortions should take place as early as possible.</p> <p>  We should drop the idea that a cooling off period is needed and the view that women are not individuals with an intellect who can engage in a decision-making process or are somehow so distressed that they need to be talked to or given loads of information.  Where a woman needs information, it should be available.  The 24-7 helpline is a brilliant idea which I fully support, but the proposal to have a woman wait for three days after seeing her doctor will not help matters.  On the contrary, it will hinder the whole purpose of the legislation and of repealing the eighth amendment.</p> <p>  If we cannot remove this proposal from the legislation because it was in the heads of Bill, we should apply the model used in the Netherlands under which the clock starts ticking - I prefer the use of the term ticking clock to a cooling off period - when the woman lifts the phone and makes an appointment with her doctor to request a termination.  That is when the ticking clock should start.  The amendments are very important because they provide for a crucial and fundamental part of delivering proper services for women's health in the case of terminations of pregnancy.  I repeat that if a woman has to wait for a scan or to see her GP a second time, the waiting times will be incredibly destructive and difficult for both the woman and the outcome, which is to have a termination.  I plead with members to think about that carefully and drop the idea that women need to cool off.  They should consider the objective conditions in this country with our shortage of GPs and the problem we have with delivering health services.  This could create a bigger burden than may appear on paper.</p></speech>

The reality is, as Deputies Smith and Coppinger have said, that it can take a period of time to get an appointment to see a general practitioner.  It is very important that a discussion in respect of a termination of pregnancy should be a face-to-face consultation with a GP or medical practitioner as defined in the Bill.  That is when the clock should start.  I do not agree with the three-day rule but I agree that a woman must and should have a face-to-face consultation with a medical practitioner, preferably her GP.</p></speech>

If a doctor is to prescribe medication, the dosage of medication will change after nine weeks.  There needs to be an in-depth consultation with a medical practitioner to decide on the next step.  The three-day rule is unnecessary but there may be a period of time between the initial consultation with the medical professional and when the woman starts the process of terminating the pregnancy because there may need to be confirmation of the gestational period.  Other diagnostic procedures may also be needed to confirm the gestational period and may take a number of days.  The three-day period is unnecessary but the consultation with the GP should start the process.</p></speech>

Although I disagree with it almost in the same vein as the Chairman, given that the three-day waiting period formed part of the discussion leading up to the referendum, I am reluctant to remove it outright.  We have to stick with the type of access we told people would be available before the referendum.  However, with respect to the Minister, I suggest that we change the phrasing used because it is impractical in the real world.  The phrase used in the Bill is "a period of not less than 3 days has elapsed from the date of certification".  The word "elapsed" means to have passed or been completed.  That indicates to me that, in practice, from the point of certification three full days must have passed.  I am afraid the current phrasing may lead to a period of more than three days elapsing, which would lead to all of the things previous speakers referred to.  I propose in amendment No. 87 that we use the phrase "the third day from the date of certification referred to in paragraph (a) has been reached" rather than "elapsed".  This would not take away from what we told people before the referendum.  It also addresses the issue to which Deputy Smith referred of time building up, depending on the availability of appointments, scans and so forth.  The amendment might make the provision tidier.</p> <p>  Practically speaking, if a woman presents at a GP's clinic on a Monday morning and the doctor is a conscientious provider of termination of pregnancy and certifies, at that point, that the woman's pregnancy is definitely under 12 weeks and definitely under nine weeks and can use the pills with medical supervision, the three-day wait would then begin.  We have to be very careful about saying when the tablet should be taken.  A woman could present on a Monday but could be working all week.  Anyone who has had a termination or miscarriage will know that it is not something a woman would go through during the working day.  While I cannot speak for all women who have had miscarriages, one definitely needs between three and five days off.  Depending on one's job - ironically a hospital doctor who was off for four or five days would be unable to meet a patient who had been in three days previously - from a practically point of view and for family reasons and so on, one cannot be haemorrhaging for a week just because one has to swallow a tablet in front of a doctor.</p><p>Those are the practical issues.  We should not put down in legislation that women should have to swallow tablets in front of people.  Supervised consumption of medication is not something that we should introduce.  The Bill states somewhere that the first dose of medication is to be taken in the GP's surgery.</p></speech>

We have to make sure that GPs are protected in the sense that they must prescribe within the licensing guidelines of the medication and if there is a borderline issue involving a gestational period of eight weeks and five days, the GP will want to have the facility to guarantee the gestation time.</p> <p>  I suggest that my amendment does not materially change the heads of Bill but it makes clear that we will not keep women waiting three days plus part of a day either side of that.</p></speech>

"Cooling off" might be the wrong term and no one is attempting to describe women as irrational or emotional.  It is certainly a difficult time but I had private discussions with the Chairman on this and I found out that the first appointment could be on a Monday evening at 6 p.m. with the follow-up appointment on Wednesday morning at 9.30 a.m.  In such circumstances, the three days would have elapsed so we are playing with words.</p> <p>  There certainly needs to be a time of reflection after the first consultation.  I have met many women who, having got counselling and discussed the issue with family or others, changed their minds on having a termination because of the time that elapsed.  The passage of time allowed them to think clearly and have the benefit of advice and counselling.  I am, therefore, opposed to the amendment.</p></speech>

Jane's GP retired last week and she can't get another doctor to take her on.</blockquote> <p>There is a shortage of GPs and there is a difficulty accessing them, as the Chairman knows.  That tweet makes the case for others who are not GPs to be involved in this.  We had the discussion about other medical practitioners possibly having a role in this previously.  Given the constraints that exist within general practice and the difficulty that many people have in accessing a GP even once, making people see a GP twice as outlined in this section is an unnecessary barrier.  People are talking about a shortage of GPs outside this room, so it would be silly of us to pretend in here that a service can be delivered where additional responsibilities are being introduced in an area where demand is already high.  We are potentially doubling the period a woman would have to wait.  I cannot be convinced that two visits to the GP is necessary.</p><p>A visit to the GP and an opportunity to consult one's doctor, if that is needed, is absolutely the right thing to do but a woman has already made up her mind by the time she has picked up the phone to make an appointment.  We have all said that a woman does not choose to have an abortion lightly but that has to have some meaning.  We cannot then act as if she might make the decision and put in checks and balances based on that.  From the outside looking in, putting those barriers in place makes it seem as though women would engage in a glib decision to have an abortion when it is not a glib decision.  General practice is operating under heavy constraints and we know there are many doctors who are ready, willing and able to provide this service conscientiously.  However, we have to live in the real world and acknowledge that the service must be fit for purpose.</p><p>I have said before and I say again that the test by which we judge this legislation must be that women choose to use this service, choose not to go abroad and do not choose to use telemedicine without supervision.  We will let women down from the start if we try to put unnecessary barriers in place.</p></speech>

If there is to be one face-to-face consultation to start the process and a test is needed to confirm the gestation, that will undoubtedly require a second visit.  A third visit will also be needed to confirm that the process has been completed because in normal maternity care there is a post natal check in any case.  To try to minimise the involvement of a general practitioner to only one visit is to minimise the safety and quality of the service that we will provide.  I believe three visits to a doctor will be required from start to finish to have safe and proper maternity care or termination of pregnancy care.  I apologise for having interrupted again.</p></speech>

I fully accept the bona fides of all those Deputies who do not agree with my view on this.  Deputies Smith and O'Reilly are correct that the GP system is in chaos and at breaking point around the country.  On my drive to Leinster House this morning it struck me that when abortion services are carried out in this country, they will reflect the dysfunction of the rest of the health service.  We are talking about this service as if it will operate as outlined in this Bill but we are fooling ourselves if we think that is the case.  The abortion service in this country will operate in the same manner as the health service in general operates in this country.  It will have exactly the same difficulties and problems and it is my honest view that in a number of years abortion will be provided through abortion clinics.  There is no doubt in my mind about that.</p> <p>  Much of this could have been worked out if the Minister had met and consulted doctors before the Government decided that this would be a doctor led abortion service.</p> <p>  The three-day rule was central in the referendum.  Some say it was brought in to placate the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and get him over the line on the issue.  I know of many women who have had abortion regret.  It is a big issue and one that does not get the airtime it deserves.  I know of a woman who went to have an abortion in Britain and in the waiting room of the abortion service in London she decided not to have the abortion and she now has a 13 year old girl.  It is a life and death issue and it is irreversible.  Whatever gender a person is, given the magnitude of the decision involved, it is good that consideration is taken with that decision.</p></speech>

I agree with the Chairman that we should resource general practice for up to three visits and we will do so, in the same manner as he correctly said that the mother and infant scheme will provide pregnant women with a number of free GP visits.  That is not to say they are mandatory visits but it is important in providing for all of the woman's needs and giving her all the advice necessary that we adequately resource general practice for this and make sure that if the woman wants or needs to go to her GP two or three times, she must be enabled to do so and the GP must be supported in providing that service.</p><p>I do not believe anyone has a difficulty with that.  I clarify that is my thinking in terms of our engagement with GPs on this matter.<br/><br/>I thank the Chairman for giving us the benefit of his knowledge of the practicalities of being a GP in that on many occasions a natural period will elapse between seeing a doctor, a procedure taking place and medication being administered.  That shows that unless it is an emergency situation, it is unlikely these situations take place instantly in the doctor's room.  I have never used horrific phrases such as &quot;a cooling-off period&quot; in this context.  A natural time period often elapses between having a consultation and having a procedure, whatever that procedure may be.  This is a hard one regardless of the personal views any of us have on this matter but, as a number of colleagues said, it was put to the people as part of the referendum.  I have heard Deputy Coppinger make the point, and I know she has done so sincerely, that she does not believe it was a big part of it, but I certainly felt, when a number of people were asking why 12 weeks had been decided and how the 12 weeks would work, that it was a significant enough part of the debate.  There is a responsibility to bring forward legislation that tallies with the general scheme that was published in March.  My opponents during the referendum said we should show them what we were going to do. They said also, as did perhaps even one or two people in this room, that  we cannot trust the politicians and that they will say they will put in place these measures but once one votes &quot;Yes&quot;, they will go off and do something different.  Those words still ring in my ears.  It is important we are consistent with what we said we were going to do.<br/><br/>On the reverse of that, there is an element of hypocrisy with respect to people who are not in favour of the legislation at all cherry-picking the bits they like out of it.  Those people would like a period of about nine or ten months to elapse before a woman could access a termination, if the members get my point on this.  There are people who are against abortion in all circumstances and I ask them not to try to align themselves in any way with my views on this issue.  This legislation needs to be seen in the round.  It needs to be seen as legislation that seeks to provide access to termination of pregnancy services that were not available in our country previously.  It also needs to be seen in the space where we are moving beyond a situation where it is effectively illegal for a woman to have a comprehensive conversation with her doctor about all her options and be advised and referred.  We see benefit in a woman and her doctor having that conversation with the woman being imparted with information.  It is not about being paternalistic but about the woman being given professional medical information and then having an opportunity to consider that information and making her choice, as that woman is well able to make that choice.<br/><br/>We have somewhat changed what we said in the March legislation without deviating from the fundamental principle.  Members will recall that we referred to a period of 72 hours in the general scheme of the Bill.  We have clarified that this is three days.  We did that for practical reasons.  A number of colleagues, including Deputy O'Connell, have asked, for example, that if one sees a doctor at 5 p.m. on a Monday, is the 72 hours from 5 p.m. that day?  We have clarified that is not the case and it is three days.  It will deal with the way that three days will work.  I need to point out something that did not come up during the course of this debate.  Obviously, there are emergency provisions in the legislation and they trump all the other provisions.  When people talk about difficult situations, which Deputy O'Reilly raised, which I am sure will materialise, and I have discussed this with doctors, the emergency provision enables doctors to use their clinical judgment and perhaps that is something on which we can seek more clarity on to provide an assurance for people.<br/><br/>A number of people referenced the fact this is not an Irish-specific requirement and that this is in place in law in a number of European countries.  I believe it was Deputy Clare Daly who implied they were not necessarily countries that are considered very conservative, namely, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and, I believe, Italy.  A number of countries have a waiting period requirement.<br/><br/>A number of members asked when does the clock start, which is to what the issue boil down.  Some members would like to remove this requirement but I believe they are asking that if that cannot happen, when does the clock start and how will it work practically?  There is an element with respect to somebody not having to discuss their medical details with a person who is not their doctor.  That is genuinely something we need to tease out.  One should not have to tell the receptionist why one is going to see the GP.  We do not have an electronic booking system in this country, which perhaps is the norm in the Netherlands where one make an appointment by email.  That is my understanding.  We do not necessarily have the systems in place that other countries have in terms of how they have dealt with it.  That is something we need to tease out.<br/><br/>Deputy O'Connell asked about a lapse regarding the waiting period and her amendment specifically refers to that point.  I checked this out legally.  Section 18 (<i>h</i>) of the Interpretation Act deals with how periods of time should be understood, which I did not know about.  It states: &quot;Where a period is expressed to begin on or be reckoned from a particular day, that day shall be deemed to be included in the period and, where a period of time is expressed to end on or be reckoned to a particular day, that day shall be deemed to be included in the period&quot;.  Section 13 of this Bill provides that three days must elapse from the date of certification and, in accordance with the Interpretation Act, the day of certification is included.  If one saw a doctor at 5 p.m. on a Monday, that Monday is included.</p></speech>

The person would have to go back to the GP to have the prescription dispensed.  Again, that is not included in the legislation but the intention of those getting ready to operate the service is that the prescription would be dispensed by the doctor rather than the pharmacy, cutting out an additional visit, an additional conversation and an additional potential obstacle or hurdle.  One of the benefits of what we are doing here is that the dispensing will be done by the GP rather than the person having to go to a pharmacy.  I understand the challenge involved.  It was reflected also in some of the discussion we had yesterday and some of the correspondence we had from obstetricians yesterday on the whole issue of certification.  Some of that will come up again shortly.  As a period of time elapses what if a particular </p> <p>obstetrician is no longer rostered that day?  There are operational issues regarding how the three days will work and when the clock starts, which I am happy and eager to tease out.  It is not the easiest area to tease out because we have to make sure that it is very clear as to how it will work.  I am happy to work with people on this between now and Report Stage.  If we are going to have an engagement on it, we should engage both legally and operationally on it because we need such engagement with both sides to get this right.  We have already seen the challenge with the certificate element.</p> <p>  I would respectfully ask people not to push their amendments today.  To assure people that I am not being in any way disingenuous on this, my position on this is that the legalisation published in March referred to a period of time elapsing.  It referred to 72 hours and I have modified that to three days for reasons of clarity and a degree of flexibility.</p><p>I do not intend to deviate from that because that is what we said we would do.  I would be willing to engage with colleagues with regard to when the three days start.</p></speech>

It would circumvent the gap in the three days if it was to occur over the weekend.</p></speech>

I do not want to withdraw this amendment.  It is specific to section 13, on early pregnancy.  The same argument we had before applies.  Amendment No. 83 would insert as a condition of termination of pregnancy that it is requested by the pregnant woman.  That is partly for the reasons we have already discussed.  The woman's voice and wishes must be at the centre of this.  There is more to it than that in the early pregnancy section.  One could see a situation where a vulnerable woman comes under pressure.  It could be a very young woman or a woman in an abusive relationship.  I can see many situations where the woman may not want a termination or may want to wait but she could find herself in a vulnerable situation.  Nothing in section 13 says the woman must request the termination.  The section states:</p><blockquote>A termination of pregnancy may be carried out in accordance with this section by a medical practitioner where, having examined the pregnant woman, he or she is of the reasonable opinion formed in good faith that the pregnancy concerned has not exceeded 12 weeks of pregnancy.</blockquote> <p>It states it shall not be carried out unless the medical practitioner has certified that and that there must be a three day wait.  It is essential that an explicit condition is inserted that a pregnant woman requests the termination, to protect women.  It is in a different category from other amendments.  In sections 10, 11 and 12, the woman's life is at risk or there is serious threat to her health.  We have agreed that the Minister will take away the views of the committee and hopefully, between us all, we can come up with some agreed wording.  This is different.  It is specific to section 13.  It is essential, reasonable and legally robust.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The strong view of my team is that it is unnecessary.  Who else, other than the women, can request the termination under existing law?  Doctors have to operate under medical consent already.  I take the Deputy's points seriously and I referred to it yesterday when we were talking about offences.  Forced or coerced abortion is something that we should all be concerned about.  I do not mean any disrespect but I think this is somewhat superfluous.  One cannot carry out any medical procedure in Ireland without a patient consenting.  As the Deputy quite rightly says, in this case, the woman would visit her general practitioner to request the termination.  It is not because she would have a risk to her health or she has a different opinion on her health to her medical team.  While I appreciate what the Deputy is doing, I genuinely do not see the need for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.1264" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110700002#Q00900"><p>This is probably a unique medical situation.  I cannot conceive of anyone pressuring a woman into taking aspirin or having some orthopaedic or orthodontic procedure done.  Other medical procedures are not situations in which significant social pressure could be brought to bear.  It does not really arise.  In a situation where if a man or a woman has a medical issue and drugs need to be prescribed or surgical intervention is required, it goes without saying that the patient is agreeing to it.  This situation is unique.  A very young woman could be under pressure from a parent, guardian, her peers or people she knows who have strong views on the subject.  A woman may have become pregnant with a man who is not her partner and he could be putting her under serious pressure.  A woman could be at a vulnerable time of life.  This amendment makes it clear that when the doctor is consulting with his or her patient, he or she should explicitly seek the patient's request.  As such, I think it is essential to have this in the legislation.  It is a unique situation.</p></speech>

There are situations where women, particularly young women but potentially women of any age, can be put under pressure to have a termination which is effectively against their will, but they feel powerless to resist.  It is a real situation.  It is a very worthwhile amendment which I agree with.</p></speech>

When the morning-after pill was made available over the counter in the community pharmacy setting, while I cannot remember the law exactly, one was not allowed to give it to the woman's partner.  Even if one knew the woman well, one could not provide it.  I am not familiar with the medical guidelines on this but I assume they are mirrored.  One had to have a consultation with the woman, be satisfied it was for her and that she was comfortable with the situation and not being coerced.  I understand that this would already be dealt with in the patient-doctor relationship.  I do not think it is required.  Including it might have effects on other parts of the Bill.  It is a practical issue.  There are other physical surgeries for which partners can put pressure on people, not just terminations, such as enhancement surgeries.  It is not a unique situation.  Sometimes women can be pressured.</p></speech>

I thought it would be covered in the first sentence by the medical practitioner having examined the pregnant woman.  We had a discussion about this yesterday.  The phrase "consultation with" might be better than the word "examined" but I think it is covered.  The question is whether it creates any problem.  Will the Minister comment on that?</p></speech>

I also accept what the Chairman says.  I would like to check with the Medical Council and, I give the Deputy my word, I will support it if there is a sense that this will in any way assist.  The Deputy's bona fides are entirely accepted.  I am just looking at page 15 of the Medical Council's Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics on consent.  It is very strong on consent, capacity to consent and on what one needs to do in terms of making sure a patient is making a voluntary choice and that the patient knows consent is not just a formality or cannot just be deemed as a signature on a page.  Consent is required by law.  It is a respect for a patient's autonomy.  It goes through information.  I can certainly share it with the Deputy.  I genuinely feel it is already covered but I also think the Deputy is entirely correct to make sure it is robustly covered.  I know the Deputy does not wish to withdraw his amendment but I suggest he consider withdrawing it and submitting it again on Report Stage and we will clarify the matter in the meantime.  If the Medical Council or the people drawing up the clinical guidelines do not see a difficulty with it, I have no difficulty accepting it but I would like to check.</p></speech>

Nobody wants to see a situation in which anyone is coerced into having any procedure at all.  It strikes me as somewhat unnecessary.

It is almost as if it has been put in for a reason that has not been outlined.  I am not very clear why it is needed which makes me nervous.  I would tend not to support it because of the fact I do not see the reason it is needed in the first place.  Perhaps we should go to a professional body and get some guidance on it before we make a decision.  It is always harder to take something out than to put it in later.</p></speech>

To get some clarity, let us just say, for argument's sake, if I was an abusive partner and I was forcing my partner to procure an abortion, I am open to criminal sanctions.  If we put this in and then it is very clear it is at the request of the woman, does that have an impact?  I am not saying people will do this but I could easily say I did not put any pressure on her and that she asked for it herself.

Consent is already in law.  A doctor can be struck off if he or she breaches the law.  A doctor has to be satisfied the patient is consenting and consenting voluntarily.  I accept the Chairman's point.  He is familiar with this.  If somebody goes to see a doctor, the doctor has to be satisfied the person is looking for the treatment in a voluntary capacity and is not being coerced into looking for it.  That is already in law.</p></speech>

The issue is this: if somebody is being coerced by an abusive partner or parents, she is going to be told to go in and say she wants the abortion.  That could be something they insist on.  It could be a get-out-of-jail card.  If the pregnant person is not saying anything, it could be a better indication.  I do not want to delay this.  It seems like a small thing.  I think the words "having examined" mean it is covered whereas insisting the person says it could result in it being something that could be brought about abusively.</p></speech>

Many people have major problems with the issue of conscientious objection.  I will make some general points because I do not intend to speak several times.  In principle, people feel that others should be allowed to conscientiously object.  For example, I agree that someone should be able to conscientiously object to having to join the Israeli army.  People should have a right to object to participating in world wars with which they do not agree.  When it comes to medical care, one could argue that some people may have qualified as doctors in an era when there was no abortion in Ireland.  Someone made the point that it could be argued that a time limit should be placed on the conscientious objection provision so that it is not there forever and future medical students who enter the system know that termination of pregnancy is part and parcel of the health service.</p></speech>

In rural, conservative areas of Italy, for example, doctors feel that they cannot participate because of pressure from within the culture by which they are surrounded.</p><p>This leads to a situation where women have no access at all.</p><p> On the amendment, many people are shocked at the loose wording used in the Bill.  The provision that a doctor must refer somebody must be retained.  If somebody wants to object, that is fine.  However, the woman involved must be referred to another doctor.  That is current law and practice and it should be maintained.  The phrase "as soon as may be" is loose - as soon as someone gets a chance, he or she might refer somebody rather than ensuring that he or she must do so promptly because time is an issue in the case of this medical procedure.  The phrase should be deleted.  It would be good if the Minister agreed to that.  There are later amendments which suggest placing a time limit on it and with which I agree.  Surely 24 hours is enough time for somebody.  If a person comes to see a doctor, said doctor might be busy for the rest of the day.  I can appreciate that but by the end of the working day, he or she should be able to make a referral.  I would have serious worries about this in some rural areas in particular.  This could lead to delays for pregnant women in terms of getting access in a timely manner so I think the phrase "as soon as may be" should be deleted.</p></speech>

We are referring to section 13(3), which then refers to section 13(2)(b).  If a doctor has an objection, surely that doctor should state it when the woman arrives in the surgery on day one instead of waiting until the three days have elapsed to say the he or she has an objection to carrying out the procedure or administering the medication and must refer the woman on.  I agree with Deputy Coppinger regarding the objection and the fact that there should be no delay.  We are talking about early pregnancy.  It seems that if a doctor has an objection, he or she should make that very clear on day one.  Surely ,by day three, he or she should have referred that patient to another doctor who will carry out the procedure.  Could the Minister talk us through that because what is being suggested here is that somebody could invoke their conscientious objection on day three and then have to refer somebody.  That should be invoked on day one so that by the time the three days are up, the doctor would refer the patient to somebody who will administer the medication.  Can the Minister provide some clarification on this?</p></speech>

What does the term "arrangements" mean?  Does it mean making an appointment or a referral or writing a letter?  I think the Irish Medical Council would indicate that it should involve giving sufficient information rather than making an arrangement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.1314" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110700002#W00400"><p>I will begin with a few general comments because Deputy Coppinger is right - all of the discussion about conscientious objection has been about the medical practitioner, not about the woman.  Let me be very clear.  Medical practitioners have a right to conscientiously object.  Deputy Coppinger is saying that perhaps this should be time-limited but it is not.  It is not so in the law and Medical Council guidelines.  A person has the right to conscientiously object as a medical practitioner.  Can we have the conversation with regard to the way Deputies Coppinger and O'Brien and the Chairman raised the question of what it looks like from the woman's perspective because it is much more illuminating and informative?  After we have changed the law significantly, had a referendum and made these new services available in the Irish health service, the last thing any of us wants is a woman, and I do not mean to be in any way flippant, going from GP practice to GP practice in the hope of finding a doctor who is not conscientiously objecting.  Let us be honest about that.  If that happens, it will result in women not accessing the service and either continuing to travel outside our jurisdiction or to access medication illegally purchased online.  We need to stop just talking about conscientious objection as though the only person it impacts upon is the doctor.  I thought the way the entire health service was meant to be run was with the patient - in this case, the woman - at the centre.</p> <p>  The next issue is outside of the legislation but it is very relevant to our consideration of the legislation.  I have been working on devising the 24-7 helpline that will be manned, or "womanned", by nurses, midwives and councillors.  We have been working to ensure that this helpline can also be a source of information for a woman to find out where the nearest service is located.  To be clear, it is not mandatory for a doctor to sign up for his or her information to be given to that helpline.  However, a number of doctors and agencies and organisations that operate in our health service have come forward that may be willing to give their details.  This means that if a woman in County Clare contacts the helpline next January, not only will she be able to be given all the information, all of her options and all of the supports, she will also be able to state that she lives in County Clare and those operating the helpline might be able to tell her that there is a doctor in Ennis who has signed up to provide this service.  Alternatively, and I do not expect that this will be the case, she might be told that there is no such doctor in said county but that there is a doctor in Dublin who will perform the service.</p> <p>  Conscientious objection is not about trying to catch doctors out.  Doctors have a right to conscientiously object.  It is not about trying to find the doctor and put them in an awkward position.  Much more importantly, it is not about the woman having to go around until she lands on a doctor's surgery that will provide the service.  I want to say this because there has been a lot of concern, some of it genuine and some of it made created to become a bit of a frenzy, about conscientious objection being this extraordinary burden on a medical practitioner.  What I have tried to do is lessen that burden, although I do not think "burden" is the right word.  I have tried to lessen that obligation by making sure there is a source of information that works for the woman and will also enable doctors to know that is there.  That is an important point.  In practice, no woman in crisis will be wandering around hoping to find the right doctor.  Let us give women credit here.  That is not the way the world works.  The 24-7 helpline will assist in that regard.</p> <p>  With regard to her amendment concerning the words "as soon as may be", Deputy Coppinger argued that this means whenever a doctor gets the chance.  I can understand why she would read it like that.  I would also read it like that.  I am advised legally that there are approximately four categories in terms of the degree of urgency one wishes to attach to somebody having to do something.  The first is "forthwith", the second is "as soon as may be", which is where we have gone-----</p></speech>

Those are the circumstances to which the word "forthwith" relates.  The second category is "as soon as may be", "as soon as possible" is the third and "without delay" is the fourth.  Legislation is interpreted by courts, lawyers and legal experts who work for the Irish Medical Council and others in terms of enforcing this.  We have opted for the period that makes it very clear that the doctor is meant to identify their conscientious objection at the very earliest stage.</p> <p>  We must live in the real world.  I do not think it is in the interests of any doctor who does not want to provide the service to not tell the woman until the end.  Why would a doctor do that?  It is certainly not in anyone's interest to have women going around trying to find doctors willing to provide the service.  In terms of the operation of the legislation, we must try to provide information sources that can direct women to services.  We cannot remove -and I am not willing to remove - conscientious objection from legislation because if we believe, as I believe, that this is to be a normal part of the Irish public health service, which I think people voted for, the obligation and duty have to be the same for this as they are for anything else.  With regard to conscientious objection, we are applying the same standard - no more and no less - that we would apply to other treatments and procedures in the health service.  That is largely where we are going with it.  I suggest that leaving in the phrase "as soon as may be" is genuinely more helpful legally than taking it out.  That is the legal advice I have received.</p></speech>

In liberal democracies, that is generally understood as to where we draw the line on the rights of an individual.  This Bill states in clear language that termination is an operation that ends the life of a foetus.  I appreciate that some people do not see it as that, which is fine.  Some people want access for women and I understand the point that the Minister is making.  Many medical practitioners, however, will read the Bill in the language in which it is actually written and understand it in that fashion.  To force them into an act where they feel culpable is not a good thing.</p> <p> Were I to arrange for the end of the life of Simon Harris, I would be in part culpable under the current law, as well as morally.  It is perfectly reasonable that doctors around the country would say they do not want to get involved.  This should not have happened.  There should have been consultation with doctors in advance of this Bill.  The Government would then have realised the dangerous space into which it is moving.  The Government cannot force people to do this and, indeed, doctors will not do it.  Doctors will then be in conflict with the State as a consequence.  Doctors and general practitioners are already radically demoralised by the state of the health service and their own profession.  Should one seek a way by which to further demoralise doctors, forcing them to make arrangements for a transfer for an abortion would be the way to do it.  It also will mean that many  people like me will no longer choose those professions at any level, whether doctors, midwives, pharmacists, if they believe their profession will force them to carry out an act that they cannot get their head around morally.  If the Minister wants to provide for abortion, I would say this is not the way to do it.  It is the method of most conflict to achieve that goal.  Within the past week, 650 doctors have signed a letter saying they will not proceed with this.  The Minister ought to sit down with them and try to work it out.  </p> <p>  Last night I spoke to an obstetrician who told me that Dr. Peter Boylan is doing a tour of hospitals, and has been to Kilkenny, Letterkenny and Cavan.  Medical professionals had met prior to this and said that they would not participate in the Government's planned abortion provision.  These are consultants and medical professionals, including midwives, who say they will not proceed with this.  Two immovable objects now face each other on conscientious objection.  There must be a solution whereby medical professionals who are at ease with the provision of these services are clearly identifiable to those who want to access them, and a method to join the two.</p></speech>

When doctors, nurses or midwives want to know whether they are in compliance with the law and their professional code, they do not dust down statutes passed in the Oireachtas but they turn to the regulator.  In the case of nurses and midwives it is the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, and for doctors it is the Medical Council.  It is the job of those bodies to outline the contentious objection requirements.  I have before me a document which has proved useful in recent days, namely, the eighth edition of the<i>Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners</i>, published in 2016.  Section 49, on page 35, outlines conscientious objection.  We are not doing anything different here; there is no new standard or barrier.</p></speech>

One cannot have more or less of a conscience on different medical issues.  Conscientious objection is a person's right to object if something is in conflict with his or her religious or personal beliefs.  Section 49 of the Medical Council guidelines state:</p><blockquote>You may refuse to provide or to take part in the provision of lawful treatments or forms of care which conflict with your sincerely held ethical or moral values.<br /><br />If you have a conscientious objection to a treatment or form of care, you should inform patients, colleagues and your employer as early as possible.</blockquote> <p>That was the point that Deputy Jonathan O'Brien asked about.  It continues by stating:</p><blockquote>When discussing these issues with patients, you should be sensitive and considerate so as to minimise any distress your decision may cause.  You should make sure that patients&rsquo; care is not interrupted and their access to care is not impeded.<br /><br />If you hold a conscientious objection to a treatment, you must: ... inform the patient that they have a right to seek treatment from another doctor; and ... give the patient enough information to enable them to transfer to another doctor to get the treatment they want.<br /><br />If the patient is unable to arrange their own transfer of care - as we know, people can be very sick - you should make these arrangements on their behalf. <br /><br />In an emergency, you must make your patient&rsquo;s care a priority and give necessary treatment.</blockquote> <p>We are not changing the wording in this law to the wording that already exists in other legislation in respect of conscientious objection.</p></speech>

Consequently, I do not think the Deputy should make statements that has not been established.</p> <p>  I had the pleasure of debating and engaging with some of those obstetricians who work in those hospitals over the course of the referendum.  Many of the complex cases about which they expressed concern during the referendum are ones that they do not care for anyway as they are already transferred to our main maternity hospitals.  I refer to fatal foetal abnormalities and so on.  People are also transferred to our tertiary hospitals.  We must be very careful.  Dr. Boylan is doing an excellent job in engaging.  There will be people who will conscientiously object, I do not dispute that in any way.  Institutions, however, do not have the right to conscientiously object.  Institutions do not have conscience.  The only people who think that is the case were the bishops in that unhelpful intervention.  It was the repetition of very similar arguments to those made during the passage of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, where some of the same individuals stated that services would not be provided and even if a woman was about to die in one of their hospitals, they would not intervene.  I am delighted to say that has not been the case in the practical implication of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act because doctors do what doctors do.  They intervene and look after people.   </p></speech>

We will deal with conscientious objection later but while it does have an impact this, we are currently discussing early pregnancy exclusively in this amendment.</p><p>Section 13(1) states &quot;A termination of pregnancy may be carried out in accordance with this section by a medical practitioner where, having examined the pregnant woman, he or she is of the reasonable opinion formed in good faith that the pregnancy concerned has not exceeded 12 weeks of pregnancy.&quot; Later, in the event of a medical practitioner having a conscientious objection section 13(3) provides the practitioner must &quot;make such arrangements as he or she shall deem to be necessary for the carrying out of the termination of pregnancy as soon as may be after the period referred to in<i>subsection (2)(b)</i>has elapsed&quot;.  The Minister has stated it is very unlikely that a doctor who has an objection would wait until the three days had elapsed to invoke that objection.  However, under the legislation as it is currently worded, that is possible.  It says the medical practitioner shall make arrangements &ldquo;as soon as may be after the period referred to in <i>subsection (2)(b)</i>&quot;, namely, the three-day period.</p><p>The three-day period will elapse and then the doctor can invoke the objection.  The practitioner must make the arrangements "as soon as may be after" the three-day period has elapsed.  For me, if the doctor has an objection, he or she should make the arrangements as soon as the woman indicates she wants to have an abortion.  The woman should not have to wait until after the three-day period elapses before arrangements are made to transfer her.  That is my reading of it.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.1341" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110700002#Y00200"><p>I understand why the Deputy is reading it like that.  We have just had a lengthy discussion about conscientious objection.  In fairness to everyone, that piece of the legislation, and what Deputy Coppinger is trying to do, does not relate directly to conscientious objection.  This is section 13(1) of the Bill.  It states "A termination of pregnancy may be carried out in accordance with this section by a medical practitioner where, having examined the pregnant woman, he or she is of the reasonable opinion formed in good faith that the pregnancy concerned has not exceeded 12 weeks of pregnancy."  It then details what needs to happen in section 13(2) and section 13(3) actually refers to the doctor carrying out the procedure and not conscientious objection.  </p> <p>  At this stage, I should signal that I am likely to seek to tighten up that language on Report Stage.  At the moment, it states that the medical practitioner, that is, the doctor who has certified that he or she is going to carry out the termination, should then move to do so as quickly as possible.  That is, effectively, what it means.  That is for all of the reasons people have outlined for the importance of early access to the service and not waiting until the 12-week limit approaches or expires.  It is an instruction in law that, once the three days have elapsed and certification has taken place, the doctor should move to provide the procedure as quickly as possible, which is not a legal phrase, in accordance with the legislation.  I am going to tighten up section 13(3) slightly on Report Stage because I think the phase "shall make such arrangements as he or she shall deem" is a bit wordy.  I decided to wait until Report Stage to do that because I am coming back to the certification issue anyway.  That section, therefore, does not relate to the issue of conscientious objection directly.  </p></speech>

A pregnant woman meets her GP, tells him or her that she is pregnant and gives her estimation as to how far the pregnancy has progressed in weeks.  The GP consults with and examines his or her patient and then the GP will do one of four things.  He or she will state that he or she is conscientiously objecting and there is a conversation about what happens.  The second thing the GP might do is state that he or she is not willing to certify because, based on the dates given, he or she believes the patient is above 12 weeks and so is not willing to certify.  The third thing the GP might do is certify that it does seem the patient is within 12 weeks and she should come back to the GP in three days to get, essentially, a prescription.</p> <p>  The other thing that can happen is not in the legislation but it has been part of the conversation.  That is what happens between nine and 12 weeks.  A GP might state that his or her opinion is that his or her patient is 11 weeks pregnant.  There is then a question as to whether the GP has to refer the woman to hospital for ultrasounds to try to get a more exact determination of dates and when does the three-day period start.  Will the Minister walk us through that?  We will start with the scenario where a woman goes into a GP on a Monday.  The GP may say that he or she is conscientiously objecting, will arrange the transfer and then have a more in-depth conversation about that.  Does the three days start there nonetheless?  As the legislation is written, I would say that it does not.  It could then, however, then take another two or three days, or more, for the woman to access a GP who has opted in, as we might say.  It could take four days to find another GP and then the three-day clock starts.  Will the Minister confirm that is the case and whether he agrees with that?  It does not sound right to me.</p> <p>  We are pretty clear if the doctor believes the pregnancy is less than nine weeks.  The doctor certifies and asks the patient to come back in three days.  Will the Minister walk us through two situations?  One is where the doctor conscientiously objects.  What happens there in respect of the timing for this three days?  The second case is where the doctor believes the pregnancy may be between nine and 12 weeks.  What happens there?  Critically, what happens in regard to the timing and in respect of what medical practitioner may be required to make the arrangements? </p></speech>

The first part of the Deputy's question brings us back to when does the three days start.  We have agreed to work on that between now and Report Stage.  At the moment, Deputy Donnelly is entirely correct in his reading of the legislation.  The three days starts when the doctor has been seen and he or she has certified that legally and medically, which is more important, that it is appropriate and legal for his or her patient to access a termination.  Where I would differ slightly from the scenario Deputy Donnelly gave is that I hope if we get this right - and as he said this is in the operations space rather than the legislative space - we will not have a situation where women are walking into doctors' surgeries hoping they will find one.  I need to emphasise that.  I met many doctors, as did Deputy Donnelly.  I refer to southern taskgroup on abortion and reproductive topics, START, doctors, members of the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP or Doctors for Choice.</p> <p>  A number of doctors have made the point to me, including START doctors, that we need to help signpost services for women.  Rather than a woman walking into a surgery on a Monday hoping she will be seen by the doctor, I hope that woman - either through word of mouth, because that is the way the world also works, conversations with fellow women in her life or picking up the telephone and ringing the 24-7 medically staffed helpline - would know that is what is going to happen.  On the first point, therefore, Deputy Donnelly is right.  The woman needs to see the doctor and be certified before the three days start.  That is how it is currently construed in the legislation but we might decide, as a collective, to revisit that.</p></speech>

We have agreed we are all going to meet up before Report Stage.  Whatever is the purpose of the three days - we all have different views as to why it is in there, it was not in the report to begin with but it is there and was in the Heads of the Bill - and whatever the period is, for many people it is a period of reflection.  I also agree that this idea of calling it a "cooling off" period is wrong.  Whatever is the right language, it is around a period of time between first meeting a doctor and a termination.  When the Minister is considering Report Stage, will he reflect on whether that period will require the certification of a doctor?  We are trying to create a three-day time period.  I agree we do not want a situation, for the doctor or the woman, where someone is conscientiously objecting but it can happen.  If a woman goes to a doctor that should also count as the start of a three-day period.  The Minister might reflect on that.  I am sorry, the Minister was going to go on to the second scenario where the doctor believes the pregnancy is between nine and 12 weeks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.1347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110700002#Y00800"><p>Yes, I am.  Legally in Ireland, as a result of this Bill and following on from the referendum, there will be no specific indication needed to access a termination up to 12 weeks.  My understanding when it comes to the licensing of the medication is that once nine weeks is reached, it is medical best practice that the woman is referred to a maternity hospital.  That is currently the situation, at least, accepting that licensing and practice can evolve.  During the referendum campaign, everyone, including myself, spoke about zero to 12 weeks in the community setting.  It has now transpired that nine to 12 weeks is likely to take place in the hospital setting.  The doctor will refer the woman to the hospital setting.  I am not endeavouring to hold any information back but how that will work is the job of the development of the clinical guidelines and, crucially, the model of care, being currently devised by the ICGP, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland.  I can tell the committee that good progress is being made on referral pathways.  I am cautiously optimistic that those clinical guidelines and models of care will be agreed by the end of this month.</p><p>I will be happy to arrange for members of the committee to be briefed on it.  I am also more than happy to take them through my understanding of it now, but it is being written and devised.  </p><p> To reply to the Deputy's question, the doctor will refer the woman to the maternity hospital.  Obviously, she would have to have a way of accessing the hospital in a timely manner because of the 12 week cut-off point and how best to do this is being worked out in the model of care.  A huge amount of work is also being done to ensure there will be adequate access to ultrasound scans and so on during that timeframe.  </p><p> As to when the three-day timeframe will commence, it is at the point at which the woman is certified in the hospital.  As written, she has to be certified by the doctor who will carry out the procedure.</p></speech>

If a woman goes to her doctor on the Monday and he or she confirms that she is between nine and 12 weeks pregnant, he or she will then refer her to a maternity hospital.  Let us say it takes three days for her to get to it, which means that she would be in it on the Thursday.  Admission will not necessarily always be on the same day or the next.  Let us say it is the Thursday before the woman is admitted for an ultrasound scan which is carried out by a nurse and there may or may not be a doctor present.  We have to assume that there is a doctor present to confirm that the woman is 11 weeks pregnant and certify.  It is at this point that the three-day timeframe will commence, which will take us through the Friday, Saturday and Sunday, but nobody will be available on the Sunday, which will bring us to the Monday.  That does not sound like the intended consequence of the time period.  I do not know what the right phrase is, but it seems to be that the three-day period is a pause.  In that case, the law is not differentiating between an eight and a ten week pregnancy in terms of the three-day pause, but operationally there would be a world of difference.  For example, the three-day period could increase to seven or eight days.  Should we not be seeking to provide for this differential in the legislation?</p></speech>

There is a challenge in getting this right.  In looking at this issue, as we should be, from the woman's perspective the pathway on which the Deputy has taken us sounds like a fair description and we should absolutely work to improve it.  The other piece at which we have to look is the doctor's pathway.  In fairness, I am not sure how one could do anything different in this situation.  The legislation provides that a doctor has to make medical decisions "in his or her reasonable opinion and "formed in good faith".  We have to ensure the doctor will also be satisfied that he or she is acting in accordance with the law.  That is where we are hitting a challenge because, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, it is hard to start the clock before the woman sees the doctor because he or she also has to be protected and satisfied that he or she is acting in accordance with medical regulations and the law.   Marrying the two pieces is the challenge between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

I think a reasonable way for it to be crafted is as follows.  The woman goes to her doctor on the Monday and he or she is of a reasonable opinion formed in good faith that the pregnancy is between nine and 12 weeks.  I imagine he or she could certify same but with the caveat that there is to be a referral to a maternity unit to check it.  The certification could begin at this point.  If the woman is in a maternity hospital on the Thursday and it is confirmed that the doctor's certification is correct, it seems that at that point the three days would have passed.  That is how I would like to see it worded.</p></speech>

It is a challenge, as is evident from the length of time we have explored the issue today.  Abortion will be legal in Ireland up to 12 weeks without a specific indication, as provided for in the Bill.  Earlier we discussed the importance of communicating this legislation to the public, women and doctors.  Communication, in terms of our best roll-out of the service, by which I mean doctors and the HSE, as opposed to the Minister and the Department, will be in line with the best medical advice.  It will be on the importance of accessing services early in pregnancy.  We already know that women do not need a communications plan to know this.  We know from the statistics that the overwhelming majority who currently have to travel to the United Kingdom are accessing a termination before nine weeks.  One does not see any reason that will change.  One hopes the ratio will improve further because women will not have to travel because they will access the information they need through a 24/7 helpline.  I make that point because the nine to 12-week piece and how the primary care community setting will interact with maternity services in terms of access to ultrasound scans and so on will definitely be a challenge.  These are all operational matters on which Dr. Boylan and others are working.  I would not like people watching this debate, or anybody else, to think it will be a significant number of women because if we get the service right in the interests of women, we will be providing the vast majority of terminations in the community setting as early as possible in pregnancy.</p></speech>

It is Murphy's law that if something can happen, it will.  Pregnant women have a right to know what circumstances prevail and the extent to which they can gain access to services.

The Deputy is entirely correct - conscientious objection is important.

I point to section 23(2) which states: "Subsection (1) shall not be construed to affect any duty to participate in a termination of pregnancy in accordance with section 11".

The discussion has deviated into the role of care pathways and clinical guidelines.  While I do accept that some of the situations could occur where the issue of the nine to 12-week period arises, it is the doctors in the community who know what the relationship is with the universal maternity service.  It is a waste of time for the committee to discuss woman Z who goes in and finds that she is over nine weeks pregnant.  That is the job of the people delivering the service, be in the community or the acute setting.  It is at that point where the woman, potentially, as Deputy Donnelly said, will end up in a clinical setting due to not being able to confirm in the community whether she is nine or ten weeks pregnant, we will have to consider not sending her from Billy to Jack but letting her choose to go back to her GP or stay in the clinical setting, even though she is only seven or eight weeks pregnant, as opposed to hopping backward and forward between services.  I referred to the woman who had to continue to tell her story.  I know that the Minister is working with the medics.</p></speech>

I think it was Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n who said it.  This afternoon we will head into the realm of Roe<i>v. </i>Wade in the United States.  One of the clear strategies of the American pro-life wing is to frighten women, put undue barriers in their way and isolate and intimidate them.  Another strategy is to intimidate doctors.  Even those who genuinely believe in termination of pregnancy and a woman's right to choose are left in the difficult position in their personal life where it is not worth it to get up in the morning to find blood on their car or a barrier in their way or their families being abused.  It is important that people be conscious of the similarities here with the methods used in the past in the United Stated.  We need to try not to repeat those situations.  I do not believe we will, but we need to be conscious of it now and in the future.</p></speech>

The Medical Council guidelines do not require for arrangements to be made.  It requires that information be made available.  There is a significant difference in that regard.  The issue of abortion is highly contested, not just in Ireland or the United States.  It is contested internationally.  I do not agree in any way that any person who is seeking such an operation, or the person who will provide it, should be interfered with.</p></speech>

When we go home from here tonight we will have a conversation with our spouses or partners.  When I go home I will have a conversation with my wife, and my family is split down the middle, so to speak, in terms of pro-life and pro-choice.  To be honest, I probably get the best education when I go home because I listen to both sides of the argument.  I am pro-life, but I agree with certain aspects in terms of pro-choice as well.</p> <p>  The biggest problem we have currently is the shortage of GPs and we are doing nothing to deal with that.  I know abortion will be legalised in Ireland.  I mentioned earlier that Peter Boylan is travelling around the country to try to see which hospitals are available.  We should be doing everything we can to recruit as many junior and other doctors as possible.  I heard of an organisation last week that went to Australia for five or six days to try to encourage Irish people to return here to work in IT.  We should be out there trying to encourage GPs, consultants and so on to return here.  The recession is over now.  If we are going to legalise abortion and are to do an average of nine, ten or 11 abortions a day throughout the country, our hospitals will not be fit for purpose to do that.  We will then have abortion clinics throughout the country.  I said from day one that Ireland is one of the safest countries in the world in which to have a child and I would like that to continue to be the case.  We should be doing our best to recruit as many GPs as possible to work in this country.</p></speech>

As to the reason we are proposing to delete those from the legislation, I never thought I would see the day when we would have legislation in which women's menstrual periods are included.  Why is this necessary?  Presumably we have established medical practice as to how a pregnancy is dated, be it gestation or whatever, and it seems ludicrous to insert something like this into a law.  This should be dealt with in medical guidelines.</p><p>There is a touch of &quot;The Handmaid's Tale&quot; to this.  It is like something out of an episode from the TV series.  We are in a parliamentary committee talking about women's periods being put into law.  We should delete the reference.  We trust doctors to have a conversation with a woman and to establish the duration of the pregnancy.<br/><br/>There are a couple of other things to back it up.  Every day, people take abortion pills they have ordered online that they get from whatever source, one hopes from safe sources such as <i>Women On Web</i>.  They are certifying themselves on a website as to how far they are into the pregnancy.  We presume they are doing so honestly because we have not had reports of ill effects.  The surveys that have been done by Dr. Abigail Aiken, who testified before the Joint Committee on the Eight Amendment of the Constitution, that appeared in the <i>British Medical Journal </i>and <i>The Lancet</i>show that follow-up treatment was required in less than 3% of cases.<br/><br/>The reason I make the point is that there is a touch of paternalism here.  We should trust women.  That was the message of the referendum.  I have spent the entire day listening to it being said that we cannot do anything because we talked to people about it during the referendum.  My view is that we should learn from the referendum result.  For six weeks we had a dialogue with the population.  I and many others in the room knocked on thousands of doors and spoke to thousands of people.  By the end of the conversation something more progressive and radical had emerged than what we thought previously.  People told the exit poll that they trusted people and that they wanted people to make a choice.<br/><br/>It is very insulting putting that measure into a law.  If the reason for it is to appease people who are opposed to abortion, I do not see why we should do that.  We should delete the measure.  Let doctors have a discussion with women to decide how far pregnant they are without the Legislature specifying measures relating to periods in the law.</p></speech>

It is in the same vein as Deputy Coppinger's amendment.  I support everything she has just said.  I do not understand why we need the words "last menstrual period" or any reference to women's menstrual bleeding in the legislation.  It is crass and inappropriate.</p> <p>  Currently, the Bill states the dating of pregnancy shall be construed in accordance with the medical principle that pregnancy is generally dated from the first day of a woman's last period.  There are those who believe that life begins at conception, but the Bill suggests that life could begin ten days before one has sexual intercourse.  That is a fundamental issue if one uses a date when a woman is not actually pregnant.  We discussed this at considerable length in the committee.  Because I asked for it, we got a document from somebody and it is in the file.  It showed what way European countries date pregnancies.  Some do it from the point of implantation and others from the first day of the last missed period.  We need to look at what we are trying to achieve here and what the measure is trying to achieve.  I cannot find a reference in any legislation to menstrual bleeding or women's periods.  I cannot understand this obsession with women's periods and menstrual bleeding.</p> <p>  Could we simply alter the wording to say that dating a pregnancy shall be construed in accordance with current medical principles?  If the Medical Council adopted the idea that pregnancy was from the point of implantation then we would have to amend the current wording.  It throws up problems.  I am trying to be helpful.  The measure would be future proofed against medical advancements in the event that we would be able to track the fertilised egg down the fallopian tube.  Technically, one could argue that, pre-implantation, one has the genetic material to make a person in nine months.  My suggestion covers medical advances but we must also consider irregular cycles and that cycles and ovulations are based on averages.  This will cover people who might have a six-week menstrual cycle or who throw out two eggs a month.  I am not an expert in this area but I know about it.  All sorts of individual cases arise and I do not think what is proposed is fit for purpose or future proofed and my amendment addresses those issues to some extent.  I object to the fact that women and their private bodily functions would be prescribed in legislation.  Women comprise 52% of the population, although I accept they would not all be menstruating.  As a woman, I find the measure offensive.</p></speech>

I do not think it is appropriate that the day of a woman's last menstrual period should appear in legislation.  That is crass and unnecessary.  To be fair, three women have spoken and we have made our views known.  There has been much talk of speaking to this and that group, but I cannot imagine the Minister spoke to any group that was cheerleading for this measure.  Deputy O'Connell's amendment makes sense and it does not use such language, which I do not think is necessary.  I do not think it exists in other legislation-----</p></speech>

From a practical point of view it can be quite difficult to determine the first day of a last period.  First, it may not be remembered or it may not be accurate.  Quite often when women present for ultrasound scanning, the date of delivery is altered on the basis of the scan because the date given as the approximate date of the last menstrual period was incorrect.  There often has to be an adjustment on the expected date of arrival.  Current medical practice is much more encompassing from a practical point of view.</p></speech>

This does appear in other laws.  I will get the details of where that is for the sake of completeness.  Although I take very seriously the points made by the three Deputies, and the points made in the letter the committee received yesterday from the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists foetal medicine guideline development group, which has sought absolute clarity as to what is 12 weeks, Members will recall that I had conversations with people in this room in advance of and during the referendum campaign on how we define 12 weeks of pregnancy.  We do not need to reopen the entire debate again but we discussed whether it was ten weeks plus two or 12 weeks plus two or if it was 14 weeks.  I genuinely take very seriously what the Deputies say in terms of the language being crass, but it was done in consultation with medical practitioners with a view to providing them with clarity as to what 12 weeks mean.  I will read the note that has been prepared for me.  I do not think the phone that is interfering with the sound system is mine.</p></speech>

I will read my briefing note as opposed to me explaining this.  Twelve weeks of pregnancy has been defined in accordance with the medical principle that pregnancy is generally dated from the first day of a woman's last menstrual period, LMP.  Given that termination of pregnancy is to be permitted where a pregnancy has not exceeded 12 weeks, it was considered important, including by medics, and we heard this again from them in the letter yesterday, that a definition would be included in the legislation that was clear and unambiguous.  That is what Deputies O'Connell, Coppinger and O'Reilly want to achieve as well.  It is essential that legislation would be clear, particularly for medical practitioners providing services and obviously for women.  We do not want a situation where doctors are wondering if something is legal or to have the chilling effect of doctors being uncertain as to whether they can or cannot enable a woman to access a termination.  The definition in the legislation accords with the definition of 12 weeks of pregnancy that is commonly used and understood in medical practice.  It does not endeavour to deviate in any way from normal medical practice but to be a definition that is readily understood by both medical practitioners and women.</p> <p>  In light of the serious views expressed by the three Deputies and the section on gestation that we received in the letter yesterday from the IOG's foetal medicine guidelines development group, I will engage further on this.  We must arrive at a point where the language is acceptable and where there is absolute clarity as to what is 12 weeks.  The people voted for 12 weeks, but 12 weeks plus two weeks is 14 weeks.  I do not wish to rerun the referendum campaign but I must stay honest to the principle of 12 weeks while taking on board what the Deputies said.</p></speech>

The Minister said "generally dated".  Yes, in Ireland pregnancies are generally dated as the Minister described, but I imagine that is because the eighth amendment was in place.  Perhaps it was not, but I argue that it was.  Jurisdictions date it differently, and I believe there is scope there to move without compromising the ten to 12 weeks or eight to ten weeks.</p></speech>

One saw elderly males on the doorsteps who were flummoxed by what we were saying.  That refers to the claim that the people fully grasped that.  The reason I proposed deleting it is the reference to current medical practice.  What does that mean in legal terms?  Does it mean it keeps changing or is it current to when we vote?  I agree with Deputy O'Connell.  Dating a pregnancy from one's last period, given what the doctors and the Chairman said, is highly unscientific in some ways, and there could be an advancement next week whereby we can exactly date a pregnancy.  If we insert something like that, we are inhibiting any advancement.  In addition, we do not go into details about men's health in such a way in legislation and we should not do so about women's either.</p></speech>

We got into what I considered a very unhelpful conversation about how every woman who wanted to access a termination was going to be obliged to have a scan, which is not medically necessary and not best practice.  There was a need to land somewhere that provides clarity as to what 12 weeks are.  Through the committee we decided to provide in legislation for no specific indication as a ground and we capped it at 12 weeks.  There was a need to try to capture what 12 weeks were and, without scanning every woman accessing a termination, the sense was that using the LMP provided clarity.  I have heard what the Deputies have said and I will reflect on it, but in doing so I cannot deviate from the fact that there is a 12 week limit on the no specific indication.  I do not believe anybody is asking me to do that but that is the challenge we must try to address.</p></speech>

At that stage, I did not realise there was such a thing as people who survived abortions.  She told me that in her situation, thankfully, a medical practitioner who was at the location of the abortion intervened after it to provide her with comfort and sustenance.  I was shocked that this had happened.  I carried out some research after that and found that in Canada between 2000 and 2010, there were 491 occasions on which an unborn child survived an abortion but was significantly injured and was allowed to expire.  In those cases, doctors did not provide any medical assistance to the child so that it could survive.  In any given year in Britain, there can be up to 66 not unborn but born children in this situation who have survived an abortion but are injured and allowed to expire.  This amendment is neither a pro-choice or pro-life amendment.  It does not do anything about access to abortion.  All it means is that we ensure that a person born in that scenario is protected.  My own instinct is that it would surely never happen in Ireland and that if a person made it through, all necessary medical help would be provided.  However, I have indicated two international examples which suggest that we should clarify the position and go forward by ensuring that in those cases lives are protected.</p></speech>

When I spoke on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il, it was suggested to me that they did not, but that is not correct.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n has given the examples of Canada and England and Wales.  This amendment provides clarity and guidance for doctors by creating a duty to act to save the life of a child born alive after an attempted abortion.  The amendment identifies criteria such as breathing, a heartbeat, umbilical cord pulsation or the movement of muscles which should be taken into account to oblige a doctor to act to protect the life of the child.  Over the course of the hearings, the Minister said the biggest problem he had in relation to abortion was the lack of clarity for doctors.  This amendment clarifies the action for doctors.  Importantly, it does not dictate to the medical profession what steps might be appropriate in any given care scenario.</p> <p>  It is routine in countries with legalised abortion that doctors in one part of a hospital are doing everything possible to save a premature baby born at 23 weeks while in another part of the same hospital a baby at 24 weeks' gestation is having its life ended by abortion.  The only difference between the babies in that scenario is that one is wanted while the other is not.  We cannot allow this to happen in Ireland.  Amendment No. 98 ensures the scandal of children being left to die in other countries will not happen here.  The amendment does nothing to prevent access to abortion or to stop a woman availing of legal treatment, but it will avoid the gross human rights abuses which take place when the law fails to protect clearly babies who survive abortions.  In the course of hearings here and during the referendum campaign, the Minister has often used the word "compassion".  This amendment is all about compassion and care for one of the most vulnerable people in our society, namely, a tiny baby who has just survived the trauma of abortion.</p> <p>  It would be unbelievable if the Minister rejected an amendment which did nothing to prevent access to abortion and which is all about saving lives.  We cannot create a situation in Ireland where doctors in one part of a hospital are doing everything possible to save a premature baby born at 23 weeks while in another part of the same hospital a baby of 24 weeks, born after surviving an abortion, is left without life-saving care for whatever reason.  The amendment is sought to provide clarity and certainty to doctors as to how to proceed when an abortion does not result in the death of a baby.  It makes it clear that where there are indications of life, there is a duty to act to save that life.  Nothing could be more compassionate and clear.  The amendment will assist doctors significantly in the carrying out of their duties.  We must also be cognisant of the human rights abuses of children who survive abortions and are then left without care.  We have plenty of evidence of this problem from England, Canada and elsewhere where babies born alive after botched abortions are left alone in hospitals to die without care from medical staff.  We cannot license human rights abuses here.  Abortion in Ireland will be legal up to six months into a pregnancy in some cases and we can only hope the number of children who experience the cruel after effects of failed abortion procedures will be few and far between.  However, we must ensure at the same time that those children are cared for.  That is what this amendment is all about.</p></speech>

A year ago, I met a lady downstairs in Buswells Hotel, which is across the road, who had been aborted herself but was now 39 years of age.</p><p>She explained what happened.  Her grandmother insisted that her mother abort and her mother duly had the abortion.  A nurse who was passing by heard a little groan or moan from the baby in a bucket and asked the matron if the baby was still alive.  The matron told her to carry on, that the baby was dead but she came back and it proved that, when the baby got attention, it lived.  It is worrying that babies can feel pain much earlier in the pregnancy than 21 or 22 weeks.  To go on with the story, the baby was seen afterwards and survived.  We are asking that if a baby lives after coming out of the womb, it should get every intervention that is medically possible to ensure it gets the same chance at life as everyone else.  As the previous speaker said, one could have a scenario where, on one side of the hospital, a mother, for one reason or another, has to have an early birth at 21 or 22 weeks and everything is done to ensure her baby is kept alive.  We do not want a scenario where, just because a baby has been aborted, it does not get the same attention.</p><p> A few weeks ago, I had the good fortune of seeing a baby who was born at 22 weeks, weighing a little over 1 Ib.  He was a lovely little boy and is now six months old.  He is small but he is coming on and will live.  It is sad, in one way, that we lose babies, but if the baby arrives and is still alive outside the womb, I am asking the Minister to please ensure it gets every possible medical intervention and every help and assistance possible to be allowed to live.  That is what this amendment is about and I fully support it.</p></speech>

For avoidance of doubt, the fact that the infant has been born alive as a result of the carrying out or attempted carrying out of a termination of pregnancy under this Act shall not be a relevant consideration for a medical practitioner when determining what constitutes an appropriate and/or practicable step under <i>subsection (3)</i>.</blockquote> <p>This amendment provides badly needed clarity, to which the Minister often refers, in guidance for doctors in creating a duty to act to save the life of a child who is born alive after an attempted abortion.  Like Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, I have met a number of survivors of attempted abortions.  The amendment identifies criteria such as breathing, heartbeat, umbilical cord pulsation, movement of muscles, etc.  The Minister, over the course of the hearings, has said that one of the biggest problems with the law on abortion in the past year was a lack of clarity for doctors.  We might disagree about that point but if the Minister has indicated a lack of clarity, this amendment is an opportunity to make it clear.  </p><p>It is important to note that the amendment does not dictate to medical practitioners what steps might be appropriate to take in any given case.  It will obviously vary with circumstances, including in particular the stage of gestation of the foetus and into infancy, and different considerations will naturally apply.  For example, if the infant is born alive after the point of viability, the amendment clarifies that the fact that a termination of pregnancy was sought by the pregnant woman, or certified under the Act, does not <i>per se</i>alter the duty owed by doctors to take appropriate steps to preserve the life of any child born.  It is a reasonable amendment and I am hopeful it will be accepted.  We have seen evidence and figures from Canada and other countries.  Over a ten-year period starting in 2000, 481 babies who survived botched abortions were abandoned by medical staff and left to die alone in the corners of hospitals.  It is unbelievable that this would happen.</p></speech>

The circumstances in which people survive abortions might be rare but, as others have said, they have met people who survived them and are living proof.  I also met the lady Deputy Danny Healy-Rae met and the incredible relationship she now has with her mother is second to none.  She was fortunate that, after the abortion, she was seen several times by a medical professional several times who observed her heartbeat and decided to give medical intervention and save her life.  A baby who survives an abortion deserves every right to medical treatment so it can continue to live.  The amendment will provide clarity for medical professionals.</p></speech>

The first time I met a person who had survived an abortion was when Deputy Mattie McGrath introduced me to a lady who had visited him here in the D&aacute;il.  During that conversation, the enormity of what happened to this young person struck me.  I looked at and spoke to this lady and the enormity of the way she came into the world was a profound experience for me.  I was grateful to Deputy McGrath for introducing me to her because it opened my eyes to what can happen and things that I would not have understood.  A doctor would understand them, but people like me would not.  That is why I feel strongly about this important amendment.  There are sound medical reasons for bringing it forward as it will give clarity to medical practitioners as to what they should or should not do.  It would, I presume, be abhorrent to all of us if something was done to a baby who had survived an abortion other than allowing it to live.  I hope I am explaining myself properly.  I wholeheartedly support this extremely important amendment.</p></speech>

It would not be appropriate for the committee to do so.  Medical practitioners are always required to maintain professional standards and uphold medical ethics and are bound through professional regulatory mechanisms to deliver medical services in accordance with best medical practice.  However, the detail of best medical practice is always set out in clinical guidelines rather than in primary legislation.  The purpose of primary legislation is not to set out treatment plans or compulsory care pathways.  That is not our job as legislators.  I certainly would not fancy giving advice to the master of a maternity hospital on how to care for or deliver a baby or how to care for a woman.  That is the job of highly qualified obstetricians.</p><p>Let me be clear: I have not come across one doctor working in our maternity services who seeks this clarity, because they already have it.  They care for newborn babies every day they go to work regardless of the circumstances.</p><p> One aspect that was not mentioned in any of the Deputies' contributions, perhaps disappointingly, was the woman.  The idea that any woman in Ireland would leave a baby in a bucket, which is a reference to a phrase that one of the Deputies used, is a shock tactic.  Whether it is intentional or otherwise, it is insulting to doctors and to women.  Doctors know how to care for babies.  They care for every single new life that comes into the world daily and they do a darn good job.  If anybody wishes to take a trip, I suggest going to the neonatal intensive care units in Holles Street, the Rotunda or the Coombe, and I am sure the masters of any of our maternity hospitals would be more than delighted to show how much they care for life at its most vulnerable stages.  I would happy for my office to arrange that for any of the Deputies.  The idea that doctors would not care is not borne out by reality.  The Deputies have all heard multiple times from the masters of maternity hospitals and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  The only people who suggest that doctors would not care are a group of politicians in Leinster House.  It is not borne out in medical practice or in the standards to which our doctors adhere.  It is a poor reflection the Deputies are trying to cast on women in this situation.  While I do not doubt their bona fides, I fundamentally disagree with them and it is has no place in the law.  We do not put compulsory care pathways and treatment plans in law.  I am not, therefore, in a position to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

Until now, there have been no abortion clinics in Ireland.  We have maternity hospitals - and I know what happens in them - but I wish matters to be clear not only for myself but for all the people who voted in this referendum.  I want clarity about whether that baby will get the same treatment, because it was not clear in the Bill until we started discussing it.  The Minister can criticise me if he so wishes and say I am this or that for stating the lady's baby was thrown into a bucket, but that is what happened to her and she said it herself.  I am not making it up or adding one iota to it.  I make no apologies for getting clarity as to what will happen or for asking for every intervention possible for a baby who is aborted and who, in the first place, is not wanted by anyone but who ends up alive for a number of minutes.  It is not wrong or unfair of me to ask that that baby gets the same care and nurturing that another baby of the same age delivered in a maternity hospital in some other part of the country would get.</p> <p>  The Minister should not criticise me or say that I am being disingenuous.  I have the same regard for mothers and babies.  We know the mother will be seen afterwards but it was never clear - and it will not be clear until it is included in the Bill - that the baby will also be seen afterwards.  The Minister may think I get enjoyment out of talking about these things but I certainly do not.  I was elected by the people and I find myself here making the case and asking questions.  We have tabled only 16 amendments, which we found important to put down and put our name to, and we do not want to be criticised by the Minister or anyone else for tabling them.  All we wanted was to get clarity and surety that an aborted baby will get the same treatment.  The Minister should not criticise us on whatever platform he has.  He is the Minister and he is supposed to be the expert.</p> <p>  We all got the job of legislating.  The people voted and I will abide by their vote but we must put a fair Bill in place to provide for all eventualities.  If an eventuality arises where a baby arrives and he or she is alive outside the womb, I want to ensure that baby will be appropriately seen afterwards.  We do not know what happens in an abortion clinic because we have never been there and we have never had an abortion clinic in Ireland.  That is what we wish to ascertain and the Minister should not belittle us.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked me a question, which I answered and which I am now answering a second time.  Many medics appeared before committee meetings in advance of the referendum outlining why the constitutional change was needed and how much they care for all babies born in their hospitals.  To suggest they do not care, therefore, is a slur on our medical profession.</p> <p>  The Deputy claimed that there are not any abortions in Ireland but that is factually incorrect.  He may or may not have supported it but Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act allows women whose lives are at risk have access to abortion.  That law has been in place for a number of years and every year more than 20 take place.  It is factually incorrect, therefore, to say that terminations do not take place in Ireland.</p> <p>  The Deputy also referred to abortion clinics.  I presume he is referring to our maternity hospitals and maternity units staffed by our obstetricians.</p></speech>

At the start of our deliberations yesterday, the Minister stated that he would accept none of the pro-life amendments.  However, he is to some extent making an effort to meet or technically facilitate some of the other pro-choice amendments, which is a pity.  The Minister said we never referred to women in our discussion, but all the people we mentioned were women.</p></speech>

These are both women and mothers and we mentioned them in our opening statement.  These are people who have survived due to someone obviously intervening in a medical fashion to protect their lives.  There is nothing in the amendment that determines what type of treatment or pathway of treatment is provided or any such thing.  Rather, it requires that treatment is provided.  This debate often arises when people like me compare and contrast international examples but people say it would never happen in Ireland.  The implication is that Irish people are morally superior in some way to those in other countries and, therefore, Irish doctors will not make the same decisions that are made in Canada or Britain.  I do not think anyone is superior in any country; doctors are doctors and people are people.  We know that when we legislate in this regard, legislation can often change social norms and that is the concern.</p><p>It is a genuine worry.  It is not an effort to make any difference to the legislation with regards to access; it merely seeks on this occasion to make sure that in a case where a person is born and injured, he or she would be protected.  Clarity would be useful in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.1490" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1263" speakername="Michael Collins" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110700002#NN00200"><p>The Minister mentioned that nobody is talking about the woman or the mother and that is highly insulting.  We are putting forward amendments to protect the unborn, if there is an abortion, where the child survives.  We are putting forward this amendment merely to ensure protections are put in place for medical professionals.</p> <p>  There will be cases where women will not be medically able to make a decision after having an abortion.  Certainly, I am aware, from talking to the lady to whom we spoke, who is the woman I referred to both about her mother and herself and the great relationship they now have after her survival, that we need to put those protections in place and ensure if something like this happens that at least the medical professionals know.</p> <p>  We are not undermining any medical professional.  We are going down a different road.  The Minister may say abortions are taking place in Ireland but they are rare and they are undertaken in extreme circumstances to protect the mother's life.  We need to ensure these safeguards are put in place and this amendment will ensure they are.</p> <p>  I do not like attacking anybody but I feel sometimes the Minister is talking down to us regarding our amendments as if we are here to cause as much disruption as possible; we are not.  We have kept our amendments to a minimum.  These are sincere amendments.  This is a sincere worry among some, which I share, that these safeguards need to be put in place.</p></speech>

The Minister accused him of engaging in shock tactics.  It is not a shock tactic if one goes in front of people and states a fact that happened in real life.  That is not made-up stuff.  That is not a politician being sensationalist.  It is a politician telling a truth of a life's experience that he and others had and for the Minister to try and put a person down because of stating a fact is not in keeping with his form.  The Minister is better than that and he should not engage in that type of activity.</p> <p>  Coming back to what Deputy Michael Collins stated, the Minister gives the impression that it is as though he wants to ridicule us, try to find fault with, and punch holes in our 16 amendments.  For the office that he holds and for an intelligent person, that is not a proper way for Deputy Harris to be carrying on.  He should listen to what we are saying and take it on board.  If he is to beat us, he should beat us but not try to ridicule us for holding firm the view that we have.  We are, after all, representing an awful lot of people.  We are democrats.</p> <p>  Following the referendum, I was asked whether I would engage in trying to hold the legislation up for as long as possible, and I clearly stated I would not.  What we are doing here, as the Chairman will be well aware, is not blackguarding the system.  We are not trying to hold anything up.  We are not speaking for a minute longer than we have to.  We merely want to make our points.  That is why I am so disappointed with the Minister's reaction to our amendments.</p> <p>  The way the Minister answered this amendment was to go off on a tangent talking about the protection of the child.  We are talking about being inside in a room in a clinic - the Minister can call it whatever he likes - where the purpose is for a baby to be aborted.  Then the Minister talked about expecting the emphasis will be on protecting the life.  It will not be about protecting the life if one is inside in a room where an abortion is to take place.  If one is in that room where the baby is to be aborted and the baby is alive for one reason or another, we want clarity about what will happen it at that stage.  That is what we are talking about here.</p> <p>  The Minister replied to something completely different that we never stated in the first instance.  We are being clear about what we are talking about.  It has been stated by every member on this side that we want to know if that life is to be protected if it is outside of the womb, if the baby has a heartbeat.  The Minister did not answer that.  He went off on a completely different matter, trying to ridicule it and trying to say that is what doctors do - they save lives.  That is what doctors have been doing all along but we are talking here about legislating for ending life.  We are looking for protections and measures to be put in place and for there to be clarity for our doctors.  There are many doctors, GPs and others, up and down the country who have asked us to raise these matters.  The Minister, more than anybody, should appreciate what we are trying to achieve here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.1492" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110700002#NN00400"><p>I, too, am disappointed with the Minister in the way that he is talking down to us as if we were trying to hold the legislation up.  We have 16 amendments; there are 180 overall.  That answers that assertion.  We were being accused of intending to filibuster and do God knows what.</p> <p>  For the purposes of clarity, I reiterate that official figures in Canada show that over a ten-year period, starting in 2000, 491 babies who survived abortions were abandoned by medical staff and left to die alone in the corners of hospital.  In the UK, the confidential inquiry into maternal and child health revealed that in one year, 66 babies were born alive and left unaided to die after failed abortions in England and Wales.  These figures shed a light on the chilling reality of legalised abortion without protections for children who survive an abortion.  The fact that these practices are rarely talked about in public does not diminish one iota the horror of what takes place.  It is routine in countries with legalised abortion that doctors in one part of the hospital do everything possible to save a premature baby born at, say, 23 weeks, and I am testament to that as I have a grandchild who was born at 23 weeks thanks to the hospital staff and who the Chairman has met, while in another part of the same hospital a baby at 24 weeks' gestation is having his or her life ended by abortion.  It is insulting for the Minister to state we do not respect what the staff do in those hospitals and to give us a lecture.  In my grandchild's case, I note the work that went on in both Clonmel and at CUH in the neonatal ward.  We are so blessed to have her in school now.</p> <p>  As for the Minister talking down to us, I have visited an abortion clinic.  I have been in a maternity hospital.  I have eight children and four grandchildren, and am expecting two more.  I know the ins and outs of it and respect the work they do.  As for the Minister trying to stigmatise us as bashing the doctors, more than 600 of them signed the petition looking for an EGM because the Minister has not consulted them.</p></speech>

We cannot allow this to happen in Ireland.  This amendment makes sure that the scandal we have seen in other countries of children being left to die will not happen here.</p> <p>  This amendment is clear.  It does not hold up anything or try to stop the abortion process.  It will do nothing to prevent access to abortion or to stop a woman availing of a legal treatment but it will avoid the gross human rights abuse that happens when the law does not clearly protect babies who survive abortions.</p> <p>  I have met a number of people.  The Minister could have met them too as they asked to meet him but they were not allowed in and he referred them back to the committee.  They could not get a pro-life doctor, we were told, to address the committee.  That answers that.</p></speech>

We were told by the secretariat and the Chair we could not get a pro-life doctor, which was totally untrue.</p> <p>  The Minister has often used the word "compassion" during these hearings and during the referendum campaign.  This amendment is all about compassion and care for one of the most vulnerable persons in society, a tiny baby who has just survived the trauma of an abortion.</p><p>It would be unbelievable were the Minister to reject this amendment.  I reiterate there is nothing to prevent access to abortion but it is all about saving lives.  We cannot have a situation where doctors in one part of the hospital are doing everything possible to save a premature baby born at 23 weeks, for example, while in another part of the hospital, a baby born after 24 weeks, born after surviving an abortion, is left without life saving care.  Doctors need to know what to do.  They cannot be tied.  This is why this amendment has been put down.  We trust doctors, of course.  This amendment has been sought to give clarity and certainty to doctors on how to proceed when an abortion does not result in the death of a baby.  It makes it clear that where there are indications of life there is a duty to act to save that life.  Nothing could be more compassionate.  It is clear that this amendment will significantly assist doctors to carry out their duties.  </p><p> We must also be cognisant of human rights abuses for children who survive an abortion and are left without care.  This is not a theoretical problem, as we have plenty of evidence of such cases in England, Canada and elsewhere where babies born alive after botched abortions are left alone to die in hospitals without care from medical staff.  We cannot allow such human rights abuses to happen here.  Perhaps we can, according to the Minister.  We met that lady from America, and her story was just riveting.  It was wonderful to see her alive and telling her story.  Abortion is going to be legal in Ireland until six months into a pregnancy in some cases.  We can only hope that the number of children who experience the cruel after-effects of failed abortion procedures will be very low.  At the same time, we have to ensure they are cared for.  This amendment not about grandstanding.  We have 16 amendments in total.  Other amendments are described as very important, but ours are ridiculed and rubbished.  It is not a good way to proceed.  The Minister is talking down to us about hospitals.  I have been in more maternity hospitals than the Minister will ever see.  I wish the Minister well.  I know plenty about what goes on in hospitals and the excellent work by the nurses, doctors and others.  I have been in abortion clinics in America - perhaps the Minister has not - and have seen the horror of what goes on there.  We are not backward people.  We have a right to be here and have been elected to be here.  I seek fewer lectures, please.  </p></speech>

It is only a matter of time before this becomes an issue, and our hospitals will not be able to cope.  If abortion takes off and there are thousands of abortions every year, our hospitals will not be fit to look after these abortions.  Therefore, there will be abortion clinics coming to Ireland and all I seek is clarity as to whether doctors or whoever carries out these abortions in clinics are fully aware that if an abortion is botched and the child survives he or she must look after the child.  I might not have mentioned women in my last speech, but I mentioned the Minister's name many times.  The reason I mentioned his name is that I want him to make sure that this amendment is carried.  He is looking for clarity, and we are providing clarity.  We are asking the Minister to listen to us.  Has the Minister made up his mind?  Will he throw aside all of our amendments?

I always try to engage respectfully on this matter.  Deputy Michael Healy-Rae has a depth of feeling and passion but so do I.  I am thinking of the many women who have experienced human rights abuses in our country because of our current legislative situation.  We are trying to change that.  Deputy Mattie McGrath has spoken about human rights abuses.  Many human rights abuses have been perpetrated on women.  Deputy Kelly and I have sat in rooms with some of these women, as have others, while they outline the human rights abuses they have suffered in this country.  Passions are running high on both sides of the argument.</p> <p>  It is not a matter of having made my mind up yet or not.  I have a right - indeed, an obligation - to try to respond to the questions I am asked.  The Deputies can call it lecturing if they like, if they do not like the answers.  They have the right to describe it however they wish.  I will answer the questions to the best of my ability based on the information available to me and on my perspective on this issue.  My perspective has been endorsed overwhelmingly by the people of Ireland in the recent referendum.  The Deputies can call a vote on any amendment here or in the D&aacute;il if they wish; that is how parliamentary democracy works.  It is not a matter of my mind being made up.  My mind is made up.  I intend to pass the Bill in line with what I promised the people I was going to do.  We are testing amendments here.  I was concerned by the lack of reference to the woman in this situation because it is highly relevant.  The Deputies have referenced women who survived abortion, but-----</p></speech>

Infants born alive are cared for in our maternity hospitals already.  This amendment suggests that there is some doubt about that.  There is a suggestion that if this is not included a doctor will hear a crying baby and not care for it.  We are talking about situations where the baby has reached viability and is alive.  I agree with Deputy Mattie McGrath that viability cannot be defined by the number of weeks.  We have not done that in this legislation, because viability moves and changes depending on the pregnancy, the woman, whether there are multiple births, and indeed modern medicine.  </p> <p>  The Deputy is correct when he says that we have not defined viability, and that babies can sometimes be viable at a younger age.  However, we are talking about situations of viable pregnancies, where the woman has wanted to have her baby, and one of three things has happened: the woman is about to die; the woman is about to experience a risk of serious harm to her health that could result in her death; or she has had the devastating news of a fatal foetal abnormality.  Perhaps the baby has no brain or no heart.  I accept the bona fides of the Deputy, but it should be remembered that these are wanted babies and a terrible situation or tragedy has occurred.  Our laws are very clear, unlike laws in other countries.  I can tell Deputy Fitzpatrick that I do not know what Canadian law is like, but I am familiar with the Irish law and it is very clear as to viability.  Abortion is not allowed in Ireland where a pregnancy has reached viability.  I do not make the point about visiting maternity hospitals flippantly but the doctors who run our maternity hospitals sat in these rooms and made it clear that every single intervention is provided in those situations.  Of course people want to save the life of any baby.  A number of Deputies have suggested that hospitals have two wings, and that in one wing babies are looked after and in the other, babies are put into buckets.  I believe that many people watching this at home can understand how I find that very hard to engage in.  I find it quite upsetting.  I cannot accept these amendments.</p></speech>

I sought the figures for the time since the introduction of the 2013 Act and, although somewhat delayed, I received them.  They are small.  There is talk about the wing of a hospital but we are not talking about Dallas.  I am speaking about South Tipperary General Hospital where there are two cubicles.  They are not at either end of the hospital; they are right beside each other in the same place.  It is very caught for space and overcrowded.  I have been there.  Thankfully, everything was successful each time and I cannot praise the staff enough.  Both procedures took place in the same labour ward.   We are not speaking about a wing of a hospital; we only have a small hospital.  God knows it has suffered enough but they do an excellent job in maternity care there.  They are excellent at all other care but especially maternity.  It is not as cold and bleak as that.  No one asked the Minister to be Minister for health in Canada but surely when we are making legislation we are obligated to look at best practice and worse practice.</p></speech>

I said it is routine in other countries where abortions are legalised, which is why I keep mentioning Canada, the UK and Wales.  I also said Ireland is one of the safest places in the world to have a baby.  I said all of this.  I do not want Ireland to become the same as Canada, the UK or Wales.  The Minister has an opportunity to protect the unborn baby.  We want the Minister to state that the child who survives an abortion will be given as much medical aid as possible.  That is our suggestion, which is simple.  The Minister keeps asking for clarity.  I am speaking about countries that have legalised abortion.  Currently, abortion is not legal in Ireland.  Before this happens, I am giving the Minister an opportunity to protect the child that survives an abortion.</p></speech>

There is a lot of research that shows babies in the womb are seen to have a physical and biochemical response to injury and pain from as young as a foetal age of 20 weeks and for definite from a foetal age of 24 weeks gestation.  The amendment does not in any way seek to restrict access to abortion and does not change one iota of the heads of the Bills that were published before the referendum.  It is not a pro-choice or pro-life amendment in any way.  It simply states that in the case where there is a potential for pain to be experienced by an unborn baby in the womb during abortion that we take a precautionary perspective and ensure no operation is undertaken that allows for pain to be experienced.</p></speech>

As Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n has stated, we are not looking to change anything or water down anything.  If there is a possibility of an unborn child feeling pain the Chairman, who is a doctor, will know more than any of us that something should help alleviate the pain that might be suffered otherwise.  Which one of us can say clearly that pain would not be suffered?  Who here can state that he or she is 100% sure and certain the unborn child would not feel pain?  If we thought they were to feel pain, surely be to God this is a very human thing to seek to do.  There is nothing wrong with seeking this amendment.  I would be extremely surprised if the Minister or anyone else had a problem supporting it.  I would have to have it explained to me as to why anybody would be against this.  I am more than willing to listen to somebody with a differing viewpoint.  If there is somebody, I would love to hear what he or she has to say because I cannot understand it.  I cannot understand why somebody would be fundamentally against this because to me it seems like a very ordinary decent human thing to want to protect an unborn person from suffering or feeling pain.</p></speech>

We are told abortion is an invasive and violent procedure for the unborn child.  All we are asking is that whatever anaesthetic or pain relief is to be had, that it be administered in the course of the abortion to ensure the little babies suffer the least pain possible in the last seconds of their time in the world.  It is a small request.  When we meet people in pain, and elected representatives meet many of them every day, we try our best to see what can be done to minimise or reduce it and relieve them of whatever pain they have.</p><p>It would be remiss of us as elected Members if, when discussing the Bill, we did not ask for whatever pain relief is possible to be had to help the poor baby not suffer pain.</p></speech>

Medical science has shown that babies in the womb respond to injury and pain.  We have a duty to ensure compassion and humanity for the child and to apply the precautionary principle that pain should be prevented wherever possible.  Surgeons recognise unborn babies as patients and anaesthetic is routinely used for babies undergoing surgery in the womb.  Surely the same should apply in the case of surgical abortions.  It would be horrifying and unnecessary for Irish unborn children to suffer needlessly during an abortion.  To prevent this, the Government must accept the amendment requiring unborn children to be given pain relief before an abortion procedure wherever there is a reasonable possibility of pain being experienced.  I hope the Minister has a good look at this.</p></speech>

We are dealing with a human life, whether the Minister wants to accept that or not.  The fact this has not been factored in is beyond belief.  Like others here, I am acting according to the wishes of the electorate, more than 723,000, including yes voters, who would like to see this put into the legislation.  Nobody wants unnecessary suffering or to inflict any unnecessary suffering.  It is clearly the duty of compassionate and humane doctors to act on the precautionary principle of prevention of pain if there is any risk.  Scientific research from around the world has shown that babies in the womb feel pain before 20 weeks.  All we are doing with this very reasonable amendment is asking the Minister to show compassion for the unborn baby by accepting the amendment.</p></speech>

We need to acknowledge this humanity by obliging medical professionals to minimise the pain of abortion procedures.  Surgeons recognise unborn babies as patients and anaesthetic is routinely used for babies undergoing surgery in the womb.  Surely the same should apply in the case of surgical abortions.  It is not too much to ask.  The Bill envisages surgical abortions in certain circumstances beyond 12 weeks&rsquo; gestation.  Clearly there is a possibility that some of these unborn children are capable of feeling pain, yet the Bill as it stands has no requirement that unborn children are given appropriate protection from pain during abortion procedures.</p> <p>  There are differing views on this.  In April 2018, the master of the National Maternity Hospital, Dr Rhona O'Mahony, said a foetus does not feel pain until 26 or 27 weeks.  A 2010 Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists report on foetal awareness inferred the foetus has the capacity to feel pain at 24 weeks.  Experts observed in a recent paper that a common precautionary principle is imposed whereby the absence of possible damage must be demonstrated before giving, or in this case before withholding, a potentially useful treatment that we would expect to be used.</p> <p>  We are pleading for humanity.  I am sure nobody in the room wants to inflict pain on anybody.  This is why I have proposed the amendment and I plead with the Minister to accept it.</p></speech>

The purpose of the legislation is not to regulate or dictate the practice of obstetrics.  Medical practitioners are bound through their professional regulatory mechanisms to operate in accordance with best medical practice.  The requirements in sections 10 to 13, inclusive, for medical practitioners to be of a reasonable opinion formed in good faith emphasise that doctors must maintain professional standards and uphold medical ethics.</p> <p>  It is simply not appropriate to include detailed medical treatments, compulsory care pathways or treatment plans in legislation.  We do not do this even for the woman in the legislation, such as detailing what medication must be prescribed to her.  The type of detail is best set out by our clinicians in their clinical guidelines rather by politicians in primary legislation.  I have assured my colleagues, and I am happy to do so again, that in parallel with service planning and expansion work, clinical guidelines for medical practitioners on termination of pregnancy are also in preparation.  That work is being undertaken by the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland, and the Irish College of General Practitioners.  The Department has provided financial grant aid to support this work to enable their timely and efficient completion.  These clinical decisions and how clinicians operate belong in the clinical space decided by clinicians in their guidelines.  It is not for us to prescribe medication or treatments in the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

It is an issue for politicians to decide upon whether they should or not.  We had a correct conversation earlier where Deputies from the other side said if something is in primary legislation, it is much stronger than if it is in medical guidelines.  This is an ethical and moral situation and question.  It is not a guideline or a pathway decision.  Any of us should have the confidence to state that we oppose an operation that causes pain to any individual and that we will use the tools that we have, politically and democratically, to ensure that it does not happen.  Passing the buck to somebody else to do this is incredible.  This is the mildest and most unifying of all the amendments, and the fact that we have to fight for this is amazing.</p></speech>

It is a question of where it is appropriate to deal with various issues.  It is appropriate for the legislation to set out policy parameters of how a regulation of termination of pregnancy service will work, and the most appropriate people to talk about the administration of anaesthetics are medically qualified people and not politicians.  I have never administered an anaesthetic in my life and I am not sure that anyone in the room has.  Perhaps the Chairman has done so.  The appropriate place for these issues to be decided is by clinicians in clinical guidelines.</p><p>It is important that clinicians do their job and legislators do theirs and that we not get in each other's way in that regard.  Clinicians will decide appropriately what medications, treatments and care pathways to put in place.  We will provide them with the parameters of the grounds on which termination is legal in Ireland.  It is not the job of this Bill to regulate obstetrics.  It is simply the Bill&rsquo;s job to outline how termination of pregnancy services will be regulated.</p></speech>

First, at least 24 hours before the carrying out of a termination of pregnancy, the relevant medical practitioner or qualified person assisting the relevant medical practitioner should perform an ultrasound imaging of the foetus and auscultation of foetal heart tone.  The Minister stated that this would not be necessary medically at that stage.  His view contradicts that of a large number of medical professionals, not least Dr. Peter Boylan, chair of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who explicitly informed the Joint Committee on Health on 19 September 2018 when it was discussing the clinical guidelines for the introduction of abortion from nine to 12 weeks that it would be necessary to have an ultrasound as a dating mechanism in that respect.  He told the committee: &ldquo;Figures vary but in Scotland, for example, about 30% of women will require a scan for uncertain dates and it will probably be something similar here.&rdquo;  He spoke about the risks of introducing a termination of pregnancy service in this State without adequate scanning facilities and how there were infrastructural deficits in the provision of access to ultrasound in pregnancy in Ireland.  That deficit raises concerns regarding this process.  When giving evidence at any level to us regarding this procedure, the first thing that many doctors indicated was that they did not have ultrasound machines in their offices and they were not skilled in their use.</p><p> There is also an issue with ectopic pregnancies in this scenario.  There is a danger, if an abortion pill is prescribed and consumed, that that abortion pill will not have an effect on an ectopic pregnancy.  If that ectopic pregnancy is not discovered, that can be a threat to the mother's health, which is a major issue.  The issue of allowing for an ultrasound scan to be taken has been discussed by many senior medical professionals.  The medical professionals the Minister has tasked to run this particular service have said it is necessary.  Certain doctors are concerned that if they are involved in the delivery of a treatment that does not fully understand the dangers with regard to ectopic pregnancy, it could be a threat to the mother's health and could also be a threat to them in the future.  The threat to the mother's health is the primary concern there.</p><p> The second element of this amendment is information.  I have been pro-life for a great number of years, although I was not always.  In all that time I never denied that information should be offered or provided to people.  I have always been of the view that access to information is really important for people to be able to make proper choices.  Informed consent is based upon access to information.  I have been struck by a number of women who have come to my constituency clinics and said that they had had abortions but that they did not realise how developed the unborn child was at the age gestation that the child was.  They did not have that full information and they regretted that that information was not provided or at least offered to them.</p><p> The amendment only seeks to offer this potential to a woman who is pregnant.  It does not seek to coerce, even though I know some people have said it does.  It just seeks to offer.  In that case it is a pro-choice amendment because it gives the choice to a person to accept or decline that offer.  Given that the Minister is in favour of choice, surely this choice should also be offered to the woman in that circumstance.</p></speech>

I wish to clarify something that has been misquoted elsewhere.  A pregnant woman is offered the opportunity to view an active ultrasound imaging and hear auscultation of foetal heart tone.  She can opt not to view the active ultrasound imaging or the auscultation of foetal heart tone.  Some people have tried to twist this in different ways that were never intended.  The Chairman and I know that ultrasound equipment is available in very few GP surgeries.  The Minister knows of one place where it is available in Clonmel in County Tipperary.  They offered it to the HSE to be used for south Tipperary and west Waterford but after long meetings - the Minister visited to see it himself and I thanked him - they were offered a contract for only ten days and it was pulled after eight.  That is more mismanagement in the HSE, but that is not why we are here.</p></speech>

Very few surgeries have it.  That is a massive medical centre - a wonderful practice - with up to 11 or 12 doctors, but most GPs will not have such facilities in their surgeries, nor would they have the broadband in many remote areas to work it or have the experienced people to read it.</p> <p>  Do we want to have the best possible assessment?  The Chairman is a GP and I had discussions with him in private, which I will not divulge.  As regards pregnant mothers, there is a different gestation for different reasons.  It is not deliberate; they just might not be sure.  This would be one way of telling.  In the case of a termination of pregnancy to be carried out in accordance with sections 10 or 12, we have the reasons behind this and it is all about being accurate about dates and times, and what the best treatments are.  The Chairman or somebody else said earlier that certain medications can be administered at certain stages of pregnancy and not after certain stages.</p> <p>  We just want the best for both patients at this stage - the mother and baby.  We want the offer of viewing an ultrasound or listening to the heartbeat, not enforcement.  I repeat that it would not be compulsory.  It is the offer of that.  If the mother opts not to see it or listen to it, that is her choice; she is entitled to do that.  We not about coercing people at all.  We want to use the best diagnostic equipment that is available in some areas but not in others.  We want that opportunity to be there.</p></speech>

People are entitled to table amendments, but some people have learned nothing from the debate we have had in society in the past year in particular.  Either people genuinely do not understand how offensive some of these suggestions are or they do not care or they do not interact with people who have been in these situations.  I had not planned on speaking because there is no point in giving oxygen to some of these things.  I was laughing at some of the details in the amendments such as the DVD.  On foot of these amendments, I was contacted by a young relative, who was livid and outraged which was triggered by some of this offensive stuff.  She has recently been through the trauma of a fatal foetal abnormality with twins, an experience which stretched out for months.  It is unforgivable that the six men, who just mansplained to the whole population, have no understanding of the trauma of people who have to go through a late abortion.  They talked about being left alone and so on.</p> <p>  We had a referendum, involving misogynistic posters in which the shaming of women was roundly rejected by the electorate.  There is no point rehearsing the discussions we had during the referendum campaign, but I wanted to pass on that people were genuinely upset by these amendments.</p> <p>  Those on the other side failed with their stuff during the referendum and they now want women to be forced to have ultrasound scans, for the HSE to give them written material if they want to take the abortion pill and to be forced to watch a DVD.  DVDs went out with the Ark by the way.  How offensive it is to require them to listen to a heartbeat.  Savita Halappanavar is dead because through the miscarriage she was experiencing, there was still the detection of a foetal heartbeat.  These Deputies want to force a woman who is seriously ill to listen to this.  As well as that-----</p></speech>

We are asking for balance here.  There was laughter in here as we discussed pain relief as well and I ask members of the media to convey that because they are here.  Laughter is coming from one side of the committee room and I would bring that to the attention of the public.  We are in here trying to do our best with an extreme Bill.  We respect the will of the people but many "Yes" voters have sent me in here to soften this extreme Bill and that is what I am here to do.  I will respect the voice of pro-life people as well because I am pro-life.  I am trying to be fair but what has gone on here today is disgusting and disgraceful and many false reports and false statements have been given.</p> <p>  The Chairman might be aware that the Amarach Research survey findings show that eight out of ten people agree with women having "the choice".

We are asking the Minister to take that on board.  I ask for the disgraceful and disrespectful behaviour in here to stop.  Laughter while we are discussing pain relief for unborn children is disgusting.  We are dealing with human life here, so I ask for it to stop.  Since I came in here at 3 o'clock there has been laughter and it is disgusting.  The Minister has talked about respect so where is that respect?</p></speech>

I have heard the laughter and scoffing.  We had it during the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution too and the media overwhelmingly tried to brush it under the carpet because it was coming from the right side.  We would say something, there would be laughter and it would be in the headlines, so I ask the media to have some respect for the views of the people we represent.</p> <p>  I accept the will of the people and it is of the utmost importance to stress that.  Contrary to the fundamentally misrepresentative reporting that has taken place on this matter, the amendment does not oblige or force a pregnant woman to view any ultrasound image or receive any information on the imaging and monitoring performed.  That is a fact and that is what is in the amendment.  It was carefully crafted with legal assistance.</p> <p>  Deputy Nolan quoted the Amarach Research but I will give the committee the facts of it.  The Amarach Research survey findings, which were published last month, found that almost eight out of ten adults agreed with offering women the choice of seeing an ultrasound image.  Excluding those who said they did not know, the survey found that 74% of those who identified as "Yes" voters in the recent referendum also agreed with the statement that women should be offered the choice of seeing the ultrasound.  Members all quote polls when it suits them but if the Minister is genuinely sincere in his wish to implement the will of the people, then we can see no reason this amendment should be rejected.</p> <p>  There is no question of women being forced.  It is being offered, which I said at the outset, but some journalists chose to run off and have a field day with it.  The importance of ultrasound for determining the gestational age of the unborn child and for protecting the health and life of the woman who is undergoing an abortion cannot be overstated and the Chairman knows that as a GP, particularly in circumstances where there are concerns about dating the pregnancy or where there are ectopic pregnancies.</p> <p>  As I said, Dr. Boylan, who committee members usually laud, was chair of the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and he explicitly informed the Joint Committee on Health on 19 September 2018, when it was discussing the clinical guidelines for the introduction of abortion services, that from nine to 12 weeks women will require hospital management, which in turn raises the question of ultrasound as a dating mechanism.  According to Dr. Boylan's testimony at that committee, figures may vary, but he referenced Scotland where about 30% of women will require a scan for uncertain dates so it would probably be something similar here.  That is from the man members all want to hail.</p> <p>  Dr. Boylan also spoke about the risks of introducing termination of pregnancy services in this State without adequate scanning facilities and how there are infrastructural deficits in the provision of access to ultrasound at present.  This deficit raises serious concerns with respect to the intention of the Minister for Health to roll out abortion services nationally as early as January of next year.  These concerns were confirmed by Dr. John O'Brien on behalf of the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP.  In reply to Deputy Donnelly, Dr. Mary Favier of the ICGP informed the committee that the evidence base on the need for ultrasound scanning is becoming clearer.  Dr. Favier went on to say that if ultrasound is acquired, rapid access to this facility, including the expert provision and interpretation of sonography will be a critical element of the pathway.  A 24 hour helpline staffed by properly trained clinical staff will be required.  She further noted that GPs have expressed concerns on capacity and resourcing challenges such as staffing, facilities, training, the potential lack of appropriate specialist support, the possibility of medical complications for their patients and fear of litigation.  All those points underscore the necessity of introducing a legal obligation to perform an ultrasound for both the woman and her doctor.  Those are not our words in support of this amendment.  The taking of medicines and all of that has to be considered as well because doctors need to know what treatments they can administer as the Minister said himself.</p> <p>  This is nothing to be scoffed at.  These are people we like to quote and I will take no lecture from Deputy Coppinger or anyone else on how uneducated we are or whatever.  She seems to have a monopoly on all this and on respect for democracy.  We have to face the people too, and we will.  We represent people as well, and we are entitled to do so.</p></speech>

I do not speak for her but I am pretty darn certain she has a different perspective from Deputy Mattie McGrath in respect of this matter.  She would not like her name being used in support of or aligning with the Deputy's arguments.  Dr. Favier is working extraordinarily hard to facilitate the roll-out of the services for women from January and this can be seen with many of her public comments in recent days.</p><p> Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n made a fair point about the importance of access to ultrasound.  He also correctly quoted Dr. Boylan, who said there are circumstances in which ultrasound may well be clinically needed.  He correctly indicated that from the period of approximately nine weeks - I am quoting Dr. Boylan and others - there may well be need for recourse to ultrasound.  Of that there is no doubt.  In the drawing up of clinical guidelines and care pathways under way now, our doctors are deciding when a woman needs access to an ultrasound.  I am not drawing up the clinical guidelines and nor should I but the Deputy may well be right that it may be the case that the majority of cases from nine weeks on may require this.  Of course, that is not what the amendment is about, and it is not just dealing with that period.</p><p> This amendment would make it mandatory for every woman to have an ultrasound.  I accept the Deputy stating that the screen could be turned away and it would not have to be shown to the woman or the woman would be asked if she wanted to see the screen.  The Deputy has incorrectly criticised some journalistic reporting of this because the amendment stipulates that the medical practitioner "shall perform ultrasound imaging" and that the practitioner shall then certify that this has been done.  The amendment also stipulates that after the imaging, the pregnant woman must sign to indicate that the imaging happened and that if the practitioner does not do this, he or she could end up serving a jail term of up to four years.  It is pedantic and I accept that the Deputy is not saying the woman must look at the ultrasound but he is indicating that the woman must be subjected to an ultrasound.  He is stating that a rape victim or anybody in the position, including, as Deputy Coppinger has said, an extraordinarily ill person, must be put through an ultrasound.  This would make ultrasounds mandatory and that is a statement of fact.  There is no doubt that this is the legal effect of what the Deputy is trying to do with the amendment.</p><p> The Chairman will know my next point well and Deputy Mattie McGrath made reference to it.  Access to ultrasounds for all pregnant women and other people through our health service is very important.  The idea is that we would make it mandatory to scan every woman who needs a termination when there is no medical reason for the scan.  No doctor would believe that these women would need to be scanned in some of these circumstances.  This could end up depriving women who may need a scan or access to such machinery and diagnostics.  It is not a consequence-free amendment.  This is as well as being somewhat insulting in that we as politicians would be stipulating that a doctor must scan the patient regardless of medical opinion.  Apart from this and the fact that a woman must be subjected to the scan, there is also the concern about the Deputy's constituents who may need a scan but could lose out because of the capacity of the imaging service being occupied by those women for unnecessary scans.</p><p> Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n mentioned an important point regarding the role that ultrasound scanning must play in satisfying medical concerns when they may arise and there is no doubt about that.  Clinical guidelines stipulate how best to do that.  He correctly quoted Dr. Boylan in stating that it is much more likely to be necessary from nine weeks.  If we are being honest with each other, that is vastly different from what is being proposed in the amendment, which is to mandatorily scan every woman in every circumstance.  This would have a chilling effect on the doctor if he or does not carry out the ultrasound, with the threat of either a fine or imprisonment, and it would make the woman sign her name to indicate the scan has been done.  Basically, it amounts to us as politicians telling clinicians that we know better than them as to when an ultrasound is appropriate.  For those reasons, unsurprisingly, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I know there is momentum and people want to see this Committee Stage process happen fast.  I have no desire whatsoever to slow it down.  It might be useful in the context of people's ability to engage with each other respectfully to take a break at some point.  I have never called anybody names in respect of this matter or second-guessed motivation.  I have never sought to control somebody else's language on the matter.  It is too important for any of that.  At the very outset I said I respected people's bona fides on the issue, no matter what perspective they come from.  I know the feelings are deep.</p> <p>  People who understand what representative democracy means know that minorities have a voice in this room.  Deputy Coppinger stated that the debate and referendum have been had.  If only majorities had a voice in these Houses, her party would have to fold because it is a minority party, as such.  Minorities have a role in these Houses and at this committee, and that should be respected.</p> <p>  The ultrasound is a medical tool designed to benefit patients.  It is not threatening in any way at all.  People are second-guessing the provision of it here as being threatening in some way but it is not.  It is a medical tool designed to ensure patient safety at all times, with doctors being protected in the delivery of this service.  I have no doubt the medical guidelines will go down this route.  Everybody I am speaking to medically has said that for this to work properly, there must be an ultrasound involved.  What happens if there is an ectopic pregnancy that is missed because an ultrasound is not used?  I ask these questions to find out information.  It is not the case that we are trying to railroad something through.</p> <p>  The Minister referred to penalties.  We cannot create a responsibility in law without creating a penalty and the Minister mentioned that yesterday in referring to the penalty of 14 years in prison.  We have applied a class A fine, which is the same as what applies when a person does not pay his or her television licence.  We are not talking about extreme and high-level penalties but rather penalties to apply if there are people continuously refusing to accept a responsibility in providing information to others.  It is a key point made by others that the vast majority of people asked by Am&aacute;rach Research stated it is a good idea to offer women this information.  Of those who voted "Yes" in the referendum, 74% indicated it was a good idea to offer this information to people before they make a decision.</p></speech>

We are not saying that every pregnancy requires an ultrasound but certainly, with reassurance from a doctor's perspective and as the system is rolled out, it would be important that there would be access to ultrasound if it is deemed clinically necessary.  It should not be rationed so that somebody in an early pregnancy would get an ultrasound and displace the service for somebody who requires it for a different clinical indication.  We must take on board the necessity to make available ultrasound in a very timely manner for those who have a clinical need.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that there will be a need for extra ultrasound provision.  It is a major part of the preparation ongoing for the introduction of the new services in 2019.  The Chairman indicated that this would be used where clinically appropriate or where a clinician believes it to be appropriate.  The amendment is not about asking the clinician if he or she believes an ultrasound is necessary but rather it tells the clinician it must be done.  At the very best and most benign interpretation of the amendment, it would amount to a waste of capacity if a clinician does not believe an ultrasound is necessary.</p></speech>

I used his titles and I quoted from his comments to the health committee as recently as September this year.  According to Dr. Boylan's testimony, the figures vary.  I will repeat them.  In Scotland, for example, 30% of women will require scans because of uncertain dates.  The number here will probably be similar.  Dr. Boylan spoke at length.  The Minister tried to imply that I was misquoting or doing something damaging to Dr. John O'Brien and he specifically mentioned Dr. Favier.  I am quoting from the committee transcript.  I do not know Dr. Favier at all.  She also informed the committee that the evidence base on the need for ultrasound scanning is becoming clearer.  She went on to talk about rapid access for required ultrasound scanning.</p><p>I thank the Chairman for his intervention.  Rapid access to this facility, including the expert provision of interpretation of sonographs, will be a critical element of the pathway.  In our hospital in Tipperary, people have to wait six or seven months for ultrasound.  That is why we lobbied so hard when private providers wanted to fill the gap but the Minister, the HSE and Mr. O'Brien just pulled the plug on it.  I made reference to a 24-7 helpline already.  I was not impugning anyone's character.  I will not allow the Minister to play to the media or misquote me to suggest I was impugning someone's reputation.  I merely referred to the fact that we have put so much stake in Dr. Boylan who has been appointed to lead on this, but when he quotes things that are supporting the need for our amendment-----</p></speech>

There is currently no provision in the Bill for treating the remains of aborted babies with respect and dignity.  We know abuses have taken place in other countries where such protections do not exist, including the appalling reality of body parts of unborn babies being sold for research without even the consent of the mothers of those babies.</p><p>Some of the amendments are based on research and adapted from precedents that have worked effectively in other countries.  There is nothing unusual in that.  It happens every day of the week in this Oireachtas on other issues and in parliaments throughout the world.  Before I proceed to a detailed deliberation on the content and objectives of the amendment, it is important, with the permission of the Chairman, to address briefly what can only be described as wilful and outrageous misrepresentation to which the amendment has been subjected by some elements of the media and those tasked with co-ordinating the implementation of the proposed abortion legislation.  A deliberate and callous attempt has been made to conflate or confuse how we are proposing to address two very distinct and tragic realities, namely, a deliberate termination of pregnancy as defined under the Act and an involuntary miscarriage.  We are profoundly conscious of the fact that each year an estimated 14,000 women miscarry spontaneously.  Our own loved ones are included among them.  We are deeply conscious of the fact that this is often a profoundly traumatic event for the woman and her partner, the family and siblings.  We therefore categorically reject the utterly baseless assertion that this amendment is an attempt to impose additional grief on any woman in what is already a time of great distress and sadness.  I repeat that we categorically reject it.</p><p>This amendment places an obligation on hospital facilities, not women.  It does not provide for any power to prosecute or infringe upon the women in question.  It applies to the facilities where abortions will be carried out and God knows where that will take us.  We are told it will be in our maternity hospitals but whether it is in private clinics or elsewhere, it is the person and the facility carrying it out to which the provisions would apply, not the women.</p><p>I repeat that it is not the women.  The amendment has been totally misquoted, abused and kicked around.</p></speech>

Will a record of DNA testing be kept?  This comes down to whether the Minister respects the fact that we are dealing with human beings here.  We are not proposing this amendment in order to cause unnecessary distress to any woman who finds herself in a difficult situation.  What we are saying with this amendment is that we want to ensure the right of any unborn baby to a dignified resting place.  That is all we want.  We want dignity and respect for the rights of the unborn baby.</p></speech>

This is a choice for the pregnant woman, in terms of the manner of the disposal of the bodily remains of the foetus.  This is related to the surgical procedure.  There should be an obligation on hospitals to dispose of foetal remains in a dignified manner, in accordance with regulations laid down by the Minister.</p></speech>

I wonder why because since time began, it has been important to people to be able, where possible, to choose where to be buried.  In the same way, if a mother does not have a place organised or does not wish to decide where the baby will be buried, it is important for the Minister to provide such a place so that the baby can be laid to rest with dignity and respect.  It is a very reasonable request because we hear of body parts being sold and other things happening.  In that context, some type of burial would be proper.  It is up to the Minister and he should say where this place will be if the mother or some other relative of the baby does not want to exercise his or her say on where the baby should end up.  It is the responsibility of the Minister, the State and the Government to provide a proper place so that babies are laid to rest with dignity and respect.  The amendment is very reasonable and is asking for nothing more than dignity for the baby.  It is very important for the people who voted "Yes" in the referendum who are asking where these little babies will end up or be left.</p></speech>

Politicians have commented to the effect that it is barbaric and other nonsense.  We are trying to find out where exactly a child's remains will go after an abortion.  In many cases where a mother has an abortion, she is under a huge amount of stress afterwards and it might not be the easiest time to discuss the issue with her.  In many cases, hospitals will not be able to have such a discussion with a mother.  In that context, I would like to know the Minister's plans for the foetal remains.  To be fair, we do not want to be there to be an outcry in ten years' time when we find out that, as happens in other countries, body parts were sold.  I sincerely hope it will not happen here and I know the Minister will say that this is Ireland and it will not happen here.  I contend, however, that we need to put protections in place to make sure babies are protected.  It has been suggested in the past week or so that we have the intention of criminalising the mother but that is absolute nonsense.  There will be no criminalising of mothers.  The mother needs to be protected here at all costs but we must also have concern for the baby.</p></speech>

I do not intend to add to anybody's distress or hurt by getting into the graphic and tragic situations in which people can find themselves.  In many cases in early pregnancy, from a medical point of view, this effectively has the same impact on a woman as having a miscarriage.  How do the Deputies propose that the baby be buried or cremated?  It is a foetus but how do they propose that it would be identified?  These are very early pregnancies.  I am not referring to any individuals when I say that the proposition is quite grotesque in terms of its impact.  An abortion at the early stages of pregnancy is, from a medical point of view, like having a miscarriage and I am not quite sure how the Deputies propose to have a burial-----</p></speech>

In terms of the burial of the beloved child that they wanted, whose loss is devastating to them, there is a church and a crematorium near where they travel back from and they often go there.  Others send the remains back to Ireland through the postal service or a courier service.  We know that in the case of fatal foetal abnormalities, it is not a question of the hospital or the Minister of the day having to dispose of or bury the remains.  These are babies that people take home and bury with dignity like anybody would after a stillbirth or a miscarriage and to suggest otherwise is unfair and upsetting.</p> <p>  Regarding the grounds of life and health in early pregnancy, I am not going to describe the process because any woman who has been through a miscarriage knows what it is like.  The proposal here is grossly offensive, accidentally or otherwise.  Beyond that, one is into the same procedures that we have in our hospitals today.  Hospitals already have procedures in place for stillbirth and miscarriage.  Our hospitals already deal with these cases sensitively.  They work with the families in arranging burials and so forth.  Our hospitals know what to do here.</p><p>We should not include anything in the legislation which would place the Minister of the day in such a position.  I accept the Deputies' assurances that this is not the intention behind the amendment, but, accidentally or otherwise, a woman who, in the early stages of pregnancy, has what is from a medical point of view a procedure equivalent to a miscarriage would be criminalised for not having held a funeral.  The amendment is unnecessary and upsetting.  I accept that this was not the intention of its proposers but I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that each year 14,000 women miscarry spontaneously.  All members are familiar with that but that is not what is under discussion.  Rather, we are referring to surgical terminations and the disposal of remains.  International best practice supports the amendment.  We agree with the guidance on the disposal of pregnancy remains following pregnancy loss or terminations issued by the United Kingdom Human Tissue Authority in 2015 to the effect that in all cases the woman should be made aware that there are options for disposal.  According to the UK regulator, the woman should be given written or verbal information about her options and the opportunity to discuss them and be supported in an individual and sensitive manner in order to ensure that she can make a decision that is right for her and her partner.  Further information provided should include explanation of how the pregnancy remains will be disposed of if the woman does not wish to make a decision and would prefer the hospital to handle it, as the Minister suggested.  It should also explain who to contact to request a particular disposal option and a timescale for that.  We are not talking about miscarriages but, rather, surgical procedures.  A crucial distinction reflected in the United Kingdom Royal College of Nursing guidance on informed decision-making is that although incineration and cremation both involve the pregnancy remains being burned, the procedures are not the same and take place in very different environments.  The incineration of foetuses has been forbidden in Scotland since 2012.</p> <p>  The amendment is not intentionally mischievous.  Rather, it is about trying to be respectful to the mother, her family and the body of the baby.  Clearly, it is not intended to address miscarriages.  We are not trying to muddy the water in that regard, but others are.</p></speech>

I find it extraordinarily distasteful that, intentionally or otherwise, under the amendment a rape victim who attends her doctor in early pregnancy, perhaps at six or seven weeks or earlier, and is administered the medication would have to bury the foetus.  Not a woman in the world would want to have to go through that.  Groups such as Termination for Medical Reasons, TFMR, know exactly what to do and how to care with compassion for a beloved baby who could not survive.  There is no issue in that regard.  Our maternity hospitals know how to care with compassion and dignity for stillbirths and miscarriages.  I accept that Deputy Mattie McGrath stated it is not about miscarriages but the same procedures will apply.  Our hospitals know how to deal with these situations and for women and their partners.  I take the Deputies at their word that the consequences of the amendment are unintentional, but it would apply across all sections of the Bill.  For those reasons, we should reject the amendment.</p></speech>

Subsection (5) of the amendment provides, &quot;A person who disposes of the bodily remains of a foetus which has been the subject of a termination of pregnancy otherwise than in accordance with <i>subsection (2)</i>shall be guilty of an offence&quot;.  That aims to avoid any possibility of the recurrence of an event which occurred in 2000 at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street, when the hospital admitted it may have incinerated the remains of a baby whose mother had been led to believe her child would buried in the holy angels plot at Glasnevin cemetery.  It was reported at the time that the hospital disputed for several years whether it had dealt with the remains and insisted that it had no record of the location of the body.</p><p>The amendment also highlights that our intention is not to place the onus of responsibility on the woman who has been the subject of a termination of pregnancy but, rather, on the facility or hospital where the abortion took place.  Although the amendment is silent on how the disposal of foetal remains ought to be monitored, it is our view that service providers should be subject to regular audit of relevant policies and procedures and that inspection of registered providers' termination of pregnancy services should take place.  Have we learned anything from the Tuam mother and baby home and other such institutions?  This is real life.</p><p>I will not address the selling of foetal remains in detail.  Subsections (8) and (9) of the amendment would prohibit selling or offering to sell a foetus or the bodily remains of a baby.  All present are aware of the corrupt money involved in such trade in other parts of the world.  We are not dreaming this up.  There is clear international evidence of such trade.  We are not trying to criminalise the mother at any stage.</p></speech>

That would never come into this.  We must be very protective of a mother who finds herself in such a situation.  I have been present for some of the meeting and have followed more of it in my office.  I listened to the discussion of each amendment.  I have always respected those who table amendments, even if I do not support them.  The Minister has stated that certain amendments may be considered at a later stage.</p> <p>  The Minister is lucky to have a legal team at his disposal for this process.  He needs such a team and I respect that.  We do not have that.  All I have is the wisdom of life and listening to people.  The Minister has on several occasions stated that our hospitals and medical professionals know what to do.  I presume the correspondence he receives from the public reflects that which I receive as a Deputy.  Why have hundreds of medical professionals told us that they do not know what is going on with these proposals?  They do not agree with much of what is proposed in the Bill and are very annoyed.  The Minister is saying medical professionals know everything.  Not all of them do.  Is the Minister implying that those who do not are not very good medical professionals?  He stated that medical professionals know all about it but it is obvious that many are not familiar or do not agree with many aspects of the Bill.</p> <p>  The amendment seek to clarify where the remains of the aborted baby will end up.  We do not want to looking at this issue ten or 15 years down the road and realising a mistake was made in the legislation.</p></speech>

I have been around a few years so I have heard this debate previously, and I was present during similar debates in the 1980s.  Nothing new has been said here today that I have not heard before.  I do not question the ability of the Opposition or the right to table amendments.  I question the people who drafted the amendments as it appears that they had little knowledge of the proposals in the legislation because we have spent a lot of time talking about something that the legislation does not propose at all.  That is fundamental to what we have talked about for the past two and half hours.</p> <p>  Abortion at 24 weeks or 26 weeks is not proposed in the legislation.  We heard all of that debate in 2013.  Some of us have had our posters defaced and the words "Murderer", "Bloodlust" and all other kinds of slogans daubed on them in red paint.  There comes a time when one must answer these assertions and that time is now.</p> <p>  I am glad to hear a newfound concern about compassion for babies who are aborted.  I am not, and never have been, in favour of abortion.  There have existed certain instances where women in particular situations have no other option or see no other way out other than self-harming, and that has been proven to be true.  </p> <p>  I wish to draw the attention of the committee to the manner in which babies who were born at full-term were disposed of.  Up and down this country I never heard public outcry about it.  We are now visiting those sites and talking about exhuming the remains that were disposed of in a pretty cold-blooded fashion.  Lest anybody thinks that I wish to blame the Church or churches in respect of this, I do not.  I blame society that was alive and well but looked on and did nothing and, by that stance, approved of what was happening.  People turned a blind eye and did nothing.</p> <p>  I do not attribute the content of the amendments to the members opposite, but whoever phrased them knows more about English and American law than Irish law.  They certainly knew a lot more than they know about what is proposed in the legislation.</p> <p>  Compassion is not the preserve of any one group, body, party or person in the D&aacute;il.  Much has been said about the circumstances in which women are subjected to what is seen in some quarters as inhuman and inhumane treatment in the course of the legislation.  Women have given birth in some pretty peculiar circumstances in the past and very little was said about it so, regardless, it was something that we took in our stride.  It was a classic case of ignoring the obvious, moving on and pretending that it did not happen.  We, as a society, have a lot to answer for and we should not pretend to suddenly discover our consciences.  I wish to emphasise that this is not a tilt at the people opposite; it is a tilt at the people who produced and drafted the so-called amendments because they were clearly intent on portraying everybody else in the House who does not agree with the agenda, and the sentiments of those who drafted the amendments, as being blood-curdling, heartless, cold and callous.  The irony of the issues that we have discussed for the past two and half hours has not gone unnoticed by some of us who have been around before, and I am sure that it has not gone unnoticed by those who are here now.  It would be wrong of that time to pass without drawing attention to the fact that some of us were around before and carefully listened to the debate.   Those issues that were not discussed or dealt with previously and were pushed under the carpet are still with us.  We are still reaping the whirlwind of those today.  I do not wish to lecture anybody on the committee but I do not wish to be lectured to either.</p></speech>

It is easy for political opponents to misrepresent him as we would expect some of that to happen.  The intent behind our amendments is clear.  It is to address the extreme nature of this Bill, to protect women, and treat with respect and give some dignity to unborn babies who have had their lives ended, or are likely to have their lives ended, under the new law.  For example, I cannot say it often enough that the specific amendment on the disposal and treatment of foetal remains clearly refers to surgical abortions-----</p></speech>

I resent the claim made by Deputy Durkan that we must have been given the amendment by someone.  Thankfully, we are free thinkers.  As Independents, we do not have to accept the diktat from the Minister, his officials and the public relations or PR people in parties.  I was a member of a party all of my life so I know all about them.  Ten members sat down in my office and worked hard to draft these amendments.  We got legal and medical advice and all of other advice that was available to us at our own expense.  We asked for a meeting with the Minister before we tabled our amendments.  Deputy Fitzpatrick approached hin and I wrote to the Minister on behalf of ten members, including myself.  The Chairman will be aware that the meeting took place.  We did not even get a response and now we have been accused of tabling amendments that are ill-thought out or ill-judged and were fed to us by somebody.  My colleagues and I worked hard on drafting our amendments.  We discussed them back and forth, made several phone calls and made amendments and changes.  We did not submit them lightly or do it for fun as has been suggested.  We are not cannon fodder for any political machine either.  We represent the people and are entitled to table amendments.</p></speech>

We wanted to meet the Minister to engage with him before we drafted our amendments to see if we had some common ground.  We begged and pleaded with him to meet us.

I said this is a choice for pregnant women in terms of the manner of and dignity for the disposal of the bodily remains of the foetus.  This is to do with a surgical procedure.  I put it to the Minister that we are not dealing with an early pregnancy.  We are referring to the bodily remains after later surgical abortions.</p> <p>  Reference was also made to Terminations for Medical Reasons Ireland, which was clear that it was arguing for the respectful treatment of remains.  That is exactly what this amendment proposes to do.  It does not require women to have a funeral.  We aim to put an obligation on the hospital to bury or cremate the remains with dignity.  The women do not have to get involved unless they want to.  I wish to make it clear.  If the intention is to limit this measure to surgical abortions, will the Minister consider this amendment?</p></speech>

I appreciate the fact Deputy Fitzpatrick acknowledges that the amendment currently goes further than his intention.  Currently, it includes the full ambit.  The Deputy is saying that he would narrow it to surgical terminations.  I appreciate that he is trying to change that.  I make the point, however, that in our hospitals, we already have procedures to deal with stillbirths and miscarriages.  How would this be any different?  The hospitals would still have procedures to deal with these sensitively.</p> <p>  I am worried about the phrase "The women do not have to get involved unless they want to".  This sounds like a throwback to the very worst parts of this country's history where we had all sorts of burial situations.  I am not suggesting that is the Deputies' intention-----</p></speech>

My honest answer is that I do not believe any variation of the amendment is needed.  That is my truthful answer.</p> <p>  As it has been put on the record of the committee, when I met with the Opposition spokespeople on health I invited a representative of the Rural Independent Group in addition to Deputy Harty in his role as the Chairman of this committee.  Deputy Mattie McGrath was unable to make that meeting and he sent an assistant.  Deputy McGrath is not present but I can also say this when he returns.  The only meetings I had in that regard, and the Chairman was there, included representatives of all of the groupings in the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

I am conscious that despite the Minister's comprehensive understanding of this topic, as it has been put, it is not clear in the amendment that it refers to surgical termination.  Deputy O'Brien's suggestion is quite a good one.  In its current state, I read it to mean that it could have consequences for a woman having a late period, which is often an early miscarriage.  If a woman is a couple of days late in her period and she has a heavy bleed the product of that situation would be subject to this proposed amendment.  That is unacceptable.  That is the mildest word I can probably choose.  Often in this type of miscarriage situation, it is a much wanted child.  Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that women may not want to be involved.  People before they miscarry are expecting a baby.  As the Minister has so rightly put it, there is a grieving process for those of us who have had miscarriages.  We expected a baby and we grieved a baby, although those babies were only 13 or seven weeks.  As a woman who has been in this situation, I find the suggestion offensive.  I do not want to inform anybody about what I have done with my foetal remains.  I do not want to inform the Minister and I do not want it in the legislation.  I most certainly do not want people in this House prescribing what I should do with my used maternity pads, my soiled bed sheets and my bath sheets.  I want no interference from you guys, and the one lady, in my dignity and in my care.</p></speech>

It is not in any way clear that it applies to surgical abortion.  For the avoidance of any doubt, it is offensive.  It is offensive to any woman who has had a miscarriage and I believe it is intentionally so.  The Deputies who have put the amendment forward should reflect on that and have one of the many conversations they allege to have had with all these people.  Perhaps they should reflect on the result of the amendment and the hurt they have caused, which I believe was intentional.</p></speech>

In respect of the amendments that have been tabled, I would like to believe that the Deputies here are acting in good faith.  That is my assumption going in, but I do not believe that those who tabled at least some of the amendments we have been talking about for the past two hours or so are acting in good faith.  We have a series of amendments which have the kernel of a soundbite or of something good in them.  Protecting babies is good, as are pain relief, diagnostics and dignified disposal.  All of these things are good but I put it to those Deputies that they are clever enough and experienced enough to know that the amendments they have put forward are unworkable.  Protection of foetuses is, as the Minister said, covered but the amendment the Deputies have tabled would leave us in a situation in which non-viable foetuses would have the same protection.  Pain relief sounds like a good thing, but in legislation we do not get into deciding when doctors administer it for any operation, as the Minister has laid out.  Of course the Deputies tabling the amendments know this.  They know that no Legislature would ever pass a provision forcing every pregnant woman to have an ultrasound scan.  Disposal of remains, if and when appropriate, and when the mother or parents wish is of course a good thing, but it is not a good thing in every circumstance.  I understand that I must move to the section.  What we have seen over the past two hours or so is at least some of the Deputies involved tabling amendments which they know are unworkable and which they know-----</p></speech>

Section 10(1) refers to a risk to life or health and section 12(1) refers to fatal foetal abnormalities.  Is there a reason this has not also been applied to section 13, which refers to early pregnancy?  If a woman presents at a GP and her GP decides, for whatever reason, that he or she is not going to certify, the Bill does not state that the GP must inform the pregnant woman of her right of appeal in that case.  It is just a question of clarity.  Why is section 13 omitted?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.1767" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110700002#EEE02400"><p>That is a good question.  We did think about this.  The difference between sections 10 and 12 as a group and section 13 is that section 13 does not involve a specific indication.  The woman, therefore, does not have to give a reason to a doctor.  If the Deputy looks to the review, he will see that it involves looking at the medical case history to decide whether the woman had an entitlement.  This is very much a review of the medical opinion, whereas the doctor under section 13 is not giving a medical opinion.  Once the doctor is happy that the woman fits the 12-week window, she not have to give any further specific indication.</p></speech>

He or she is certifying that the pregnancy has lasted less than 12 weeks.  Would that not also be a-----</p></speech>

This section is very much about reviewing the health grounds.  Different doctors could have different medical opinions about serious harm.  That is what this provision is aimed at.  Because section 13 does not involve a specific indication and because there will be a 24-7 phoneline and the like, women will be able to be directed to others. Other people will be available to give second opinions through the provision of the service whereas in this situation one might have seen an obstetrician who has decided, in his or her medical opinion, that one does not qualify for termination.  In that case, one might wish to have another obstetrician look at the case, if the Deputy gets my point.  They are different.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister.  My second question relates to the timing of telling women.  Section 14(1)(<i>b</i>) says that &quot;he or she shall inform the pregnant woman in writing that an application may be made ... to review the relevant decision&quot;.  A doctor may consult with a woman, examine her, and certify that he or she does not believe that the pregnancy poses a risk to her life or a serious risk to her health.  My understanding is that the doctor would then have to write to the woman, as the section states, &quot;inform the pregnant woman in writing&quot;, to tell her that she may apply for a review.  Would it be better to tighten that up in terms of timing because all of this is time sensitive?  In most of the other areas we have given timelines of three, five or seven days.  Would it be worth adding such a timeline to this?  I was thinking that the woman should be informed at the time of refusal that she has the right to appeal.</p></speech>

It is the situation that the treating physician or clinician would provide the opinion there and then.  The Deputy is correct when he refers to writing to the woman, but that does not mean writing to the woman through the postal service.  It happens instantly in a sense but the Deputy is arguing that we should put a timeline in.</p></speech>

Section 17(1) states: &quot;The review committee shall complete its review of a relevant decision as soon as may be but, in any event, not later than 7 days from the date on which the review committee was established and convened&quot;.  That is too long.  If it was from the point when the woman, or someone acting on her behalf, writes a letter and looks for a review, then it may be fine.  As I read it, the review committee would actually have met, presumably with the appropriate files.  I would be open to the amendment that proposes three days but I have opted for five days.  The period of seven days, given that this is obviously time-sensitive, seems too long.  My proposal is that we move from seven days to five days.</p></speech>

I will go through my note.  This is taking the review committee model that has been used in respect of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  I wish to point out that it has worked well.  Under the provisions of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, we are dealing with life rather than with the expanded terms in this case, which include serious harm.  It is foremost in my mind that the formal review process needs to happen in a speedy manner to safeguard the life or health of the pregnant woman and to ensure that she or her family are not subjected to prolonged suffering.  However, there is a practical consideration for the review to be conducted properly.  The review process requires several steps.  The HSE, as the convenor of the process needs to take those steps.  The application for the review process needs to be assessed to ascertain the nature of the request, whether it concerns a certification under section 10 or section 12, the identification of the relevant medical practitioners, the making of logistical arrangements in respect of the convening of these medical practitioners, their duty to examine the woman, the woman's right to be heard or for someone on her behalf to address the review committee.  Reasonable timeframes need to be provided for in the Bill to strike that balance.  I get the point that Deputy Donnelly makes and he appreciates that there has to be a period.  The question is whether it should be five or seven days.</p> <p>  I am satisfied, based on the operation of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, that seven days is appropriate and that it has not caused any difficulty.  I wish to point out that this is the upper limit.  It is not that it cannot be completed in less than seven days.  Depending on the clinical scenario at hand the review process can and often does take place far more efficiently.  I realise I am stating the obvious somewhat but if the woman's medical condition were to deteriorate in any way then there are other provisions in the legislation, including the emergency provisions in section 11.</p></speech>

We have tabled an amendment with a period of three days.  There is a point to this and I spoke about it earlier.  It is a question of timing.  When a woman is in a crisis pregnancy, timing matters a great deal.  I know the Minister is talking about the operation of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, but that relates to a far narrower and more restrictive cohort of woman who may be seeking abortions.  That is not a good ground on which to base the provision.  We will now be able to offer to many more women in crisis pregnancies the ability to have a termination at home.  This is putting a burden on them.  We must try at all costs to avoid a time-limit burden.  This is not a serious attempt to avoid that in providing for a period of seven days.  As the previous speaker said, the upper limit could become ten days.  It is too much.</p></speech>

Earlier, Deputy Donnelly asked me why not.  It does not relate to section 13.  It relates to sections 10 and 12.  At issue is risk to life or risk of serious harm to health.</p> <p>  In one way I would almost argue the converse.  We are broadening the terms and the number of women who may seek reviews.  Therefore the seven-day period is even more appropriate than it was in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.</p> <p>  One benefit of having had the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act in operation for several years is that we can test some of the claims people made about what would happen as a consequence at the time to see whether they arose.  We get annual reports and notifications.  This has not posed any difficulty.  It is very much the upper limit.  These review committees can be convened far quicker.  It is simply the case that we have to provide for an upper limit and seven days seemed appropriate.  Obviously, it is not seven weekdays, it is seven days inclusive of weekends and so on.</p></speech>

I am not sure it is wise to simply transplant something from an old Act that was brought in with a certain criminalising hue.</p> <p>  Let us suppose a woman believes her health is endangered by not being able to have an abortion, but two doctors disagree.  The woman can review it but she might have to wait for seven days for a panel to be convened.</p></speech>

Many people had to go to a hospital in Dublin to try to access an abortion.</p> <p>  One can get a second opinion on anything.  Presumably if I felt my health was at risk and a doctor disagreed, I could get another opinion.  Would I have to go through an entire review process?</p></speech>

Given that there are wider parameters under this legislation versus the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, that opens up more opportunities to engage with more physicians because one has gone beyond a risk to one's life into a risk of serious harm to one's health.  Of course, a woman does not have to go through the formal review process.</p></speech>

The differentiation the Deputy has made is important.  This is where a woman or her family has decided they want to review the decision of the doctors.  It does not prevent a woman accessing a termination through other clinicians in the interim, nor does it prevent anybody using the emergency provisions in the legislation either.  It is not as drastic a situation as it sounds, by any manner or means.  It is one that has worked pretty well.  There are elements of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act that the Deputy or I would not like or approve of but it was drafted to comply with the eighth amendment.  There are, however, elements of the structures that work quite well from an administrative point of view and this is one.</p></speech>

There is a piece of work that the woman would wish to do in terms of going before the review panel or sending a representative as well.  It is the logistical piece of getting all the relevant people one needs, including specialists in the area to review the work of their peers.  That is the reason seven days was seen as a reasonable period of time.</p></speech>

This amendment may not be perfect and may need changes, to which I am open.  It comes from parents discussing with me their worries that a minor would proceed with an abortion without their knowledge in advance.  Any parent would like to be there for his or her child and to help the child in the decision-making process.  Any case where a minor is pregnant is a serious crisis.  This amendment seeks to align parental desire to support, advise or help the child with the needs of a child to make such a momentous, life-changing decision that will always be with her.  The Bill deals with different levels of emergency of which the amendment seeks to take cognisance.  Where it is the case under section 10 that certification or notification is not practicable before a termination is carried out, it will be done afterwards.  One cannot hold back emergency treatment for a process such as this.  That is the objective of the amendment.</p></speech>

I understand what he is trying to achieve and accept his bona fides.  I do not believe the amendments are necessary because the issue of parental notification is dealt with in the HSE's guide to consent for young people.  Section 22, on consent, does not make any special provisions for any particular group.  I do not intend for this to change.  I am trying to keep the principle of medical consent the same and consistent as it is across HSE services.  Issues relating to consent arise across medical practice and are not limited to this particular issue.  Such issues equally arise with contraception, gender realignment, cosmetic surgery and all other areas of medicine and healthcare which affect adolescents.  This being the case, if they are to be examined, I believe these issues are of a sufficiently serious nature to warrant examination on their own merits and not to be relegated to a single clause in this legislation.  I am genuinely satisfied with regard to consistency that the issue of consent is established and understood and will be the same for this service as it is for other health services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.1888" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1441" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110700002#KKK00500"><p>I will speak about amendment No. 145 on parental notification.  I want to emphasise that a minor is a woman who has not attained the age of 16.  The amendment introduces an additional requirement for a lawful termination of pregnancy under sections 10, 12 and 13 where it involves a pregnant minor under the age of 16.  In such cases, it would be necessary for a parent of the minor to be provided with a copy of the certification made under these sections before the termination of pregnancy.  This requirement will not apply to termination carried out for emergencies.  The Minister is required to make regulations on how services on a patient should be carried out and consequently recorded.  Provision is made for the High Court to dispense with the parental notification requirement if satisfied that it is not in the minor's best interest to do so.  This amendment does not make any changes to the existing law governing the giving of consent by or on behalf of the minor for surgical or medical treatment.  It relates solely to a requirement to notify a parent of a minor under the age of 16 years about any certification of a termination of a pregnancy for that minor prior to that termination being carried out.</p><p>When a girl under the age of 16 becomes pregnant, there are many good and obvious reasons her parents or guardian should be notified of any intended abortion.  Minors often lack the ability to make fully informed choices that take into account both immediate and long-term consequences.  The medical, emotional and physiological consequences of abortion are sometimes serious and can be lasting, particularly when the patient is immature.  Parents are best placed to advise of these circumstances as they will know if their child has a mental health issue, of which the doctors approached for a termination may not be aware.  Parents possess information essential for the efficient exercise of best medical judgment concerning the child.  Parents who are aware that a daughter who is a minor has had an abortion can ensure that she has adequate medical attention after the abortion.</p><p>The requirement for parental notification protects the constitutional rights of the family and the parent.  Article 41.1.1&deg; of the Constitution states:</p><blockquote>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</blockquote> <p>Article 41.1.2&deg; states:</p><blockquote>The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</blockquote> <p>According to the World Health Organization, WHO, Germany, Finland and Spain were among 21 countries in the WHO European vision to respond to a 2016 survey to confirm that legal access to abortion was not available to minors under 18 without parental consent.  In the USA, 40 state parental involvement laws are in effect, with 26 states requiring parental consent for minors seeking abortions and ten states requiring parental notice for minors seeking abortions.  The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 in section 23(1) states:</p><blockquote>The consent of a minor who has attained the age of 16 years to any surgical, medical or dental treatment which, in the absence of consent, would constitute a trespass to his or her person, shall be as effective as it would be if he or she were of full age; and where a minor has by virtue of this section given an effective consent to any treatment it shall not be necessary to obtain any consent for it from his or her parent or guardian.</blockquote><p>This amendment recognises that parents should be involved in any decisions that have far-reaching consequences for their children.  It shows that the doctors involved respect that the Constitution and international best practice emphasise that decision.  This is not about parental consent.  It is about notification.  There is a minor difference.</p></speech>

I am sure that will be the case for the majority.  However, I am opposed to the wording of this amendment because it states that a termination of pregnancy may only be carried out where the parent has been informed.  Technically speaking, as the law stands, a minor who is pregnant is a rape victim.  What if the parent is the rapist?  That is not unusual.  Most sexual abuse occurs within the immediate or broad family unit.  I do not think somebody could be prevented from having an abortion for that reason.  She would need her parents' consent, the rapist's consent.  This would impinge on the human rights of somebody who is younger than 16.  There are laws covering someone under age accessing health treatment and we should stick with them.</p> <p>  The chances are that many of the young people, to judge by the evidence the committee heard, may be in direct provision or be like that poor migrant rape victim who was put through torture in this country a couple of years ago.  They may not have freedom of movement and to say that they would have to have their parents' consent would be a real problem because there are people in many situations who will not be in a position where their parents can be notified.</p> <p>  I also object to the language.  The certificate will be "served" on the parent.  That is a legalistic term such as serving a summons.  I am not saying people do not have concerns but this is playing on the idea that there cannot be any kind of breach of the family, but unfortunately we live in a society where these situations do occur and it may not always be possible for somebody to have their parents' support, sad as that is.  We should not infringe some young woman's right, such as the 14 year old rape victim who became known as Miss X.  That was nothing to do with her parents.  I am not suggesting that, but if it had been, we would have been putting an immediate stipulation into law that we should not do.  I oppose this.</p></speech>

Most parents watching this would hope that this issue would be brought to their attention before the child proceeded to take such a step.  This is not consent and consent exists in the law on this all around Europe and in other places.  Other countries have a far higher standard with regard to parental involvement in this than we are asking for.  Notification is not necessarily going to prohibit the situation.</p> <p>  If it is the case that a parent has been involved in any way in the child's pregnancy an interested party can make a High Court application and, in that case, in the best interests of the minor concerned, an order can be made for dispensing with the requirement for this process.  There is space within this amendment to allow for that case.  While I understand that the Deputy might want changes to the amendment, if we could come to an agreement at this committee that parental notification, even with some of the concerns that have been expressed, would be a useful addition, that would be helpful.</p></speech>

As the previous speaker indicated, however, there are some difficulties that could arise.  For example, what would happen if the pregnant girl had a condition that was a serious threat to her health and a delay of two or three hours might be the difference between life and death, which is quite common?  What about the cases where the parents are not contactable?  They may not be in the jurisdiction.  How do we manage that?  Is nothing done or is the child made a ward of court?  That would also involve a delay which would have implications for the health and life of the patient in certain circumstances.  What would be the situation if the pregnancy were the result of in-family abuse?  There is no use saying that does not happen because it does and has happened many times in the past and over a long period.  I have been involved in cases where this situation arose, and even when the parents were present and available, it was difficult to resolve the situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.1893" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1434" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110700002#LLL00500"><p>This is quite dangerous.  Maybe there is not sufficient understanding of someone living in an abusive and violent situation.  The Deputy says notification does not mean consent.  To notify an abusive parent about their daughter potentially having an abortion would put that girl in danger.  That is the reality.  These are not imaginary or rare situations.  This week we saw a case reported from the courts of a girl who had been raped over a long time by her father and, unfortunately, it seems, with the knowledge of the mother who backed the father.  They have no right not just to prevent but to put any kind of pressure on that girl.</p> <p>  In Britain there was talk of a law stating that a woman would have to notify her husband about welfare situations, not realising that if a woman is leaving a violent situation, any such notification or communication can put her in danger.  I seriously ask the Deputy to withdraw this amendment.  In most cases people will be going with the consent and knowledge of their parents, but there will be rare cases where they would be put in a very dangerous situation by notifying the parents.</p></speech>

The child in that situation could be represented by the HSE in the High Court.  We are talking about children younger than 16 years.  I think it would be heartbreaking for most parents to find afterwards that a child had proceeded with an abortion and they had not had a chance to talk to or support the child in that situation.  Deputy Durkan mentioned the threat to life.  He will see that is dealt with very clearly, if he reads the amendment.</p><p>With threats to life or serious risk to health, a notification can be provided after the abortion has happened.  That situation is dealt with.  The international standard in many cases is consent.  This is lower than that.  Deputy Coppinger is right that there may be a situation that still needs to be provided for in this amendment to ensure that no child suffers any further, but the basic understanding that parental notification for an under 16 year old having an abortion is important.</p><p> In addition, while people on the pro-choice side feel that this is access to healthcare, we on the other side feel that a human life is involved in this as well.  We are entering a new legal realm.  The unborn child had a constitutional right to life a few months ago but now we are entering a space where that is not the case.  It is a brave new world in many ways for many people.  However, it is not the same as the prior parental notification that exists.  It is more serious than that.  I ask the Minister to consider it.  We have tabled amendments that have been batted out of the room with fierce force.  Other members have seen some level of effort to move towards their amendments, although perhaps not agreement.  If the Minister would accept some level of this amendment, I will withdraw it and submit something afterwards that is more suitable for everybody else.</p></speech>

The issue of parental notification is dealt with in the HSE's guide to consent for young people.  I have given examples of other areas of the health service that could affect adolescence, such as contraception and gender realignment.  The right place to deal with this is not by putting a special section or clause into this legislation but through the HSE's guide to consent.  We should not make special provision for a particular group around the issue of consent.  That is my position and it is likely to remain my position on Report Stage.  Perhaps it might be useful between now and Report Stage to consider the HSE's guide to consent for young people and what it says regarding parental notification and then resubmit a version of the amendment.  However, I must be clear about my view that the legislation is not necessarily the place to do this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.1899" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1280" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110700002#MMM00500"><p>One of the reasons the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution was dealing with this issue was the abortion pill.  Subsection (4) of amendment No. 145 deals with early pregnancies under 12 weeks.  Obviously I cannot imagine what it is like to be a frightened 14 or 15 year old girl who may be pregnant as a result of rape or incest, but if I were, the last thing I would do is go to a doctor to seek an abortion knowing that the person who was probably responsible for raping or abusing me is going to be notified.  The first thing I would probably do is go online and obtain an abortion pill illegally and take it in somebody's house.  One of the reasons we have this legislation is to get away from such unsafe practices.</p> <p>  There are unintended consequences to every amendment, good, bad or indifferent, and we must think all of them through.  I am not saying there is anything bad behind tabling this amendment as it is probably coming from a genuine point of view, but the Deputy must recognise that there are unintended consequences.  One of the unintended consequences could be a very frightened 14 or 15 year old girl who has been raped by her father or a close family member such as a brother or uncle being afraid to go to a doctor to get appropriate medical healthcare and ending up doing something whose illegality is being dealt in this Bill but which is still unsafe.  We are trying to move from unsafe practice to a safe regime.  That is an unintended consequence the Deputy must reflect on before Report Stage as well.</p></speech>

This would place the medical profession in a difficult situation as well in certain circumstances.  I cannot see the basis on which authorisation or permission can be sought from a parent who could be culpable or where a family member could be culpable and who would obviously take a particular view, thereby forcing the minor to go abroad.  That is what the legislation is trying to address.  It would be a useless exercise if the abortion could take place because there was an immediate threat to the life or health of the pregnant girl and the permission could be sought afterwards.  I am not sure that has any validity other than to aggravate and create the basis for a court case that could continue for a considerable amount of time.  From my experience of dealing with cases of this nature, the experience of a protracted court case where a minor is concerned, particularly with regard to sexual abuse, is not a good or nice place for the minor to be, because the minor is part of the discussion but unable to do anything about it as the case is taken by the somebody else or the State.  The amendment is not legally sound.  It is seeking to provide for parental authority but the parental authority might not be available or it might be prejudiced, depending on the circumstances.</p></speech>

It could be in the interest of a predator of a young girl that there is no parental notification.  Abuse happens across society, not just in family units.  If there is no parental notification, it would mean, in effect, that the predator of that child could get away with it.  It is not all one way.</p></speech>

The Deputy's point is serious and I accept it.  It is more an argument about where this provision belongs.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien put it well.  If we make the legislation overprescriptive rather than allowing a system that works quite well already with regard to consents and notifications to continue, we run the risk of young teenage girls accessing pills through the Internet without any medical supervision, which is definitely a situation no parent would want for his or her daughter.  We all share the aim of ensuring young vulnerable children are protected from abuse.  It is a question of the modality by which we do it.  We should not do it in primary legislation and this Bill is primary legislation.</p></speech>

We are trying to legislate for abortion here and we cannot conflate the two.  Although it is a very worrying development, it is not related to this.</p><p>Before I leave, I want to make the point that given the enthusiasm with which this has been argued and the determination of the movers of the amendment to protect and support young people in the best way they can, I look forward to their full endorsement of the ancillary measures from the Citizens' Assembly, which include free, non-ethos based sex education in all our schools and free contraceptives to be provided to women of all ages who need them.  I am sure they will endorse those measures fully.</p></speech>

I would be worried about the long and short-term consequences for her.  As I said earlier, if the girl is immature she cannot make her own decisions.  She is going to be very emotional and she is going to need a lot of medical attention.  I feel as though the best place for her would be with her parents.  I have two girls myself and I would not like for anything to happen but the Internet has to take a big responsibility and these people looking at films and everything else.  I know when I was 16 I was very immature myself.  The way everything has gone we are all so advanced: talking to young people nowadays, it is amazing what things they know and do not know.  At the end of the day, they are only minors, only children.  I do realise that there are different circumstances to be provided for here and there but I think at the end of the day, no matter what happens, when a minor has an abortion they do need medical care and they need their parents there for a bit of support afterwards.</p></speech>

The Deputy is entitled to his opinion, although he is not entitled to alternative facts.  The question was asked with regard to cases where the parent is in fact the rapist and how the proposed provisions would work.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is signalling that he has some answers and that is fine.  My understanding is that this amendment is unnecessary purely because structures are already in place.  It is not fair to ask our Chairman constantly to double-job but we do have a medical practitioner in our midst who might be able to confirm for us and I think it might be helpful in respect of this amendment.  I am not suggesting for a moment that it is not well intentioned but I think it is unnecessary.  I suspect that it was put in to aid a talking point or bring us down a particular conversational road.  Maybe the Chairman could clarify whether this is necessary, and I do apologise for putting him on the spot.  My read of it is that it is not necessary and that sufficient checks and balances are in place.  Perhaps Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n will be able to explain to us how the proposed provisions would work in a case where the rapist is a parent or close relative.</p></speech>

The truth of the matter is yes, if a girl is pregnant before she is 16, it is statutory rape, and that is a very serious issue.  However, there are pregnancies every year that happen between two minors, for example.  In those situations it would be logical that most parents would wish that they had a notification prior to an abortion taking place.  We are not plucking this from the air.  This is an international norm.  More so, the standard is higher internationally than what we are asking for.  The standard is actually consent from the parents.  We are just asking that the parent would know and that in those cases where there are extreme difficulties that we would resolve those as well.  Maybe if the committee could just answer.  The reason I would like the provision to go into this Bill is that internationally, abortion is considered different.  This is obviously a bone of contention that we are not going to agree on and I know that.  But it is different and that is why, internationally, notifications and consent are in the abortion laws also.</p></speech>

If that responsible person was a parent or a close relative, then that information would be passed on to the authorities.  If it was not a relative, obviously, one would then inform the parents.  I imagine that would be the natural flow of information.</p></speech>

They clearly outline what one should do as a doctor in respect of the issue of consent for a minor.  They also indicate what to do if the doctor gets a sense that the minor is not in a position to involve her parents or guardian for some of the reasons we have discussed today.</p></speech>

We are on the wrong side of the clarity.  That is the problem.</p></speech>

To be helpful, I have said to colleagues - I may disagree with a few of those colleagues on Report Stage - that there are some things the colleagues I am looking at here want in legislation and the advice to me is it is best to have clinical guidance.  We will thrash that out.  This is similarly an example.  I have been quite consistent in my approach throughout the debate that when it comes to clinical decisions and what a clinician should do, the guide they use in terms of how to decide about consent, notification, appropriate things to do and ethical behaviour is the Medical Council guidelines.  The Medical Council is the regulator and the body that can strike a doctor off for not complying with it, which is something I cannot do.  I am not trying to short-circuit the debate but I get the sense we are going around the houses on this matter.  I get what Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and colleagues are trying to do.  I differ from them in terms of where we should do it.  Some colleagues have expressed a view on how to deal with particularly difficult situations and perhaps people can reflect on that now.  There is already a law on that.</p></speech>

I have been sitting here listening to all of this for the past four or five hours and I have spoken very little.  I think I am entitled to speak as somebody who might be affected by these situations.  What I was asking the Deputy about when he spoke was there is no point in people in particular elected Deputies just talking about their own situations such as the fact he or she has eight children or is married.  What point is there in that?  We can all use examples but there is no point in reverting to happy families.  We are talking about when it is not a situation of happy families.  The reason I am saying it would be dangerous is it is making it compulsory to find and tell the parent.  It is not putting in consent.  In reality, it could be a real problem for the person.  Every parent would like to know.  I would like to know if my daughter went to the doctor.  Hopefully we have built up such a relationship with our children that they can tell us.  I do not think I would have a right to stop her.  She is the person affected by it, not me.  Sometimes we also have to step back as parents.  We do not own other people's lives.  That is why I reacted to what the Deputy said.  He would not deal with the issue of the rapist being the father which is not unusual and could arise.</p></speech>

The Executive shall, for the purpose of monitoring and evaluation, keep records of terminations of pregnancy carried out in accordance with sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 and publish an annual statistical report with respect to the incidence of and trends in relation to abortion.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>The purpose of this amendment is straightforward.  It concerns the collection of data.  Termination of pregnancy will be a new service and the proposal is that we should collect data and records that are similar to the health in-patient enquiry, HIPE, data.  We should record the data while protecting the anonymity of patients, but we need to do more.  I am open to correction but I understand that what is currently recorded is the registration number of the doctor and the age of the woman.  We need to record proper data that can be used to inform any change of policy. </p><p>We had this conversation when we were discussing this matter in the D&aacute;il, and there did not seem to be any objection to the collection of data.  We will not be able to inform policy for the future if we do not start off by collecting meaningful data, like the HIPE data, that would encompass proper information to give an indication of where terminations are happening and where there might be a particular issue.  To inform the development of health policy, we need to take an evidence-based approach.  Doctors always say they cannot do anything that is not evidence based but the proposal as it stands does not provide for sufficient evidence for the development of proposals and policies in the future.  In the development of public health and public health policy, we should record meaningful data.  I am not sure that is being provided for, which is why we propose this amendment.</p></speech>

The section, as currently constituted, refers to the information that is sent to the Minister for Health of the day as opposed to information that would be held in hospitals on HIPE systems, as the Deputy rightly points out.  I cannot think of another area where a Minister of the day would receive such a level of notification, which is perhaps a matter for a different debate.  The Minister of the day will receive notification of the Medical Council registration number attached to the registration of the medical practitioner.  He or she will also get some details about the woman, such as the date on which the termination is carried out and the woman's county of residence, which do not threaten her anonymity.</p> <p>  The Minister will be obliged by law to lay a report not later than 30 June before the Houses of the Oireachtas, as is done with the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act, but this amendment possibly would not do that.  I will also receive the HSE report every year on the reviews and how they are working.  There is also nothing to prevent the Minister of the day, or anybody else in the Oireachtas such as members of the health committee, seeking more information from the HSE, nor to prevent the HSE publishing a report anyway.  I genuinely believe we have and will have all the data we need through the hospitals, the national women and infants health programme, the notification system to me and the reviews submitted to the HSE.  The Deputy's sensible question is whether that can all be pulled together and collated.  I do not see any difficulty with that and I imagine it is what will logically happen.</p></speech>

Some hospitals record the number of times a theatre is used while others do not.  Some record the number of procedures while others do not.  As this will be a new service, the amendment is to ensure the data are collected consistently and used to inform public health policy.</p><p>That is not the fault of any one person because the people at local level collect the data the way it is collected at local level but in many instances, it is not possible to observe a trend.  The intention is to bring some consistency to the way the data is recorded and to enhance the data being recorded in order that it can be used to inform public health policy.</p></speech>

We are all planning on publishing an annual report anyway.  Under this legislation, I was planning on laying a report before the Oireachtas by 30 June every year.  In respecting of my working with the Deputy and others to see if there are more useful things we should do, we are trying to make sure we protect the identity and data and do not get into too much detail.

My concern is that there is no uniformity in the context of the collection of data right across the HSE.  This is no way the fault of any one individual.

The Deputy can already table a parliamentary question today or I can produce a report on how many people in County Donegal have a medical card compared to last year.  That data can be pulled very quickly.  How many PCRS claims for termination services were submitted by doctors in County Donegal and how does this compare with the previous year?  I will have to look at the hospital situation but I have no difficulty with what the Deputy is trying to do.  I think it is sensible.  Can I think about how best to do it?</p></speech>

The proposal on the report sounds eminently sensible and I am sure something can be worked out on an annual report but I would like to speak to the other part of the amendment, which is to delete the existing section.  I find this section bizarre; it is really weird.  I hope I am misunderstanding it.  I have an additional frustration because it is word for word what was in the heads of Bill and, therefore, following the principle that we have been following the whole time, I will not be voting for its deletion.  When I read this, however, I was very confused.  What it seems to state is that where a termination of pregnancy is carried out, the medical practitioner shall keep a record in the prescribed form and, within a month, forward to the Minister that record.  That any sitting member of Cabinet would have GPs, obstetricians and psychiatrists all over the country sending him or her individual records of terminations, or any medical procedure, seems very odd.  Perhaps I am wrong.  It strikes me as bizarre in the extreme.</p> <p>  Can I ask the Minister a few questions in order to obtain clarity?  First, am I right in thinking that if we pass this as it stands, any GP, obstetrician or appropriate medical practitioner, which could be a cardiologist, psychiatrist or whoever is appropriate to the case, will send the Minister and his successors individual records relating to terminations?  That is what it seems to state.  I hope I am reading it incorrectly.  The second question is whether the Minister receives emails from doctors regarding other medical procedures and informed him of what is happening in their surgeries?  If I am reading it correctly and if there is no other law, what is the rationale for it being here?  Is it not already the case that in any situation, regardless of whether it involves a GP, a psychiatrist, an obstetrician or a gynaecologist, the individual would always keep medical cards of these events and would such recording not fit within normal medical guidelines for how doctors write up cases?  In terms of the statistical requirements and in order that we know how things are going, the amendment seems to propose something quite reasonable.  These are my questions on this section.</p></speech>

They will not contain the name of the doctor, just the medical registration number, and there will be no mention of the name of the woman.  They are providing such information today in line with the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  It was a view at the time in the Oireachtas that this would help in the context of monitoring, overseeing, information and collecting data.  I have a slight technical point to make.  It is highly unlikely that anybody other than an obstetrician or a GP will send this information because the obstetrician will be carrying out the procedure or the GP will be administering the medication.  That is only a small point.</p> <p>  Do I get other reports?  I do not get a huge number.  Sometimes they relate to mental health services or drug-licensing applications but they are far from the norm.  What such reports do is provide the Minister of the day and the Department with information they can then collate and put before the Oireachtas, which is what we currently do on an annual basis each summer in the context of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.  That turned out to be very useful from a policy development point of view because the Deputy will remember that, back then, there was the argument, which we will not go back over, that hundreds would happen on mental health grounds and there were even some disgusting comments about women faking being suicidal - all this awful stuff.  The good thing about having statistics and data is that we can actually show every year what the number is and the hospitals where it took place.  It has helped to inform policy development and reassure legislators that what they are trying to do is what is happening.</p></speech>

I get the point the Deputy is making.  The end point I want to get to is that we can produce an annual report and lay it before the Oireachtas.  If one looks at the UK Department of Health and Social Care's website, as many of us did during the referendum campaign, one will see the amount of data that is collected and sent to the Department in the UK.  While I am not suggesting we should mirror what they do, it is far more than the data here.  For example, they collect the age of the woman, the marital status of the woman, whether the woman has other children and, of course, that is how we all got the data for how many women from each county in Ireland had travelled.  All of that is up there, so they collect an awful lot more than we do.  I have no difficulty with this.  If the question is around the modality of how we get the information and put it before the Oireachtas or in the public domain, I am happy to consider that.</p></speech>

For example, if termination of an early pregnancy is carried out in a general practice and a GP is claiming payment for the service, he or she would automatically make a claim which could capture much of the data to which Deputy O'Reilly refers.  It would then go to the PCRS within the HSE, which would then have the capacity to generate the report.</p></speech>

The Bill includes the line that a termination of pregnancy is the "ending of the life of a foetus".  That is really significant and I do not think anyone will disagree with it.</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned Britain.  I have a copy here of the form used in Britain.  To a certain extent, it is not an onerous task to complete that form.  However, what that form does is collect information that allows people to understand how the system being created is functioning.  As much light as possible should be shone on that system in order that people to understand exactly what is happening.</p> <p>  Deputy Donnelly mentioned the collection of information from the HSE.  He will know as well as I do that it is very difficult to get information from the HSE; in fact, it is virtually impossible and, in particular, impossible to get information with the breakdown or categorisation that is needed.  We have put forward amendment No. 141, which literally replicates international best practice on this in a form that would give optimum information to the Minister.  Information is collected under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 but, as many have said, it falls short of the optimum data required to provide the best healthcare to people.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.2015" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1441" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2018110700002#RRR03500"><p>Believe it or not, I have great respect for everybody here.  Amendment No. 141 is a very clear and straightforward amendment.  It specifies a number of matters which a medical practitioner who carries out a termination of pregnancy must record and then notify to the Minister.  This amendment adds to the matter that must be so recorded and notified.  In doing so, it reflects the reporting requirements that are legally required of a medical practitioner who carries out a termination in England or Wales.  This amendment reflects international best practice in record-keeping.  It in no way interferes with access to abortion.</p> <p>  The matters which must be recorded under the Minister's Bill and under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 fall short of the data required to inform and provide best practice healthcare for women in pregnancy and to avoid healthcare inequalities.  Under the UK Abortion Regulations 1991, as amended, if a registered medical practitioner is of the opinion, formed in good faith, that a woman has grounds for an abortion, he or she is required to complete a certificate of his or her opinion on form HSA1 or HSA2.  In addition, registered UK medical practitioners are required under the Abortion Act 1967, as amended, to notify the chief medical officer of every abortion performed in England and Wales, whether carried out in the NHS or at an approved independent sector place, and whether or not the woman is a UK resident.  The UK Department of Health provides form HSA4 for this purpose.  The proposed amendment reflects the requirement of the HSA4 form, a sample of which is available online.  A copy of the 2013 guidelines for the completion of this form is also available online.</p> <p>  It makes obvious good sense that the same data should be collected in Ireland as in the UK.  This is a very straightforward amendment that simply reflects best international practice.  The fact we can see the experience with record-keeping in the neighbouring jurisdiction means we already have a template to follow.</p></speech>

It is very important that we look at the trend, particularly at what stage the abortions are occurring and whether there are regional variations.</p><p>I agree that there could be doctors who carry out more terminations for various reasons.  I did think it was a little onerous for a GP to have to send the Minister such information.  I would have thought the HSE collected that information on a three-monthly basis.  I suspect that this is the only practice and procedure in respect of which such a demand is made.  I do not think the Department collects information on wisdom tooth extractions and so on.</p></speech>

On the information being sought, I had to Google to learn the meaning of "gravidity" or "parity" because I did not know what it was.  I am not sure if the proposers of the amendment know what the definition is either.</p></speech>

I am sure the Chairman understands their meaning because he is a doctor.  The level of information required seems to be a little invasive.  I am not sure that if I was discussing a termination, I would want to discuss my full history in terms of the number of pregnancies I have had, when they ended and so on.  Also questions about ethnicity and marital status could be considered by some to be inappropriate.  It is very old-fashioned to ask such questions.  If I were asked them, I could refuse to answer, citing that it was nobody's business and that I was entitled by law to have an abortion.  I do not know what the purpose of the amendment is, but it seems to be a bit much.  Is the suggestion being made that people in particular age groups or from ethnic backgrounds are more likely to have an abortion?  What is being proposed is a bit much.  I have no problem with records being made available or the section, but I do think the 28-day period is onerous and that it should be the same source gathering information.  Is it not the role of the HSE, rather than a general practitioner who would be snowed under if required to do that job?  Therefore, I do not support amendment No. 141 because it would be too invasive.</p></speech>

If to the requirement to notify of the carrying out of a termination was attached a payment, we would be far more likely to have a 100% compliance rate.  Data could be picked up in this way, in a sense by default.</p></speech>

We are all in agreement that there is a need to collect data to monitor the service.  If we want this to be, over time, a geographically equitable service as part of the national health service such that there will not be parts of the country where women will not be able to access the service and if we want to know how to address such issues, if identified, it would be useful to have data.  I am happy to reflect on the section to see if there is a better modality for obtaining the data.  The ultimate aim is to have an annual report that will provide information, statistics, trends and so on that can be published and laid before the Oireachtas.  We will engage with the HSE on the most appropriate way of doing so.</p></speech>

This information should necessarily form part of the data collected.  Given the conversation we have had, I am happy to receive a note on the matter.  I do not think there is 1 million miles between the Minister and me on this issue.</p></speech>

It strikes me as slightly odd to provide for it in primary legislation because if the policy people and civil servants decide in a couple of years time that there is particular information that it might be useful to collect, we would have to amend the primary legislation to allow for it to happen.</p></speech>

There is basic information we would want to collect every year which it might be no harm to specify in the legislation.  However, I agree that the Minister or the Government of the day could want information above and beyond it that would be useful.  It is better to specify some of it in primary legislation in order that it will be guaranteed to be collected.</p></speech>

The purpose of this evening's engagement is to meet members of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland to discuss its recent report.  We are joined by Ms Kathleen O'Toole, chairperson of the commission.  I thank Ms O'Toole, personally and on behalf of the committee, for the significant effort that she has made to be with us.  We are also joined by Sir Peter Fahy, chairperson of the commission working group on the dual role, that is, State security and civil policing; Ms Helen Ryan, chair of the commission working group on leadership and structures; and Professor Donncha O'Connell, chair of the commission working group on governance, oversight and accountability.  I also extend a welcome to their colleagues in the Visitors Gallery.</p><p>Before inviting Ms O'Toole to make her opening statement, I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Ms O'Toole to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by Sir Peter Fahy, former Chief Constable of the Greater Manchester Police; Helen Ryan, a well-known Irish consultant and former CEO of Creganna Medical; and Professor Donncha O'Connell, NUI Galway.</p> <p>  As members are aware, the commission was tasked to undertake a fundamental review of policing in Ireland.  We saw our role as charting a vision for the future that would be rightly ambitious for Irish policing and would anticipate future challenges given changes in society, criminality and technology.  However, we recognised at an early stage in our work that vision would also need to be grounded in the reality of some significant challenges both for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as an organisation and for the system as a whole.</p> <p>  The shortcomings we encountered in the course of our work are not merely, or even mainly, a question of resources.  They are critical systemic problems related to culture, structures, accountability mechanisms and management processes.  There is an urgent need for comprehensive and fundamental change.  We respectfully suggest that implementation should be a first-order national priority.  We have been encouraged by the initial response to our report by the Garda Commissioner, individual members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Government and others, including several members of this committee.  The announcement in the recent budget of specific financial commitments to the transformation process, the roll out of the IT mobility project and training needs is welcome.  I know that a detailed consultation process is under way at present with the Garda Commissioner and the relevant agencies and Government Departments.  This committee will also have a key role in informing the Government's views on our recommendations.</p> <p>  How our recommendations are implemented is, ultimately, a matter for Government and the Oireachtas.  I am, however, more than happy to share with members the context for the recommendations we made and to answer any questions they may have.  Members will be familiar with much of the detail of the report and will also be aware of our view that it should be implemented as a holistic reform package given the interdependence of key recommendations.</p> <p>  Before we move to our discussions, I am pleased to have the opportunity to share some insights into our recommendations and to highlight some key elements.  At a fundamental level given that the purpose of policing is to protect the human rights of all members of society to live free from violence, abuse, crime and fear, we have recommended that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a human rights strategy and a human rights unit within the organisation to develop, implement and monitor that strategy.</p> <p>  We also proposed a new approach to policing and community safety that will ensure police are more visible in communities and can focus on preventing harm as distinct from a reactive approach.  I understand that the committee's deliberations this term have a particular emphasis on community policing and that it has recently heard a detailed presentation on our proposals in this critical area from Dr. Johnny Connolly of the University of Limerick, who was also a member of the commission.  In summary, we have recommended a new overall structure for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that aligns the organisation with the core ethos of policing, which is service to the community and working with communities.  We have recommended an approach at district level that makes local communities the central focus for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure that garda&iacute; are more visible on the front line.  We proposed a new definition of policing to include the concept of community safety and a stronger emphasis on harm prevention.  We have also recommended that other agencies work with police in multidisciplinary teams to protect people and prevent crime and that communities should be formally consulted regarding how their local areas are policed.  I am pleased that the emphasis in our report on the need for stronger interagency co-operation has been welcomed.  We saw clear evidence during our consultation process of the frustrations and gaps in service to the community that can arise where the work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other key agencies intersects.  As we are all aware, in many circumstances the garda&iacute; are likely to be among the few public servants on duty outside normal office hours.  We have, therefore, recommended that interagency co-operation be underpinned by sharing information, with the appropriate safeguards, about persons identified as being at risk.  We have also renewed a recommendation made in 2009 in a joint report by the Mental Health Commission and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for multiagency crisis intervention teams, the objective being that police and other concerned agencies should be well equipped to handle mental health crises together.  Police also need to be trained in the necessary special response techniques required in incidents involving vulnerable individuals.</p> <p>  We also made several recommendations for measures that would deliver a professional, ethical, modern and effective police service.  Ireland deserves a professional police service that is well-managed, cost-effective and properly trained and equipped.  The people of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are its greatest resource.  We say very clearly in our report that policing should be seen, and see itself, as a profession.  This carries solid implications.  A profession requires proper qualifications, robust training, continuous professional development, a commitment to a code of ethics, clear policies, high standards of service, accountability and a culture of continuous improvement.  Our report includes important and substantive recommendations in all of these areas.  It is vital that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na fosters psychological safety within the organisation and an environment in which people at all levels of the organisation feel able to share ideas on challenges, opportunities, problems without fearing retribution or marginalisation.  This new culture must start from the top of the organisation and be embedded at all levels.  Our recommendations include a new approach to recruitment and will mean one Garda organisation reflecting the full diversity of Irish society and with sworn and non-sworn members part of a single workforce with a shared mission.  We have also endorsed recommendations by the Garda Inspectorate on new entry routes at more senior levels in the organisation and we have recommended recruitment of staff with the necessary specialist technical and other skills.  </p> <p>  We have recommended a new approach to education in partnership with higher education institutions, no longer confined to Templemore.  We have also recommended a flatter structure than currently exists with much greater scope for local decision making, new ideas and innovation.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must develop effective management processes supported by technology.  We have also been clear about the capacity and skills we believe are required in senior leadership to drive the necessary reforms and to run the police organisation effectively and efficiently.  At a fundamental level, we recommended that the Garda Commissioner and leadership team be empowered to manage the organisation so that it can be truly accountable for delivery of its objectives.</p> <p>  To strengthen the internal corporate governance and management of the police organisation and ensure efficient use of resources, the commission has recommended that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have a statutory board.  The purpose of the board is to strengthen the governance and accountability of the organisation.  The board will hold the Commissioner and senior management to account for the effective performance of their responsibilities.  Its establishment would provide a more appropriate framework of governance between the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na than currently exists.  This fact was endorsed by the independent effectiveness and renewal group chaired by P&aacute;draig &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in in its second progress report published last month in the context of the structural and governance reforms now being undertaken in the Department of Justice and Equality.  The commission&rsquo;s recommendation for a statutory board simply makes sense.  It is "corporate governance 101", a term used by one governance expert earlier this year in the context of the restoration of the board of the HSE.</p><p>It is not a substitute for oversight of policing in Ireland as some commentators have claimed.</p><p> I want to be certain that this committee is fully informed on our recommendations on oversight.   The commission&rsquo;s report does not recommend the abolition of the Policing Authority or its functions, the abolition of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, nor the undermining of an effective, independent complaints mechanism, nor does it recommend or imply any dilution of oversight or scrutiny of policing.  On the contrary, it explicitly recognises the unique nature of policing and the importance of independent oversight in that context.  We recommend combining and expanding the work of the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate under a single umbrella oversight body, which we have suggested could be called the Policing and Community Safety Oversight Commission.  It could just as easily be called the Policing and Community Safety Authority.  The report is clear that the functions of this body would involve transparent scrutiny of policing, including through public meetings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the opportunities presented by social media and other forms of meaningful engagement.  The responsibilities will also include an enhancement of the inspection function, a focus on benchmarking professional standards of policing, and a role in promoting the interagency co-operation we believe to be central to the transformation of policing in Ireland.  These functions are set out in Chapter 13 of our report.</p><p> We have recommended that the responsibility for appointments, including senior appointments, within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should move to be the responsibility of the organisation itself, under the leadership of the Commissioner and the scrutiny of the board.  Our view, as set out in the report, is that it is not appropriate for an agency responsible for oversight to have also responsibility for managing appointments.  It compromises the ability of that agency to oversee and scrutinise with complete independence.  This is especially problematic when it comes to making senior appointments.  The report makes it clear that what we envisaged is a clear and transparent process for such appointments, carried out in line with current common practice in the public sector, which usually involves the Public Appointments Service or other expert recruitment organisations.  It is not a regressive step.  Also, and as we set out in the report, the successor to the Policing Authority, the Policing and Community Safety Oversight Commission, would have a defined and independent oversight role in making judgments on the integrity and effectiveness of this process.</p><p> The commission&rsquo;s proposals for reform of GSOC would significantly strengthen the organisation as an independent and effective complaints mechanism.  Under its proposals, GSOC would be renamed.  This is not a strictly cosmetic change.  Its purpose is to ensure no doubts about its independence from the Garda organisation.   Likewise, to underline its independence, the head of the organisation would become the Accounting Officer.  This function would no longer rest with the Department of Justice and Equality as it does now.  In addition, the new complaints body would carry out all investigations itself.  This would mean that police would no longer be investigating themselves, as is now often the case.</p><p> The new organisation would investigate incidents as well as individual actions, so that any broader lessons for the organisation could be identified.  It would assess all complaints received and make a timely determination whether the complaint was a performance management issue.  If this was the case, it would refer the issue back to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be addressed under performance management processes, which also require reform.</p><p>  In the context of oversight and the proper exercise of accountability for policing, we also respectfully recommend a structured programme of meetings between this committee and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We hope that such an approach would also enhance the accountability system.</p><p> Overall, our proposals in this area respond in large part to the recommendations set out in this committee's report on oversight produced earlier this year.  In summary, we believe the time has come to make a clear distinction between, on the one hand, the internal governance of the police organisation, for which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its Commissioner must be responsible, and the roles of the Department of Justice and Equality and the oversight bodies, whose independence must be without question to ensure their effectiveness. Let me stress that this approach enhances both the overall accountability of the police and the role of oversight bodies to investigate and scrutinise independently how police exercise their responsibility.</p><p> I now refer to the commission's proposals on national security.  As we all know, the main threat to national security in the past has come from domestic groups.  That threat has not disappeared and remains the source of concern, particularly in the Brexit context, combined with the non-operation of political structures in Northern Ireland.  Today, however, the nature of the threat to national security is changing.  Many places that in the past have not seen themselves as targets for international terrorists have suffered attacks.  The means employed by terrorists have also changed, as social media and the Internet are used to plan attacks, radicalise impressionable minds and recruit operatives.  Against this backdrop, the commission was of the view that the national security function should not be lodged entirely within the police organisation.  We considered carefully whether to recommend the creation of a separate agency with powers going beyond analysis and intelligence co-ordination, but we are not convinced that this is either necessary or realistic at the present time.</p><p> In light of the changing threats to national security, however, we believe that it is vital now that security intelligence should be co-ordinated at a national level.  This is also relevant in a context where it is increasingly important for Ireland to engage in important security co-operation with international partners.  We therefore recommend the establishment of a new strategic threat assessment centre, STAC, at central government level, headed by a national security co-ordinator.  The STAC would answer to the Department of the Taoiseach.  It would bring the various relevant agencies of the State together to pool expertise and information and produce a comprehensive picture of the threats to the State.  It would provide a permanent structure to support the work of the National Security Committee and Cabinet committee F, and support the development of a national security strategy.  We have recommended that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should retain operational responsibility for national security and a ring-fenced budget for its security and intelligence capability to enable the necessary recruitment of specialist expertise.</p><p> Our report also has important recommendations on cybersecurity.  Across the world, government entities and private companies experience attempts to hack into their systems every day.  Irish Government institutions, infrastructure and companies are all at risk from such cyber attacks, as are the many foreign companies based in Ireland that are important to this nation&rsquo;s economy.  We recommend the early formulation of an updated and comprehensive national cybersecurity strategy.</p><p> Ireland also needs to develop its capacity to address the threat, both within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in the national cybersecurity centre, and expand work with academia and the private sector.  This is a matter not only of resources but also of the security apparatus of Government.  The national security co-ordinator should therefore also be responsible for the national cybersecurity centre. </p><p> Some of the submissions received by the commission called for a single oversight framework for policing and security, a single set of eyes.  I understand that this is an issue that this committee has also discussed.  Our recommendations, however, are based on an analysis of international oversight arrangements for security and recognise that the security function of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na sits within a much broader state security framework.  This will be reinforced by the establishment of the STAC.</p><p> We recommend the appointment of an independent examiner of terrorist and serious crime legislation, with powers to assess the conduct of security operations and to maintain a continual review of how security legislation is being implemented by police and other agencies.</p><p> Trust and consent of the people form the bedrock of an effective police service.  My sense is that Ireland has done well, despite the challenges of recent times, to retain positive community relationships.  However, community support and trust cannot and should never be taken for granted.</p><p> This is my final engagement as chair of the commission.  It has been a real privilege to work with my colleagues on a transformative programme for the future of policing in Ireland at such a critical time.  I see great commitment by all stakeholders to making it happen, once and for all.  There will, no doubt, be hurdles ahead in implementation and delivery, but if all involved - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Government, the Oireachtas, and the policing oversight bodies - really get behind a shared vision, it will succeed.</p><p>The vital role of individual members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their staff associations in this process cannot be underestimated.  We believe it can be done - indeed it must be done - in the interests of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the people it serves.  I look forward now to discussions with committee members.</p></speech>

This is a strong report and there is a great deal in it that will be of value to policing in Ireland.  There are many things in this report I agree with and a great deal of them fit quite closely with what we recommended in the Sinn F&eacute;in submission, such as the police and community safety Act, prevention of harm as a core objective of policing, the importance of local policing fora, legislation on search and detention powers, entry pathways to the Garda, the establishment of human rights units and non-core Garda functions being carried out by the Courts Service, the Irish Prison Service, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and so on.  These are all important things on which I am in agreement.</p> <p>  My time is limited but I want to emphasise that many of my questions will necessarily focus on areas where I might have a different view, or some reservations as to the committee's recommendations.  However, that does not mean I do not believe it is a good and a valuable report and a great public service which I want to see implemented.  I want to make that clear at the outset.</p> <p>  The first point I want to raise is one I discussed with Dr. Johnny Connolly here recently about community policing.  I will deal with this briefly but I am not entirely convinced of the approach.  I very much appreciate the emphasis on community policing and the district policing model, but I am not entirely convinced by the approach whereby all garda&iacute; are considered community garda&iacute;.  Policing within the community should run from top to bottom in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but I am a believer in the function of a designated role within districts, in particular, and divisions that would be the key liaison person between the community and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Could I get a comment on that?  I know there is some talk that there would be a team and different people would have different responsibilities.  I think that would work reasonably well on the Garda side but my concern is about whether the community would know who the person would be who would pick up the phone.  Currently, this model is not working well everywhere.  I pay tribute to the garda&iacute; in Cork.  I think they have protected the model better than most, from what I have heard elsewhere.  It makes a difference when the community knows who the local community garda is and develops trust, relationships and so on.  I am not sure how well that is going to be maintained under the model proposed.</p></speech>

I discussed it with Dr. Johnny Connolly and believe we are more in agreement than disagreement here.  We do not envisage that there would no longer be specialist community policing people.  In our model, there would still be specialists assigned to community policing who would engage regularly and informally with members of the community, participate in multidisciplinary teams, organise community policing meetings and be there to answer the phone when specific questions about community policing arise.  We feel that every police officer assigned to a particular district at the local level also needs to embrace the philosophy of community policing and that even those people who  get 999 calls need to understand that they have a responsibility to prevent and intervene.  It is not just about reaction and enforcement.</p> <p>  In policing studies elsewhere, data show that less than 20% of police work relates in any way to law enforcement and most of it requires providing service to people in need, particularly vulnerable people.  It is important it is embedded in the culture of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that all members, particularly those at the local level, have a responsibility to engage with the community and help it to solve problems.  If I am a police officer who is ordinarily assigned to a unit that is taking 999 calls, I am not just going to react to calls for service.  If I have time in between, I am going to get out and visit people living and working in the neighbourhood.  I am going to engage with them and learn who they are, what their problems and challenges are and how I can be helpful to them.  Again, we are talking more about a culture of community policing throughout the organisation.  We are not suggesting for a minute that specialist positions in community policing be eliminated in our model.  I hope that clarifies it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.2067" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Sir Peter Fahy" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018110700002#J00700"><p>We are also saying that for that shift to occur, the organisation has to be restructured with a fundamental shift of power and responsibility down to the local level, away from the headquarters and there has to be a freeing up members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from lots of tasks which are not police tasks.  Generally what happens is community policing gets squeezed out because of all the other duties and, as an organisation, those have to be taken out to free up time.  Then there is a need for systems like the performance systems which say that relationship with the local community, the problem solving and working with other agencies is what is really valued by the organisation rather than simplistic statistical targets.  The whole thing has to fit together.  Our report outlines a whole series of measures which signal to the organisation that local relationship, local problem solving and ability to respond to local need.  One can only respond to local need if the power is pushed down so that local commanders understand that their key answerability is to local people and local elected Members.</p></speech>

If it is a designated function, it may be merely be a designated function.  From speaking with regular members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it was clear to us that in order for community policing to be taken seriously within the organisation of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it had to be identified as essentially the pre-eminent purpose of policing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.2069" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018110700002#J00900"><p>I suppose I am a little bit clearer there.  I will take that onboard and consider it further in the context of ongoing discussions on legislation.  My primary concern, and I am sure it is the same for others, relates to recommendations 17, 12 and, to a degree, 16 and to the change in structures.  I understand the argument that is made as to governance and oversight.  I will not read all of the footnote from Dr. Vicky Conway and Dr. Eddie Molloy, but the last sentence reads: "We believe that the solution should be to adequately empower the Policing Authority while encouraging maturation of the culture of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na concerning external accountability."  That would be my initial view as well but I am open-minded on this and I will listen to the arguments that are made.  However, it seems that with the best will in the world, and even with independent appointments to the Garda board, over probably not a long period of time, the institutional loyalty of that board will be to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na rather than to its primary responsibility, being the Policing Authority, and its primary function, being the oversight of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p>  I appreciate the public and community safety oversight commission, PCSOC, structure, the combined inspectorate and Policing Authority, and its responsibility for oversight, but what is to prevent An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na disregarding what that body says given that it does not have the same powers over it that the Policing Authority had in terms of appointments and the ability to approve policing plans rather than simply being consulted on them which is my understanding of the recommendation?  Things are being moved around.  I understand this is not an abolition but rather a merger and a restructuring.</p><p>I am concerned that the Garda board is not going to offer oversight but will instead be used for governance, and perhaps offer some level of accountability.  Ultimately it will be tied quite closely to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Meetings will not be in public, if I understand it correctly.  The policing and community safety oversight commission, PCSOC, would be responsible for oversight but would not have any powers with which to move An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na along; it only would have the powers of exposure, as do we.  The approval of policies, oversight of budgets, approval of policing plans and, crucially, appointments, are all important.  </p></speech>

We are very patient and are willing to stay as long as we are needed.</p> <p>  I will respond as someone who has served as a police chief previously and I am sure Sir Peter Fahy will also have something to say about this.  I will then turn over the discussion to Professor Donncha O'Connell, who chaired a sub-group to specifically tackle this issue.  We come up through the policing ranks in North America, Europe and elsewhere in the world and are primarily focused on being good police officers and good detectives, but some of us rise to the rank of chief or commissioner without the benefit of education or experience in management, budgets and other issues which require experience to enable to person to manage a huge organisation.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has approximately 16,000 people and an annual operating budget of &euro;1.6 billion.  There is a desperate need to build capacity internally and to promote internally people who have the appropriate business acumen to assist the Commissioner and his team.  We believe the board proposal would be particularly beneficial because it would bring people from different disciplines, including those who understand budgets, HR issues, IT issues and other important requirements for an organisation in which a commissioner or a career police person may not necessarily have a lot of experience.  I thought the idea of a board was a brilliant one from the perspective of a police chief but I would not expect that a cosy relationship between the board and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would ensue.  I would hope for a strong professional tension, because from such tension good things would emerge.  In a similar way to other State boards, if there is a non-executive chair of a statutory board, those people absolutely would hold the management team to account but also would be there to support the team and bring business acumen to the table that does not necessarily exist in a police organisation.  </p> <p>  Coincidentally, just after we made the report, I returned to America and attended a meeting of international police chiefs, and had the opportunity to engage with the police executive research forum, with people from the policing foundation and other think-tanks that carry out a lot of international work.  The feedback was overwhelmingly positive.  In fact, Mr. Chuck Wexler documented his enthusiasm for our report, specifically the notion of having a statutory board.  I think it will not only prove to be a good idea here that will enhance governance, oversight and accountability here in Ireland, but it is one of the recommendations I believe is most likely to be replicated elsewhere.  Having said that, I would like to hear the perspective of Sir Peter.  </p></speech>

I am concerned that body does not have any real powers.  It has the ability to discuss and shine a light on issues, but it does not have any real powers or teeth when it comes to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is my main issue.  Some of the powers it should have have now been allocated to the board.</p></speech>

We considered the bite the authority has.  The difficulty in Ireland is that there is one police force and no competition with other police forces, therefore another police force cannot be brought in to run it.  If there are concerns critical reports can be issued, but ultimately sacking the person at the top is almost the only sanction available.  Accountability needs to be woven into the organisation at all sorts of different levels.  We believe we have strengthened the role of the PCSOC because it has a wider responsibility for community safety, which is what policing is about ultimately.  We also have injected some really credible business acumen and other expertise at the crucial level of governance, the level at which the organisation is run.  We felt that there would be a fundamental tension between a body responsible for oversight and for governance.  If one is involved in the governance side of the organisation, it would be very hard for one to operate oversight of that governance.  The situation is as the Deputy has outlined.  The question remains as to what is the sanction.  Critical reports can be issued.  We debated whether some of the budget could be held back but decided that such an approach would damage the policing side of things.  This is part of the difficulty.  It is really important that this is considered alongside a series of other measures that make An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na more transparent, from the local level with individual officers with body cameras, through every stage.  Governance will be improved by bringing independent people into the running of the organisation with the effect that it is not just the police profession that is doing that.  The authority will have a stronger role in calling to account the board and other agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for its performance.  We discussed that tension.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-07a.2096" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Donncha O'Connell" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018110700002#K02700"><p>Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's point is absolutely valid.  One of the things we considered was that the level of change we envisaged being implemented is extraordinarily large.  We are talking about a very ambitious programme of change which cannot be driven or generated entirely externally.  There has to be some stage at which the organisation itself takes responsibility for its own reform and takes that responsibility seriously.  While that cannot be entirely externally driven, oversight must be entirely external and independent.  A new body called PCSOC might be less focused on governance but instead can be more focused on its main business, which is oversight and holding An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to account.</p><p>The authority, the inspectorate and GSOC all emerged in crisis situations.  They all were reactive developments to crises and we had to consider this when looking at them.  We had the benefit of being able to ask what an oversight framework would look like if we were trying to establish one.  One key decision was to merge the inspectorate with the authority and create a more deliberative loop that is perhaps less adversarial.  There will still be the possibility of holding feet to fire and GSOC will be the new independent ombudsman for the police with significantly enhanced powers, as a result of which it will need to be resourced.  There is also, however, a need to create strong, democratic accountability to this committee, which it will meet four times a year.  There also will need to be more formal professional oversight arrangements between the PCSOC and the statutory board.  If the statutory board ignored something that was said by the policing and community safety oversight commission, it would be dysfunctional.  A properly constituted board that is legislated for properly would have to take account of what the commission said.  Members spoke of a culture that had not yet demonstrated sufficient maturation in relation to external accountability but we are not proposing to postpone the process of maturation.  We are proposing to enable it, right now.  If we want a culture which is comfortable with external oversight and robust internal governance, we will have to provide for it.</p></speech>

I hope the PCSOC does not become such a body and we need to look at this carefully in the legislation as it comes through.</p> <p>  Recommendation 42 relates to a code of ethics.  Is it envisaged that a breach of the code of ethics by a garda will be a disciplinary matter?  At the outset, there was concern on the part of the commission over the appointment of a Garda Commissioner in advance of the report being published, though I understand the commission was reassured that it was okay and the Policing Authority proceeded.  Was there substantial communication over this?  Were the draft recommendations discussed?  How was reassurance given to the commission over this matter?</p></speech>

We had suggested that the appointment of the Garda Commissioner should align nicely with the release of our recommendations because we thought the timing was important.  There was speculation that the Garda Commissioner's appointment would happen much earlier and we thought it might have been awkward but, as it turned out, the timing was much better than any of us anticipated as the appointment preceded our publication by only a few weeks.  We engaged with the Policing Authority on a regular basis, particularly the secretariat, and the authority came in to meet us and to present its submission.  There were good, strong lines of communication.</p></speech>

It needs a lot of fleshing out and the commission may have deliberately left it open to Government and Opposition to interpret.  Would this role have a statutory basis and would it have an entitlement to intelligence, rather than relying simply on co-operation?  Would it be entitled to oblige?  Would the Garda Commissioner and the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces be answerable to this co-ordinator?  Would the priorities that could be set by this person involve requirements on the Defence Forces and the Garda or would they simply be recommendations?  Would the person be responsible for co-ordinating investigations such as data breaches?</p></speech>

We see the role as not being an operational one.  The proposed national security co-ordinator would not task the Garda Commissioner or the Chief of Staff and the Garda Commissioner and Chief of Staff would not answer to this individual.  We see the national security co-ordinator as something of a resource, to the national security committee and to Cabinet committee F.  This group would synthesise intelligence and identify potential gaps and notify the national security committee, which would take the appropriate actions.  We do not see the national security co-ordinator as overseeing the Garda Commissioner or the Chief of Staff and we do not see the strategic threat analysis centre playing an operational role in the gathering of intelligence.</p></speech>

As the nature of the threat which all countries are facing is developing very fast, the capability of the infrastructure in Ireland will need to develop accordingly.  We see it as a co-ordinating role but the co-ordinator will be able to look more broadly at the nature of threats and to call in other sources of intelligence and information, as well as to build strong links with academia and the business community.  The co-ordinator can develop a different culture and gather new skills, which are needed given that a lot of the threat is carried on the digital infrastructure.  The recommendations were driven by the people who came before us and who were already engaged in the national security of Ireland and they felt there needed to be greater co-ordination.  They also recognised that the nature of the threat was changing very rapidly.</p></speech>

Criticisms have been made, for example, of how the DPP handled the case of Shane O'Farrell.  Other bodies could also come into view, such as the Courts Service and the Irish Youth Justice Service.  This may have been felt to be outside the remit of the commission but did the witnesses give consideration to an accountability mechanism in the form of a criminal justice inspectorate, which would look at all bodies responsible for criminal justice?</p></speech>

The co-ordination that is now required is with other agencies at local level, if anyone.  That is why we recommended an increased role for the PCSOC.  We felt that was the crucial part.</p><p> In regard to criminal justice, the crucial series of recommendations involved removing the prosecution role from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for a whole series of reasons, not just because of officer time, but because in a democracy it is crucial to separate the two roles.  There should be an independent national prosecution service.  We did not particularly examine the potential spectra on that side.  Those were the two key dynamics we pulled up.  It is absolutely right to say that very few incidents are solely about the police and can be solved by the police alone.  Therefore, the ability to pull together other agencies and the ability of those agencies to work together at both local and national level are crucial.  That is why we recommended this wider role for the PCSOC, for wider community safety and the protection of vulnerable people.</p></speech>

I thank them for coming in because people who write reports are perfectly entitled to say that they were asked to prepare a report and those with questions should read it.  They do not have to be probed in respect of it.  It is helpful for us to be able to ask questions about it.</p> <p>  I agree with most of the recommendations in the report.  They mirror a lot of what was in the submission put in by Fianna F&aacute;il.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, I am not going to focus on the parts with which there is no dispute, where I strongly favour what is recommended.  I hope the witnesses do not think that by doing that I am being negative about the report.  I am not.  I wish to probe the other areas where there are issues of uncertainty or dispute.</p> <p>  The report's ninth principle concerns the oversight bodies.  It states that a blame culture has affected the relationships between them.  Will the witnesses elaborate?

It seemed there was frustration all around.  It seemed there was a lot of frustration, whether we talked to people in the oversight bodies or in the police.  We felt that we could all accomplish so much more if we worked collaboratively.  I worked as the chief inspector of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate and felt very strongly that we needed to engage with people and to do so constructively.  I also thought there should be a strong professional tension in order for us to be effective.  It is a matter of striking the right balance.  Everywhere we went, the oversight bodies were frustrated, the police were frustrated and it seemed the environment was counterproductive.</p></speech>

The debate around policing in general, in several jurisdictions, is about moving from looking at misconduct and blame to a healthier culture, one that seeks to learn lessons but still holds people to account for misconduct.  In policing, poor professional practice is often merged with deliberate misconduct.  That of itself creates a blame culture where individual officers feel they are not able to make honest mistakes or admit to them.  They can feel the realities of their day-to-day working conditions are not appreciated by the bodies that hold them to account.</p></speech>

There will be the independent office of the police ombudsman, IOPO, which will take the place of GSOC and will be more efficient in dealing with complaints against members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and there will be PCSOC, which will supersede the Policing Authority and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, absorbing most of their functions and taking on new ones.  Members of the Oireachtas will have a direct role in voting on legislation on the establishment of these new statutory bodies if it comes before us.  I understand how the IOPO will operate.  How will PCSOC operate?  We have had the Policing Authority since 2015.  How will it differ from that?</p></speech>

We talked about breaking it down into three areas of responsibility.  The inspection responsibility that currently exists, including the meetings and the public oversight, is very important.  There should be public meetings where the police are held to account.  We would also like to see an enhanced role for PCSOC in developing strong structures and systems for bridging the national strategy on policing with the local district model we envisage.  Right now there is a lot of room for improvement at the local level, especially around multidisciplinary approaches and how best to organise them.  I know that Professor O'Connell and Ms Ryan were both involved in these discussions.</p></speech>

It will draw on knowledge from a more defined role in co-ordinating local policing fora.  We did quite a lot of engagement with local community groups, both urban and rural, in regard to this.  That will give this new body a sense of the policing priorities on the ground.  We know that the inspectorate has an extraordinarily valuable store of information and a bank of recommendations.  Because the inspectorate will be within the ambit of this organisation, that will all be integrated into its knowledge base.  It will not be limited to using that in its oversight exercises or in conducting public meetings with the Garda Commissioner, senior Garda management or whoever.  It can also use that knowledge in benchmarking the standards that it wants to see applied in policing plans and made operational, with reference to international experience.</p> <p>  A huge amount of thought went into this.  Even those who disagree with the idea of a board do not disagree with the idea of a policing and community oversight commission or authority, whatever it is called.  One of the benefits we gained from talking to communities, police and all sorts of other people is a sense of what an enhanced body, genuinely connected to what is happening on the ground, would look like.  It would not necessarily take instructions from every group.  We understand that it has to be co-ordinated.  There is additional value in knowing what is happening in communities and taking it seriously.  It is a clear strand in the three pillars of that organisation.  It is not tokenistic.  It is not a gesture, and it knits completely with the idea of community policing as the core of policing.</p></speech>

Members of this committee are critical of the Policing Authority, but we liked seeing it holding the Garda Commissioner and senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to account at public meetings.  We have a wide experience of that in this committee in regard to homicide figures and other issues.  Obviously it needs to improve.</p><p>A concern that some members have is whether we are going to do away with that.  Professor O'Connell has indicated this is not the case, as the policing and community safety oversight commission, PCSOC, would include the functions being carried out by the Policing Authority and it would have enhanced roles as well.</p></speech>

There is a misunderstanding about that.  The idea that there would no longer be a public hearing in Dublin Castle is absolutely wrong.  That will continue and our argument is that the body doing it would be better equipped.  It would be better informed than we can be under the current position, with a disparate set of arrangements between various oversight bodies.  It is critical for it to be understood that the idea of public accountability and oversight will continue as one of the functions of the policing and community safety oversight commission.</p></speech>

It would put in all the practices to ensure that sort of thing would not happen.  Again, it would have a very strong risk management process that would point out when there is a risk area.  There would clearly be times when it might have to react because something has gone wrong but the main focus would be on how, in a modern and complex organisation, processes can be implemented to identify and manage risk and to inject professionalism into every level.  The trouble with police leadership is that it sometimes misses such elements because it can be reactive to the latest crises.  The other benefit of the board would be to enable the organisation to consider things more for the long term rather than just reacting to the latest policing operation.</p></speech>

I suppose we could consider the example of a statutory or semi-State body that would not have a statutory oversight body reviewing it in the same way the Garda would have the PCSOC.  I know the oversight body is distinct from the management role to be played by the board but does this not distinguish it from other State entities?  On one level there would be an oversight body that is checking the policing organisation, probing it, kicking the tyres and indicating, if we use the breath test example, that matters should have been revealed earlier-----</p></speech>

That does not mean that because of that exceptionalism, the police should not have a board.  It should have a board with a particular purpose.  As Sir Peter Fahy pointed out, the careful oversight architecture that has, in a sense, been reconstituted by our recommendations addresses that exceptionalism.  When we thought carefully about this, we wondered why we would not have a board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It would not have a board just because of the idea it is like any other State body, and that is not the reason we argue it should have a board.  It is about trying to bring clarity to the governance and oversight arrangements.  Accountability happens at all sorts of levels, including the political and democratic levels in this forum, as well as with a board and, in a manner of speaking, with oversight mechanisms.</p></speech>

It is really about taking up from where we left off.  We cannot divorce what happens in the real world from the accountability of the Minister in the Department of Justice and Equality.  It is the one area we have not touched in this regard.  The witnesses have spoken about the oversight provision and there would effectively be a board interacting with the Garda Commissioner.  I worry that we are at risk of layering on top of this.  In reality, there will be direct accountability going back to the Minister.  I agree with Deputy O'Callaghan's comments as I know there is a tendency to say it would be like a semi-State or commercial organisation but it is not and it never will be.  We must accept that in terms of accountability.  I do not expect the witnesses to be familiar with the old scenario of an RT&Eacute; authority that had a view on broadcasting and control.  When we considered how to modernise that process, we created a broadcasting authority but it still comes back to a Minister.  Where does that fit in the proposal?</p></speech>

Ultimately, in this democracy, all these different components should answer to the Minister and the Oireachtas, which comprises the democratically elected representatives of the people.  Not only would the Garda Commissioner and the board be accountable to the Minister and the Oireachtas but so would PCSOC and the new oversight body that will replace GSOC.</p><p>I am trying to tease out this issue.  It sounds that at one level the board has no teeth.  It is almost like a board of directors to advise the management on the day-to-day structure.  Where does the board get its teeth?</p></speech>

The board does have significant powers in so far as it impacts on ministerial and departmental level.  One of the aspirations behind the creation of this structure is that if we believe as we clearly do that the involvement of the Department of Justice and Equality in the micro management of policing crises or policing generally is not a good idea, one has to take steps to ensure that is less likely to occur.  By creating a board, the Commissioner has an entity to engage with that can assist in the type of issues with which he or she needs assistance and the Department of Justice and Equality, which rightly should be focused on the creation of criminal justice, policing and wider policies on public safety and on relationships with other Departments can focus properly on that business.  That might seem high minded or a little too aspirational but that is one of the issues, although not the primary one, that influenced our thinking on this.  The Department of Justice and Equality and the Minister for Justice and Equality will always exist; that is legitimate and we are not against that but we need to ensure there is a super structure within which policing occurs and that does not dominate to the extent that it possibly has or does not create problems that ought not to be created, or that the Department itself does not need.</p></speech>

When State bodies come before the committee we have a responsibility to hold them to account.  We are not looking to hold the witnesses to account because as far as we are concerned they did their report, are finished their work and are not working for the State.</p><p>As other members have said, we agree with most of what is in the report.  We read the Garda inspectorate reports of 2014 and 2015 and we would have identified with much of what was said in those reports.  We have a disagreement on the issue of the GSOC, the Policing Authority and the inspectorate position.  Ms O'Toole states they are being amalgamated and they are changing the name of GSOC.  I am not so sure of the reason for the need to change the name.  The argument put forward is that it will sound more independent of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is proposed to amalgamate the other two but it does look like a watering down of what they were doing.  We would not be the only people to believe that is the case.  </p><p>Professor Dermot Walsh, professor of law at Kent University, is probably one of the most serious commentators on policing in Ireland and he said: </p><blockquote>Despite the recent establishment of the Policing Authority, the Garda has remained largely insulated from effective democratic scrutiny and transparency.  The Commission's recommendations for change have the merit of bringing much needed clarity and cohesion to the complex and confusing infrastructure of this vital area.  At the same time, however, they seem to entail a significant strengthening of the power and status of the Garda Commissioner and the relationship between the Government and senior Garda management, the latter of course was one of the key concerns that led to the establishment of the Commission in the first place.</blockquote> <p>We believe, and this is not a criticism, that we have a practical take on how policing happens in Ireland.  We also have a take on where we think it is going.  Deputy Clare Daly and I have been involved since 2011-12 in dealing with much of what was going on and we were raising issues about the Garda when it was dangerous.  We were nearly run out of Leinster House for doing that.  Things have changed since then.  Forgive me for thinking that the Commission's take is a little more theoretical for want of a better word.</p><p>The witnesses talked about the frustration they experienced when talking to GSOC, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate, the Policing Authority and we understand that.  We introduced a Bill in 2013 and 2014 to try to address the challenges that existed and to change things.  The Government refused to bring in our recommendations and instead brought in bits and pieces.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na inspectorate was frustrated because they were never given the powers that they should have been given.  It made more than 500 recommendations over a number of years.  The inspectorate had no statutory responsibility for the monitoring of the implementation of recommendations made in its reports, something which I am not so sure the witnesses have dealt with, however, the inspectorate established a process with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2008 which resulted in the publication, without Government help, of status implementation update reports twice a year on the inspectorate's website, but the last such regular update was published in November 2013.  When Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan was appointed as Commissioner she abandoned this process.  The inspectorate did not have a clue whether any of its recommendations was being implemented after that as it was left in the dark.  One can understand the reason it was frustrated.  GSOC was frustrated because the Garda had the potential to absolutely ignore what it wanted.  The Garda would not give GSOC information if it did not feel like it, or give the information late.  The Government would not give GSOC the legislative powers to go and get what information it wanted and would not give it the money to do the job properly.  GSOC could not hire the people it needed to do the job properly.  We were critical of the Policing Authority too, mainly because we felt the Government should have given it more power, for example it was not allowed to hold the Garda Commissioner to account. </p><p>The reason that the former Ministers for Justice and Equality, former Deputy Shatter and his successor Deputy Frances Fitzgerald lost their jobs and that two Commissioners lost their jobs was because the relationship was too close.  One could say that the board might be a buffer between them but I am not so sure that it will work that way.  It is being said by the witnesses that accountability for the Commissioner will still go back to the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Committee on Justice and Equality and the Oireachtas.  We would not be mad about that suggestion.  This committee is not the worst it has ever been but it is the first time the Opposition has dominated.  Normally it would be Government dominated and the Government will never make the mistake again of allowing the Opposition to dominate it.  It was a serious oversight on the part of the Government.</p></speech>

This is absolutely remarkable, given the fact that we are 11 people who sat around a table for a year and a half and who represent very different perspectives.  The only two of us who had any direct policing experience were Peter Fahy and me.  This was similar to my experience in Northern Ireland on the Patten commission, where only two of us had any policing experience.  That is a wonderful thing, however, because we had academics, business leaders, people committed to human rights and people committed to victims' rights and we all came together representing very different perspectives.  I am looking at the glass as being 98% full because on 49 recommendations we came to a complete consensus and in this one instance we do not necessarily disagree on everything.  We all agree we should include the inspectorate into the authority and we agree that the powers of the authority should be expanded.  This is, then, a very small disagreement in the overall context of things.  This was an extraordinary team of people and we have great mutual respect for one another.  We thought that, in the spirit of transparency and mutual respect, we should include that footnote noting the dissenting opinion of two of our members.  Nine of us felt very strongly that this was the right recommendation.</p> <p>  I chuckled a little when the Deputy said it was a little theoretical because I based a lot of my perspective on this and the five to six years I spent as the first chief inspector of the Garda Inspectorate.  I stood up and led that organisation for five to six years right in the aftermath of the 2005 Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act, when the first new bodies, GSOC and the inspectorate, were created.  Of course, as the Deputy knows, the authority was not created until more recently.  I experienced my own frustrations as the chief inspector when we worked really hard to develop and publish recommendations.  I was the one in 2008 who said we needed to create an online tool to show people what happens when we issue recommendations, to gauge progress, to show whether these recommendations have been adopted and implemented.  I was the one who put that in place.  As someone who was in that position, I feel that combining the roles and the resources of the inspectorate and the authority is brilliant because, as the chief inspector, I can now bring those recommendations into a public forum where the authority holds a public meeting and hold the Garda Commissioner to account as to why certain recommendations have been either implemented or ignored.  This was not a tool we had available to us in the inspectorate.  We published recommendations, they were presented to Government and we hoped they would be implemented, but we did not have a public forum in which to hold people to account.</p></speech>

Why did the commission not decide to give the Garda Inspectorate the tools it needed to do its job properly, give it the power of inspection, including unannounced inspection, and give it the authority to actually follow up on how its recommendations were going?  Why did the commission not give the Policing Authority these extra powers, which would make it more effective, rather than amalgamating the bodies?</p></speech>

By the way, there is nothing in our report that criticises the work of the Policing Authority or the inspectorate.  Both organisations have done important work during their existence.  I want to underscore that.  We did not criticise anything.  We think we will make them stronger.  We think that by harnessing those resources and bringing people together it will be a much more powerful oversight organisation.</p></speech>

In the context of the legislative process that may ensue, in the creation of a policing community oversight commission or authority it is of course possible to make those proposals and to have them considered.  One thing I would like to double back a little on, for the record, is what the Deputy said about GSOC.  We are certainly not suggesting a merely cosmetic change of name.  The reason for changing the name is that a GSOC survey indicated that the public perceive the commission to be a Garda organisation and not an independent organisation.  We wanted to underscore or put beyond doubt its independence.  If the Deputy looks at our recommendations on its powers and functions, he will see they are greatly enhanced-----</p></speech>

Yes, this involves significant additional resourcing.  We have been really clear that this cannot be done on the basis of meagre resources.  In fact, if the Deputy sees what GSOC itself has proposed and suggested to the Department by way of legislative reform, we are substantially <i>ad idem</i>with it on what is needed.  I am just concerned that there might be a perception that we did not suggest quite radical reform of that organisation.</p></speech>

Recommendation 18 states: "We recommend the urgent introduction of streamlined processes for decision making and procurement approvals within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na."  I got the impression that the commission had perhaps not taken into consideration just how bad the problems in this area of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are.  To give the witnesses a small taste of it, in 2016 alone An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na paid Accenture, the IT management company, which is kind of taking over this area, &euro;26.5 million.  It gets a lot worse than that, however.  An audit by the Garda internal audit section into Garda information and communications technology, ICT, payments for 2016 and completed in August 2017, which RT&Eacute;'s John Burke got from a freedom-of-information request, found serious problems with its contract with Accenture.  The aim of the audit was to examine the payments process and so on, but the audit found no assurances that public procurement requirements were being complied with and that this represented a high risk.  The Garda contract with Accenture, which was provided to the audit, was dated August 2009.  The audit stated that as this contract had not been renewed since 2009, it was not satisfied that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na complied with the procurement obligations.  The audit notes that Accenture staff are the only external IT contractors who do not record their attendance in hours on an electronic clocking system.  Not only are these problems with the contract and the staff, but the audit also found that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had been paying Accenture in advance before the work was done.  I was surprised the commission did not go there.  Was this outside its remit?  It is such a problem area for them.</p></speech>

We certainly followed the stories of the day in the news.  I followed some of the media coverage of Accenture and that contract.  We talked about creating the model for the future that will prevent such situations from developing in the future.  If one has in place internally in the organisation the right management team that includes not just police but also people with business acumen who know how to manage businesses, and then if one has the board with similar business acumen which can question them to ensure they have the right risk registers in place and that they are operating and managing the business appropriately, we think that will address many of those issues and prevent such weaknesses developing in the future.  Ms Ryan has a lot of experience in business and has served on a State board previously.</p></speech>

We were, however, equally aware that there was a need for a very significant step-up in the IT infrastructure, particularly to get mobile enabled, which is common in most other police forces at this stage, and that the current process that was being run around those newer technologies was very cumbersome and required a level of specification of the system that, in our view, needed to be looked at differently to enable these things to happen in a reasonable period.</p><p>A number of those systems are crucial to the organisation being able to operate more effectively and efficiently.  That is what that was about.  It was particularly about the procurement of IT systems, not IT support, but new systems that are needed.</p></speech>

On the issue of the board, Ms O'Toole stated:</p><blockquote>... the Commission has recommended that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should have a statutory board.  The purpose of the board is to strengthen the governance and accountability of the organisation.  As is routine in good corporate governance, the Board would be comprised of external members from the business and professional sectors with expertise in human resources, labour relations, criminal justice, financial management, IT and other areas of management.</blockquote> <p>We have boards in Ireland that are stacked with these people left, right and centre.  We have had enough of them.  Why not include someone from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Ombudsman for Children, the Data Protection Commission and even someone from the Traveller community?  One does not have to be a rocket scientist.  People who do not necessarily have all these management skills have a lot to bring to the table, and we believe much of that is missing.</p><p>Ms O'Toole was making the argument that the Garda was like a commercial organisation, but I do not buy that.  Commercial organisations are 100% driven to make a profit.  It is all about making money and making sure it works.  That is not what we want from the Garda.  We might have a different perception of it but I have an entirely different idea as to what our Garda should be doing and what it should look like.  I find it hard to see treating it like a commercial organisation as the way forward.</p></speech>

I would not want to see it being treated as a commercial organisation.  The board's interest should be the stakeholders, and the stakeholders in this instance are the people the Garda serves.</p></speech>

I will read a short quote from Conor Brady.  In an article he wrote shortly after the report came out he said that the political establishment and its civil servants have nothing against An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a community police force but their desire for a strong blue line of defence for the State is greater.  He further stated that that imperative, along with the ambition of rolling back external scrutiny, is threaded through this report to a degree that is surprising and disturbing.  What comments would the witnesses make on that?</p></speech>

He was involved in our commission very early on and made a personal decision to step away.  We had great respect for him early in the process and I am sorry his voice at the table did not continue.  The Deputy mentioned another academic earlier for whom I have great respect.  I have actually presented at conferences with him but I have not had the opportunity to sit with either Mr. Brady or the other academic the Deputy mentioned to have a discussion about the rationale that eventually led to some of these recommendations.  I look forward to doing that at some point.</p></speech>

That was a big call to make, and we can see the pluses and minutes of it, but many people would think differently about it.  I know it is what the Garda, and the Government, would want.  It is probably an area on which we would like to have seen a more fresh approach taken.

We recognise that there are other agencies involved in this - the Defence Forces, the Revenue Commissioners or whatever.  In taking that into account and the evolving nature of the security threats, some of which we cannot possibly even imagine, we suggested a different approach to that but not by any means confirming any monopoly for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of policing.  We argued clearly for the creation of a new strategic threat analysis centre in the Department of An Taoiseach, not in the Department of Defence or in the Department of Justice and Equality, and an actual security co-ordinator and all that goes with that.  Sir Peter chaired this group, and he is not here, but we would argue that that is a very innovative approach that has learned from what has and has not worked elsewhere.  We were very clear that there would be oversight of that through the appointment of an independent examiner.  Given the different task of overseeing security issues, there are sensitivities that would not apply in respect of regular policing oversight, and there are national interests at stake, etc.  There was a careful consideration of what should be done and what we suggest is a very significant change in terms of security arrangements for this State.</p></speech>

It is important to state that we are meeting late in the day to avoid interference with D&aacute;il business and that the witnesses' attendance is appreciated.  This is an important part of the process in the D&aacute;il deliberations on what will happen with this report.  I am a member of the Business Committee and I know there is a desire to have us discuss the report in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  However, the other Deputies wanted us to discuss it in this committee first because the witnesses can come into this Chamber and therefore their voices would be heard first inside the Houses of the Oireachtas, with the rest of the discussion taking place in the House.  It has been very beneficial to have that, and it is part of that jigsaw.  It is important to state that.</p> <p>  Following on from what Deputy Wallace said, in some ways we may look at this a little differently.  My grey hair comes from our long-standing desire to have Garda reform.  When we say there is stuff in the report that is not new, we mean that much of it is very good but that it was identified some time ago.  In that sense, when Deputy Wallace said that GSOC is not new, the newly called GSOC is everything we, and GSOC, have been requesting for years.  It could have been in place a number of years ago.  In fact, it could be in place this year as much of what is contained in it was part of this committee's recommendations, if the political will was there.  We welcome what is being proposed now.  Everybody welcomes it, but it is not new.  Even though it would be my view that one of the reasons for the establishment of the commission was a political decision to head off a lot of political dialogue around the clamour for reform, that does not mean we are saying it was a waste of time, that the witnesses did not do the job they were asked to do or anything like that.  They have had a very good role in engaging in that dialogue throughout the country and having the conversation, to use the buzz words.  I genuinely believe that everybody talking about these issues and bringing them into the report collectively is very important.  I refer to reducing the task of the coroners, not prosecuting in court, serving summonses, prison escorts, the INIS stuff, the procurement, and all of that good stuff that was out there.  It is important to say that because much of the discussion has centred on the points of disagreement or lack of clarity, which I will deal with now.</p><p>The other stuff is good and important.</p><p> On the other stuff, and it could be the lateness of the day, but I am even more concerned now about this idea of the board.  I jotted down a couple of reasons we need it and a couple of points.  One of the things was that garda&iacute; come through the ranks and one could not expect someone who started off as a garda, sitting in a station, drinking tea and scratching himself or whatever, to rise through the ranks and suddenly be able to run an organisation.  I found it a little derogatory to some of our people who are at the top of the Garda.  The point was made that, at a certain point, the internal drive has to come internally at a certain point.  Do the witnesses not think that has begun and is in place internally already?  What do they think Commissioner Drew Harris should be doing that he has not already indicated he is going to do?  Are there no garda&iacute; who have been able to run a police force?  It seems strange that that would be put forward as a reason.  It has been put forward as a management thing.</p></speech>

I was referring to Sir Peter Fahy and myself.  We have been very fortunate to benefit from good educational opportunities earlier in our lives but we still rose through the ranks of policing and I was referring to ourselves in that context and not necessarily to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is typical.  Our experience is not dissimilar to police services elsewhere and, I would suggest, probably the police service in Ireland.  Once a person focuses on his or her police career, traditionally that focus has been primarily in the area of policing, investigations and security and, as that person comes up through the ranks, those are the things he or she learns as part of the police craft.  That needs to be supplemented.</p> <p>  I remember being put into a position, after being a Boston police officer for many years, where I was suddenly responsible for the whole justice portfolio in the state of Massachusetts and I had responsibility for 20 agencies, more than 10,000 employees and an operating budget of in excess of $1 billion.  I needed to surround myself with people who had serious business acumen and experience in areas of finance and HR because I was not an expert in those particular areas.  I was the policing and public safety expert and, as a team, we needed to be a cohesive team that included people with a variety of skill sets.  I have great respect for the many very smart people in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am just saying that the entire team has to be a diverse team of people representing different skill sets and, traditionally in policing, most of us who have risen to the position of chief or commissioner have focused primarily on the police craft.  I would never intend to insult.  I was referring to my own, personal experience and Sir Peter Fahy has concurred with that in the past.  I thank the Deputy for allowing me to clarify that.</p></speech>

The point I am trying to make is that we would all agree that the organisation should be run better, run well and managed properly.  No one is going to be opposed to that, but that is a bit of a red herring in terms of this discussion in some ways.  The Garda has a director of HR, a finance operator and so on.  That is who is getting up to speed on computers.  There was never before a director of IT in An Garda because there were no computers years ago.  Society evolves and An Garda needs to manage, but it has nothing to do with oversight and accountability, and yet the text of the document is proposing that An Garda is firstly accountable to this board.  They are the people who deal with appointments and my concern is that this is resulting in more control internally.  It is an internal board that is making the appointments and decisions and, in essence, that is where the clout is.</p></speech>

It cannot be entirely externally driven.  Given the scale of the organisation, what has to be done and the political context it exists in, and should exist in, it cannot avoid that.  That is a democratic reality and one has to augment what is there.  All the people who exist at the senior management level, or HR or whatever, are members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, whether civilian or sworn, but this board is not.  The board would be people who are not members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and it would have a non-executive independent chair.  It is not that they are going to be sitting there, as a board, making these appointments day in, day out.  They will use the facilities that exist for making appointments through the Public Appointments Service, or some other independent mechanism, and then deal with those recommendations.  There is nothing to say, for example, that if a board was being constituted to make particular appointments, that somebody from the Policing and Community Safety Oversight Commission, PCSOC, could not be on the board.  That is the way these things happen all the time and they would simply approve them in that setting.  Again there is nothing to suggest that a board would not adopt very transparent processes.  The way some State boards operate, their minutes can be read and detailed or whatever online.  We need to be careful not to caricature what is being proposed here.  It is a serious attempt to address the complex issues and it is offered in that particular way.</p> <p>  It is also a link to the suggestion that the Commissioner is the CEO and should be empowered as such, but if he or she is empowered to act as a CEO, that also means that he or she has to be accountable properly and has to be responsible for the exercise of his or her powers, but they also have to be resourced.  We are not saying that somebody who comes up through the ranks will not have all of the abilities to be the Commissioner.  Clearly she or he will have those abilities, but they have to be augmented with this level of assistance that is not the assistance one gets from one's management team, which is part of one's team.  That is truly internal.  This is at arm's length from what is going on internally and is the proper proximity, but the proper distance as well, from the operational detail of policing.</p></speech>

I actually do not understand it and I understand it less now because it smacks of a halfway house.  On the one hand, the witnesses have spent a lot of time dealing with the fact that it is internal, it is management, governance and all that good stuff that is, as the witnesses said, for the people to whom I referred, like the directors of HR or whoever, their day-to-day bread and butter.  There is this other crowd who do not do that day-to-day stuff but who might include the HR director of some multinational or whatever, and they tell the Garda that it could be doing this differently or they will have an input on that.  The problem is this is being used as a justification to take powers from the external oversight body.  We have the new PCSOC, the amalgamation of the Policing Authority and the Garda Inspectorate, but with a lot of the functions of the Policing Authority not transferring.  This internal board is getting a lot of powers, particularly the power of appointments.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses not think that the expertise they talk about exists in the Policing Authority in Northern Ireland, for example, that it has that broader expertise that the witnesses are talking about transferring to the board, and it has an influence over appointments and a better balance than what we are proposing to do now?  Maybe this could be built in, because it must be seen in the context of where we have come from.  I would like the witnesses to make a point of reading the observations in the report of Mr. Justice Charleton.  It is not the witnesses' faults if they have not had a chance to read it, and I am not blaming them, but his conclusions were very illuminating and this is an individual who has been involved since the time of the Morris tribunal.  He talked about the need to change the culture and said the mistake that had been made was in the setting up of structures and responding in structures.  That is kind of what the witnesses done here.  I am not saying, in terms of the controversial bits, that there is not a lot of other good stuff that will help.</p> <p>  Why do the witnesses think the culture is as bad as it is?  The witnesses can disagree, but I think one of the reasons is because appointments were made internally and related to who was pally with the Commissioner, who came up through the ranks and people were getting appointed to senior level not on the basis of merit but rather on who they knew.</p><p>This was done internally, and there was too much of political influence between the Department of Justice and Equality and the Commissioner.  We had moved a bit of the way to give the Policing Authority the power to begin the job of oversight, but that is all we gave it.  We did not give it the full package because many appointments were made before it was set up.  We did not give it the chance to deal with the Commissioner, but the basic structure was in place.  Instead of taking that to its logical conclusion to develop an authority with teeth, the expertise the witnesses are talking about and accountability over the Commissioner, we have taken it from the authority and given back that power to the Garda Commissioner and the Department.  In fairness, the Toland report made the point that the Department has never used its powers to hold the Garda to account.  Why did the witnesses choose to go that way?  I know I have thrown quite a few questions at them.  They say the new policing and community safety oversight commission, PCSoc, has greater powers of oversight.  What are they because I cannot see any-----</p></speech>

They agree unequivocally with us in their second progress report published a week or two ago.  That derived directly from the Toland report.  Ms O'Toole was a member of the Toland review group.</p> <p>  There is a lot in what the Deputy said.  To try to unpick some of it, our starting position is that governance and oversight ought not to be located in one entity.  That is what informs our view that we locate oversight properly and effectively in PCSoc.  One of the governance functions is the making or approving of appointments, which again can be done properly at one remove from a board in accordance with normal public sector practice.  I do not believe that was the most important thing the authority did.  The most important thing it did since its foundation was to implement its oversight function regarding policing externally.  In that context, therefore, that is the rationale for what we propose.</p> <p>  It appears to the Deputy that we are transferring a good deal of power to the Commissioner.  If a Commissioner does not have powers, how can he or she be accountable for something for which he or she does not have power?  If we are telling a Commissioner that he or she must now lead an organisation in respect of which there is a significant change agenda, which is ambitious, he or she has to be empowered and resourced to do that but, equally, held accountable.  If we are saying we do not want this cosy relationship with the Department or one that is too involved, the board must create an accountability mechanism independent of that.  That creates, we hope, a functioning accountability platform for the Commissioner in that sense so that he or she is accounting for what he or she does, but he or she is also empowered to do it.  To date, that has been something of a difficulty.  That is our rationale, as I see it, for this proposal.</p></speech>

He or she can appoint people with whom he or she can work effectively, and all of those people work subject to their own accountability mechanism.  They have to be able to do their jobs, etc.  If the Deputy's view is that everything can be driven externally by a body that is doing oversight, regulating the police and running the police, we respectfully disagree.  We say the police, through its own entity, has to run An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, be accountable and have oversight.  That is the coherence of our view.</p></speech>

What has your board told you to do or how has your board responded?".  It is not at all the case that this will in some sense diminish the level of effectiveness.

In fairness, the authority was given inadequate legislation to do that job and be in a sufficiently strong position to carry out that mandate.  We were very critical of its establishment precisely because of that.  Had it been properly armed and if we had a real policing authority - Deputy Wallace proposed legislation on two occasions to properly arm a genuinely independent policing authority, which would mean breaking that link with the Minister for Justice and Equality, particularly at Commissioner level - it could have gone the next step further.  There is a view, including among senior garda&iacute;, that the authority was doing a pretty good job, given-----</p></speech>

It certainly is about culture and we are clear on that.  In fact, culture is the first issue mentioned in the issues itemised by Ms O'Toole at the beginning, but structures must be addressed as well.  It was part of our terms of reference.  However, by no means would we ever say that if the structures are dealt with, everything would be right.  That would not make sense.</p></speech>

It is a huge blow to morale if people think that a promotion appointment process is not legitimate.</p></speech>

On the point Ms O'Toole is making, it is about the recruitment of the right people, proper training of those people, proper performance management of those people and proper objectives being set.  If there is a good performance management system in place, one uses that as a means by which to decide on promotions.  That is a gap at present and it definitely must be strengthened.  That is one of the key matters that can change culture.</p></speech>

It is an independent officer who would make a call on those questions.  Clearly, the normal guarantees of independence would have to be put in place for that.  That officer would have access to all sorts of material and documents that would not be generally available to other scrutineers or overseers.  We met two former holders of that position in the UK.  The current holder, Mr. Max Hill, has just become Director of Public Prosecutions in the UK.  We met Mr. David Anderson and I cannot remember the name of the other individual we met.  We had lengthy encounters with them about how their powers and functions worked and how they were exercised.  It seemed to be a fairly effective mechanism.  They are high profile people who take very independent stances as to the rights and wrongs of the matters they are tasked with examining.</p></speech>

My question is in the context of implementation.  If this tome were to rest on a shelf and nothing were to happen, it would be not only disrespectful to the work done and the effort applied but would also leave us in a very poor position for many years to come.  It is important to note that across all the members' contributions there was an acknowledgement of agreement with and acceptance of a great deal of the work, although not all and some of that has been highlighted.  However, there is a definite welcome for and endorsement of much of what has been recommended in &quot;The Future of Policing in Ireland&quot;.  Will Ms O'Toole elaborate a little on the commission's indication that it met senior Government leaders?  In her closing remarks, she said that if all the recommendations were implemented, Irish policing would not only regain the ground it had lost compared with other policing jurisdictions but would be at the forefront in the evolution of policing internationally.</p><p>We are all political players, not just in this institution but also in the State, and we are all well aware of the unfortunate silo nature of government.  I listened to Sir Peter Fahy earlier when he was focusing on the other agencies of the State that have a responsibility to step up to the plate, which is not currently the case.  Nine to five from Monday to Friday does not deal with the variety of mental health issues, child welfare issues <i>et al</i>.  Garda&iacute; are invariably the line of contact and the first responders in many of these cases, which are not necessarily in their particular area of expertise although some would have acquired considerable expertise through experience, improved training and so forth.  Can Ms O'Toole give us any indication from those the commission has met, who are not specified in the report, that it is more than just a Department of Justice and Equality consideration and that the Department of Health, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and other Departments would have a role in or responsibility for ensuring the implementation of the new reality we want?  Can she give us a sense of that?  As this is her last engagement in this capacity, as Ms O'Toole exits the stage, does she have confidence regarding the implementation of the report?  Does she have confidence that it will overcome the silo mentality that has dogged governance in this jurisdiction over the years?  What are her expectations?</p></speech>

Policing cannot be left to the police alone.  As I mentioned earlier, more than 80% of what the police do has nothing to do with law enforcement.  It is addressing community needs and the needs of the most vulnerable in communities.  We will only develop successful policing strategies if we work with multidisciplinary approaches.  We worked our consultation process around that.  We engaged with many other Departments and, indeed, received submissions from them.</p><p>In our reports we have provided a list of the Departments and people with whom we engaged.  We are in the process of publishing, with the appropriate redactions necessary under the law, all of the submissions received.  Those who review them will have an appreciation of the very broad input received.  I would not have spent the last year and a half working on this initiative if I had not truly believed there was an appetite for change.  For me, to some extent, it was unfinished business because when I left here as chief inspector, I was frustrated.  We had put a lot of great ideas on the table, but the Government at the time necessarily became distracted by the economic crisis and police reform was placed on the back burner.  In recent years it became apparent hat something had to be done and this is the time to do it.  </p><p> The commission had no agenda other than getting this right and we worked to get it right.  The report is a reflection of what we heard, including from people in this building and people who lived and worked in communities throughout the country.  On my reference to Government leaders, I use the term broadly, but we met all of the parties.  We also encountered colleagues of many committee members at the public meetings we held throughout the country.  The Ceann Comhairle hosted a reception in order that Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas would have an opportunity to meet and talk to us.  We accepted written submissions from most parties.  I hope most will see our work as a reflection of their input and feedback.  While there are still some questions to be answered and clarification is required, I am heartened by the response which I did not expect to be as universally positive as it has been.  I attended a meeting yesterday with representatives of eight Departments which had come together in the early weeks following publication of our report to determine what each of them would have to contribute in the implementation of the report.  For me, that was reassuring.  I also worked with the Patten Commission in Northern Ireland and we had to wait for a year or two before we saw any progress because of the political position at the time.  Thankfully, people seem to digging in and following up very soon after publication of the report.  As I said, I am sure my esteemed colleagues and I would not have spent all of this time on the report unless we believed it was an important time, that we could make a significant contribution and that the report would be received and implemented.  I am very optimistic.</p></speech>

I am heartened to hear that so many Departments were directly involved in the most recent engagement.  It is important that it be recognised and accepted that implementation of what is recommended is not just the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality alone.  If we are to see real change, an embrace across government will be required.  There must be fundamental changes to the employment reality, particularly the arrangements for the employment of people with particular skills and expertise who are not part of policing but who should be first responders post-5 p.m. and at weekends such that we will no longer depend on the Garda to intervene.</p> <p>  I thank Ms O'Toole for her leadership of the commission and its work and also for her engagement with the committee which also comprises 11 members.  I noted with interest the statement that there was not always unanimity among the membership of the commission.  Yesterday and earlier today I worked with the clerk to the committee on a report to be brought before the committee for adoption on which I am sure there will not be unanimity.  The committee has been very lucky in seeing the adoption of a lot of its reports, but I do not expect that it will be able to sign off on this report unanimously.  We will have a different set of recommendations.  Our respective roles mirror each other to some extent.  I again thank Ms O'Toole and all those who have served on the commission for their work.  I wish her, Sir Peter Fahy, Ms Helen Ryan, Professor Donncha O Connell and all those who have served on the commission good luck and the very best for the future.</p></speech>
