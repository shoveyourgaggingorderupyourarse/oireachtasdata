He is accompanied by Ms Maureen Mulligan, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Farrell.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is minutes.  We are dealing with minutes from a number of previous meetings that have been circulated.  I refer to the minutes of the meetings on 11, 18 and 25 October and on 15 and 22 November.  There is one slight change of wording to be made to the minutes of the meeting on 8 November, as circulated.  I will ask the clerk to the committee to make that one change and re-circulate.  I propose we note the minutes.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  The next item is matters arising from the minutes.  If members have matters arising out of the minutes, they might hold them over until next week as they will have an opportunity to go through them.</p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence.  There are three categories of correspondence, the first of which is briefing documents and opening statements for today's meeting.  The two items, correspondence Nos. 1771 A and 1772 A, dated 4 November, from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, provide briefing material and an opening statement for today's meeting.  I propose we note and publish those documents.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We also have No. 1777 A, dated 5 November, from the same Department, providing further briefing material for today's meeting.  We have been asked not to publish No. 1777 A and I propose we agree to that request, at least for the moment.  I propose we note No. 1777 A.  It has been circulated to the committee.  Inevitably, it will be discussed here today.  On the question of publication of that document, it may contain confidential, commercially sensitive information.  We can come back to it.  For now, I propose we note, but not publish, it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-06a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018120600002#B00400"><p>We will discuss with the Department what particular aspect it has an issue with publishing.  For now, we will abide by the Department's request.  We will not publish it at this stage.</p><p>The next item of correspondence is in category B - correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to previous Committee of Public Accounts meetings.  There is one item, No. 1703 B, held over from the previous meeting.  It is from the CEO of the Local Government Management Agency, dated 2 November 2018, in relation to a request from the committee for a copy of its report arising from the value for money review of Irish Public Bodies.  The report is subject to a non-disclosure agreement between LGMA, Irish public bodies and PricewaterhouseCoopers dated 2 September 2015.  The CEO has written to Irish Public Bodies, IPB, and PricewaterhouseCoopers, PWC, to request their consent for LGMA to release the report to the committee and is awaiting a response.  We will keep the committee updated on that.  For now, I propose we note and publish that response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Correspondence No. 1753 B from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director of the HSE, provides an information note requested by the committee on former Console staff.  This is an important piece of correspondence that we want to deal with, if we can call it up on the screens.  Essentially, we had asked that compensation be made available on an <i>ex-gratia</i>basis to staff who were not re-employed.  We included it as a recommendation in a previous periodic report.  We also asked the Minister to examine the matter.  The response is good and I want to put it on the public record.  The HSE states that it understands from Pieta House there were 55 pre-existing employees of Console in 2016.  The HSE confirmed that it offered 52 contracts to staff previously employed by Console.  This comprised ten employees of Console and 42 persons, mainly counsellors, on contracts for services or sessional work with Console.  Pieta House did not offer contracts to three former Console employees, who included the former CEO and two others who decided to seek employment elsewhere.  Of the 52 contracts that were offered by Pieta House, 47 contracts were accepted comprising ten employees and 37 contracts for service sessional work.  Effectively, Pieta House has done as much as the committee was looking for on this.  A couple of people who did not work there, and, obviously, the CEO, were not offered contracts.  They offered contracts to everybody else, most of whom took them up.  As for those who chose to work elsewhere, that is their own affair.  It took a long time to get to that point.  We have been following this for quite a long time.  I acknowledge that it is good to receive that information at this time.</p></speech>

We understand, from Pieta House, that there were 55 pre-existing employees.  It looks good that it offered 52 contracts, but these were to ten employees of Console and 42 persons on contracts for service.  The Chairman is taking it that they are all included.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-06a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018120600002#B01800"><p>I do not know.  Deputy Connolly has pointed out an obvious issue.  We will ask for clarification on that point.  If it is as it appears, that is great.  If there is a subtle distinction in the letter that the Deputy has spotted, we need to know about it.  We will ask for confirmation of that particular point.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1754 B from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General, Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, dated 27 November 2018, providing information notes requested by the committee on a variety of points that we raised with him at the previous meeting.  We will have a second meeting on the housing issue in the new year.  Mr. McCarthy follows up on a number of issues.  These are the new regulations for short-term lettings; transfer of funds; the prevention of emergency accommodation being used for families; differential rents which accrued to local authorities; findings of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive; funding of family hub accommodation; breakdown of housing expenditure in 2017 and 2018; regeneration programme details; projected number of homes that could be accommodated on local authority housing lands and the extent of loans attached; children in emergency accommodation; annual assessment of social housing applications received by each local authority and the targets set; different organisations and capital loan schemes in the context of the amounts outstanding, capital advance leasing facilities etc. and where there is an overlap of functions of agencies; credit policy governing loan approval, with reference to separated couples; and lending arrangements in place for approved housing bodies.</p><p>That will be useful feeding into our meeting and report on housing in the new year.  We will certainly note and publish the correspondence for now.  We will hold the matter over for discussion on that day.</p><p> There is, however, one issue that is wholly unsatisfactory.  I specifically tabled parliamentary questions asking about the credit policy used by local authorities to determine whether a person is eligible for a loan under the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme.  We all know that approximately 50% of people who apply do not get it.  Many Deputies have raised the matter.  I raised the matter as a Topical Issue and through parliamentary questions.  I was told the matter was confidential and commercially sensitive.  I was told the requested information could not be released and so on.  When the Secretary General was before the committee we asked him for a copy of the document.  If it is the basis on which taxpayers' money is being advanced to people who are purchasing loans, then we are entitled to see the nature of it.</p><p> The Secretary General has given us a document.  The reference number is 1754 and it is document number 4 in that group.  I wish to put on record that this document is totally unsatisfactory and I want the public to know the response we got from the Department.  Committee members can bring up the document on their screens.  Pages 1 to 3 are fine.  Then, we get to page 4.  There are already redactions relating to fixed rate loans and variable rate loans.  Two paragraphs are fully redacted.  That is unacceptable from our point of view.  Page 5 seems fine.  Page 6 contains serious redaction and we do not know what it is about.  Those responsible have blanked out page 7 in its entirety.  Page 8 has serious redaction relating to the source of the applicant's equity.  Page 9 has another serious redaction relating to the employed applicants.  There is another serious redaction on page 9 relating to self-employed applicants.  Page 10 seems okay.  They have blanked out pages 11, 12 and 13 entirely.  Page 14 seems okay.  Pages 15, 16 and 17 are fine.  Page 18 is blanked out in its entirety.  Page 19 is substantially redacted and blanked out.  Page 20 is blanked out in the section dealing with exceptions to policy.  People would like to know what the exceptions are.  There is an evaluation report at the end and explanatory notes as well.</p><p> Information was sought by the Committee of Public Accounts in the interests of the public from the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government relating to the credit policy for 2018, which is drawn up under SI 25 of 2018.  The response is wholly and totally unacceptable.  We have been told that traditionally the Department does not give people access to credit policies and banks may not make such policy.  However, in this situation what is at issue is public money.  We are going back to ask the Department to reconsider the matter and provide more detail.  We are going back to ask for the full unredacted copy to be supplied to us.</p><p> If the Secretary General has issues in that regard he should, in respect of each redaction, give the specific reason he has chosen to redact each sentence as well as the pages that are blank.  Half of the document has been blanked out.  It is no way for an Accounting Officer to treat the Committee of Public Accounts.  I hope he gets that message.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> I am amazed because this is my fourth attempt to see the document.  People will know that, especially with 50% refusal, there is much in the blanked out document that is preventing the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme from achieving what we and the public believe it was meant to achieve in the first place.  Anyway, I have made the point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-06a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018120600002#C00200"><p>I wish to make one point on the home loan scheme.  I agree with all that you have said, Chairman, in respect of understanding the workings of the scheme.  There are people who have gone through the whole system but still have not been allocated a loan, because the local authority has to negotiate with the Department.  It seems that each local authority has to do it.  We have found this in Kildare and perhaps you find the same in Laois, Chairman.  We find that there many applications to buy coming from other counties.  We might have more because of value or the price of houses.  Anyway, some people have got through the whole system but the money is not available to allow the mortgage to go ahead.  It is inhibiting a good scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-06a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018120600002#C00300"><p>I wish to make a broader point &ndash; I will conclude on this &ndash; on the concept of having a credit policy drafted by the Department to be implemented by 31 different local authorities, 31 different housing officers and all the staff under them.  All those involved have varying levels of training on how to process applications.  Some counties have small numbers while others have big numbers.  The expertise within the local authorities cannot be consistent throughout the country, almost by definition.  I am not calling for the administration to be centralised but we are guaranteed inconsistency in the delivery of the scheme if it is being farmed out to 31 local authorities.  We all know it.  The staff who are administering the scheme were probably in the motor tax office last year, in the planning department the year before and in water services the year before that.  They may not have spent time in the housing or finance department, as the case may be.  We do not necessarily have people with financial competence in the area of granting loans or dealing with applications in the various local authorities.  Consistency is another issue.  I am sorry but committee members can see that I am annoyed by this.  This is my fourth attempt to see the document.</p></speech>

I do not understand why it is redacted.  At the very least the Department should have explained it to us.  It is a credit policy.  I do not understand it.  Maybe the Comptroller and Auditor General might help us on what might be sensitive in what is a document of general policy.</p></speech>

Committee members will see the net need figures.  There is an inset with the information.  The figures on the waiting list have reduced.  The total number of qualified households in 2018 has reduced significantly from 2017.  That should be a good news story but it is important to clarify this.  Let us consider the criteria set out on the page.  Who is left out of the assessment?  Anyone receiving the housing assistance payment is left out of the assessment.  We know the figures for HAP doubled last year and the allocation became &euro;300 million.  The figure for next year will be &euro;431 million.  Those in receipt are in the private market with no security of tenure.  It is costing a fortune in taxpayers' money &ndash; that is why we are mentioning it.  They are excluded completely and so are those in the rental accommodation scheme.  It is the exclusion of people who are still in need.  That is really what is difficult.  They are on a waiting list but when they go into these schemes they are off the waiting list but they are put on a transfer list.</p> <p>  I know we abolished limbo, but limbo is alive and well somewhere in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We need to put this in context.  When we see these figures reducing, it should be a good news story except that the figures are not reducing in any way.  While the figures in the document are going down, other figures have gone up.</p></speech>

It was extraordinary that we were not able to get from the departmental officials information such as how many people were on HAP transfers.  They said they did not have it; the local authorities have it.  We are trying to get the local authority managers to come before the committee and they are refusing to do it.  That all needs to be settled before we come back in January and deal with this in a more substantive way.</p><p> In fairness it was an assistant principal from the Department who might not have been in a position to answer all the questions we had anyway.  Even at that, I found some of the responses from the Department extraordinary.  This plays into it.  Before we come back to this in January we need to look at the information we sought but did not get because they did not have it.  We need to get some response from local authorities.  It is not good enough for the Department to claim that the local authorities hold the information but it has not asked them for it.  We have asked representatives of the local authorities but they will not appear before the committee.  We are missing a big piece of the jigsaw.</p></speech>

We need to get the breakdown by local authority.</p> <p>  On the credit policy, I am told it is historical.  They never published it in the past.  The tradition is alive and well.  It may be a Victorian rule not to tell the people what is going on; I do not know.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1755 is from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General, Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, providing information requested by the committee.  It relates to our periodic report No. 2.  He has come back with details of medical assessors and overpayments.  I do not believe that relates specifically to last week's meeting, but to a previous request for information.  We note and publish that.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1756 is from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, providing information on historic landfill remediation sites, moneys recouped in respect of these and the working group on greenhouse gas emissions.  We note and publish this.  Members can raise it with the Secretary General in public session today.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1757 is from the general manager of Tusla, stating that an item which we dealt with last week as correspondence No. 1738 is not complete and that we will get a full response shortly.  We note this and publish that correspondence.  We await the full response. </p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1758 is from the Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, providing information requested by the committee on the decision-making process on the acquisition of the Harold's Cross Stadium site; how the final sum was agreed; and the circumstances which gave rise to the Department contacting the Valuation Office with reference to the protocols for transfer.  We note and publish that.  Obviously we will have a discussion on this.</p></speech>

That is my assessment.  I get very frustrated with the Department of Education and Skills because that seems to be its <i>modus operandi</i>.  The answer we got is not sufficient at any level.  We asked the Department how the valuation was arrived at.  The response we got was that was what the Valuation Office arrived at, but no rationale behind it.  We know it arrived at that figure, but wanted to know the reason for it.  We wanted to know how it arrived at the &euro;23 million figure which seemed to coincide with the Irish Greyhound Board debt.  As the reply is not sufficient, we should go back to him and say he is stating the obvious, but that is not what we asked.</p></speech>

It just refers to the protocol for transfer.  We are writing to the Valuation Office.  The Valuation Office came into the process because it is a transfer between two State bodies and the Valuation Office acts as an independent arbiter of what is in the overall interests of the taxpayer - not necessarily either Department.  It could involve transferring IDA Ireland land to a local authority for housing.  There are many factors.</p> <p>  We are writing to the Valuation Office asking for a list of each property it was asked to value in 2017 and 2018 to date involving the transfer from one State body to another.  We want a summary of the number of hectares and value per hectare it set.  If we see this &euro;23 million is the norm for valuations of other transfers between State bodies, it is well and good.  If it is an outlier, we will want further information on that.</p> <p>  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General know if there are many of these transactions every year?  Would there be dozens or hundreds?</p></speech>

That was all assumed in advance.  As it was for a school, it may not be an invalid assumption that councillors would support a material contravention for a school site.  We agree most councillors would.  However, we need specifics and the comparisons used.  I take the point that when we get that answer there may or may not be a broader issue at that stage.  We will ask Valuation Office the basis of the valuation and the comparisons it used to come up with that valuation.  We note and publish that.  That letter will go to the Valuation Office.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1761 is from NAMA on Project Nantes giving a breakdown of the &euro;24 billion in asset sales categorised by the jurisdiction of purchaser and the application of section 172 of the National Asset Management Agency Act.  We will put that up on the screen.  There was the issue of the &euro;11 billion from loan sales and the &euro;24 billion from asset sales.  NAMA stands over the original information it gave on the jurisdiction and origins of the entities or persons that became the ultimate beneficial owners of assets.  As of now we will accept that in good faith.</p> <p>  The detail it gives on section 172 of the National Asset Management Agency Act will be of interest to some people.</p><p>The second paragraph on page 2 states:</p><blockquote>In summary, the legal analysis concludes that the acquisition of these loans by a company, of which the person concerned is one of five directors, was not a contravention of Section 172(3) of the NAMA Act, 2009.  Neither was the transaction in any way &quot;illegal&quot; ...</blockquote><p>We did not go there.  Somebody else may have said that.  Essentially it states the acquisition of these loans by a company, of which one of the persons concerned is a director, was not a contravention of the original definition of what was covered by section 172.  Maybe that was always the original intention.  I do not know.  It states what it did was not a contravention.</p></speech>

I do not have the resources to be able to delve into a lot of what is coming our way.  Much of it could be irrelevant.  We do not know.

To assist in completing the analysis phase, discussions will commence over the coming weeks with those concerned and this process will continue into the New Year.  As you can appreciate each individual case has its own set of circumstances and full due diligence is required in reaching the appropriate determination as was communicated on publication of the review in June.<br /><br />A policy has been developed which will take effect in January 2019 and is currently undergoing internal review.  We will share with you once finalised.</blockquote></speech>

I have to say I am not pleased with this letter.  It raises more questions than answers.  It does not answer the questions we asked.  It does not state how many of the individual cases have been dealt with so far, which is the substantive question that was asked.  A total of 157 cases need to be examined.  We do not have any detailed analysis.  The letter states ongoing detailed analysis is being done.  What detailed analysis?  How many cases have been done?</p> <p>  What is more important for me is that it seems to suggest this issue has to do with individuals, that it is being looking at on a case-by-case basis and there is a review of each individual case.  Where is the review of management practices?  Where is the review of HR practices?  These 157 people found themselves on self-employed contracts.  We had a hearing and we heard from RT&Eacute;.  Even one of the RT&Eacute; presenters who had been speaking to staff said these people were not given a choice.  They found themselves on these contracts and not because they wanted them.  This is not about putting the responsibility back on the 157 individuals.  The question is why were they put in that position.  Was it a management practice by RT&Eacute;?  Are HR issues raised here?</p> <p>  It is disingenuous, to say the least, to try to suggest in the letter that the issue needs to be resolved by looking at it on an individual case-by-case basis.  Potentially, it was a more systemic managerial issue that led to these people being on these contracts in the first place.  The letter does not give us the information we sought, which is how many of the 157 cases have been dealt with and how many people have been spoken to.  This needs to be done to determine whether they should now be on proper contracts.  Where is the review of the management of RT&Eacute; and its HR processes?  We need to get this.  If it means having Ms Forbes back before the Committee of Public Accounts then so be it.  That is what needs to happen.  I am not at all satisfied with this response.</p></speech>

To anybody who felt we were going to receive the report, I apologise.  I inadvertently assumed we would have it today.  In any event, we will write to the director general asking about the points raised by the Deputy.  The last paragraph states, "A policy has been developed which will take effect in January 2019".  Regardless of the specifics of individual cases RT&Eacute; has looked at its policy and now has a new policy.  We want to know what led to the change of policy.  We are not looking at the individual cases.  We want to know what was the previous policy, what are the changes, what policy is taking effect and why has there been a change.  There are specific circumstances for individuals.  RT&Eacute; seems to accept that a new policy is required for January 2019.  We want to know why it came to this conclusion and give us the details and a copy of the new policy.</p></speech>

We will come back to this.  A letter is going out on the issue on which we will follow up.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1767 B is from the clerk to the Committee on Procedure, dated 30 November 2018, forwarding a complaint on matters raised by the committee in advance of the recent presidential election.  The complainant believes the committee raised the matter of presidential expenses in order that it would become an issue in the election and be used as a weapon to damage the chances of the incumbent being re-elected.  As Chairman, I reject that entirely.  We will note and publish the item.</p><p>We have not been asked by the Committee on Procedure to respond to that letter, but we may choose next week to respond or to note and publish it.  If it identifies the private citizen who has made the complaint about the Committee on Public Accounts we will ensure that his or her name, or any information that could identify him or her, is redacted but I think we should publish the substance of the complaint.  We are big enough to take complaints on the chin and we will not publish them.  People often make remarks that we may or may not agree with.  I will ask the secretariat to scrutinise the letter to ensure there is nothing therein which if published would identify the correspondent.  I would like the substance of the complaint published even though it is not flattering from the committee's point of view.  We may decide to respond or not, as the case may be, next week.  </p></speech>

I am told we have a letter on the issue, which will be dealt with at next week's meeting.  If we are not satisfied with that we will take it up further next week.  On the letter regarding open disclosure, we are coming back to the issue of medical negligence because we have not yet completed our work in that regard.  We will hold this correspondence as part of our ongoing work on that issue.  There is interesting information in this documentation regarding the processing of claims.  We will note and publish this correspondence but it will form part of our future work.</p><p><b></b>Correspondence 1769B is<b></b>from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills providing information on the potential risk caused by the weaknesses in the accounting system following the transfer of the training centre accounting system from F&Aacute;S and the internal audit function for each of the education and training boards.  We will note and publish this correspondence, which makes for detailed reading in regard to the ETBs.  According to the correspondence, which I read yesterday, the ETBs were established in 2013 and they hope to commence phased implementation of the payroll shared service next year and to commence phased implementation of the financial shared services system in 2020.  Seven years after these organisations were established they are only centralising these services.  They accept that the number of people in the internal audit function, which is based in Cavan, is not sufficient and they had recruited a number of additional staff but three of them left because the amount of time spent travelling from Cavan to Waterford, Wexford and Cork and so on did not suit them.  They now have a minimal staff complement, with three staff on contract from a consultancy company.  They accept that they did not have adequate internal audit facilities available in 2017.  It is a factual letter, setting out the position warts and all, acknowledging failures and the difficulties involved in terms of making improvements.  They also acknowledge how long it has taken to get to this point since the establishment of the ETBs in 2013, which is a lesson we are learning for all new public bodies.  There was a similar issue with the establishment of the Tax Appeals Commission.  When a body is being established nobody comprehends there will be an increase in workload.  This is a previous example that also is coming back to haunt us. </p><p>The ETBs have appeared before us previously.  They have moved from only one having its accounts for audit within three months of the year-end to all now being on time.  We met four of them recently, when we highlighted this issue extensively.  The ETB network in Ireland has acknowledged the work of the Committee of Public Accounts in putting pressure on the Department of Education and Skills to provide additional resources and so on.  We have achieved a lot in this sector.  </p><p>Would Mr. McCarthy like to comment?</p></speech>

Looking at the compiled accounts, the scale of absence in regard to internal audit was way under what is required for a sector on that scale and with that level of complexity.  As the Chairman said, it is good to have that type of information at a co-ordinated level.  As can be noted from the financial statements, one of the ETBs has recently submitted for 2017, in which, again, it draws attention to the same points.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the ETBs do very good work and that amalgamations are not easy.  That said, we do not learn lessons.  The committee's work is, in part, reviewing processes and process failures.  These are not going to be the last amalgamations.  It appears that in such processes, consideration is given to only a small number of issues rather than the broad sweep of issues arising.  The Chairman mentioned the Tax Appeals Commission.  We heard from officials of the commission that its computers were bursting into flames.  How do we ensure that in an amalgamations process, consideration is given to a broader range of issues by a range of Departments such that we do learn some lessons?</p></speech>

I suggest that when the legislation for the new body is being drafted it include a section devoted to how it is to be resourced and funded.  Currently, legislation is being drafted to give organisations the statutory powers to establish a board and hire a chief executive, with no detail as to who is to do the job.  Our interim report specifically referenced that the Department of Finance had failed in its planning in regard to the establishment of the Tax Appeals Commission on an independent statutory basis.</p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform must learn from that lesson and draw up a plan in respect of any new such bodies.  I am conscious that one was announced two days ago.  There will be an opportunity for those organisations, especially Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to learn in advance in respect of any new organisation.  That is my observation of where we are at now.</p></speech>

I welcome this from the Department.  The education and training boards, ETBs, are saying openly that they have no staff.  They are identifying the problems, so they are coming forward.  The committee has a role in encouraging people in that regard.  We cannot have good governance if they do not identify the gaps, inform us and then put pressure on the Department.  If that is a process that has started, I welcome it.  It is difficult to be on the ground and hearing about problems with computers and shared systems that should be sorted out but have not been sorted out, through no fault of the staff.</p> <p>  On the general point, we are about to amalgamate Galway city and county councils on no other basis than that bigger is better.  We certainly are not learning-----</p></speech>

The interim report which recommends the amalgamation included a condition precedent that we deal with staff and resources first.  The report states that staff and resources should be dealt with and it would seem that the cost implications, depending on one's interpretation, will be greater for the amalgamation.  The ETBs seem to be learning but are the powers above this committee also learning?</p></speech>

The risks are certainly there and keeping a focus on the types of governance arrangements that are being put in place, and whether they are working, is vital.</p></speech>

I know from a briefing I received on the merger of the Waterford and Carlow institutes of technology that the last big piece of the jigsaw being looked at is the change management strategy.  It would be interesting for us to look at whether there is a separate change management strategy for each of the mergers, for example.  They are all different because we are looking at corporate headquarters and so on, but it is the governance model in which I am most interested.  What is the relationship within the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and that process?  Will the governance model be consistent because we have had inconsistencies across the board in the past?  I know that is a separate issue but, in the same vein, it is something we need to be watching, as the committee was across the technological university process in terms of cost.  Governance will be a critical piece that the technological universities will have to get right. </p></speech>

However, perhaps the Oireachtas should be more proactive in respect of some of the others that will be established in future.</p></speech>

Some of them only run to a page.  If there was a regulatory impact template was in place, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform could do a post mortem, as it were, on organisations that have been merged.  We could then end up having issues placed on that template that would not otherwise have been thought of.  As a country, we do not do this type of follow through.</p></speech>

We are still trying to finish out the 2015 financial statements for them.  There were issues that caused the delay.  That would give the committee an opportunity to look at the operation of an ETB and the systems that are in place since the amalgamations have taken place.  Taking that, with the Department, and looking at areas like internal audit and the development of financial management systems might be focus for a related meeting.</p></speech>

No. 1728 is from persons referred to as B and C in University of Limerick, UL.  They continue to have concerns about the current work environment and want to engage with the committee.  We heard recently from the president of UL in respect of the implementation of the Thorn report and I propose we forward that to the individuals in question.  We have also placed the two reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the University of Limerick and Sligo and Waterford Institute of Technology, respectively, on our work programme for the new year.  We need to plan those engagements, which may involve meeting some of the individuals who have been affected by related matters.  Can we agree to that?</p></speech>

I propose that next Thursday we agree a work programme for January and February.  There will definitely be a meeting or two on the third level education sector.  We can discuss next Thursday whether we should have separate meetings for some of the whistleblowers.  That will form our work early in the new year.</p><p><b></b>No. 1770, which is related to the previous correspondence, is from an individual and it relates to University of Limerick.  The person has requested a meeting with the committee.  We will consider that request when we discuss our work programme next week.</p><p><b></b>No. 1762 dated 30 November 2018 is from an individual and relates to illegal records of legal visits.  This is a copy of a letter sent to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office asking that the committee address the matter.  While the issue raised is potentially very serious, it does not fall within the remit of the committee.  I believe this is the matter raised in the media last week about prison staff and the recording of what people understand to be legally privileged meetings and visits in prisons.  We are scheduling for next week a meeting with the Prison Service before we break for Christmas.  We will raise that with the Prison Service and the Department of Justice and Equality when their representatives are here in person shortly before Christmas.</p><p><b></b>No. 1766 dated 30 November 2018 is from an individual and concerns land zoning and planning in County Kerry.  Planning matters or matters related to the possible losses to a local economy are not within the remit of the committee and I propose that we inform the individual accordingly.  We will not get into planning matters.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  There have been parliamentary questions on the matter raised and any member is free to pursue it in that context.</p><p>That is the final batch of correspondence.

The Department recruited staff but three of them have since left because the amount of work involved in travelling throughout the country to do internal audits was very difficult for the small group of people involved.

I am not saying that.  However, it ends up costing more money with reports following reports.  Something has to be done in terms of an employment package to attract people.  That is not our area but it becomes our area because it ends up before us in the form of more and more reports.  We had the Thorn report.  We have a list of reports with which we could paper a wall.  That is the message we have to try to send out.  As we have seen everywhere - there is no point in repeating it - it costs more money and the taxpayer ends up paying.</p><p>Correct.</p></speech>

This is a North-South body which administers EU-funded grant schemes and is jointly audited between the Northern Ireland Audit Office and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There is a clear audit opinion.</p> <p>  The next item is the Defence Forces canteen board.  This supervises and ensures financial control over bars, canteens and officers' and non-commissioned officers' and privates' messes.  Turnover in 2017 was &euro;1.8 million.

We will also meet representatives from the Department of Justice, which is the Accounting Officer for the Irish Prison Service.  This will involve Vote 21 - Prisons.  The only time available during that week for a meeting is 9 a.m. on Tuesday, 18 December.  Members wanted the meeting to happen before the end of the year.  I am very pleased that the secretariat and the Department have agreed to facilitate our request to meet that week.  The meeting will last until lunchtime at the maximum because the room is only available up until then.  The issue of a quorum arises.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-06a.160" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018120600002#J00700"><p>I will introduce the Vote and the other chapter.</p> <p>  The appropriation account for Vote 29 - Communications, Climate Action and Environment had total gross expenditure of just over &euro;500 million in 2017.  This was distributed across six expenditure programmes of varying size.  Figure 1, which will appear on screen, indicates how the expenditure under the Vote was divided between the programmes.  Members may wish to note that, in addition, the Department is responsible for management of the environment fund, which is funded from levies on the landfill of waste and on plastic bag usage and accounted for separately from the Vote. </p> <p>  The largest expenditure programme was in relation to broadcasting, accounting for &euro;254 million or more than half of the total spent in 2017.  That programme was substantially funded by television licence fee receipts, which totalled just over &euro;215 million in 2017.  Most of the expenditure under the programme was in the form of grants of almost &euro;185 million to RT&Eacute; and &euro;34 million to Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge.  A total of &euro;14 million was paid into the broadcasting fund and just under &euro;12 million was paid to An Post in respect of its costs for collecting television licence fees on behalf of the Department. </p> <p>  The Department spent &euro;111 million on the energy programme in 2017, of which &euro;90 million was expended on energy efficiency programmes promoted by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  This was a substantial increase from &euro;66 million spent in 2016. </p> <p>  The Department spent over &euro;50 million on the environment and waste management programme in 2017, more than half of which went to support the operations of the Environmental Protection Agency.  In addition, the Department spent over &euro;33 million on environmental projects and initiatives from the environment fund in 2017. </p> <p>  Expenditure on the communications programme in 2017 was &euro;31.5 million.  This included expenditure on the procurement process for the national broadband plan. </p> <p>  The Department spent just over &euro;30 million under the inland fisheries programme, mainly in grant support for Inland Fisheries Ireland.</p><p>Finally, almost &euro;25 million was spent on a range of services covered by the natural resources programme.  Nearly 60% of that expenditure related to the specialist functions and services of the Geological Survey of Ireland.  The net expenditure on the Vote was around &euro;32 million less than was provided for in the 2017 Estimate.  The Department got the agreement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to carry over &euro;6 million in unspent capital funding to 2018.  The balance of &euro;26 million was due for surrender.</p><p> This brief outline of its 2017 expenditure illustrates that the Department funds oversees a broad range of functions, public sector bodies or both, including major commercial State bodies which do not receive ongoing grant funding such as An Post, EirGrid, the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na.  Given the scope of the Department&rsquo;s remit, I have included for the committee&rsquo;s information a diagram which aims to summarise the public bodies within the Department&rsquo;s aegis, indicating those which I audit and those which are outside my remit.</p><p> A key feature of the Department&rsquo;s remit is the long-term nature of many of the issues for which it takes lead responsibility.  The chapters for consideration today deal with aspects of two such issues, namely, cybersecurity and sustainable energy.</p><p> The energy efficiency national fund was established in 2014, using funds of &euro;35 million from the carbon revenue levy, which had been discontinued.  The fund is not accounted for separately but the Department presents a summary of the results for the fund in note 7.2 of the appropriation accounts.  The objectives of the fund are to provide financing to support energy efficiency improvement programmes and measures, as well as to promote the development of a market for energy efficiency improvement measures.</p><p> Rather than investing directly in energy efficiency projects, the Department decided to establish a qualifying investor fund, QIF, managed by fund advisers.  The QIF pooled this funding with private sector funds.  The Department committed to investing up to the full fund amount of &euro;35 million in the QIF.  As of March 2018, private investors had committed up to &euro;38.8 million.  At the time of the finalisation of the chapter, the anticipated investment in energy efficiency projects had not been achieved.</p><p> It was originally envisaged the QIF would invest in projects from its establishment in May 2014 up to May 2017.  The shareholder agreement made provision for this investment period to be extended to May 2018, of which this was availed.  When the agreed investment period closed, the Department had transferred a total of &euro;14 million to the QIF, including &euro;10.8 million contributed only in May 2018, in anticipation of delivery of projects in planning.</p><p> The funds transferred are used to finance energy efficiency projects and to fund the fees and expenses of the QIF.  Based on the State&rsquo;s percentage shareholding in the QIF, the examination estimated that around &euro;2 million of the State&rsquo;s contribution was used to pay fees and expenses.  The value of the State&rsquo;s investment into the future is not known.</p><p> The Department has stated there would be no further transfers from the fund to the QIF and that the balance of &euro;21 million remaining in the fund will be transferred to the climate action fund.</p></speech>

The underspend related primarily to lower than expected expenditure on certain demand-led sustainable energy schemes, the delayed commencement of landfill remediation projects, the national broadband plan, as well as reduced broadcasting expenditure due to lower than forecasted TV licence receipts.  In addition, expenditure of &euro;33 million under the environment fund in 2017 supported further progress in the areas of environmental protection, sustainable development and waste management.</p> <p>  The Department has a key policy development and co-ordination role in Ireland&rsquo;s transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy.  Ireland's first statutory national mitigation plan, published in July 2017, sets out a whole-of-Government approach to tackling greenhouse gas emissions in key sectors, including electricity generation, transport, agriculture and the built environment.  Ireland&rsquo;s first national adaptation framework, approved by the Government in December 2017, sets out our strategy for adaptation measures to reduce the vulnerability of the State to the negative effects of climate change, and also to avail of any positive effects which may occur.</p> <p>  Using less energy, and using it more efficiently, is the most cost effective and accessible way to take action on climate change.  The Department invested a total of &euro;105 million under its energy programme area in 2017.  Of this, capital expenditure of &euro;80 million supported energy efficiency measures in more than 23,500 homes and 491 public, private and commercial buildings, while also supporting around 2,670 jobs across the country.  In tandem with this, measures aimed at decarbonising electricity generation and promoting the electrification of heat and transport were progressed.  Last year saw the approval of two key support schemes for renewable heat and renewable electricity, respectively, with the latter providing pathways and measures to ensure increased community and citizen participation.  Over 900 new electric vehicles were grant-aided in 2017, as we move forward to ensure all new cars and vans sold will be zero emissions, or zero emissions capable by 2030.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General has prepared a chapter with the 2017 appropriation accounts dealing with the national energy efficiency fund.  The fund served to stimulate the market for large scale energy efficiency projects and leverage private investment in this area, at a time when such investment was not evident.  The role of the fund should be seen in the broader context of Exchequer investment in energy efficiency over the past few years.  The greater proportion of the &euro;21 million remaining in this fund will now be diverted to stimulate innovative investments by public and private sector entities under the new climate action fund to further support the decarbonisation effort.  Last week we had the first announcement of seven schemes to be supported by the fund.</p> <p>  Some &euro;26 million of the Department&rsquo;s allocation was spent on communications, multimedia developments and the information society in 2017.  Within this, expenditure to support digital entrepreneurship and to promote digital inclusion among small businesses and citizens under the national digital strategy amounted to &euro;9.4 million.</p> <p>  During 2017, the Department continued to progress the procurement process under the national broadband plan, while commercial investment in high-speed broadband services continued to expand.  Overall, 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in the country had access to quality services at year end.  The overarching policy objective of the plan is to deliver this vital service to the homes, schools, farms and businesses for the 1.1 million people across rural Ireland who will not be provided this service by the commercial sector.  It remains a key priority for the Department.  We have now entered into the final assessment stage of the procurement, with a view to making a recommendation to the Government within the coming weeks.</p> <p>  In other sectorial areas covered by the Department, funding to support public service broadcasting amounted to &euro;253 million in 2017.  Investment of over &euro;91 million was targeted at the sustainable management of our natural resources and inland fisheries, the protection of our natural environment and the transition to a resource-efficient circular economy.</p> <p>  I look forward to assisting the committee members with any questions they may have today.</p></speech>

The area on which I want to focus is broadband.</p><p>There can be some confusion because there are a number of different contracts.  The metropolitan area networks, MANs, which were established in 2004, were purchased by Granahan McCourt Capital in 2013.  There were two concessionary contracts.  One was to run to 2019 and the other was to run to 2024.  In 2017 it was decided to extend those contracts to 2030.  Obviously, they were not going to run out imminently so it was not necessary to do that in 2017, but it was done in March 2017.  In July 2017 the Irish Infrastructure Fund bought 78% of Enet.  That is one of the areas I wish to explore.  First, who was the decision maker who decided to extend the contracts?</p></speech>

We committed to undertaking an analysis of the pricing of the MANs products and that review has just been completed.  We are engaging with the MSE and, having spoken to colleagues, I expect us to be in a position to publish the review before Christmas.  I expect it to be published virtually in full, although there may be one or two matters we may have to redact.

The briefing document the Department provided for the committee stated the report had been completed by the Department in 2016 and that the review established that the MANs programme had proved to be effective.  In a reply to a parliamentary question in January 2017 the Department wrote that it had "recently finalised decisions relating to the management of the MANs to provide that the current Concession Agreements co-terminate in 2030".  It went on to state: "An independent evaluation of the operations of the MANs, including pricing of all MANs products and services to ensure that they are within market norms, is currently under way".  The report stated it had been done, but the parliamentary reply indicated otherwise a year later.  I am, therefore, confused.</p></speech>

There was an internal review by the Department which was supported by the external analysis of Norcontel.  It formed basis of the decision at the end of 2016 and the principle to proceed on the basis of an option to extend.  Between the end of 2016 and March 2017 we entered detailed negotiations with the MSE on issues related to revenue share, claw-back and the management service fee in order that we would achieve an even better outcome for the State.  The final part was completed in March 2017.  We undertook to make the pricing analysis which Analysys Mason was procured to undertake.</p></speech>

We used mechanisms within the Freedom of Information Act to give effect to it.  They were mechanisms put in place by decision makers beyond my level.</p><p>The advice subsequent to the case being lost in the High Court was that we should appeal.  We concurred with that advice.

I want to move on to another item.  An analysis was done by Mr. Colm McCarthy as consultancy work in November 2015 and was provided to the Department.  One area on which it focused was the need, under the public spending code, for a cost-benefit analysis to be undertaken in order that all projects taken on by the State go through a rigorous process to determine which ultimately will be selected.  Was the national broadband plan, or the metropolitan area networks, MANs, contract subject to cost-benefit analysis?</p></speech>

It has been updated on a number of occasions.  In a reply to a parliamentary question, which Deputy Catherine Murphy may not have had an opportunity to read, the Minister stated that a cost-benefit analysis was done in 2002 by Peter Bacon and Associates on the proposed MANs.  To the best of my recollection, I believe that report has been released.  If it has not, we will do that.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Griffin.  There is a crossover in this project with the same entities such as Granahan McCourt Capital, which owned Enet up to 2017.

On the operation of the MANs, we have seen an additional investment of &euro;31 million by Enet, as the management service entity, in upgrading the MANs infrastructure.  That value resides with the State because it owns the MANs.  The MANs network has also been extended by about 30% and, again, the value of that also resides with the State.

What we have seen is a significant take-up on the MANs network by the retail operators in recent years and the selling on of those services.  I will try to find the actual figures because I saw the information in the brief in recent days.  Many of the businesses in the towns served by the MANs network are using fibre.  I will give the example, often quoted, of Coca-Cola in Wexford.  It uses the MANs network.  I will get a list.  If I cannot get my hands on it during the course of the meeting, I will forward it on to the committee later.  There is, however, a very extensive take-up.</p></speech>

I will come back to that but I have the figures now to which I referred earlier.  There are 63 service providers using the MANs infrastructure and 1 million individuals and businesses are benefitting from it, including industrial estates, multinationals, small and medium enterprises, State entities, local authorities and educational institutions.  There is significant take-up of the services.</p></speech>

If we are going to invest money to make us connected and fit for purpose and to ensure rural Ireland can perform to the best it can, the services provided must be attractive for people to take it up.  Otherwise, there is a question mark over that investment.</p></speech>

That is correct.  We will be looking at what has arisen from the Analysys Mason report on pricing to see what needs to be done.  On the specific issue of that library, I would be happy if the Deputy could provide me with the details and I will follow up.</p></speech>

Given that it is the same entity, and the only remaining entity, involved in the current national broadband plan, the information from that report is incredibly important because this is a very expensive project.  We do not know exactly how much it is going to cost, but amounts between &euro;500 million and &euro;3 billion have been mentioned.  We know it is going to be tremendously expensive.  At the very least, we should have information on the affordability, the take-up, the risks etc.  Looking back at the forerunner of this project is probably the best thing to do to make sure this can be a successful project.</p></speech>

The assurance I can give the Deputy on the evaluation of the national broadband plan is that there is massive due diligence ongoing.

That was never envisaged as a purpose.  While it is great if it is possible, it shows the excess capacity that is there.  What I do not understand is the following.  We are here talking about the national broadband plan and the number houses it will serve yet here we have invested in State infrastructure to provide 94 towns with metropolitan area networks and the Department cannot tell us how many houses are connected to it.  Mr. Griffin now tells me the ESB, Siro, Vodafone and others are in the process of starting to take connections from MANs to connect houses.  Why would the MANs not be used in towns to connect houses when they are now deemed suitable to connect as source points for rural broadband?  I do not understand why the houses in those towns are not connected.  There might be certain big company offices or shops.  I cannot understand all the focus on the costs of broadband for the future to connect houses when we have a massive scheme covering 94 urban areas but the Department cannot tell us how many houses are connected to that.  Surely, we should know what is connected to the metropolitan area network.  There is an awful gap in information when the Department is asking us to make a jump to count houses in rural areas but it has not even counted the houses in the urban areas that are already accessible.</p></speech>

At the beginning of November <i>The Irish Times</i>printed figures that it obtained showing that 28,000 homes or as few as 14% of homes availed of Eir broadband out of a total of 200,000 homes.  If the cost for the national broadband programme ranges between &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;3 billion then that suggests the cost of connecting each house would be at best &euro;20,000 per house or, in a worst case scenario, &euro;40,000 per home.

The number of premises passed by Eir is about 211,000.  It has connected over 40,000, which is close to 20%.  If one looks at any international comparator, and Eir's own projections on what it is it would have expected to achieve within that relatively short period of time, it would have been very happy with that level of take up.  There is a lag between houses being passed, services being provided by the retail services, time to connect and all of that.  In fact, when we saw those figures from Eir, and I do not think Eir will have any difficulty with us quoting them because I think they came out with a statement themselves around that time, we would be quite encouraged by the level of take up at this stage.</p></speech>

What analysis has been done on 5G and its provision rather than fibre?  Around the world 5G technology seems to have overtaken fibre as a means of delivering high-speed broadband.  From my uneducated spot, it seems to me that 5G must be cheaper if it could work. </p></speech>

Certainly 5G will allow one to watch a movie on one's phone but it will not allow an architectural business in rural Ireland, for example, to look at detailed drawings in order to finalise a design, prepare a bid and submit it to a client.  It is also clear from the 5G versus fibre to the home debate that scalability of services with a fixed fibre network is far more easily achieved.  We have looked at this quite closely.

The European Commission came out with a paper in 2016 stating that by 2025, all households must have a minimum of 100 Mbps and all businesses should be capable of 1 Gbps, if they so wish and that all households must be future-proofed to have 1 Gbps download speeds.

As a person from rural Ireland, I believe rural Ireland is being codded by this national broadband plan.  I will take Portlaoise as an example, but every county is the same.  At the moment, under the metropolitan area network, MAN, plan in Portlaoise, the operators to which we have referred, including Vodafone, Siro and the ESB, are offering a 1 Gbps service to households.  That is 1,000 Mbps.  What the Department is offering to the houses two miles out the road is only 3% of that or 30 Mbps.</p></speech>

The broadband plan initially referred to a minimum download speed of 30 Mbps.  Future-proofing could require a marginal increase but even if we went to 100 Mbps to which Mr. Griffin referred to as a target, the NBP is not, in its wildest dreams, really future-proofed.  Europe has told the Department that the 30 Mbps target was way out of touch in the context of modern requirements.</p><p>At best, even if it reaches a maximum of what is being offered, it will only be offering a service to the people of rural Ireland that is 10% of the speed of what is already available in urban Ireland.</p></speech>

Every single bidder that came to the table offered fibre to the home.  The solution that is still on the table with the final bidder is fibre to the home.  Every single rural premises in Ireland, bar the most remote, which may account for 2%, will have a fibre-to-the-home solution.  There will be no restriction.  They will be no worse off than the cities.  In fact, when we get this done, it may in many cases be better than what is being provided in the cities.  It is a fibre-based service, with gigabit potential, that will be provided to the 542,000 premises.</p></speech>

He asked me to talk about what Eir is doing.  I tried to make a distinction between what it is doing in the 300,000 premises that are being provided with services under the commitment agreement with the Department.  That is a predominantly fibre-to-the-home network.  In urban areas, Eir is currently providing a mix of fibre to the home and an enhancement of its copper network - VDSL, I think it is called - which will give somewhere between 100 Mbps and 150 Mbps.  I read in the media that the Eir operators have indicated their intention to fibre the urban areas.  Therefore, nobody in rural Ireland will be any worse off than anybody in urban Ireland.  In fact, for a period of time they are likely to be substantially better off.</p></speech>

Therefore, on the never-never, it is going to be 90% and Eir will be printing money.  That is its business.  That is commercial.  I am only interested in the public's money.  We do not have a cost-benefit analysis on 5G, as we have established.  The second thing is that, thus far, two years into it, there is only a percentage of take-up.  I am just taking a wild guess that a lot of home users are not NASA engineers designing the space shuttle and might be happy to access Netflix and use a little bit of Google.  I am wondering, before we dish out somewhere between &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;3 billion, whether we should look at this.  I am not an expert.  I am just a simple taxpayer in here to ask questions on behalf of other taxpayers.  Let us do a cost-benefit analysis on 5G, which, by Mr. Griffin's own admission, we have not done because the figures are newly available.</p></speech>

Siro made a decision on the basis of its ability to submit a competitive bid while Eir had concerns regarding some of the conditionality being imposed through the contract and some of the regulatory arrangements that are in place and it decided to withdraw, as is its right.

I will not address broadband in great detail because I only have ten minutes and there are other issues I wish to address.  I note the twin aims in regard to climate change and regional development outlined in Mr Griffin's opening speech.  All Deputies have received the documentation I have before me.  A man I know in Indreabh&aacute;n recently emailed me with an update on his broadband.  The houses 100 m on either side of his house have fibre broadband but this man who is attempting to work from home has nothing in spite of attempting to obtain broadband.  That is the reality on the ground.</p></speech>

I am making a general point.</p> <p>  Broadband is very important but a wide range of matters come within the remit of the Department.  Has it sufficient staff and expertise to cover that range of matters?  It has taken me hours to read the documentation that has been provided.  Issues such as land remediation, the Silvermines, Avoca and climate change have been addressed.  At the recent climate change conference in Poland, the Secretary General of the United Nations stated that climate change action makes social and economic sense.  Sir David Attenborough stated that we are at the point where climate change is threatening civilisation.  Is there sufficient staff and expertise in the Department to deal with the significant range of challenges it faces?  I am looking for a "Yes" or "No" answer.</p></speech>

Certain areas remain under some pressure but I am reluctant to identify them because every assistant secretary in my Department will remind me of what I stated at the Committee of Public Accounts.  Overall, I am satisfied with the staffing level in the Department.  We have grown the Department in recent years.  On resources to tackle climate change, there are approximately 66 staff in the Department, 92 in Sustainable Energy Ireland and 32 in the Environmental Protection Association.  One must look at the full quantum of resources.  Indeed, the local government system is now scaling up in terms of-----</p></speech>

We were in a particular situation when the fund was being established.  We wanted to explore what models there might be to generate activity in the private sector.  We were limited in the type of fund that could be put in place because we could not direct the activities of the fund.  This was because doing so would have meant the money would have come onto the general Government balance sheet, which would have been problematic given the budgetary situation at the time.  To comply with state aid rules, there was an obligation on the Department to be at arm's length to an extent.</p> <p>  As to lessons learned-----</p></speech>

There was a period within which appropriate projects were identified.  The fund, as the Deputy says, is administered by a fund manager who is in receipt of fees.  It is important to say that, when we were looking at this, we got advice from NewERA, and it and the Department looked at the type of funds that would be appropriate for an investment of this nature.  It is a widely used fund.  I think there are 2,500 users in Ireland with investments of about &euro;530 million.  It is not an atypical fund.  It was well understood and well known.</p></speech>

Spectrum is used by mobile phones services, broadcasting services and the emergency services.  There is a particular band of spectrum that is used by broadcasting services, the 700 MHz spectrum.  A decision has been taken at EU level that should now be used for wireless broadband services.  There is a process by which RT&Eacute; will migrate its broadcasting through that spectrum onto another platform.  That requires capital investment.  We provided the funding for that.  There was a detailed service level agreement, a letter of entrustment and all the rest.  It is carrying out the capital works on its network and we have reimbursed it for that.</p></speech>

I want to start with broadband provision.  A number of my colleagues have raised issues and I have listened patiently to the responses.  I imagine that the witnesses are aware of the perception, even if they do not agree with it, that it has turned into a bit of a mess.  The matter is very complex and convoluted in terms of the companies involved in the various processes, but on the face of it, for some, it seems to be a bit of a mess.  It was also the perception because a Minister had resigned.  I am not saying whether that was right or wrong, but obviously it added to the complexity, problems and perception.  There was a perception that the process might have been contaminated.  Of course, I am not saying that is the case or that the witnesses would agree with it because I am just talking about perceptions.  There is a perception problem and it all seems to be a bit of a mess.  Those for whom I have most concern are the people living in rural Ireland who want connectivity.  I have heard my party leader ask time and again why it cannot be done.  Why are we talking about this issue over and over again without delivery?  There is real frustration in that regard.</p> <p>  I have very straightforward questions and want the witnesses to help me to understand the process and challenge me on the perception because, unfortunately, it is one I share partially.  Perhaps they might help me as the meeting progresses and I put my questions.  When was the national broadband plan first put in place and how many households was it envisaged would form part of it?</p></speech>

A proposal was made to the Department by Eir to put the 300,000 households on the map, thus reducing the overall scale of the intervention area.  We had extensive discussions with Eir on its commitment to do so and with the European Commission on the latitude available to the Government not to accept the 300,000 households as part of a separate deployment measure.  The clear response we received from the European Commission was that under state aid rules, where there was a commitment agreement in place, with clear targets and deliverable outcomes and so on, the option was not available to the State to decline it.</p></speech>

It could have intervened much more robustly.  Perhaps it is because we left the market to deal with the issue for too long that we are in this mess.  Notwithstanding that, arguably the 300,000 households that were more commercially viable were taken from the 800,000.  Did that leave the tendering process for the remaining 542,000 households more complicated and less attractive?</p></speech>

We have had to examine how the tender process works in respect of many different organisations.  NAMA was a recent one where we looked at tendering processes for large projects.  My point is that if there is insufficient competitive tension, it is not the ideal solution so having one bidder - one consortium - in the process is not healthy.  Did we arrive at that position because of all of the other decisions that were made, including the taking out of the 300,000 homes and businesses from the original plan, which possibly made it less viable for other bidders?  I am trying to understand the Department's perspective as to why we were left with only bidder.  I appreciate that it is complex in terms of the companies that can do the job.  Could Mr. Griffin enlighten me as to why we arrived at this point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-06a.873" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Griffin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018120600002#X00500"><p>When SIRO withdrew, it was still very supportive of the Government's ambition.  However, it could not develop a competitive business case to justify continued participation in the national broadband plan.  I cannot say whether that was related to the 300,000 homes and businesses or other things.  Eir withdrew in January 2017.  It raised issues around the complexity of the procurement process for which I make no apologies because when we are talking about the State providing a very substantial subsidy, we must make sure our procurement process is robust and the things we are asking commercial companies to do stand up in terms of the obligation we are imposing on them over a 25-year period.  Eir indicated at the time that it would continue to support the national broadband plan.  We are seeing this in practice in terms of the engagement with the final bidder in terms of the make ready programme.  The question that arises for us in developing a recommendation one way or the other for the Minister and Government is whether it has the technical capacity, whether the business plan stands up, whether it is commercial and whether the bidder will live up to all the contractual obligations that will be imposed.</p> <p>  Regarding competitive tension, it is probably worth mentioning that part of the competitive dialogue process is what it is called the ISDA S phase, which is the invitation to submit detailed submissions.  At that point, we had received two submissions - one from Eir and one from the Granahan McCourt consortium - so we had both of those to benchmark as part of the assessment of value for money.  We must then do a full detailed assessment of value for money.  Many of the costs are regulated such as Eir duct and pole rentals.</p></speech>

All of that information is very enlightening but reading between the lines in terms of what Mr. Griffin has already said, the Department has some general idea as to why it was reduced down to one bidder.  It is because the contract is huge and the company would need to have the expertise to do it.  In addition, it is possible that taking out the 300,000 homes and businesses played a part in it but the Department does not fully know.  What I am hearing from Mr. Griffin is that it is what it is, we are left with one bidder and we are getting on with it.</p></speech>

It goes back to what was said earlier about 5G - that there will be post-project reviews.  I imagine that we will come back here at some point and evaluate this.  I hope we will not be dealing with a special report from the Comptroller and Auditor General and we are taken back to this exchange when we asked about the costs at that time and were told we could not have that information.  The Department has it.  It has some indication of what it might be but we have no idea how much it will cost in the long run even though it is taxpayers' money.  Mr. Griffin is nodding his head but I am frustrated as a taxpayer and as somebody who represents taxpayers because it is not an ideal situation for this committee to find itself in.</p></speech>

He was asked earlier about the meetings that took place between the former Minister and Mr. McCourt.  It would be unfair of me or anybody else to expect Mr. Griffin to speak for the former Minister because he cannot do so but Mr. Griffin is the person who signs the cheque for all of this.  There is a perception, and I stress that it is only a perception, that the process is contaminated and that the report into this is a whitewash.  Leaving aside this public perception and media or political commentary, many meetings took place between the former Minister and Mr. McCourt.  It was put to Mr. Griffin earlier by Deputy MacSharry that it is reasonable for members of this committee to ask him as the person who ultimately signs the cheque, and he does not know or least we do not know how much he will sign for, whether it was appropriate for the former Minister to have had that level of contact with somebody so closely associated with the only bidder in the game, about which we spoke earlier.  I put this question again to Mr. Griffin because I was not satisfied with the response.  This committee deserves a response to that question.  Mr. Griffin is the Secretary General and the buck stops with him.  Surely when he saw the number of meetings that took place between the former Minister and Mr. McCourt, he would have formed an opinion.  I am asking him to share that opinion with members of this committee.</p></speech>

Again, I do not want to put words in Mr. Griffin's mouth so I ask him not to put words in mine.

I have watched him interact with other members of the committee.  We are putting reasonable questions and we expect reasonable responses.  Mr. Griffin said it would have been preferable if the former Minister had been accompanied by officials but he was not accompanied by them.  Can I surmise from this that Mr. Griffin believes it was wrong of the former Minister to meet Mr. McCourt four times without an official being present?</p></speech>

The record is unambiguous as to what he is saying.  I am not going to deviate from that.  I do not have a different opinion from what is set out in the report.</p></speech>

We have a single bidder for whatever reason.  We have already talked through that and ended up in that situation. A former Minister had several engagements and meetings with somebody closely associated with this single bidder that was left in the race.  Notwithstanding whatever independent report gives its analysis, it is not just a perception here.  It would have been preferable if the meetings not taken place.  They did take place.  It is reasonable for us to ask Mr. Griffin questions, which he has answered.  It is reasonable even to go a step further and ask how he can say that the process has not been contaminated if we have had a large number of meetings - meeting after meeting without officials present, which Mr. Griffin says is not appropriate - between the former Minister, who ultimately would make the decision here, and somebody associated with the only bid.  How can he say that the process was not in any way contaminated?  How can we be assured that this is a genuine reflection on his part?</p></speech>

In the case of many the meetings, the Minister was accompanied and there were official records.  Mr. Justice Smyth stated - I will not repeat the report because the Deputy has read it - at the end of the report: "I am satisfied that neither the former Minister nor Mr. McCourt had the opportunity to influence the conduct of the tender process in favour of Granahan McCourt or otherwise."</p></speech>

He has been quite clear, and my experience of the man over the two and a half years I worked with him, is, he is straight as a die.  He has said that the national broadband plan was not discussed at any of those dinners, nor was there any canvassing.  I, on the basis of a very close working relationship with him over two and half years, would accept his word.</p></speech>

We will never know what was or was not discussed. What we do know is that the perception is not good and not having officials present that can verify what was raised or not is the problem.  We have had this before in other areas.  Lessons should be learned, that is for sure.  I am not in any way calling into question the character of the former Minister.  I share Mr. Griffin's overall view of the former Minister; I have no problem with that whatsoever.  I am thankful for Mr. Griffin's response and for his clarifying that point.  I agree with his perception.</p></speech>

The last phone call I received before I came in here was from a businessman on the Carlow-Kilkenny border who has problems with his Internet and has no broadband.  He got Eir to install broadband for him and it stopped working.  He has been in touch with Eir for over three months and is waiting.  I am aware it is it not Mr. Griffin's responsibility but I am just raising the importance of broadband and its roll-out to rural Ireland.  There are 550,000 people out there waiting for broadband.  I have a kind of half system of broadband at home that is not fast or good enough.  This is the future of Ireland and we are at a big disadvantage in rural Ireland by not having broadband to compete with Dublin and other urban areas.  I have people constantly contacting me to ask if they will have broadband if they come to live in Kilkenny.  If they work from home, it is just not available.  We are losing out badly in small villages and towns in rural Ireland.   This is an opening comment to let Mr. Griffin know how serious the situation is.</p></speech>

We want to move forward to a situation where something is put to Government that it is in a position to accept.  If it is accepted, the next focus then is the roll-out and the deployment.  Part of the bid process by the final bidder is setting a detailed deployment plan.  We will share that.  It is really important.  I have family who live in rural Ireland as well.  It is important that we can get boots on the ground, get this mobilised and delivered as quickly as we possibly can.  I accept-----</p></speech>

What happened, in Mr. Griffin's own words, that the companies like Eir etc. pulled out during the process and we ended up with just one?  Can I get an explanation as a layperson as to why that happened?  Where there is no competition I do not believe there is proper business acumen.  One needs opposition and bidders against one another to get proper pricing and to make a proper contract award to the consortium, whenever it is handed out.</p></speech>

Three organisations were shortlisted.  SIRO - the Vodafone-ESB consortium, Eir and the Granahan McCourt-led consortium.  As the dialogue progressed, in September 2017, SIRO wrote to the Department formally and said that it found it difficult to develop a competitive business case.</p> <p>  Deputy Cullinane effectively queried if that was linked to the Eir 300,000 being taken off the map.  It may well have been but I cannot say that with absolute certainty.  Eir decided in January 2017 to withdraw from the process.  It was in the process-----</p></speech>

That was the formal letter submitted to the Department at that point.</p> <p>  Eir withdrew in January 2017.  At that stage, it was in the middle of a takeover process.</p><p>It said its decision to exit the NBP process was driven by a range of commercial, regulatory and governance issues.  It referred to the complexity of the tender process.  We make no apology for a complex tender process and document where there is so much State money to be invested.  It had some other broader concerns about the regulatory and pricing regime that existed outside the NBP.  We met with Eir on 23 January and asked it to reflect on its position.  It wrote back to us again on 30 January setting that out.  That is effectively the rationale that both of those entities put forward to us. </p></speech>

We had extensive governance and delivery processes set out in our contract documentation.  If we are providing a large amount of taxpayers' money to provide a scheme, we have to be absolutely sure they are capable of delivering, that they have the funding set aside to make the investment, that they meet all the deployment milestones, for example, the milestones for connection of premises, that there are demand stimulation mechanisms set out therein, arrangements for reporting to the Department and open book accounting.  The list in our request is as long as my arm but we are absolutely determined that they were the right requirements to impose on any entity that would ultimately win the contract to do this.</p></speech>

Why would they not be capable of taking on this?  Now we have enet, an American company, coming into Ireland to roll out the same project.  Does it not beg questions that only one bidder is left?  Is there something wrong that there is only one bidder?</p></speech>

It is not unusual in the case of some large infrastructure projects to have only one bidder at the table.  For example, when the equivalent of our high speed broadband project was rolled out in the UK there was only one bidder at the table at the end, the incumbent, BT.  At an earlier stage in the process, the invitation to make detailed submissions, we got two outline bids, one from Eir and one from the Granahan McCourt-led consortium.  That indicates the ball park they were in.  We will have to ensure when the process is being concluded that we are in a position to demonstrate the technical capacity, the business plan, the commercial health, financial standing and the ability of the company to roll out the network and to comply with the contractual provisions the State will put in place.</p></speech>

That is the important point.  If there is only one bidder how will the Department be so sure?  All sorts of figures are being bandied around.  We heard first that it would cost the taxpayer &euro;1 billion, now &euro;3 billion or a higher figure is being mentioned.  There is a big difference between &euro;1 billion and &euro;3 billion or maybe &euro;4 billion.  Are these just figures that are being thrown about, and the taxpayer will pay the bill?  Will we have the witnesses in here next year or in two years' time talking about a waste of taxpayers' money on the cost?  How can Mr. Griffin give us a guarantee that this will be cost efficient?</p></speech>

There will be a range of contractual obligations inserted.  There will be post-contract governance.  We will have local and international benchmarks.  Many of the costs that arise are regulated by ComReg, such as the Eir pole and duct costs.  We will have an overview of the procurement processes that the lead bidder will be undertaking for some of the sub-contracted work.</p> <p>  There is open book accounting so that we can look at the accounts of the final bidder.  We know there is a high level design in place.  We will be able to look at the deeper design on a deployment area basis, which represents approximately 5,000 premises, and see the costs arising there.  There are clawback mechanisms, what is in place, all that kind of stuff.  The Deputy can rest assured that we are doing the absolute level of due diligence that will be required, not just of us but expected by the Minister and the Government before they get any proposals put to them.</p></speech>

I see a cost of &euro;29 million under the heading of natural resources for Inland Fisheries Ireland.  To what does that money go?  Is it for the preservation of salmon?</p></speech>

There are over 300 staff in Inland Fisheries Ireland.  Another chunk of the money will go on capital works.  In the last couple of years Inland Fisheries Ireland published a national strategy for angling development, for which we are committing funding.  There are also pension costs and non-pay expenses related to consultancy work Inland Fisheries Ireland may need to do.  That accounts for the the bulk of the money.</p></speech>

A significant amount of money from its own resources is used.  I will come back to the Deputy about the matter.  There is good material available, albeit very long, on what it is doing in the area of conservation.  Some &euro;3 million is for capital works under the national strategy for angling development.  Inland Fisheries Ireland spends a lot of money in carrying out inspections and on monitoring from a combination of the money we provide and its own resources.  I will come back to the committee with a more detailed note.</p></speech>

All local authorities had landfill sites, or dumps, as we used to call them.  How safe are the landfill sites that were previously available in every county?  At one time almost every municipal area had them.  Are they being monitored years after being filled in?  What security is provided to ensure there is no contamination from them if they were not done to perfection?  They exist because we did not know enough about the environment at the time and in many cases local authorities were not up to scratch.</p></speech>

There are only four or five operational landfill sites in the State now.  There was a case at the European Court of Justice, known as Case C-494, which resulted in the State being required to remediate many historical landfill sites, on which we spent approximately &euro;160 million.  We wrote to the committee at the end of November, setting out where we were on what are called priority 1 sites.  Many such sites are going through various layers of assessment, using a methodology agreed between the Environmental Protection Agency and the local authorities.</p></speech>

The risk is categorised as A, B or C.  Assessments are then made by the local authorities, with the main focus being on category A landfill sites.  The programme of works emerges from the assessments.  In most cases, we fund them from the centre.  In 2018 we had &euro;11 million set aside and will spend close to &euro;10 million.  The figure was lower last year, at approximately &euro;5.5 million.  We have a very good programme in place, with resources assigned to the Environmental Protection Agency.  Resources will be assigned before the end of the year in the regional waste authorities.  We have had training programmes for local authority staff.  There is a comprehensive and complex programme of works to be rolled out.</p></speech>

The treatment required is defined by a comprehensive assessment process that has been agreed to by the Environmental Protection Agency.  If extensive works are required, they will be done.  No corners will be cut.</p></speech>

When one is in the business of removing waste, osts ramp up considerably.  One of the biggest costs in waste disposal is transport.  The specific issue about which the Deputy is concerned is being addressed.  What is required to be done will be funded.  The State will make good the historical landfill sites that need attention.</p></speech>

The first round of speakers made their contributions before the break and I have a few other questions to ask.  We are joined for the afternoon session by Mr. James Ryan from the Department of Defence and from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na by Mr. Michael O'Sullivan, assistant commissioner, security and intelligence, and Mr. Michael Gubbins, Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau.  We will be dealing with the issue of cyber security during the course of the meeting, although not yet.  I advise the new witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by members of the committee clearly and with candour, they can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>To return to Mr. Griffin, there are a few issues I wish to raise.  I will return to broadband provision, given that it is the topic of the moment, even though there are other issues arising from the full Vote before us.  I have three questions about the appropriation account for the purposes of clarification.  Before the break, we touched on inland fisheries which are dealt with on page 6.  Page 13 has a heading which refers to contingent liabilities.  It states there is potential for financial liabilities to arise in 2018 and subsequent years, depending on the outcome of current pending and possible future EU and other legal actions.  What current cases are referred to?  Is there a list or schedule?  Obviously, Mr. Griffin cannot talk about future cases that have not yet arisen, but perhaps he might tell the committee about current and pending cases.</p></speech>

Many of them fall into the category of judicial reviews of various decisions made and in certain circumstances could lead to a liability on the State.  We do not have EU infringement cases likely to give rise to a penalty in the short term, but given the level of activity on issues being negotiated at EU level and agreed, directives or regulations which fall to be transposed on certain occasions and EU measures to be implemented, it is something on which we always have to keep a close eye.  We do this as part of the work of the management board and aim to deliver on the objectives of the directive or regulations in transposition or implementation.  We aim to ensure risks do not materialise.  It is a standard provision in the appropriation account, but there is nothing pending in terms of an immediate threat for the Department.</p></speech>

We re-tendered the contract in the last couple of years.  BT, which was the provider of the service prior to the re-tender, won the re-tender, so that is now being put in place.  We have introduced a number of innovations.  eCall is a new service provided where there is an accident in a car.  If an individual is capable of contacting the emergency services, he or she can make a call himself or herself or the car can do it.  That technology exists.

It would be preferable if capacity was developed within the State because, while it is not inevitable, one sees what is happening internationally, especially the intention last year by the Chinese market to shut down and not take in any more waste, and significant problems are being presented.  There are recycling facilities on the EU mainland but it is something we probably need to look at closely.  We have given a commitment to review our waste policy during 2019.  While there are a number of waste recycling facilities around the State the availability of waste recycling capacity, the new obligations that arise from the circular economy package, which put very significant additional requirements onto member states with regard to packaging targets that have to be met, and the abolition of single use plastics will all have to be factored into the new and very detailed waste management policy.  We are hitting all of the current targets for recycling and reuse, be it plastic, batteries or electronic waste.</p></speech>

A review was undertaken by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission on foot of a D&aacute;il motion.  That has been completed.  The review said that, in due course, regulation of the sector will probably be required.  They reinforced to us the need to build the data capacity within the system and the need for the Department to undertake a fundamental review of its 2012 waste policy.  This review will be done in 2019 and it will inform a lot of the thinking around regulation and where we need to go in terms of more recycling.</p></speech>

I take the Chairman's point.  When one considers the scale of the market and the level of landfill capacity that is there and what is needed, by 2030 - if I have the figure right - we will only be allowed to divert 10% of our municipal solid waste to landfill.  We need to focus much more on reuse and recycling.</p></speech>

The island of Ireland, or whatever way one wants to call it, still exports some of its recyclable materials.  Even as a State we are not fully sustainable.  The first objective should be to get the State into a fully sustainable capacity when it comes to waste, and then - possibly - to break it down by region.  It is probably more of a personal view but Mr. Griffin follows my logic.</p></speech>

Progress to date is reported on 15 category A sites.  I will not go through it in detail but perhaps Mr. Griffin will talk members through that correspondence because the issues around landfill remediation sites have cropped up at this committee a couple of times previously.</p></speech>

I believe the issue was raised by Deputy Connolly.  At the time I said that right across the regional waste management plans there were some 71 sites that were identified as category A, which are high risk sites.  The correspondence for this meeting sets out where we are with the sites that have progressed through a process.  The sites are categorised as A, B and C.  A is high risk and B and C are lower risk.  The process that is needed to determine what is required for the remediation of the sites is set out in a tiered hierarchy.  The basic tier one investigation may conclude that minimal or no further work is required and that the site is not a high risk.  Once we have gone through a tier one investigation and the conclusion is for a more a more detailed analysis, then a tier two and tier three assessment is done.</p><p>The output of that process is certification of authorisation from the EPA and this sets out a work programme that is to be undertaken in each of the sites.  That work programme is funded by the State.  The committee will see from Table 1-----</p></speech>

The committee will see others that are further progressed, on the second page, where they have moved beyond the tier 2 and tier 3 and now are in the process of having the certification of authorisation being assessed by the EPA.  Once that is approved, one can move to works.  The committee will see, in Table 2, a smaller number of sites where the certification of authorisation, COA, is under consideration by the EPA with remediation works programme for 2019.  Then the committee will see, in Table 3, a number where the COA has issued and the works are planned or have commenced and then another suite of them, in Table 4, where works have been undertaken and a spend of &euro;17.8 million made on them.  That is the process.</p> <p>  We have a distance to go in terms of dealing with all of them.  We are more comfortable than we would have been this time last year when I came before the committee because at that stage, we had not fully scoped out the tools that would be required to do that work.  We have a resource now, in the EPA.  We are just finalising the appointment of a resource in the three regional waste authorities which will be focused exclusively on dealing with this particular issue.  We have trained up local authority staff.  We have moved to a situation now where, of the &euro;11 million budgeted in 2018 for landfill remediation, we will spend somewhere between &euro;9.6 million and &euro;10 million.  It is good progress relative to 2017.</p> <p>  For the benefit of Deputy Connolly, one site which we spoke about last year was South Park.  It had been classed as a high-risk site, category A, which, I think, caught the Deputy by surprise, but, in fact, the local authority has revisited that site, done a further assessment and is now seeking EPA approval to have that reclassified as a category C site - a low-risk site.</p></speech>

In May, we had an exchange with Ms Dee Forbes on RT&Eacute; 2 and I asked when will we see RT&Eacute; 2 plus one.  There was quite an exchange of correspondence.  The impression was given that RT&Eacute; had applied for it.  The Department came back and stated it had not been asked to approve it before it goes to the regulator.  RT&Eacute; responded stating that it was mentioned in its five year plan and it took that to mean it was a request.  I did not read it that way.  Has RT&Eacute; 2 sought ministerial approval?</p></speech>

Can somebody, between the Department and RT&Eacute;, send us a note next week on when we can see RT&Eacute; 2 plus one?  I keep insisting RT&Eacute; is losing revenue by not having the station.  That is one of the reasons I raised it.  They voiced much complaint about television licence evasion and here is an opportunity to raise money themselves.  In my view, somebody was slow off the mark on it.</p> <p>  Before I return to broadband, what of mobile phone coverage?  There are wonderful maps of plans of 100% mobile phone coverage.  I do not have mobile phone coverage in my office.  Nobody in my village has proper mobile phone coverage.  I have tabled PQs all year.  I have looked at the Department's reports.  The Department is engaging with local authorities on a pilot basis to identify black spots.  That job would take approximately one hour in every county.  If one sat down at a public meeting of the local authority, there is no councillor who could not list them to Mr. Griffin off the top of his or her head.   That job should have taken a day to complete.  It could have been done as an agenda item on every local authority meeting to list the black spots but the Department set up a lengthy process.  The Department appointed officers and they are conducting a pilot study identifying the black spots in 17 local authorities.  That will inform the future plan to identify more black spots, and how one does it scientifically.  All I will say is doing the job this way is not doing the public service any good.  Who is the regulator for the mobile phones?</p></speech>

In terms of the main operators out there, 25 years after we started with mobile phones a large proportion of the country still contains many black spots.  If the system cannot deliver mobile phone signals after a 25-year period, I have serious doubts about the same operators handling the delivery of broadband to all of rural Ireland.  Where are we on mobile phone coverage?</p> <p>  The reason I refer to this is the Department devotes a page and a half of its annual report to the issue and it must be something with which Mr. Griffin is familiar.  What is the Department doing?  The position has not improved a millimetre because of the licences issued by ComReg.  What can Mr. Griffin tell those who do not have a mobile phone signal?</p></speech>

The issue with broadband is that there is a recognition by the State that left to the market, one will not have it and there were will be large numbers of people left behind.  What one has there is a recognition by the State that there has to be a subsidy to fill that gap.</p> <p>  In terms of the mobile phone market it is commercial players, through a licensing system, that are providing services.  The frustration of people, particularly those in rural Ireland, with mobile coverage is something that both we and, obviously, every Member of the House, are familiar with.</p> <p>  The mobile phone and broadband taskforce has resulted in some positive initiatives but its impact is really something that one will see over a longer period of time.  It has brought together the operators with the local authorities, the State bodies and the regulator.  That, of itself, has been of real benefit in terms of removing some of the barriers that are there, in speeding up the roll-out of infrastructure by commercial players and in providing a greater level of consistency.</p> <p>  I hear what the Chairman says on the mapping of black spots.  Certainly people such as the Chairman, who are in touch within a particular geographical area, could probably contribute a lot but what we took was a structured approach through the broadband officers through the local authorities to do that mapping exercise.  Then there is a separate exercise.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-06a.1167" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ciar&aacute;n &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018120600002#MM00500"><p>I can come back to the committee on the percentage by operator in terms of their licences.  The licences that ComReg provide have minimum thresholds in terms of what they have to deliver.  Commercial providers can go beyond that.  There is only one commercial provider that would claim to be over and above 90% in terms of population coverage, which is different to geographic coverage.  The work on the black spots, and a separate piece of work which was done to help in decision making going forward to determine where coverage should be prioritised, was about more than where people live.  It was also about where people gather and where they need mobile coverage.  This work has been completed and it will feed into the work of ComReg going forward.</p> <p>  Separately, the Department is working to develop a 5G strategy in the context of a connectivity strategy.  Earlier, we had a conversation around 4G-5G versus fibre and broadband.  I am not an engineer, but in terms of my brief, I engage with industry, the communications regulator, the telecommunications companies and the people advising on the broadband plan.  The point was made earlier, and referenced recently by the head of Vodafone Ireland during its recent 5G trial, about 5G being complementary to high speed broadband.  This is about connectivity not only within one's house or place of work but outside one's door.  The engineers will probably be upset with how I am explaining this but as I see it 5G and fibre are very fast but in terms of any expected roll-out of 5G the capacity and the amount of data are not comparable.  5G can expand out but this would require investment at a level that no commercial player would consider sensible - with more electronics en masse.  The Secretary General mentioned earlier that in the recently published ComReg estimates it would cost &euro;1.8 billion to achieve 99% plus population coverage with 5G.  This would provide a level of service such that a person could watch Netflix, but not if all of his or her neighbours chose to watch Netflix at the same time.  That is the difference between 5G and fibre.  With fibre, one has a dedicated signal.  The two can work together.</p></speech>

Mobile phones have been around for 25 years.  This conversation about black spots could and should have been had by the Department 15 years ago.  Some of the black spots identified ten years ago are still black spots today.  I would contend that the principal cause of the problem in regard to mobile phone coverage is the State in allowing companies granted licences to provide less than optimal levels of cover.  If a licence specifies 75% cover, it is not the fault of the company if it only meets that requirement, rather it is the fault of the State for setting the coverage requirement at that level.  If a licence granted today requires an operator to provide only 75% coverage then in 15 years' time there will be lots of people complaining about not having a service.  The reason we do not have the coverage is because the licence does not require it.  If the licence required 100% coverage, that is what we would get.</p> <p>  I would like information from the Department on the operators, their licensing arrangements and the percentage of coverage by population and geographically over the lifetime of their renewals.  I believe that when these operators were first granted these licences the percentage of coverage required was higher than is the case in the more recently issued licences.  It could have been 90% but was reduced in new iterations to 80%, 78% and so on.  This enables operators to cherry pick areas geographically.  This was not only aided and abetted by the State but forced on the people by the State by not holding operators to a higher standard from day one.  I accept that the Department is on a learning curve as a result of this failure and that it does not want to be caught with the same problem with broadband but we will come to that in a minute.  Twenty-five years on, there are far too many black spots.  I ask that the Department send to the committee data on the percentage of the population geographically in black spots.  It is all very fine to talk about plans, communications and understanding the problem.  The dogs in the street could have done that a decade ago. </p></speech>

The purpose of the ComReg report published last Friday was to try to tease out some of these issues.  In the move from 75% or 90% population coverage to almost 99.5% geographic coverage there are big trade-offs in terms of cost.  The decisions that need to be made in terms of the next licensing round include the conditions to be required through a round.  In other words, is it a population focus or a geographic focus and what are the costs involved?</p></speech>

The point I am making is that there is a big difference between 75% coverage and 99.9% coverage, the latter being the ideal.  We need to increase coverage from 75% to 85% or 90%.  It is not okay to say just because we cannot meet 100% we cannot have a discussion on the issue.  We need to increase the level of coverage.  I ask that the Department forward to the committee data on the renewals.  ComReg is supposed to audit a random number of the masts annually to ensure the level of coverage promised is being met.  The Department might also send us the most recent audit reports in that regard.</p></speech>

That is the first thing.  I would like a clarification.  I am reading a sentence in a reply to a parliamentary question I asked, dated 7 September 2018.  The question reference number is 35974/18.  There is a paragraph describing all the wonderful initiatives mapping the black spots.  The reply states:</p><blockquote>In addition to its work on handset testing, following a consultation process, ComReg has also developed a licensing scheme [I do not know if this is operating] which will enable households and businesses to use mobile phone repeaters to boost signals into their premises and bring immediate improvements in mobile coverage.</blockquote> <p>That is from the Minister's reply to a parliamentary question.  Can somebody give me a detailed on note on whether any of that has actually happened, and the numbers?  I have provided the reference number to that parliamentary question.</p><p>I would like to move back to the subject of broadband.  I will take it in steps.  These are questions requiring straight &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; answers.  This is a system where the State is investing and the private sector is putting in money.  It might not meet the legal definition, but it is essentially a public private partnership, PPP.  Is that fair to say?  It does not meet the legal definition.</p></speech>

It is a public private partnership of a type.  I would like to clarify this.  This infrastructure is not a design and build programme.  Is that correct?  I am comparing it to other PPPs with which people are familiar.  To use the usual terms, it is not a design and build programme; it is not a design, build and operate programme; and it is not a design, build operate and finance programme.  The Department is going to identify a preferred bidder.  The preferred bidder will contribute X and the State will contribute Y.  Is that the type of structure we are talking about?</p></speech>

The PPP company was carrying the cost until such time as it handed it over, and then the State was to pay an annual leasing.  The State made no prior payment and was not caught if something went wrong.  Is this proposal a proposal for the State to pay up from year one on an ongoing basis?

There is a 1,500 page contract, and that contract has to be closed out.  There are approximately 40 contracts, subcontracts and direct agreements that have to be closed out by a preferred bidder to the satisfaction of the Department before the contract with the Minister can be signed.  That is the significant piece of work that has to be concluded after determining the preferred bidder.  In its tender, the bidder identifies its solution to the deployment plan, subcontractors, how it will build this network and how it will operate it.  The bidder identifies parties that will deliver on that work for it.  In the period after identifying the preferred bidder and before a contract is concluded, the bidder must follow through on those commitments and put those contracts in place.  That is the significant piece of work that will have to be done.</p></speech>

One of the reasons was that the licence did not specify a high enough target, although I am not suggesting the target should have been 99%.  As time went on, the regulator went easier on the companies.  Will the percentage of target be specified in the contract or will it be in the licence?  Who will oversee the implementation of this?  Two or three years into the process, if the company is found to be unable to do it anymore for a variety of reasons, or if it is just dragging its feet, does the Department have a process by which it can remove the contractor?  That would be normal in a large contract like this.  It cannot be that the State is locked in and has to pay &euro;2 million to get the contractor off the pitch.  How will the Department protect the State in the event of the contract not being developed?</p></speech>

It will have to upgrade that technology over time to keep it consistent with what is available in other parts of the country.  It will have established the cost for delivery.  There will be payment milestones which are absolutely linked to the roll-out and there will be clawback around those.  There will be oversight of the tendering process for subcontractors and the price of materials.  There is a very strong regulatory oversight through the contract because the contract calls out the regulation.</p></speech>

Once one is into resolving disputes, one has a problem.  The focus of the contract, therefore, has been to be detailed and explicit so there is no scope, or limited scope, for such disputes.</p></speech>

I will make two points about the contract.  One is that it is the ambition, and the contract was written for this, to ensure that the service that is provided in rural Ireland is at least on a par with the one that is available in urban areas.  Part of that is cost.  The contract addresses the manner in which the owner of the network can charge the retailers who come on the network, such as Vodafone, Sky and so forth.  It sets a standard charge for that.</p> <p>  To return to the point on the 30 Mbps, there are-----</p></speech>

The world has moved on.  The three bidders in the process said fibre, which meant it would never be 30 Mbps but always 100 Mbps and more.  However, one must think about who will be selling services on the network.  It will be the big retail players such as Sky, Vodafone, Eir and so forth.  They will not be differentiating.  Dermot Bannon is doing the advertisement for Vodafone now.  After the news on a Sunday evening he is selling the same service whether one is living in the middle of Dublin city, north County Dublin or south Mayo.</p></speech>

The European Commission will say that if a commercial roll-out has happened or is proposed one cannot put State money into going into the same place.  I am paraphrasing it somewhat simplistically.  If there was new commercial roll-out one would have to take that into account.</p></speech>

I am not going too far into the contract by saying that it provides that at year 25 the bidder can continue to use those assets, if it would be obliged to, for a further ten years to continue to provide services to all the people connected to that network or the business could revert to the State.</p></speech>

That is the impression I am getting.  If the company continues it further, it continues to own it for another ten years.  If it chooses not to do that, you are saying the State buys back the product.  This leads to my follow-up question.  In public private partnerships, PPPs, the funding model for the motorways, at the end of what we will call the concession period of 25 years it is up to the company that builds the motorway to give the road back to the State in the same condition it was on the first day.  It must maintain the road to the highest standard to the last day and give it back in full working order at the end of the 25 years.  That does not appear to be happening here.</p><p>The PPP model of funding is very close to what we are talking about here in that the State put in significant money and the private sector put in some money.  They got the money from the toll or the usage charge, exactly as whoever is the bidder here will get the usage charges.  It is identical in many ways to one or two of the motorway schemes that are run on a concession basis with a condition that, at the end of the concessionary period, they would hand it back to the State in the same condition as it was in on day one.  Is that happening here?  I am looking at lessons learned in other areas.  I am sorry to be getting into this but it concerns the specifics of the contract.  If I do not ask, our successors will be here arguing and asking did we not do our work.</p></speech>

My question is whether there is going to be an equivalent here to maintain the broadband.  Mr. Griffin need not specify a figure, but in respect of what has been done in the MANS to ensure the system continues to be maintained, namely, a percentage of revenue going to maintenance and upkeep, is something similar going to be provided here?  What mechanism is in place to verify the gross receipts or the gross turnover in MANS, as I speak, and in this new proposal?  How does the Department know it is getting its 10% reinvested in MANS?  What is its measurement, verification and audit mechanism in that regard?</p></speech>

Given that this all started in 2013, six years will have elapsed between the date the original specifications were drawn up and launched and the signing of the contract.  Technology has moved phenomenally in the meantime.  If the officials were starting on 1 January 2019, would they be starting from where they did with this contract?  One could not possibly think they would.  Has the passage of time made the contract almost past its sell-by date before the first hole in the ground is even dug?

If we had started a little bit later, we would have set the benchmark higher, but we are getting it anyway through what all the bidders came forward with, which is fibre to the home.  Every other single member state, I think I can say with certainty, right across Europe, is behind us and they are all going for a fibre to the home solution complemented by 5G.  Some of the member states that got a little bit ahead of us are now redoing what they did because they did not pitch the level of technology sufficiently high.  Fibre to the home is the solution and would be the solution if we went to the market today.</p></speech>

Particularly with climate change it has become a whole new language.  At the end of the day we know we are not meeting our targets.  Similarly here I try to reduce it to its essence.  This is an essential service.  We will give a substantial subsidy.  It will operate for 25 years with an option for another ten and then we get the dubious privilege of buying it back.

It seems like a sentence every Thursday.  Every Thursday we are faced with something.  This is the first time we are looking forward a tiny bit.  Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in can tell me if I am wrong with my interpretation and it is too simplistic.  We give a subsidy to this entity to design, build, operate, maintain and own for 25 years with an option to extend for ten years.  Built into the contract is that we will buy it back if they do not want to keep going.  Am I wrong?  Which part of that is wrong?</p></speech>

There are opportunities for the State to actually get a payback from the contract to claw back subsidy.  At year 25 if the contract went well and this business is a profitable business, there would actually be a cheque coming back to the State.  In circumstances where the business is not deemed to be profitable and they do not take the option of continuing with the business for ten more years and serving people, the business would revert to the State.  What I am saying is there could be a cost to that transaction.</p></speech>

There are checkpoints the whole way along in terms of payments, payments being withheld, financial penalties and controls.  That is on the downside.  On the upside, there are checks in there and they happen every number of years as one moves into the contract to the point where it could be profitable.  There is an exercise carried out and the State could be due a payback of subsidy already paid if it turns out this is more profitable than the bid anticipates it to be.  Both sides are protected.</p></speech>

I am boring myself in saying this.  In Galway we have come full circle.  I hear the Department is looking at the ambassador scheme which was not fully drawn down.  When I look at that, it is difficult not to despair.  We had a pilot recycling scheme in Galway and achieved 70%.  If the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment were to learn anything, it might look at what Galway achieved against the engineers' advice and that of others.  They told us 45%.  There were definitely serious questions about where it was going.  However, it showed that people wanted to recycle and they led the way.  The official response was to privatise.</p> <p>  I am reading about an ambassador scheme that is struggling.  Nobody is drawing down the funding.  The local authority had an education liaison officer who worked with the people.  All of this was there.  Here we are in 2018, certainly 15 or 16 years later and the officials are telling us about recycling when we already did it.  A public composting facility was sold off or leased off.  I will not dwell on it, but it is difficult to listen to, especially when the people have led us and shown us what was possible.  If the Department was in any way wise it might go back and look at what happened then.</p> <p>  My final question is on the geological survey to map the country.  I forget what it is called.</p></speech>

Therefore, we have to make a decision on whether the good people about whom Mr. Griffin spoke - I am sure they are good people - arrived at the right decision.  In my opening remarks I said there was a perception that the entire project had become a bit of a mess.  That is the backdrop to this conversation.  We are looking at the different ownership, funding and contractual options, at which KPMG looked, one of which was the private sector build, finance, own, operate with obligations option.  The advantages were clearly stated as being that this option would reduce costs through increased competition.  Two and a half years later, however, we have ended up with a process in which there is one bidder left.  That does not chime with the advantages set out for the option.  Will Mr. Griffin at least acknowledge that that is the case?  We have not ended up with more bidders and competition.</p></speech>

In the other eight or nine there is a string of advantages not related to the one quoted by the Deputy.  Circumstances change during the course of a procurement process, some of which are outside our control.  At all stages we re-evaluated where we were at and what the implications of a change in circumstances would be for the contract.  The stocktaking process led to decisions being taken and we are now in a position to finalise the procurement process.  Whatever will emerge will go to the Minister and the Government which will make the necessary decisions in the interests of the taxpayer, in both urban and rural Ireland.</p></speech>

The witnesses might not be in a position to tell us the cost now.  There have been several newspaper articles, such as the one in The Irish Times, which estimated the cost at between &euro;1.5 billion and &euro;3 billion.  It could be less or it could be more; we do not know.  The witnesses are not going to comment on it.  At what point, as taxpayers, will we know how much the State liability is?

I have just one more question.  It says on the screen under disadvantages that the State will receive no stake in the ownership of the infrastructure at the end of the contract, despite having contributed significant sums of money towards its construction.  Mr. &Oacute; h&Oacute;b&aacute;in dealt with this earlier.  The second last speaker talked about what would happen after the 25 or 30 years.  Could the successful bidder sell on the infrastructure?

I think extend was the chosen option.  What happens in this situation?  Would there be a possibility at any point to renegotiate or retender the contract in terms of costs, given that there is only one bidder who would potentially have the State over a barrel in that respect?  If that is the case, is there a risk to the State given that we have only one bidder in the race?</p></speech>

Significant protections are built into the contract and those protections are needed whether there are one, two or three bidders in play at this point in time.  They are obviously of greater importance now in order to give confidence to the public in terms of a single bidder situation.  There is oversight in terms of the spend and there is clawback both in terms of the expenditure part of the programme and if this is a profitable business.</p></speech>

If the bidder came looking for additional subsidy the State would have rights to take back the business.  It is very much set on the basis of a 25 year contract being entered into and at the outset one sets down the maximum cost to the State for the contract.  As one moves through it, there are protections for the State to ensure there is clawback to the State in appropriate circumstances.</p></speech>

He referred to technical solutions, updating technology, payment milestones, clawback mechanisms, oversight and importantly he said the contract itself could act as a form of regulation; that in effect it would be almost like a regulator.  Could he explain that to me again?</p></speech>

It is written in a way to give the State confidence that the citizens of rural Ireland who will be depending on this network will have a quality high-speed broadband service into the future, that it will be comparable to the type of service that will be available in any other part of Ireland, especially in major urban areas and that the level of service in terms of how quickly they get connected, downtime and other such issues would be similar also.  It is written in a very heavy-handed way because this party effectively will be operating for many years, or potentially forever, the only high-speed broadband network for many of the areas.</p></speech>

The Chairman put the question earlier.  We have asked for the contracts before and it is unlikely that we will ever get a copy of the contract although perhaps we will sometime in the future.  At what point will Mr. Griffin be able to come and answer some of the deeper questions we have in relation to the contractual obligations to which the State has signed up?</p></speech>

We can go through this in a lot more detail.  I understand the frustration of Deputies at our inability to communicate more fully on what are very important issues.</p></speech>

I will not give a number but it is very significantly above that, which is what one would expect.  We are building infrastructure to be in play for five, ten and 25 years from now.

There is a commitment, at EU level, to migrate broadcasting services from what they call the 700 MHz band.  That requires a capital investment by RT&Eacute;.  The 700 MHz band is particularly useful for wireless mobile broadband services.  RT&Eacute; is migrating its infrastructure and that comes at a cost of &euro;8 million.  We are providing that once-off cost, with the service level agreement, SLA, in place and all of that.</p></speech>

An oversight agreement, under the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, is effectively what they recommend where you have an agency that is either independent - so we have them in place for our three regulators, the Commission for Energy Regulation, Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, and Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI - or where there are very clear performance requirements set out in legislation.  That is why we have an oversight agreement in place for RT&Eacute; rather than an SLA.  As we mentioned last year, they are also subject to regulatory review by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  That oversight agreement, after the committee helpfully brought it to my attention last year, has been in place with RT&Eacute; since the end of 2017.</p></speech>

I would expect that RT&Eacute;, in terms of the management of its contractual arrangements with the various people who are employed on whatever terms within the organisation, would carry that out effectively and with the appropriate level of diligence.  I understand that a considerable amount of work has been done through the Eversheds process.  They are not there yet and I am not sure when they expect to be finished.</p></speech>

Given that we had a report, which identified that there may be a problem, and given that we know that it is illegal to operate bogus self-employment, there would be an obligation on Accounting Officers and people who have responsibility for governance to, at the very least, report that to Revenue.  Has the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment ever reported RT&Eacute; to Revenue, because we do not know how many as all of the contracts have to be worked through, the potential of bogus self-employment contracts?</p></speech>

I am unsatisfied with the responses made by RT&Eacute; and we will go back to it again.  RT&Eacute; was to meet all of the workers affected by this matter.  Some of the workers have contacted me, and perhaps they have contacted other members of the committee.  If bogus self-employment is an illegal practice then it is illegal.  As to the question of whether that has been established or not, we cannot simply say that it is for RT&Eacute; to decide when RT&Eacute; has received a substantial amount of taxpayers' money.  If the Secretary General writes the cheque that gives a substantial amount of funding to RT&Eacute; and oversight agreements are in place, then what do the oversight agreements cover?  Do they exclude practices by human relations or HR?</p></speech>

As the Secretary General has said, technology is improving and modernising all the time.  A few reports have claimed that fibre optic technology might be obsolete in a few years time and we should consider satellite technology, wireless technology or some other technology.  Earlier the Secretary General spoke, in response to questions asked by my colleagues, about how much it will cost to roll out the scheme.  He mentioned the cost associated with renting 1.1 million poles, the extra cost for the additional 200,000 poles that will need to be erected, plus the cost of wiring all of them.  Has he considered whether the technology is future proofed?  Will satellite technology be the answer in five years time?  Would other technologies be cheaper in five years time?</p></speech>

Every company that came forward, as part of the procurement process, proposed fibre to the home.</p><p>Every single member state across the EU which has looked at how to deal with the technology infrastructure deficit in rural parts of their countries has opted for fibre to the home, fixed wireless in some small parts of the overall outlay, and 4G and 5G as complementary technologies.  We have one of the best companies in the world helping us on the technology aspect of this and it is crystal clear that fibre to the home is the solution.  Our own regulator, ComReg, last week indicated that 5G could only be a complementary technology to fibre to the home and that fibre to the home provides far greater benefits in terms of speed, scalability and future-proofing.</p></speech>

Was it wrong for Eir to then walk away from the roll-out to rural and more costly areas?  It took the lucrative part, the cream, and then walked away from the rest.  The reason I am asking is that I am leading up to another question, but I would like Mr. Griffin to comment on this question first.</p></speech>

Eir came forward with a proposition to cover another 300,000 premises itself.  Those 300,000 premises would have effectively been withdrawn from the map.  Under state aid rules, as there was a binding agreement in place - and we stitched in, very clearly, a specific set of requirements for Eir to meet in terms of the roll-out time, delivery, the number of premises and so on - we had no entitlement to keep the 300,000 on the map.  We had absolutely no basis to maintain the number of premises at 800,000 plus.  It is unfortunate that Eir walked away after that, because we would have much preferred to have competitive tension in the process right the way through.  I outlined Eir's motivations for withdrawing from the process earlier, but that is where we are.  Under EU state aid rules, there was no choice available to us.</p></speech>

Most of these are local issues with which I have dealt personally.  I have raised the case of a man who lives in County Kilkenny, two or three miles outside New Ross town, before.  He has nine children.  There are 11 people in the house.  He is looking for broadband.  He lives in a semi-rural area.  There are three houses to either side of his house, left and right.  All three on the right have broadband, as do all three on the left, but he cannot get it.  Again as a lay person, for the life of me I cannot understand why this man in the middle, only three miles outside of New Ross, cannot get broadband.  I have fought two or three elections in the time this has been going on and he still comes out with the same thing every time I go and knock on his door.  He is still not getting answers.  He is after writing to everyone including ComReg and all of the providers and no on will give him a service.  Why?</p></speech>

That conversation has to be with Eir.  We have absolutely no power or authority to impose a particular requirement in respect of a house which does not form part of the rural broadband scheme, nor does ComReg.  That is the real reason we need to deliver the national broadband plan.</p></speech>

This week alone I have got three complaints.  Eir has this contract.  In another area, not far from the one I have mentioned, this week a grandson took over an old house.  His grandparents are dead.  The house had a phone but it has been cut off for years.  The house is down a little lane.  This man has done it up and moved back in.  It is a bad area for coverage.  He wanted a landline and broadband for his business.  Eir agreed and put up the poles and everything then, all of a sudden, it told him it would not give him a line in due to its cost analysis.  The poles had been put up and it would not give him the wire, even though there was a phone in the house which had been cut off.  He then went to ComReg which told him that it had no role to play.  Who has a role to play?  A contract to roll out the service will be given to Eir - and I could name two other companies but I will not name individual organisations-----</p></speech>

Then, after putting up the poles, it said it would not give him a landline connection but it would give him something on the wall.  I suppose it is a wireless connection.  He wants a landline connection for broadband and phone because the mobile phone coverage down there is bad.  I can understand that.  Another businessman in Carlow was on to me.  I spoke about him earlier today.  He has been on to Eir again.  He paid for his broadband, got his service, and now there is something wrong with the service.  Three modems have been sent to him and Eir will not come out and fix it for him.  Taxpayers paid Eir and gave it this contract and yet it is not fulfilling it.</p></speech>

I am glad to hear that.  I can quote that when I get back to ComReg.  I will be doing that in the next two days.  I have a last few questions.  In respect of greenhouse gas emissions, what is the Department's view on incineration?  Some people think it is the way forward for everything, including supplying energy.  Does Mr. Griffin have any comment on that?</p></speech>

It goes reduce, reuse, recycle, recovery and then disposal of the residue.  Either landfill or incineration is needed to dispose of the residual municipal solid waste or whatever other waste exists.  Our objective is and will be to increase the level of recycling and to reduce the amount going to landfill.  The targets coming from the EU are making the obligations much more onerous.  The operations at Poolbeg generate approximately 86 MW of energy, which goes onto the national grid.  Mr. Manley's team has just completed the first round of allocations through the climate action fund.  Part of that involves the development of a district heating system in Poolbeg.  The waste heat coming out of Poolbeg will be used to heat homes within the area.  It is a more sustainable model than simply burning the waste.</p></speech>

I know incidents have happened in places but modern technology has improved incineration.  Should the Government and the Department be promoting it more?</p></speech>

In the case of Poolbeg, for example, there is a piece of technology people can use through their PC or laptop which allows them to instantly check the emissions emanating from the Poolbeg incinerator.  The emissions are monitored extremely closely by the company itself, Covanta, and by the EPA.</p></speech>

Much in the same way as the national broadband plan for the country was mapped and it was determined that approximately 240,000 premises with little or no access to basic broadband services.  It is almost like a precursor to the national broadband plan.  That was a gap-funded model.  Three Ireland was the successful bidder on that occasion and it constructed something like 390 masts to deliver a mobile wireless service into the areas.  It was a very basic broadband service.  The minimum speed at that point was 1.2 Mbps download.</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy has an opening statement on this section, as does Mr. Griffin.  There is a specific chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report connected with this Department.  We thought we would have finished with the discussion of broadband a little earlier and that is why we held off the cybersecurity section to the afternoon but we have strayed over into the time allocated to it.  I do not think we will be too long but we want to cover the key points of the report.  I invite Mr. McCarthy to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Critical systems and infrastructure at risk include those owned and managed by both public and private bodies.</p> <p>  The Department is responsible for the development of cybersecurity policy in Ireland, and for co-ordinating emergency responses to any national-level cybersecurity incidents.  The national cybersecurity centre was established within the Department in 2011 to address those responsibilities.  The examination was undertaken to review the progress made since the establishment of the centre.</p> <p>  The examination notes that the centre&rsquo;s level of resourcing in its first four years of operation was significantly less than envisaged when the Government was asked to approve the establishment of the centre.  The overall cost attributed to cybersecurity functions is not reported separately in the Department&rsquo;s appropriation account.  As a result, there is a lack of transparency around the availability and use of resources.</p> <p>  In 2015, the Department published a national cybersecurity strategy covering the period 2015 to 2017.  Not all of the measures in that strategy were achieved.  There is no national cybersecurity strategic plan currently in place.</p> <p>  At the time the strategy was published, it was planned that the overarching governance structure of the centre would be a high-level interdepartmental steering group that would oversee its work.  The Department stated during the examination that the steering group had not met since the strategy was published in 2015.</p> <p>  In July 2016, the European Union adopted the directive on security of network and information systems with a view to achieving a common high level of cybersecurity within the EU.  Transposition of the directive into Irish law was achieved in September 2018.  However, a requirement of the directive is to adopt a national strategy that contains elements such as a risk assessment plan, a listing of various stakeholders and a governance framework.  In the absence of a strategy, the Department is not meeting its requirements under the directive.</p> <p>  A number of recommendations relating to resourcing, transparency of costs, governance and strategic direction were included in the chapter.  All the recommendations were agreed by the Accounting Officer who will be able to give the committee an update on their implementation.</p></speech>

There has been a significant amount of development in the sector, which is very fluid.  We have been deeply engaged both in incident response at an operational level and also particularly with regard to work around the network and information systems, NIS, directive, which frames our entire national response to the protection of critical national infrastructure in terms of obviating and dealing with cybersecurity risks.  It is also worth pointing out that the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland makes a number of recommendations around the future of the NCSC and how that will relate back to the centre.  Of course, the outcome of that and the implementation report from that, which will be agreed by Government at some point in the future, will obviously have an impact on the next national cybersecurity strategy.  Realistically, we are only now at a natural inclination point where we can actually make those decisions in any kind of formal way.</p></speech>

This was done in 2015, four years into the life of the NCSC.  At that point, as far as we were concerned, we had achieved enough expertise to make a national strategy.  Very quickly after the 2015 piece, we had a series of very serious incidents, including WannaCry and NotPetya in 2017, which fundamentally changed the NCSC's and the global understanding of the cybersecurity sector.  We also had the NIS directive, which we signed into law in 2016.</p></speech>

The centre was set up in 2011.  In 2014 it did a national risk assessment and in 2015 it did a strategy.  The directive came in 2016 and it took up to September 2018 to implement the directive which was supposed to be implemented by May.  This is what I am reading.  The point I make is that there was a strategy.  The witness said the strategy quickly went out of date but, at the same time, in another part of his response to the Comptroller and Auditor General, he said the NCSC was complying with the thrust of the strategy.  One contradicted the other when I read it.  The NCSC has a strategy that is out of the date but the witness then goes on to say it is complying with the thrust of the strategy.</p></speech>

Those requirements changed and we had to adapt accordingly.  The basic questions the Deputy is posing are as follows.  Will there be a new strategy?  Do we need it and when will we have it?  There will be a new strategy.  We do need it.  We will have it in the first quarter of 2019.</p></speech>

Essentially, the directive establishes two separate systems for the security of different types of entities.

For those seven sectors, what we are obliged to do, along with one other national competent authority, is to identify which entities we regard as being important.  We then oblige those entities to meet security standards and to report serious incidents to the NCSC.  That is the OES, or critical infrastructure, area.  The other area is DSPs, or digital service providers.  These are limited to three different sectors, namely, cloud computing, online sales platforms - that is, a platform that sells from A to B - and search engines.  Those platforms have a different set of requirements.  We are not obliged to designate those and, in fact, we cannot designate them.  They are obliged to be self-designating and they are designated by definition in the directive and in our regulations.  They are obliged to meet a set of security standards, not ours but ones that are set broadly in the EU implementing regulation.  They are obliged to report incidents to us and the thresholds for reporting of those incidents are also set in parts 3 and 4 of that same EU implementing regulation.</p> <p>  Those are the requirements laid on those entities.  We then have further requirements in terms of reporting to other EU member states and they to us in terms of incidents that are reported to us from both OES and DSPs.  If, for example, an OES has operations in multiple member states and it is affected by an incident here that may have implications elsewhere, which could happen in this State given we have cross-border infrastructure in a number of sectors, we are then obliged to report to that other member state any outage or incident in that sector with regard to a specific OES.  The same applies for DSPs.  If for example, a DSP is based here at the European level and has an outage or incident of a given scale and it reports that incident to us, we are obliged to report to the single points of contact in every other member state which has a population that may be affected by that same incident.</p><p>Other states have reporting obligations to us and we have reporting obligations to them.  We also have reporting obligations to the Commission, as one would expect, in reporting collectively how many incidents we have seen.  We have to report to the Commission on how many entities we are likely to designate in the operators of essential services sector and so on.</p></speech>

No member state has come to us to tell us that it has an incident that affects us.  We received one incident report which was subsequently withdrawn because the entity found that it was not an incident.  We are in discussions with several more digital services providers on potential incidents which they cannot yet confirm have happened.  The issue in this sector is that there can often be a considerable period once a potential incident has been identified before an entity is able to state with certainty that it is actually an incident.  The same issue arises in data protection.</p></speech>

We have not yet had an elongated period in which to make a determination.  Once it has been settled and established for a time, we will have some idea of the workload that is flowing from it and can then make another distinction in staffing.  That will tally nicely with the timing of the new strategy.  The next decision on staffing will flow from the next strategy and/or the operational workload since September.</p></speech>

We benchmark ourselves against similar-sized, high performing NCSCs within the European Union.  We have approached staffing by building capacity, bringing in additional people and making sure they become embedded and fully integrated and understand the work they need to do.  We then move on to the next tranche.  It is a gradual, incremental increase in the overall cohort required in the NCSC and incident response teams.  On quality, the computer security incident response team has international accreditation.  We are very pleased-----</p></speech>

This was not in the strategy itself but in the implementation report that was associated with the strategy.  It was not actually part of the strategy.  It was the steering group that created the strategy to begin with and it had existed since 2011.  Its role was not necessarily governance.  Its role was oversight around the operations of the NCSC to ensure that the Garda, the Defence Forces and the various different Departments had insight into what was going on and that there was transparency around what our Department was doing essentially in the security realm.  The steering committee was replaced fully in 2017 by committee F and the structures around that committee.</p></speech>

To put this in very simple terms, cybersecurity was being treated as a peripheral issue, something that happened in its own space.  In 2017, it became part of the central focus of security in the same way as other organs of the State that deal with security are.</p> <p>  Another aspect to keep in mind is that in the interim we found that having secondees in with us from the Garda and the Defence Forces dealt with oversight issues in a very efficient way on a daily operational level.  In addition, bilateral contacts with the An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Defence Forces, and the Departments of Defence and Justice and Equality allowed us to have the operational response anyway.</p></speech>

The Chairman said it himself.  In the first instance, the responsibility for the security of these companies' systems and data is with them.  The companies are responsible for their own systems with regard to the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and network and information security, NIS.  Our only responsibility with regard to DSPs particularly is <i>post hoc</i>- after the fact.  The directive is explicit that we cannot <i>ex ante </i>audit or assess anybody.  There has to have been an incident.  Our role is literally to go in and assess.  In the regulations we have given ourselves express powers to do exactly that and to issue notices and compliance notices.  We have also given ourselves powers and are in the process of procuring external auditors to conduct audits on our behalf in those companies.  We are ready now to do assessments if we need to but we will have consultancy firms on hand very shortly to step in and engage with the companies directly on our behalf.</p></speech>

If there is an issue, there is some political and democratic accountability through the Minister.  The document also says, however, that the Central Bank is the designated competent authority in respect of the financial and banking market.  Given the importance of the financial sector, is there a representative from the Central Bank on the group?  It would be a calamity if one bank, or every bank, went down and nobody could get their money out of the machine.</p></speech>

Across the different sectors we work directly with the existing sector-specific stability or security mechanism.  In the finance sector it is the financial stability group, FSG, which is led by the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and the National Treasury Management Agency.

With regard to cybersecurity incidents, there is a provision in the directive in article 1.6 around<i>lex specialis</i>.  I am sorry for the complexity but the Chairman did ask.  This means that if there is a sector specific piece of European Union legislation - in this case PSD 2 which is the payment services directive No. 2 - that imposes obligations on entities that are judged to be sufficient or in excess of NIS in this case, the competent authority can deem that the European Union sector-specific legislation applies in respect of those services.  In financial services and credit institutions - those two out of seven - is that the Central Bank has designated entities where it has said an entity is now an OES but it has disapplied the security measures.  The Central Bank already has PSD 2 in place and implemented, but the incident reporting obligation in NIS applies.</p><p>Importantly, for the purpose of this conversation, the reporting obligation is to us, not to anybody else.  The computer security incident response team, CSIRT, within the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, is the focal point for all incident reporting in the State.  We receive incident reports from the financial services sector in the same way as we receive them from the aviation sector or the public sector.  All those are centralised in the NCSC within the CSIRT in our database of, what we call, bad stuff.  It is a collective intelligence framework of malware now seized and we can then act on that as if it were any other sector.</p></speech>

Since then we have revised those guidelines on the basis of international experience and commentary received in that process.  We will be publishing those very shortly for further consultation, as required under regulation 25 of our regulations.

This is an organisation run on a contract basis by the public service.  The minute a call is received the service can identify the physical location of the person by way of the mobile phone and in that way it would be possible to identify the location of the entire population.  Mr. Browne is advising that this service does not come under the directive.  I would consider it to be a breach of cyber security if that information were to fall into the wrong hands in that it would be possible to identify the physical location of everybody in the country just like that.</p></speech>

When the ECAS gets that file hash it can decrypt what is in that and then it sends that to the relevant emergency service.  The ECAS system, under the operator's template, has the GPS co-ordinates and the Eircode, if applicable, and that is then passed to whoever.  In some cases people have the facility to utilise that and to give it to the handset in the ambulance as it happens.  The Garda and the fire service are slightly further behind but that will happen in respect of those also.  The contract for the ECAS takes due diligence from both data protection and the security of the individual's data as handed to them.  The ECAS is subject to the GDPR, as are we, so the data protection issues are fully comprehended in the contract also.</p></speech>

Waste management planning, including with regard to infrastructure provision, is the responsibility of local authorities under Part II of the Waste Management Act 1996, as amended.  It is also important to recognise that, under section 60(3) of that Act, the Minister is precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance, in specific cases, by a local authority of their statutory functions under the Act.</p> <p>  National waste policy is set out in the policy document, A Resource Opportunity.  European, national and regional waste policy is predicated on the waste hierarchy, as set out in the waste framework directive.  Under the waste hierarchy the prevention, preparation for reuse, recycling and recovery of waste is preferred, in that order, to the disposal or placing in landfill of waste.  Ireland&rsquo;s waste management practices, infrastructure and regulation have improved radically over the past 20 years.  Since 2012, there has been a clear Government policy focus on waste as a resource, and the reduction in the use of landfill.  Ireland has made significant progress in improving its recycling and recovery rates and we are now among the top performing EU countries.</p> <p>  The share of managed municipal solid waste, MSW, that is disposed in landfill fell from 41% in 2012 to 26% in 2016.  That means that about three quarters of MSW was recycled, used as a fuel or as cover material, instead of going to landfill.  More residual waste is now used as a fuel, through energy recovery, than is disposed of in landfill.  There are now only four landfills actively accepting municipal wastes in the State; whereas 18 landfills accepted waste in 2012 and 89 landfills were accepting waste in 1995.  Similarly, almost 1.5 million tonnes of MSW were placed in landfill as recently as 2010.  By 2016, this amount had been more than halved, to approximately 700,000 tonnes.</p> <p>  Thermal recovery activities sit on the recovery tier of the waste hierarchy and have a role to play in reducing our dependence on the disposal of waste to landfill.  Thermal recovery activities include waste to energy, co-incineration, pyrolysis and gasification, where the principal use of waste is as a fuel to generate energy.  The most recent iteration of regional waste management plans set out how waste generated will be managed over the time period 2015 to 2021, in line with national and EU waste management policy.  These regional plans support the development of up to 300,000 tonnes of additional thermal recovery capacity nationally, which includes waste to energy, out to 2030.  This figure was determined, first, to ensure that there is adequate and competitive treatment capacity in the market, and second, to ensure the State&rsquo;s self-sufficiency requirements for the recovery of municipal waste are met.  Furthermore, that level of thermal recovery capacity takes account of the requirement to achieve a recycling rate of municipal waste in excess of 60% by 2030, which is in line with new EU recycling targets for MSW.</p> <p>  Good waste management planning aims to maximise prevention and recycling and minimise the quantity of residual waste arising.  It also recognises the need for sustainable infrastructure to deal with residual waste that we cannot prevent or recycle, as we move away from the less sustainable than the use of landfill.</p> <p>  The European Commission published a communication on the role of waste to energy in the circular economy in January 2017.  The Commission acknowledged that the transition towards a circular economy requires striking the right balance when it comes to waste-to-energy capacity for the treatment of non-recyclable waste.  The communication advised that waste-to-energy processes can play a role in the transition to a circular economy provided that the EU waste hierarchy is used as a guiding principle, as is the case in national and regional waste management policy in Ireland. </p></speech>

I am joined by Mary Gurrie, programme manager, and Patrick Byrne, senior inspector.</p><p>We represent the leadership team in environmental enforcement in the EPA.  We will be pleased to address any questions committee members may have on the EPA's role.</p><p> As the committee is aware, the EPA is an independent statutory body, established under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992.  We have a wide range of responsibilities, including the regulation of large-scale industrial and waste facilities.  There are just over 800 such facilities licensed by the EPA.</p><p> The EPA's specific role in the regulation of the waste sector includes authorisation through licensing and the enforcement of licences issued.  There are 207 waste activities licensed by the EPA, including landfill sites, the larger waste transfer stations, incinerators and other activities such as compost facilities.  The EPA attaches conditions to each licence to ensure that, properly operated, the activity will not cause environmental pollution.</p><p> As the focus of this session is incineration, the committee will be interested to note there are two commercial waste incinerator facilities licensed by the EPA that accept municipal waste.  In addition, there are nine facilities in the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector that are licensed to operated hazardous waste incinerators for the treatment of waste generated by their facilities.  Three cement production facilities are licensed to co-incinerate certain waste material as alternative fuels.  A summary of the licence details of each of these plants is provided in our written submission for the information of the committee.</p><p> The two incinerators licensed to accept municipal waste are the Indaver facility in Carranstown, County Meath, which commenced operations in 2011 and is authorised to accept 235,000 tonnes of residual waste per annum, and the Dublin Waste to Energy incinerator in Poolbeg, which commenced operations in 2017 and is authorised to accept 600,000 tonnes of waste per annum.  The licences for both incinerators contain more than 100 conditions to control the environmental aspects of the activity, including the quantities and types of waste that may be accepted, the control and abatement infrastructure required to reduce emissions and limit values for air, water and noise emissions.  While the licenceholders are responsible for complying with the licence conditions, the EPA enforces the conditions through an annual programme of inspections, environmental monitoring and assessment, the identification of non-compliance and, where appropriate, the prosecution of non-compliant operators.  In this context, it can be noted the EPA successfully prosecuted Dublin Waste to Energy for breach of licence conditions relating to instant notification in 2017.</p><p> Both facilities are required to monitor emissions to atmosphere for a range of parameters, including continuous dioxin sampling and analysis, which is reported fortnightly.  In addition, the EPA conducts its own independent air emissions monitoring of the facilities.  All monitoring results over the past two years for both facilities have been compliant with the licence conditions.</p><p> The EPA is aware of the public concerns regarding emissions from the Poolbeg facility in particular.  For additional public assurance and information, the EPA installed an ambient air quality monitoring station in Ringsend in July 2017.  Real-time monitoring results are available on the EPA website.  Results to date show that the air quality recorded in Ringsend is compliant with national air quality standards and is consistent with air quality elsewhere in Dublin.</p><p> I assure the committee that the EPA continues to closely monitor operations at all incineration facilities to ensure a high level of environmental protection.  I thank committee members for their attention.</p></speech>

Will Dr. Ryan expand on why the EPA classified the incident at Poolbeg on 7 June last year as a lime release when, in fact, it was a release of flue gas treatment residue, which included dioxins and heavy metals and not just lime?  My next question, on the climate action fund, is for the Department and the EPA.  Funding was given to a district heating system as part of the climate action fund in the Dublin area.  Is it a pilot project?  Will we see district heating systems rolled out?</p></speech>

The Dublin Waste to Energy facility built in Poolbeg was integrated so it could accommodate district heating being developed in the local area, and it is to support that development that an allocation has been made from the fund.  It will be a contribution towards the cost of that district heating.  It is for an operational district heating system in the new area that will be developed in that part of the south dockland area.</p></speech>

The facility already produces power that goes into the grid but for the heat we need to have a community nearby to benefit from it.  It would probably depend on the actual project being proposed.  The Dublin project is probably the best case in Ireland given that it is built within a city, which would not be unusual in a European context.</p></speech>

It involved one of the abatement filter systems that uses lime to clean the exhaust emissions.  There was a breach of the hatches in the system and a spill of the lime that contained some of the substances filtered in the exhaust.  They were contained within the facility, treated as hazardous waste, dealt with in that manner and exported for disposal.</p></speech>

My first question is for Mr. Collins on the legislation and the role of the Minister.  He stated the Minister's role is to provide a comprehensive legislative and policy framework but then the Minister is precluded from exercising any power or control with regard to the performance of local authorities and their functions.  It is 22 years since the legislation was introduced.  Does Mr. Collins believe that lack of control or power from which the Minister suffers under the legislation has been good or bad?  Why was it introduced?  It strikes me that the most controversial move after the introduction of the legislation was the building of the incinerator in Ringsend, which was strongly opposed by the local community, local councillors and the council in general.  I was a councillor and three times we voted against it going ahead, rightly or wrongly.  It meant we had no recourse to Parliament to ask whether it could do something about it.  Instead, the city manager made the decision, first under John Tierney and later under the current regime in Dublin City Council.  The power the Minister has to listen to the democratic wishes of the people was totally removed.  I assume Mr. Collins will say it is a good thing that we have an incinerator up and running and working and that the people did not get their way.  Does he not think there is a democratic deficit in how waste management policy is structured?  I will come back to another reason I believe it does not just apply to incineration.</p></speech>

The Minister does not have a role in stating what are the EPA's functions and the local authority's functions.  From an environmental perspective, the establishment of the EPA as an independent agency was a foundation stone of environmental protection in Ireland.  It is probably one of the strengths of the system that the EPA is an independent agency that is able to go about assessing, issuing and enforcing the licence requirements under European legislation.  I am not sure but it might be a requirement of the European legislation to have this independence.</p><p> The roles of the local authority system and of the Minister are established under legislation.  The executive functions are set by the Oireachtas in the Waste Management Act and that provides for the statutory responsibility of the local authorities to carry out certain functions.  The Minister's role under the legislation is to provide the policy framework and to bring forward legislative proposals.  It derives from the Oireachtas as the Parliament itself established that framework for decision making and enforcement.</p></speech>

It extends to another one, and it is close to my home.  On my doorstep there is a site belonging to Thorntons Recycling, which has the contract for all the brown bins in all the hospitals, colleges and McDonalds branches in the greater Dublin area.  A large amount of brown bin content is going to that site, which is no more than a quarter of a kilometre away from one of the most densely populated working-class areas in Dublin.  Thorntons Recycling processes all of the rotten, smelly food in that plant.  It bales it and brings it to a site in County Meath.  It has been a bone of contention for the residents of Ballyfermot for a long time and probably once a week, I have to email the EPA to complain about the smells, either on my behalf or on behalf of other residents.  It depends on which way the wind blows.  Fair play to the EPA it always responds to me quickly to say it is sending out an inspector, but by the time an inspector arrives the smell is usually gone.  The inspectors seldom find odours.  There was a reference earlier to a prosecution of Covanta.  Thorntons Recycling has been prosecuted on several occasions but the maximum fine that can be imposed on the company is &euro;3,000, which is like lunch money for a company that is making so much profit.  Does Mr. Collins, as a representative of the Department, think there is a weakness in the legislation both in the Minister not having oversight and the lack of penalties for companies that breach the parameters set down by the EPA?</p></speech>

The company has been in court two or three times and it has paid the fines, but it is like lunch or pocket money for the company compared with the profits it makes and the money it saves on diesel, location of workers and so forth by being on the doorstep of a big working-class estate such as Ballyfermot.  My argument is that it should not be there.  It can operate where it wishes but not on the doorstep of an area that is densely populated by families, children and old people who have chronic chest and other illnesses.</p></speech>

It is not that the activity is taking place in an uncontrolled manner.  It is operating within a regulated framework.  I will have to check the details relating to the fines.  We are governed by separate legislation that deals with fines and penalties and what can be imposed by a court.  That would be dependent on the nature and class of the offence that has occurred.  We operate under that framework in terms of legislation.  I presume the fines could be higher depending on the severity but that is related to what the judge has determined is the appropriate level of fine for the offence that is being prosecuted.</p></speech>

I am representing people in the Ringsend area who have asked me to say that people living around Dublin Bay often see the smoke coming out of the chimneys and are concerned about its condition.  It is thick, dense and incessant.  They worry about what pollutants are going into the air they are breathing.  What guarantees can we give them, beyond what has been said here?  Is it similar to the situation with Thorntons Recycling whereby if somebody makes a complaint an inspector is sent, or are there EPA people on site constantly monitoring what happens in the incinerator?</p> <p>  In addition, there is residual waste from incineration.  I understand a dump in Drehid, County Kildare, was recently given planning permission to take that waste.  Can the witnesses describe how toxic, dangerous, safe or otherwise it is and what happens to it?  Does it suffer if there is extreme rainfall or bad winds?  How is all that managed?  I am asking many questions but I represent ordinary people who want to know this stuff and who do not appear to understand or have a communications or consultation method that reassures them that all is well.</p></speech>

The EPA has no control over the fines set in the legislation and imposed by the Judiciary.  Our general enforcement approach has been to respond quickly to complaints about sites.  We send out an inspector to make an assessment and if we can impose some requirement on the licensee to carry out abatement immediately or after a while, we find that to be the quickest and most effective way to get the best environmental outcome and try to improve the quality of the environment or to abate the nuisance that has been reported to us, if it is verified.  That is our general stance in dealing with these matters.  However, we take prosecutions where and when we consider it appropriate, and we have a record of doing that.</p> <p>  Turning to the emissions from the incinerator plant in Poolbeg, we are all familiar with the white clouds that emerge.</p><p>The process within the facility is that waste of a certain prescribed type is brought into the plant, burnt on the incinerator grate and the exhaust fumes are taken through a series of abatement measures that scrub out the pollutants and clean the exhaust air with the best available techniques.  The residual that goes out through the stack is water vapour and small quantities of whatever residual materials have come through the system.  All our measurements on and off site show that any residual materials coming through over the past couple of years have been within safe environmental limits.  The plumes that are seen are to a large extent water vapour.  We continually monitor that.  The monitoring of the emissions is a defence in depth where there is monitoring on site by the operator, by us and off-site ambient monitoring by the EPA.</p><p> With regard to our presence on site it is a facility that we visit very frequently, this year alone we have been there 13 times.  It is a site that we pay particular attention to.</p></speech>

If we are so good at reducing waste why do we need more incinerators, such as the application for one in Ringaskiddy and there is talk of another one in Limerick?  Does Mr. Ryan think they should be given permission to build?  If we are so good at reducing and getting such great results where will all this waste come from to keep all those incinerators going?</p></speech>

It is one of the tools to achieving our goals in the circular economy.  For example, the EU has recently adopted a new legally binding target, which will apply to Ireland, that only a maximum of 10% of municipal waste should go to landfill by 2030.  We are continuing to reduce the amount of material that will be going to landfill.  That is in line with the waste hierarchy which sets landfill as the least preferable option.  Ahead of that there is recovery, where waste to energy facilities would sit.  In that context there is a role for incineration in helping us achieve our targets and to move further up the waste hierarchy.  My understanding is that the regional waste plans developed by the local authorities the Deputy referred to have used assumptions of achieving the new recycling targets for 2030.  They have identified an additional need for further incineration and waste to energy facilities in Ireland for the full attainment of those targets in line with the circular economy package.  On the one hand, we want to move to 10% landfill, a dramatic reduction in the material going to landfill and on the other, we want to achieve the 70% recycling target for packaging as well as the recycling targets for municipal landfill as well.  Those assumptions are built into the regional waste plans.  The rationale is that even meeting those goals, there is still an additional requirement for a thermal treatment in the Irish system.</p></speech>

We are trying to reduce plastic, to recycle more, we already use Poolbeg and Meath, why do we need more waste incineration in the country?  If Mr. Collins cannot answer that and it is part of the local authorities' plan we should have them in here to question them about their plan and where they get these assumptions from.</p></speech>

We are continuing to eliminate and minimise all landfill.  Some of the material from municipal waste is not to go to landfill in the future and thermal treatment is higher up the waste hierarchy, is completely in line with EU waste policy and has been endorsed by the European Commission.  That is why we need more thermal treatment, so that we do not rely on landfills around the country.</p></speech>

I take it has not been licensed by the EPA yet as it has not been built.  Dr. Ryan mentioned there were more than 100 conditions for Poolbeg.  Were they planning conditions or conditions coming from the EPA?  What is the process for getting the licence?  Is it a public process, does it take submissions, is it an individual process between the company and the EPA and where do things such as a district heat system come into that project?  Are they considered at that stage or the planning stage?</p></speech>

We do not have any application for consideration but I can talk generally about the process.  There would be an application to us, that is a very public process where there is a role for public participation and submissions.  The process is set down in legislation.  Any plant would have to comply with European standards and best available techniques.  There is an environmental impact assessment where required.  All submissions from the public would be taken into account.  This is standard practice, different legislation applies and there is specific legislation on incineration.</p> <p>  If any application like this is granted it is granted on the basis of conditions which are aimed at the protection of the environment and set against the best available European technology, techniques and local situation is taken into account.  All this is focused on protection of the environment and safe operation of the plant.</p></speech>

I think I got the gist of it.  Deputy Smith mentioned the Drehid landfill which is in my constituency of north Kildare, or it was until the boundary changed but it is still local to me.</p><p>One of the issues regarding it is the haulage routes.  The landfill site is one issue but the haulage routes are problematic because a significant volume of HGVs and trucks use local backroads and travel through the towns of Sallins, Clane and Prosperous to approach the facility.  When planning permission was granted there were four or more haulage routes identified to access the facility but I understand only two of those are being used.  All the haulage routes are on the local rural roads.  The county council has done its best to reinforce those roads and do some road upgrades but they are still not suitable for that volume of truck traffic.  It occurs to me there might be another route.   There is the Edenderry Road which passed through Kilshanroe.  That might be an option to approach the back of the Drehid facility.  It would be a higher class road and it might be a more appropriate avenue to access the plant.  The representatives might comment on that suggestion or they might want to consider it and communicate with me later.</p><p> The other issue relates to the hierarchy of planning.  I was involved in a local matter recently, which was a potential EPA issue.  There was confusion about it and I attended a meeting of the county council.  There is a hierarchy in terms of the waste permits, waste licences and the granting of planning permission.  A group of disgruntled residents had an issue with a particular site, and the matter could have been referred to one or three bodies or none of them, in terms of whether it was an EPA issue, a county council environment issue or a county council planning issue or, arguably, a fourth body, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, depending on the nature of the facility.  I do not know if there are any legislative or other reforms considered in that area.  It seems the county council licensed the smaller ones, namely the waste permits, and that the EPA licensed the more significant ones.  I am not sure what level of co-operation exists.  A question raised at that meeting was whether, if the council had a concern, it would pass it on to the EPA.  Is there communication to and fro regarding those types of sites or is there a silo approach to them?  How does the process work currently?  Is it cumbersome?  Do issues arise?  Are there any plans to consider streamlining or addressing that issue?</p></speech>

The EPA licence only covers the site, not the surrounding roads.</p> <p>  In terms of the hierarchy, as the Deputy said, the planning consent process is completely separate from the waste regulation process.  There are two tiers, namely, the waste facility permits which are issued and enforced by the local authority and, for specified activities, an EPA licence is required.  The responsibility for enforcement for a waste permit sits with the local authority but considerable work is being done on improving local authority enforcement and regional waste enforcement lead authorities have been set up.  Dublin City Council would be the relevant one to deal with the east midlands.  The EPA chairs the NIECE network, which is the network for the enforcement of all environmental regulators.  There is support and assistance available to try to improve it.  The EPA has a role in the oversight of the statutory performance of local authorities.  If somebody felt that a local authority was not conducting its statutory duties to enforce a licence, they could make a complaint to the EPA and we would follow up to check if the local authority has taken the necessary action to examine the matter.  There is considerable work involved in terms of co-operation and statutory oversight.</p></speech>

I read the presentation and I am glad I have an opportunity to ask some brief questions.  My first question relates to the Poolbeg incinerator.  I understand a recent EPA inspection showed that some of the material which was used in the incinerator should not have been used in that it came from a two-bin - rather than a three-bin - collection area.  In other words, there is a concern that such practice will undermine our ability to recycle and develop a sustainable waste stream system.  I understand in that inspection there was evidence that material had been returned from the site as inappropriate but that the logging, recording of and accounting for what happened there was not appropriate.  Can Dr. Ryan confirm if there was an EPA inspection in that regard and, if so, what sanctions were applied to the company?</p></speech>

We discussed that earlier.  The issue was that the seals on one of the hatches of the filtration system were not appropriately installed which led to a breach of the hatch and a spill of lime into the facility.  This was in 2017.  Lime is used as part of the cleaning process.  That was contained within the facility and we carried out an investigation.  There were workers in the vicinity as well.

The waste coming in has to meet that criteria to be processed by the plant.  The operator of the facility has to have a process in place for periodically checking the categorisation of that waste.  When the EPA is on site it will often check what is coming into the facility and have it tipped up to ensure it is appropriate.  On one occasion it was noted the wrong type of waste was going into the facility.  A non-compliance investigation was opened on that.  The process is about making sure that the acceptance procedures are improved and that only the appropriate materials are accepted on-site.</p></speech>

I read about giving up on incineration as a circular economy would lead us to recovering materials such that we would not have to burn our waste.  Why, therefore, are we considering further expansion of capacity, with an additional 90,000 tonnes at Poolbeg, a cement plant in Limerick and a further 250,000 tonnes in Cork?  Why are we going against European policy with this major expansion of incineration capacity?  Clear recommendations are made in the European Circular Economy document.</p></speech>

In the future there will be a role for waste energy processes in achieving one of the legally binding targets adopted at European level and which Ireland supports - a reduction of the amount of material going to landfill to 10%.  We have dramatically reduced the amount which in the past few years has been more than halved and we will reduce it even further.  There are materials that we do not want to go to landfill and waste energy is one of the processes that can be used in that regard.  The waste to energy capacity identified by the regional planning authorities and in waste management plans builds in the assumption that the 2030 recycling goals will be achieved.  It is consistent with them.</p></speech>

On waste policy, the Minister is precluded from exercising powers in many areas.  In this country we have an unusual way of collecting waste if we compare it with models used in other European states where more contro is exercisedl by local authorities.  The services are either provided directly by a local authority or using a franchise model.  Here we have what is termed "side by side" competition, although many householders might say there is not much competition and that it is actually side by side price fixing.</p><p> A few issues arise.  Has the Department given serious consideration to other models?  There are three separate trucks belonging to different companies coming in during the morning to collect waste so the issue of carbon emissions arises at a time when we are supposed to be reducing such emissions.  We know the transport sector is one of the more challenging in the context of reducing the amount of energy we use.  We had a discussion in the D&aacute;il about this earlier.  there is a complete clash between waste policy and our climate change targets in that three large trucks are doing the job one truck should be doing because we have side-by-side competition.  That is just one effect.  There is also the issue of trucks coming in and out of small residential areas at different times, which can be a bit disruptive.  That is one of the issues I would highlight.</p><p> The issue of value for money also arises.  If we look at the cost of waste collection here compared with other states, it does not show that this side-by-side competition is any cheaper or confers any real economic benefit on the householder.</p><p> The issue of control arises.  Local councillors and the Oireachtas have no control.  It is "Hands off.  This is the Wild West.  We'll leave it to ye lads.  Have a look at it, bring in a bit of light regulation and let it run on from there".  A report produced by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, raised the question of having a franchise model where the local authority would put it out to tender, members of the local authority and officials would make a decision on the best tender to accept.  It would be tendered for a period of between three and five years taking a number of things into consideration such as the ability of the contractor, price, means of disposing of waste and good environmental practice.  Has this been considered at official level?  The Minister should really be calling in departmental officials and making political decisions on this.  I wonder whether things are decided by officials behind the scenes because some people say they constitute the permanent Government.  I do not know.  I have never been in government so I do not know whether this is true.  I have a suspicion that there is a grain of truth to it.  Are officials having those conversations?</p><p> In the context of incineration, waste gas is being burnt off at landfill sites.  It has been burnt off at the site in Kyletalesha in County Laois for 12 or 13 years.  I remember raising the fact that they were going to put a flare on it at a council meeting.  I asked if it could be captured and harnessed for natural gas and maybe used to generate electricity or used another way.  Our guests from the EPA referred to monitoring.  What are their views on that because a number of these old landfill sites, some of which are very large, particularly those in the commuter belt, generate significant amounts of methane?  Do our guests from the EPA have any comments about that?  From the agency's perspective, what are the challenges with those old landfill sites?</p></speech>

It was about emissions being released from old landfill sites.  There is probably a number of technical issues here.  These are historic landfill sites.  The goal is to capture the methane that is being released as a natural process from landfill sites as the material decays.  It is being captured and converted by flaring into CO2 so that has a less damaging impact on the climate.  That is the purpose of the process so, in a sense, it is mitigating the damage being done by waste landfills.  If one thinks about what we are doing with waste to energy, one can see that it is the same thing.  We are-----</p></speech>

The landfills in question were designed many years ago.  It is probably an engineering question that I am not qualified to answer in terms of the ability to provide an energy source that could be used for electricity generation.  The more modern, purpose-built waste-to-energy facilities are designed for that purpose from the outset.  For example, the Poolbeg facility already generates electricity so rather than the materials going to landfill, we are reducing the number of landfills and the amount of material going to them.  In line with the principles of the circular economy, we are using the material and trying to keep the value of materials in the economy for longer by extracting the energy value.</p></speech>

A permit system is in place.  Regarding the policy issue mentioned by the Deputy, the Department will commence a review of our national waste policy this year.  The reason we are looking at it now is because the European package of waste legislation - the circular economy package - and some legislation on plastics are very near conclusion and should be finalised by quarter 1.  Given the long-term context and the fact that the targets we will work to meet for 2025, 2030 and 2035 are going to be set, it is an opportune time to review the policy.  As part of that review, we will take on board the information from the CCPC report and the issues it raised as well as the information we received from the price monitoring group in terms of charging for residential collection services.

I have followed a number of different lines.  I looked at all of the meetings involving the former Minister and different parties to the tender process and gone through them in some detail, considering available minutes or any testimony to which I had access.  I had access to the testimony of different people as to what was discussed at those meetings.  I confirm that for 37 of those meetings where there is third-party verification present, the national broadband plan was not discussed.  I am reliant on the former Minister and Mr. McCourt for the view that there was no discussion of the national broadband plan at the other three meetings.  While I have no reason to believe that the national broadband plan was discussed based on what was presented, I proceeded to look at what has been the impact on the process itself.  In that case, I have much more robust evidence to support the view that nothing has happened with the process.  I have looked at four different things in that regard.  The first thing I looked at was information available to the Minister which could have been passed on to a bidder which would have been of benefit to the bidder.  Purely in view of the nature of the competitive dialogue process where there is ongoing dialogue between the Department and the bidder, information is communicated in real time between the parties in terms of positions on closing contracts, the submission on technical capacity, financing, operation and running and what is being proposed.  There is no basis to assume the Minister has information that the bidder does not already have through the process.  The one thing the bidder does not seem to be taking account of is the Department's affordability envelope.  The Minister is privy to that and it is evident from the discussion on 26 June that the bidder was being pressed to bring the cost down.  In my experience, if someone has evidence or a view of what the affordability is, tenders tend to come in very close to that number.  For me, that is the evidence that the information was not communicated.</p> <p>  I have gone further and looked at how the documents evolved and who was involved in making changes to them and whether the Minister had any involvement in that.  All of that is happening at the bottom level of the teams.  When I look at the evaluation process, the evaluation teams are acting completely independently.  Even when one comes up to the next level of management, those managers cannot change the outcome of the evaluation.  They can comment on the way things are phrased and presented but they cannot actually go back to evaluation teams and require them to change a finding with which management does not agree.  That is totally within the gift of the evaluation team.  Having followed those chains of evidence through the process, I am satisfied that the process is safe.</p></speech>

I have another engagement to attend but I might get back before the end of this meeting.  We all appreciate that this may go on.  I may not hear Mr. Smyth's direct answer but I will read the transcript.  I have four simple questions that people have asked me on the streets or in conversation.  People who elect us ask about this on a regular basis.  They are basic but kernel questions from the man on the street.  First, did the then Minister, Deputy Naughten, interfere in the process?  Second, did he attempt to interfere?  Third, did he have any information available to him which could have been of benefit to the bidder?  Fourth, is Mr. Smyth convinced the process is untainted and that we are good to go?  Those questions are simply put and there is no point in elaborating on them.</p></speech>

I am pretty unequivocal about that.  It is reasonable to state that he had information which would have been of benefit to the bidder.  However, the nature of the dialogue process meant the time lag between the Minister having that information and the bidder having it was minimal if not almost non-existent.  The information was being passed almost in real time because of the way the dialogue process was being carried out.</p></speech>

I want to pull back from the process a little to try to understand the rules of engagement.  Mr. Smyth will be familiar with the document National Broadband Plan: State Led Intervention: Communication Protocol between DCCAE and External Stakeholders, a third updated version of which was published on 1 September 2016.  Said document sets out the rules of engagement on communications between the Department and bidders.  On section 9 of the document which is headed "Canvassing", the approach Mr. Smyth took was to consider whether there had been interference and whether the process had been tainted.  The Minister outlined for us yesterday that Mr. Smyth set out four key questions against which he tested everything in his consideration as to whether the procurement process was compromised in any way.  We accept that was the basis for his report and leave it aside.  I want to understand why Mr. Smyth did not look at two other aspects of the matter.  First, were the rules broken in the communication between the parties?  If so, did the breach have the capacity to taint or in any way disrupt the process?  It seems to me that Mr. Smyth did part B without looking at part A.  At least, that is my reading of his report.</p> <p>  In light of the document setting out the rules on communication, does Mr. Smyth believe the prohibition on canvassing applies?  It refers clearly to "Direct or indirect canvassing by any Bidder, Consortium Member, Bidder Member or their suppliers or advisers in relation to the Project or the Procurement" and states, "Any breach of this section will entitle the Department to immediately disqualify the Bidder concerned from the Procurement."</p><p>I would like to discuss that matter with Mr. Smyth.  Why did he not give consideration to what seems to be an obvious breach of that rule?</p></speech>

There were several meetings.  The meeting in New York clearly should not have happened in light of the guidelines.  All sorts of flags should be raised when a discussion happens without a member of the national broadband plan team present.  It is the only meeting from which we have minutes which prove that a discussion took place that should not have taken place.  What does Mr. Smyth think they were doing?  What was Mr. McCourt doing?</p></speech>

The meeting in Clare that happened on 16 or 17 September 2017 took place when there were two other bidders in the race.  It took place in the context of SIRO making it clear that it would possibly not remain in the race.  Let us return to what Deputy Smith said earlier.  The average punter thinks Mr. Smyth and everybody else involved believes in fairy tales if they think there was no discussion of the national broadband plan at any time during that encounter.  The then Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and one of the bidders were in a convivial environment.  They had a dinner at the home of one of the bidders.  Mr. Smyth does not believe there was any chance whatsoever of such discussion taking place and he is basing his assumption on telephone calls he has had with the participants.  These statements taken by Mr. Smyth, which were not sworn statements, followed all of the other participants saying they did not discuss the national broadband plan when they were confronted with the matter in public prior to Mr. Smyth's investigation.  Mr. Smyth has not made any sort of finding.  He has not raised any concern.  Does Mr. Smyth accept that if the national broadband plan was discussed at that particular point in September 2017, when there were two other bidders in the race, that would have given rise to considerable concern?</p></speech>

There were three bidders in a race.  Two were very well known and one was less well known.  One faced certain questions regarding capacity, experience and so on.  Suppose that one of the bidders then decided, in an effort to address that apparent imbalance, to begin a process of dialogue, engagement or advertising.  Suppose that bidder promoted itself as capable, confident and having the necessary wherewithal.  Suppose this was all done in the presence of the Minister.  To me, that is canvassing.  We are politicians.  We canvass in different ways.  We knock on doors and talk to people.  We like to get our pictures in the paper so that people see us.  Canvassing can happen very overtly or in a subtle way.  One could not term what happened here as anything other than canvassing.  One bidder had multiple opportunities to ingratiate themselves in the eyes of the Minister.  One might say there is a remove between the Minister and the Departmental officials and the team.  There are certain walls there that prevent that.  However there is no benign way to see this as anything other than canvassing.  Whether or not the canvassing had a material outcome is not the relevant point when it comes to these rules being breached.  If one accepts the principle that this is canvassing, the impact is a separate issue.  That is the gap in Mr. Smyth's report, if I might respectfully say so.  He has not looked at all the activities that happened or what the clear intent was.  He could have done that.  He could have made certain findings and still come up with the same conclusions, that is, that the process was not tainted as such.  Mr. Smyth covered that pretty well when he recognised that the Minister's resignation insulated the process from further contamination.</p> <p>  There is one issue.  The former Minister spoke to it in recent days when he stated that his only desire was to keep Mr. McCourt at the table.  SIRO and Eir might have liked to have the same level of desire on the part of the Department and the Minister to keep them at the table.  They had all raised issues of concern.

I have tried as far as possible to work with the facts as I can establish them.  I have avoided speculating and trying to form opinions, and have tried to work to facts.  On that basis, I do not have any facts or information which would lead me to a conclusion that there was canvassing.</p> <p>  What I have said is that the series of meetings, in particular, meetings that did not appear to be necessary in terms of the process, gave cause for concern and they are the reason I was recruited to do the report.  They create what I described as an apparent bias and the Minister stepping down effectively negates that apparent bias.</p> <p>  I accept, if one takes the average man-in-the-street's view, the Deputy is asking the question on the basis that something must have happened but I have no evidence stating that something happened.  I have no evidence of the Minister trying to engage in the process in favour of Granahan McCourt.  That leads me to the conclusion that there was not canvassing.</p></speech>

By Mr. Smyth not being able to say that canvassing took place, neither can he say that it did not.  I would have thought - I am not a lawyer and there are members here more qualified than am I to comment on this - at a minimum it left the situation open to a perception that canvassing took place.  As for bias, Mr. Smyth found the same, "apparent bias", and he used that term.  We can say "apparent canvassing" or the potential for canvassing, or the perception of canvassing, which, in itself, would be a breach of the rules.</p></speech>

I note "process auditor" is Mr. Smyth's title.  One of the most extraordinary statements I heard throughout the whole controversy was when the Taoiseach stated that the problem with the arrangement or meetings, whatever they were, the 18 meetings between the then Minister, Deputy Naughten, and Granahan McCourt, the dinners he had and all the rest of it, was not that they met and had dinner but that he did not have dinner with all the others as well.  In other words, it is okay to have dinner with those who are bidding for the contract but one needs to have dinner with everybody.  The other two bidders were SIRO and Eir.  Did Mr. Smyth question them and did he find out if there were any dinners, lobbying or whatever?</p></speech>

If one reads the report, there are a number of meetings and one-on-ones with the CEO of Eir but the focus of those meetings was all on Eir's roll-out of fibre to the home to 300,000 homes.  It seems to have focused exclusively on that subject because that was where Eir saw the key advantage to it.</p> <p>  The former Minister also had four meetings with the CEO of Vodafone.  The focus there was Vodafone's broadband expansion outside the process and its mobile broadband.</p> <p>  The former Minister did meet the other bidders.  He had engagements and one-on-ones.  One of the meetings with the CEO of Eir was a breakfast meeting.  It was followed by a coffee meeting with the CEO of Vodafone, followed by the launch of the Vodafone Internet of things.  There are different dates on which there were meetings overlapping.</p></speech>

I will find the quote for Mr. Smyth and send it to him.</p> <p>  Mr. Smyth states he believes the process is not tainted by the meetings between Mr. McCourt and the former Minister.  Is the process at all tainted, although maybe not by the meetings?  Most people who vote and put us in this House would look at this and ask, "In the name of God, what sort of tangled web of corruption and deceit is going on here?  What is our public money being spent on?"</p> <p>  Something Mr. Smyth, as somebody who conducts auditing of processes, might explain is whether at any stage he considered that there should be an investigation into the fact that one of the bidders who came late into the process himself was under investigation for the sale of Siteserv and whether that has ramifications for the process of the tendering.  He came in late.  It would be like me coming to compete in the tendering process, as Br&iacute;d Smith Limited, telling Mr. Smyth I have Bank of Ireland and Sisk builders on board and we three will do this together but then, a year later after I got the tender, stating that I have not Bank of Ireland but Bank of America, and I have not Sisk but Murphy.  Is that sort of process okay?  That is what happened here in SSE being replaced by the Irish Infrastructure Fund and then John Laing being replaced by Denis O'Brien at the table.  Is all that acceptable in the process of tendering?</p></speech>

That ended up with a single bidder, Three, which ended up winning the process.  I am glad to say we delivered the project on time and to budget.  I met the bidders at various stages throughout that process.</p><p>Even in this role, as an Opposition spokesperson for this area on this committee, I have met Mr. McCourt, recently and just once.  I meet ESB every now and then.  I meet Eir, meet Vodafone and meet SIRO.  I meet everyone because one needs to talk to people to have an understanding of what is a complex technological area.</p><p>Mr. Smyth detailed all the various meetings that the former Minister, Deputy Naughten, had and I asked myself, &quot;What is different?  Why did the then Minister, Deputy Naughten, resign?&quot;  Maybe I got the answer in a line of Mr. Smyth's report.  Where he speaks of the number of meetings the then Minister had and the dinners he had, Mr. Smyth's report states:</p><blockquote>The remaining meetings as and of themselves gave rise to a concern as they suggest an ongoing engagement between the former Minister and Mr McCourt outside of any formal need for them to engage with each other in the normal course of the Department's business including the State-led intervention under the NBP.</blockquote><p>Given that characterisation, as I read it in the report, does Mr. Smyth agree that what happened in this instance was that some of the meetings were not part of what would ordinarily be regarded as a formal need for engagement between a Minister and industry representatives, including those in a tender process?</p></speech>

It comes back to Deputy Dooley's question about what was wholly necessary.  Most of the meetings can be ascribed to specific activity in the Department in specific areas, and there is a reason for the Minister to be meeting.  There are a number of meetings regarding which there is not a specific tie to the activity of the Department.  Again-----</p></speech>

That is an issue considering the hypersensitivity of the Department on this issue because the Moriarty tribunal concerned another procurement process related to it.  I do not believe the Department would have allowed me to go to a dinner with a bidder on my own.  That would have set so many alarm bells off that there would have been a red alert.  Does Mr. Smyth get a sense from the Department that it recognises that its Minister is not being protected if there are informal meetings of the kind in question, and that it would be very uncomfortable about it happening?</p></speech>

It was mainly a discussion on the use of The Box in Trinity College Dublin and ALTV to train Syrian refugees.  While there is a memo for the meeting in New York, there is only a brief mention of what was the biggest political issue for rural areas and the whole focus of the then Minister.  The thought that there was not really any conversation on that issue is not really credible.  That is why, when the D&aacute;il debated this matter and found out about the series of meetings, there was not really a single dissenting voice in a Chamber of 158 Members, many of whom are friends of former Minister Naughten, for whom I have the highest regard.  There was not really a single dissenting voice on his having to resign.  Is the assessment of the 158 Deputies fair?</p></speech>

The context of this situation is that if the tender process was completed successfully, the Minister with responsibility for signing off on it, having completed due diligence and examined what was involved in detail along with departmental officials, would go to Cabinet and recommend that the contract be approved.  Other Ministers may question the process at Cabinet but the word of the responsible Minister would carry significant weight.  That is how government works.

There are various things a procurement specialist can do to negate the power of a single bidder.  One would ensure that one has as much information as possible on the cost to the bidder of providing the goods or services one is seeking.  In large scale public infrastructure projects, there is a process known as a public sector benchmark which is, effectively, a model of what the project should cost.  That allows the public sector to determine whether it is getting value for money from the private sector by comparing the bid to what it should cost the public sector to carry out the project itself.  In the context of the broadband plan, There is no formal public sector benchmark for the broadband plan but there is a very robust should-cost model to which one can compare the bidder's proposals.</p></speech>

The former Minister advised that he briefed the Secretary General of this meeting.  However, there is no formal minute of the meeting with David McCourt on 31<sup>st</sup>of January.</blockquote> <p>Eir pulled out on 31 January but no officials were present and no minutes were kept.  All we have is a verbal record.  Senator McDowell asked Mr. Smyth whether a formal written statement was taken but it was not.  All we have is the word of the former Minister and the word of David McCourt for what transpired at the meeting.  Does Mr. Smyth find that situation open to huge risk?  A meeting took place on the day eir pulled out yet the people present did not discuss the tendering process for the national broadband plan.  Did the Minister telephone to talk about football, the weather in Clare or whatever?  I am an Opposition spokesperson for communications.  I recall the day that eir pulled out of the process because I felt that the process was in jeopardy.</p></speech>

The Minister was not going to go into the D&aacute;il and say that we still had a live process only for Granahan McCourt to pull out immediately after he made that public statement.  I did not say that the broadband plan was not discussed at the meeting.  It specifically discussed whether Granahan McCourt and the consortium were committed to continuing with the process.</p></speech>

I find it incredible that anything else would happen in that discussion.</p><p>The report continued:</p><blockquote>There was a phone call on the 8<sup>th</sup>of August on foot of a senior sponsors dialogue meeting held earlier on the same day.  The former Minister sent a text message summarising this call to the Secretary General.  However, there is no formal minute of this call.</blockquote> <p>Let me outline what happened.  There was one telephone conversation between Deputy Naughten and David McCourt and then Deputy Naughten sent a text detailing what transpired and what business was discussed to the Secretary General.  Does Mr. Smyth find that strange?  The procurement rules are very clear that a Minister should not meet or have discussions with a bidder, and particularly one remaining bidder, without officials being present.  The report states that there was a phone call but we do not know what happened.  All we have is the recollection by the former Minister or his version of what happened during that telephone conversation.</p><p>I have made a number of telephone calls today but I could not give a verbatim record of what transpired during many of them.  I have a fairly good memory but I could not say word for word what happened in those conversations.  However, I would recall some of the significant details.  Ministers and Deputies are busy people.  Does Mr. Smyth believe relating the conversation verbatim to be a precarious, haphazard and unethical way of doing things?</p></speech>

Both are timed.  The record sent to the Secretary General was pretty much contemporaneous with the call.</p> <p>  The senior sponsors' meeting earlier in the day, which was part of the dialogue process, resulted in a request for contact with the Minister, which was why the phone call was made.  From my perspective, that call was part of the dialogue process.  It would have been preferable to have a third party present to record-----</p></speech>

The nature of the dialogue process is that there is an ongoing exchange and dialogue with the bidders.  It is very different from most of the procurement processes.  The only other process that would be similar is a negotiated process.  All the other processes have an arm's length approach where I send a person a document.  The person answers it and I evaluate it and may ask for clarifications.  A dialogue process is specifically designed to allow the parties to meet, discuss and test and push ideas.</p></speech>

I am on the record of the D&aacute;il as saying to him that he became a prisoner of the process.  Yet we have three meetings and telephone calls where there were no minutes kept and no officials present.  We must rely on the word of the former Minister and the kingpin for the one remaining bidder.  We are accepting their word for it.</p> <p>  Mr. Smyth is a civil servant and is not a legal officer.  He was not looking at this from the point of view of a legal challenge.  I have the four points of reference here.  He looked at from the point of view of commercial sensitivity and whether information may have been imparted and so on.  I contend that the process has not been looked at in terms of whether it has been left open to being legally challenged by somebody in the future because it has been stated that many meetings took place without the presence of officials and without a record being kept.  What was discussed?  We have heard the explanations but neither Deputy Naughten nor David McCourt have confirmed what happened in writing for Mr. Smyth.  We also do not have third party validation of what happened.  That surely leaves the State open to a legal challenge in the future.  Yesterday, the Minister said that his only motivation was to keep the remaining bidder in the process yet Mr. Smyth has said that on three occasions, where no one else was present and no record was kept of the meetings, the national broadband plan was not discussed.  Does Mr. Smyth find that claim to be incredible?</p><p>The national broadband plan, NBP, was not discussed.  Is that not incredible?</p></speech>

I will not give him a legal opinion.  As a process auditor I am precluded from doing that.  If the Deputy reads the rules about a process auditor, it is one of the things that is specifically precluded so I will not give him a legal view or a view as to whether there is a legal challenge.</p> <p>  I have said all along that I have not relied on what the various parties told me was and was not discussed at the meetings.  I cannot speculate on what may have been discussed but I have gone and done the tests that I can to determine whether they did or could have done anything to interfere with the process.  That is the basis of my key finding that the process is safe.</p></speech>

He has said that the NBP was not discussed during those three conversations.  If these facts were presented to anyone on the street they would not say that the NBP had not been discussed.  Why would it not have been discussed?  One of the days this happened was the day that Eir pulled out.  There were no officials present, no minutes.  It was 31 January and we are being told the NBP was not discussed.  I find that incredible.</p></speech>

The bidder would have realised at that stage that it had all the clout.  Mr. Smyth knows how a negotiation with tenderers or any kind of negotiation works.  There is always a power play and at that point the remaining bidder holds the full deck of cards.  We are saying the Minister met him to make sure he was motivated to stay in the process.  He has put this on the record.  The Minister had the weakest hand here and any business person in that situation would be saying to the Minister, or whoever was on the other side, that they would remain in the process provided the terms and conditions were suitable to their needs, if not they would not stay in it.  Does Mr. Smyth not agree?</p></speech>

In terms of the procurement process in general there is a selection process in that I am deciding whether the bidder has the capacity to do what I want to do.  I will have questions in the process which determine whether the bidder has the capacity to do something.  It then moves into an award process where I look at methodology and how the bidder will do something and I use that to decide.  Selection is a pass-fail question.  One bidder can pass with 100% and another might pass with 40%.  The award questions consider how the bidder proposes to do this.  When I sit down and test the methodology, I ask if I believe the bidder can deliver that.  When I have assessed both I will consider cost information.</p></speech>

In a competitive dialogue, I may have a view on what it might cost but the function of a competitive dialogue is that I do not have a particular view on how this will be done.  The purpose of the dialogue is to have a discussion with the potential bidders about what it is I am going to buy and then get to the end of the dialogue and say we have discussed the art of the possible, this is what I want to buy, tell me how it will be delivered and how much it will cost.  This dialogue process was slightly different because the tenderers all had different start points.  Their approaches to doing something were never going to be the same.  It was not trying to get to a single model that all bidders would bid against because the only way they could do that was if all bidders were identical.  It was trying to get to a stage where all the bidders were putting forward their best proposals against a set of criteria, which had been set out at the very beginning, that they must meet.  That set of criteria has never been changed.  Everybody is then bidding against that but because of the dialogue it was not starting, knowing exactly what it was it wanted to buy and therefore a cost model could not be done.  It was done on the basis of having an idea of what the outcome would look like but in terms of how this was done and delivered I do not have that view of the world.  The purpose of the dialogue is to get that view of the world.</p><p>Would the end game for anybody tendering for it not be supplying fibre broadband to the 540,000 homes identified by the Department?

Cormac will make opening remarks on behalf of Pepper.</p> <p>  We are here to discuss Project Glenbeigh, which we concluded on this day last week.  In this regard, we recognise that non-performing loan, NPL, transactions attract considerable attention and are of real interest to the committee.  As a result, as soon as we announced the deal last Thursday, Cormac and I wrote to the Chairman to offer to meet with the committee to discuss the transaction.  We have circulated a schematic which details the key elements of the transaction.  As the committee knows, Project Glenbeigh is the second major transaction undertaken by the bank this year to reduce the ratio of NPLs on its balance sheet.  At the start of this year, that ratio stood at approximately 26%.  Together, the transactions will see the ratio fall to below 10%, a significant improvement which will strengthen the bank by enabling it to withstand future economic shock and increase its ability to compete strongly in the years ahead.</p> <p>  This latest transaction had been signalled by the bank for some time.  When we met with the committee in October, we confirmed we were considering options for a substantial NPL loan portfolio and that we hoped to conclude the transaction within months.  In addition, we told the committee we were examining various capital market options including securitisation.  In the end, we chose securitisation, the option which is particularly suitable in this instance as the portfolio is made up exclusively of borrowers whose loans are non-performing by reference to the guidance and definitions set down by the regulatory authorities but who are meeting the terms of restructuring arrangements which have been agreed between the account holders and the bank.  The customers are engaging, have a proven record of meeting the terms of restructuring agreements and generate a steady stream of cashflow.  </p> <p>  In considering options for the portfolio, we had a number of priorities.  First, we wanted to explore all the alternatives for the portfolio.  These included a further loan sale and, as discussed at the bank&rsquo;s last appearance before the committee, to provide for, and then derecognise, the loans.  The loan sale option was discounted due to the characteristics of the portfolio of loans.  The provide-and-derecognise option was discounted due to the high capital cost to the taxpayer and the question marks remaining as to whether derecognition would be forthcoming.  This led us to the preferred alternative of a capital markets solution.</p> <p>  Second, we were mindful of our responsibilities to customers whose loans are included in the transaction and, therefore, we wanted to source a capital markets solution that maintained the long-term treatments they had agreed with the bank.  In seeking to keep as many customers in their homes as possible through the crisis, PTSB offered the split mortgage and part capital and interest treatments widely.  By comparison, to our knowledge, Bank of Ireland did not offer the split mortgage treatment at all, while PTSB offered a far greater number of split mortgages than AIB.</p><p>According to published accounts, split mortgages only make up 6% of forborne loans at AIB whereas in PTSB it is 24%.  In addition, PTSB has warehoused up to 80% of the debt in some cases.  This is important since, in the SSM's NPL guidance, 20% is the level above which the warehouse and main mortgage are deemed to be connected thereby rendering it a non-performing loan.</p><p> We wanted to attract credible investors who will hold the notes issued by the securitisation vehicle for the long term.  We have achieved that by focusing the transaction on loans that are adhering to the terms of restructuring agreements and producing consistent, predictable cash flow.  This makes the securitisation vehicle an attractive proposition for long-term investors.  We wanted to ensure that the restructuring agreements, which had been agreed and overseen by Permanent TSB, would be respected under the securitisation alternative.  We have achieved that by ensuring the agreed restructuring arrangements form part of the terms and conditions of the individual loans that are included in the transaction.  </p><p> The bank was advised that it would not be granted NPL derecognition status for these loans if it maintained the servicing relationship.  Therefore, we wanted to ensure the company appointed to service and administer the loans going forward would be credible and respected.  We have achieved that with the appointment of Pepper Ireland.  I will let Mr. Ryan detail Pepper&rsquo;s credentials but we were attracted, in particular, by the fact Pepper is regulated and authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland under the Central Bank Act 1997 as a retail credit firm for the provision of credit and credit servicing activities in Ireland.  The company has been in Ireland since 2012, employs over 380 people in Shannon and Dublin and, including the accounts included in this transaction, manages some &euro;10 billion of Irish residential mortgage loans.  In short, Pepper is a well-established and important part of the financial services infrastructure in Ireland.   </p><p> We wanted to ensure the bank&rsquo;s customers understood what was happening with their loans and the implications the securitisation might have.  We have achieved this by writing to all the relevant account-holders outlining answers to common questions, providing additional information online and encouraging customers to contact our support staff to discuss any issues they may have.   </p><p> We wanted to ensure that scheduled reviews of any restructuring arrangement treated customers fairly.  Mr. Ryan will outline how Pepper will approach this process but I will make a number of points.  Under the master servicing agreement, MSA, Pepper, as the master servicer, has the full power, authority and right to undertake all activities it reasonably considers necessary, convenient or incidental to the provision of the services under the MSA.  The securitisation vehicle itself has, effectively, legally delegated these decision-making rights to the master servicer as the Irish-regulated entity.  A review mechanism is commonplace in all restructuring agreements.  If the loans had remained with Permanent TSB, the bank would undertake reviews with the same objectives Pepper will have in the future.  If the circumstances of the borrower have not changed, there is a legal obligation to continue to comply with the terms of an existing restructured arrangement.  This is an important overlay as the bank set out to maximise customer protection.  If the circumstances of a borrower have changed, either positively or negatively, then, as would be the case with Permanent TSB, the arrangements may be reviewed to reflect the changed circumstances of the borrower.  In this regard, it is worth bearing in mind the restructuring arrangements in place all involve the agreed suspension of repayments on a significant amount of the money borrowed by the customer.  Those warehoused or bullet amounts remain due at the maturity of the mortgage term.  Therefore, it is important the arrangement is reviewed regularly to see how that amount may be reduced over time to the benefit of the borrower.  After this year&rsquo;s transactions, the bank has further work to do to lower the Bank&rsquo;s NPL ratio.  That said, we will continue to build on the work already done by the bank in moving customers from non-performing to performing status with a focus on, amongst a number of initiatives, natural cures and mortgage-to-rent.  </p><p> This transaction is very significant for the bank and, given the challenge we face to tackle NPLs, I believe it is as good a solution for customers as we could deliver.  It has much to commend it.  It allows Permanent TSB to reduce significantly its NPL ratio.  It creates a vehicle which attracts long-term, stable investors.  It locks in the restructuring agreements already agreed between the borrowers and Permanent TSB.  It brings on board a highly reputable and regulated servicer in Pepper.  </p><p> That concludes my remarks.  I will hand over to Mr. Ryan of Pepper Ireland. </p></speech>

I am pleased to be here today.  I am here in my capacity as CEO of Pepper Finance Corporation Ireland.  I have held this role since I joined the company in October 2017.  I am accompanied here today by Mr. Dermot Caden, finance director, who will assist me in answering the committee's questions.  I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this session to discuss the securitisation transaction, Project Glenbeigh, announced by PTSB on Thursday, 29 November.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to give an introduction to Pepper and to outline our planned approach to managing the more than 6,000 borrower relationships on behalf of Glenbeigh Securities once the customers transfer to Pepper from PTSB in the next six months.  I will provide members of the committee with as much information, insight and reassurance as possible when it comes to this transaction and our management of these customer relationships into the future.</p> <p>  I will take this opportunity to give the committee brief background information on Pepper and our strong track record in Ireland.  The Pepper Group is an international financial services business specialising in loan servicing, lending and advisory services.  In Ireland, our main business is loan servicing.  We entered the Irish market in 2012.  With our original 100 employees, from the outset we sought to position Pepper as a leading loan-servicing firm, providing a new and important service to banks and investors in Ireland by leveraging our significant track record and experience globally in onboarding and managing loan portfolios.  In particular, we are specialists in helping people experiencing financial difficulties manage their situation and get back on track through a sustainable solution suited to their individual circumstances.  When we entered the market in 2012, viable solutions for customers were in short supply.  We have focused on delivering a wide range of new strategies and initiatives to assist customers in the Irish market.  This has, for example, included split mortgages and mortgage-to-rent.  Pepper has completed more mortgage-to-rent arrangements than any other firm in the Irish market.  Pepper is a regulated financial services provider, regulated and authorised by the Central Bank of Ireland under the Central Bank Act 1997, as a retail credit firm.  Pepper is authorised to provide credit in Ireland and is deemed a credit-servicing firm authorised to provide credit servicing under the 1997 Act.  Pepper Ireland services over 64,000 loans in Ireland across all asset classes, valued at approximately &euro;16 billion at the end of 2017.  Following the Glenbeigh transaction, we expect to be servicing approximately &euro;10 billion of residential mortgage loans for customers.  Over 80% of these residential mortgage loans are fully performing.  </p> <p>  We employ approximately 380 people in Ireland.  The majority of our employees operate from our Shannon office in County Clare and we also have an office in Dublin.  Our customer-facing teams are made up of highly experienced people with specialised expertise operating in full compliance with the regulatory codes.  This is one of the reasons why banks, investment funds and long-term investors, such as the PTSB and Glenbeigh Securities, entrust their customer relationships to Pepper.  The growing number of long-term, performing and re-performing loans under our management is consistent with our long-term commitment to Ireland.  Our strategy and plan is to continue growing and developing our business here and become an ever more important part of the financial services fabric in Ireland.  Our commitment to the ongoing growth of the business forms part of a wider European strategy to grow our loan servicing business across Europe.</p><p>Ultimately our long-term growth ambition for the Irish business is to export our services into the European loan servicing market as that market develops. </p><p> I will talk about our approach to customers.  Our team mission at Pepper is to help people succeed.  Finding solutions for customers is part of the Pepper DNA.  Like many financial services companies, we are not perfect but we are working hard every day to improve how we service customers and find solutions for them.  From a personal perspective, I have looked to reinforce this focus on customers in Pepper Ireland by setting as one of the five strategic priorities treating customers fairly and achieving a positive customer experience in the Irish business.  In 2018, we set up a dedicated customer experience programme to improve the skills of our customer-facing staff working with customers in all situations day in, day out.  This includes quality assurance and complaint handling to ensure ongoing review and continuous improvement.  Every single member of our staff, regardless of level or team, has treating customers fairly built into his or her performance objectives.  We are proud of our people and their strong track record in managing loan books and servicing customers.  We recognise every customer situation is unique and each case needs to be treated on its own merits.  For customers in arrears, we use our experience and range of alternative repayment arrangement, ARA, solutions to work with these customers constructively and sympathetically to put in place, where possible, sustainable solutions that are tailored to their individual circumstances and situations. </p><p> Having described the benefit of that background to Pepper, our expertise and our approach to customers, I will turn to the Glenbeigh portfolio and how we plan to engage with these customers.  I appreciate this is a matter of significant interest to members of the committee and the customers included in the Glenbeigh portfolio.  I would like to repeat and expand on the assurances that I have previously provided to the Permanent TSB board and to the Central Bank leading up to this transaction and to provide five key assurances from Pepper to customers in the Glenbeigh portfolio.  All the customers transferring to Pepper in the next six months as part of Glenbeigh will be fully covered by the protections of the Central Bank&rsquo;s consumer protection codes and regulations as they were before, namely, the consumer protection code, CPC,  and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, and SME codes as applicable.  Pepper is legally obliged to adhere to and will honour the existing terms of any previously agreed restructure if the customer is meeting all the terms of the restructuring arrangements.  If the borrower&rsquo;s personal circumstances do not change and the customer engages in a review process, there is a legal obligation upon us to continue to comply with the terms of the existing restructure arrangements, and we will do so.  Following a change in the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances, any change to the restructure will reflect the relevant improvements or disimprovements in the borrower&rsquo;s circumstances.  Where a borrower&rsquo;s circumstances have disimproved or disimprove in the future, we will work with that customer constructively to find, where possible, a long-term, sustainable solution to his or her individual situation that is in his or her best interests as laid down in the codes.  Every case is different and we are known for taking an individual and personal approach to working with customers, based on a deep understanding of their circumstances. </p><p> Being a regulated entity in Ireland, Pepper takes its responsibilities and reputation here extremely seriously.  We apply the highest standards of corporate governance across our business and we work extremely hard to ensure we comply with our regulatory obligations and meet our legal and contractual commitments.  In looking at how we plan to engage with customers in the Glenbeigh portfolio, I note that this portfolio is made up of customers who are currently meeting the terms of their restructuring arrangements, which have been previously agreed between the customers and Permanent TSB.  The customers have been engaging and have a proven track record of meeting the terms of their restructuring agreements.  As Mr. Masding has noted, the relevant accounts generate a steady stream of cashflows.  These are attractive to long-term investors and Glenbeigh, the securitisation vehicle, is presenting itself as a long-term investment vehicle.</p><p> Taking this into account and in addition to the assurances I have provided, I will make the following final points on how Pepper plans to manage the portfolio to treat customers fairly, especially during the process of scheduled reviews of any restructuring arrangements.  Some of these points will echo what Mr. Masding has already said.  As master servicer, Pepper has the full power, authority and right to do all things that it reasonably considers necessary within applicable laws and regulations to manage the portfolio.  The Glenbeigh vehicle itself has effectively legally delegated these decision-making rights to Pepper as the Irish-regulated entity.  A review mechanism is commonplace in all restructuring agreements, as it is in the Glenbeigh portfolio.  If the loans had remained with Permanent TSB, it would have reviewed with the same objectives as Pepper will in the future.  Over 80% of the restructuring arrangements in place - I note that 50% are over 20 years - in the Glenbeigh portfolio have an average of ten or more years to run and all involve the agreed suspension of repayments on a significant amount of the money borrowed by the customer.  These warehoused amounts remain due at the maturity of the mortgage term.  It is important and in the customers' best interests that the arrangement is reviewed regularly with Pepper as the master servicer in the future to see how that amount may be reduced over time to the long-term benefit of the borrower. </p><p> I am here to assure customers transferring to Pepper of our positive track record and standing as a regulated entity in Ireland and to set out again the five assurances we have provided.  It is our hope over the long term that customers transferring to us will come to view their engagement with us as a positive experience and that we have treated them in a fair and transparent way.  I thank the Chairman and the committee for their invitation and would be happy to answer their questions on the Glenbeigh transaction.</p></speech>

It has been a great source of frustration for Members of the Oireachtas that there has been little or no accountability in respect of so-called investment funds and how they treat mortgage owners.  This is a key question in terms of the transfer Permanent TSB is undertaking.  I want to start with the case of a constituent with whom I have been dealing for quite a number of years in respect of her Permanent TSB mortgage.  I have been on to Permanent TSB numerous times over the years about this mortgage.  It is a rather sad case.  It is a family with three children.  One of the children has a severe disability involving autism, dyspraxia and severe anxiety disorder.  While both parents work in the public service, one of them has been subject to severe health issues arising from the stress of the mortgage.  There is a restructured loan agreement currently in place.  She has adhered to all the elements of the agreement and on a couple of occasions has exceeded them in order to try to clear it if possible.  Permanent TSB has miscalculated her arrears.  She has been with Abhaile and MABS, which have given her advice around the miscalculations, but she has never been able to get satisfaction on that.  Most appallingly, which was the point at which I became involved as a Minister, Permanent TSB sought to include the child's domiciliary care allowance in the calculation of the payments the family would make.  As Minister, I got the banks generally to stand back from that kind of draconian action towards families with disabled children.  It was a particular low point.  The day before yesterday, the family received a letter from Pepper, like the other 6,000 families, advising that Pepper was purchasing its loan from Permanent TSB.  Clearly, the family is in enormous distress.  Their son with a disability is now 13 years old.</p><p>He suffers constantly from anxiety and this has an impact within the family.  The mother is frankly frightened about how Pepper will handle this.  Permanent TSB has made a very succinct presentation but a lot of questions about the management underlie it.  We all have concerns about how split mortgages will be dealt with by investment funds.  While I understand that Permanent TSB is a financial corporation, this is oriented towards an investment fund model, notwithstanding indications given previously by the Minister for Finance.  I have the family's consent to speak with Permanent TSB and Pepper about the split mortgage.</p><p> When Pepper bought Permanent TSB's split mortgages, was the total amount of the warehoused sections of the loans discounted from the price of the loans sold?  We have some summary figures, but it is not clear how the warehoused elements of the split mortgages were valued and whether they were discounted.  Either organisation or both might be in a position to answer that.  It is a key question.  In respect of the warehoused sections of mortgages, is Pepper seeking to write these off or to recover them in full?  I assume, on the basis of its presentation, that it is going to seek to recover them in full and will not write them off, even though it may have got those sections of the loans at a heavily discounted value.  Perhaps a discount of even 100% applied; I do not know.  As with the loans of many of the families involved, this family's loan is one in respect of which an agreement was reached.  Other members of the committee have correspondence from people who are meeting their terms and conditions but whose mortgages are being sold over their heads.  The key question is when and how often does Pepper propose to review the mortgages?  Will reviews include reverting to the warehoused elements of the split loans and charging in full for that.  We need to know how Pepper is going to treat this because that is what is going to keep a lot of people awake at night.  Pepper referred to a relatively short period of ten years regarding work-outs and so on.  It could provide a bit more information on that.</p><p> On the investors benefiting from the securitisation income stream, we have a note suggesting that the portfolio is generating cash equivalent to more than 3% of the asset security.  Will the investor benefiting from the securitisation income stream have any role in the management of the loan portfolio or is that entirely a matter for Pepper?  Will Permanent TSB indicate whether this is a final sale from the bank's point of view once the six-month period is concluded?  Thereafter, will it have washed its hands of this or will it remain as an investor in the investment fund and as a potential beneficiary of the securitisation stream of income as it arises?</p></speech>

The first was on the nature of the deal, the second was on the customer the Deputy mentioned and the sad circumstances there and the third was on Permanent TSB's continued involvement in the securitisation.  I will take those three and Mr. Ryan can summarise the other questions, if that is okay.  Mr. Crowley might first provide a high-level view of the deal and how split mortgages are placed in it.</p></speech>

The first relates to the price paid.  The nominal value of the loans included in the portfolio is &euro;1.3 billion and the price paid is in the region of &euro;900 million, which represents a discount in the portfolio.  The portfolio is made up primarily of two types of long-term arrangement, namely, split exposures and part-capital and interest exposures.  There is no separate price for either.  It was one price for the entire portfolio.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-06a.2213" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamonn Crowley" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018120600002#D00500"><p>Yes, it is a bundle from that perspective.  Naturally, there are over 6,000 customer relationships there which have different perspectives regarding the level of bullet repayment, the interest rate attaching and whether they are on variable rates or tracker rates.  There is a very mixed bag within that but there are two types of arrangements.  The reference to the warehouse is not attainable.  The key thing is that the nominal value is &euro;1.3 billion and the price paid was in the region of &euro;900 million.  As to Permanent TSB's ongoing involvement, the transaction closed on Thursday and within six months the full servicing of the portfolio will switch to Pepper.  In the first six months, Permanent TSB will continue to deal with customer calls and interactions.  We will do that as a sub-servicer, which means that Pepper is the master servicer.  We will sub-service for the first six months and legal title to the mortgages will actually transfer at that period also.  Our interaction with the customer regarding these mortgage exposures will cease at that moment and Pepper will become the prime and absolute party for communication for the customer.  We have other relationships with these customers in that they have current accounts and things of that nature with other products.  That relationship will continue but interaction regarding these mortgages will cease.</p> <p>  The second part of that question relates to our interest in the portfolio.  We retain a 5% interest in the securitisation vehicle and that interest is across the different notes.  It is what is called a "vertical slice" or "V note".  This is a legal requirement which was implemented post-crisis whereby the originator of a portfolio must retain some interest in it.  We are following regulations in that regard.  We will continue to hold 5% of the portfolio.  They are the two key parts of that.</p></speech>

We do not have an anticipated return.  For accounting purposes, we are required to value that interest on an annual basis.  The valuation is based on the price we received last Thursday.  We will adjudge that at each year end but we have no view on it going up or down.  It is a requirement that we hold that 5%.</p></speech>

The nominal amount is &euro;1.3 billion and we have sold the portfolio at net book value.  It equates to the value of the loan less the provisions the bank would put against that portfolio.  It is not a valuation<i>per se</i>, but is rather the amount of provision the bank had put against it based on accounting rules.  It was a reference point for us with regard to the price we received.  That is all.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding whatever discount arrangement arose in the sale to Pepper, is it likely or unlikely that customers will get any deal regarding the restructured amounts hanging over them?</p></speech>

However, within our interactions with customers, some have improved by reducing the level of warehouse while some have remained the same.</p><p>Customers who did not meet the terms of existing arrangements were not in this portfolio.  In fact, some of them were in the Project Glas portfolio, which was the previous portfolio.  These are customers who are meeting the terms of the arrangements that have been set forth and who are engaging with the bank in respect of where they are in thinking of the bullet repayment or the outstanding amount they have to service in due course.  Some customers improve in this interaction and some stay the same.</p></speech>

It sounds like quite a distressing case.  As with the Permanent TSB representatives I will get the details afterwards to ensure that when this customer comes across to the management of Pepper the customer is flagged as a vulnerable customer and follows the specific policies we have for the customers in those types of situations.</p> <p>  I wish to clarify exactly what our role is in the transaction.  The sale of the Glenbeigh portfolio has effectively been a sale from Permanent TSB and a purchase by Glenbeigh Securities, which is the securitisation transaction.  This means the ownership is now split.  The beneficial ownership of the loans - who owns the economic interest - sits with Glenbeigh, and the legal title holder sits with Pepper.  We have two roles.  One as the legal title holder, which means we are the lender of record, and the second role is as the servicer to manage and administrate the loans day to day.  As regards who bought the loans, we did not actually buy the loans.  Glenbeigh Securities bought the loans and then passed the legal title to us.  It has appointed us as the servicer on the portfolio.</p> <p>  On how the warehouse debt will be treated, the Deputy's summary is correct that the warehouse debt is part of the transaction.  Glenbeigh Securities is taking on those loans in respect of the economic ownership.  That &euro;1.3 billion will move across and ultimately will be owned by the bondholders at the back.  I would like to clarify that the prospectus refers to eligible debt forgiveness.  I want to be very careful in what I say and calibrate my comments correctly; in very exceptional cases there will be a mechanism in certain cases such as vulnerable customers and in other cases of insolvencies when we do reviews.  There is a mechanism in place for that, but it will depend on each of the individual circumstances.  The main answer to Deputy Burton's question on what happens to the warehouse debt is that it moves across.  As I said at the beginning, some 86% of the loans mature in plus ten years and more than 50% do not mature until 20 years.  As the loans currently stand there is a bullet payment due at the end and this is the way the loans have been transferred across.</p> <p>  The Deputy's second question was about who would actually do the reviews and how would they be carried out.  As I said in my opening statement, the arrangements, if there is no change, absolutely stay in place.  No different from the Permanent TSB it is appropriate, and in many cases it is in the best interests of the customer, to have regular reviews.  The current protocol within Permanent TSB is that these have been done up to tri-annually.  This does not mean every three years, it means that sometimes it is every three years.  We will look at the frequency of that but I can say there is absolutely no plan to conduct reviews at an inappropriate frequency.  Some reviews will continue on a three year basis, some may move to two years and others may move to one year.  I can give an additional assurance today that there is absolutely no plan to review any arrangement more than once a year, unless the borrower comes to us.  How the reviews are carried out and how they are notified to the borrowers, are strictly governed and controlled by the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  The reviews must be at appropriate intervals and we must give a month's notice.  We will absolutely abide by that in carrying out the reviews.  I would also add that when we do the reviews, and as I said in my opening statement with regard to the code, we will carry those out constructively and sympathetically.  If nothing has changed and if everything is the exact same way, the arrangement stays in place and we move on to schedule the next review.</p> <p>  The last question was on control.  I will again explain the structure.  Permmanent TSB has sold the loans to Glenbeigh Securities with regard to the economic interest.  We are the legal title holder and the servicer.  The way this legal transaction has been set up, as I said in my opening statement, we have been put in full control to manage and administer the portfolio on a day to day basis, and effectively Glenbeigh has delegated that legal authority to us.</p></speech>

I put it to Mr. Masding that over the past 24 hours as these letters have landed in letter boxes we have all been contacted by a number of the affected customers.  They do not have the opportunity we have but it is important to convey to Mr. Masding that some of them feel very betrayed and very angry.  They are worried.  They have these feelings because they co-operated with Permanent TSB.  These are good customers who engaged.  They faced up to their financial challenges and entered into restructuring agreements.  They are honouring those agreements in full so they had an expectation that Permanent TSB would stay the course with them and that the loans were, essentially, good loans or loans that were well on the way to being cured.  It is important to convey that to the witness.  We are receiving a lot of contact and emails.  It is important that people receive the reassurance they are being given, which is really what the substance and the core of this session should be about, to try to tease out exactly what this means for customers.</p> <p> I shall come back to Mr. Ryan on the question asked by Deputy Burton.  Pepper will have the legal title of the loans and the responsibility for making the decisions has been assigned to Pepper by Glenbeigh Securities </p></speech>

It is not unusual in a situation like this where Pepper has no economic interest in the portfolio, for the economic interest or the beneficial owner to be represented on that committee.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned influence and aggression.  Our main role is as a servicer in this portfolio.  We are regulated in Ireland.  Every single interaction we have with a customer is covered by the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, code and the consumer protection code, CPC.  We need to act in the best interests of the customers at all times, so when we are doing reviews we will have that at the forefront of our minds.  The owners have delegated to us.  They are aware of certain things that we do, but ultimately things will sit with Pepper.</p> <p>  I wish to raise one other point to make sure there is absolute clarity on the concept of eligible debt forgiveness.  As I am aware that we might have Glenbeigh customers listening in today or reading the transcript, I want to calibrate my words very carefully so that I answer members' questions while helping customers to understand how this will operate but, equally, not setting any unrealistic expectations.  If there is any situation which we think is absolutely exceptional, looking at an individual's circumstances, where there is a case that the right thing to do is to enter into debt forgiveness, that is something that we need to agree with the bondholders, because ultimately they need to be happy with that.  That is the only exception to the decision-making power of Pepper in Glenbeigh in six months' time when it takes on the portfolio.</p></speech>

It comes back to the point of what is the return on cashflow from the portfolio itself.  There are two key points.  First, we are governed by the codes and, second, all of the protections and contractual obligations we have around the restructuring arrangements stay in place.  It does not really matter what we decide to do in the portfolio; those arrangements stay in place.  The only way any of those 4,000 splits will change is if the circumstances change.</p></speech>

One does not have to wait for the review.  What it says is that for any reason that the bank, or now Pepper, thinks fit, it can terminate the split mortgage.  It does not even have to wait for a review.  That is what is said in the split mortgage agreements.</p></speech>

Yes.  We did a review in terms of what we offer versus what Permanent TSB offers.

He made two points.  In terms of his general comments, of course I understand the feelings of the customers he mentioned.  In this particular case, as we have discussed, and in my previous appearances before the committee, post-Glas Permanent TSB's non-performing ratio, NPR, is 16% and since we last met the European average has been recalibrated at 3.5%, so it is important both for our ability to withstand future economic shocks and our ability to compete in the retail and SME market that we manage down the NPR.</p> <p>  In terms of this transaction, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, the bank believes that this is the right outcome for customers in terms of them maintaining their treatments.  It is the right outcome for the bank in terms of reducing its NPR, and we think it is the right outcome for Ireland plc, because it enables Permanent TSB to continue to compete.</p> <p>  Could the Deputy please rephrase the specifics of his second question so that I can answer it?</p></speech>

In the event that Glenbeigh was wound up, who is the beneficial owner of the loans?  It was said they are in Pepper.  Did Pepper purchase a batch of loans from Permanent TSB previously?  Is it managing any existing portfolio?  I want to get a feeling around Glenbeigh.  How does it differ from an outright sale direct to a fund in terms of structure?

The origination of Glenbeigh is by Permanent TSB; we originated the structure.

The vehicle will continue to hold the loans even if the bondholders change in the background, as we have established already.  There is probably a double or triple lock to protect the consumers behind this.  In simple terms, the assets that underpin Glenbeigh are the 6,000 borrower relationships, equating to approximately 4,000 split loans and 2,000 part-capital and part-interest loans.  Those are the assets underpinning Glenbeigh .  Looking at this from a consumer perspective, which is important to do, regardless of who owns the loans, who the bondholders are and what vehicle owns them, the contract, original facility agreements and any future alternative repayment arrangement carrying the full weight of law, are protected.  Those contracts cannot be unwound.  They persist.  There are, as the Senator stated, some carve-outs if there are material changes, but the actual contractual rights can be enforced in law.  That is one protection that, regardless of ownership, sits with and protects the underlying customer.</p> <p>  All of these mortgages, whether split mortgages or part capital part interest mortgages, have been restructured.  They are alternative repayment arrangements, ARAs, so while they are performing against their new terms, strictly speaking, under the regulatory code, they still fall under the protections of code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA.  Ultimately, everything around CCMA, including how we conduct reviews, contact customers, run reviews, come to alternative arrangements and how we conclude that nothing has changed and that they should stay the same, is strictly governed by consumer protection code, CPC, and CCMA and will be regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland on those.  There is very little wriggle room in terms of what can happen.  The only thing that can really change things is a change in the circumstances of the individual customer.</p> <p>  The third protection to bear in mind is that if the mortgage moves to another loan owner, by law in Ireland, the loan owner or unregulated owner must have a regulated entity in Ireland to service their loans.  It is not legal for a loan owner not to have a regulated entity, be it Pepper or another company, servicing those loans.  The regulated entity must follow all the rules of the CCMA, CPC, SME and all the other codes as applicable.</p> <p>  I hope I have answered the questions regarding ownership.  In the context of the vehicle, the question is what is in place to protect the consumers.  The contracts will persist, the ARAs and other protections of the CCMA will persist, and ultimately, if the loan moves around, a loan owner has to appoint a company such as Pepper or another regulated loan owner which is overseen by the Central Bank.</p></speech>

They are borrowing money to buy loans.</p><p>The appeal of this is that the money being put in appears to be long-term in nature.  If they are worked out in the long term by Pepper, it squares the circle but, if they are sold on to another fund within a relatively short period and that fund uses short-term financing, it brings about concern for hard-pressed Permanent TSB mortgage holders.  It is a reasonable proposition and needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

We know that Mr. Masding's bank is abandoning and breaking commitments it made to customers who are meeting their restructured payments and is offloading their loans to a vehicle which was set up in the IFSC last month and which has two directors.  Those individuals are directors of approximately 300 other companies because they are an agency acting on behalf of Wilmington Trust.  We do not have a clue who the owners, the people with the real power behind this, are.  Permanent TSB, a State-owned bank, is abandoning its customers.  In that context, the Minister for Finance should be here because he consented to this new low in Irish banking whereby the loans of people who are meeting their arrangements are allowed to be sold on to a vehicle which was established last month, which has two shelf directors and whose owner we do not know the identify of.</p> <p>  Pepper is just doing the administration and it is a nice wee vehicle because it has been done is such as way as to ensure that not a penny will be paid in tax.  We spent weeks closing loopholes so that section 110 funds such as this would actually pay tax on interest but they have found a way around it.  Is that not correct, Mr. Masding?  The fact that the bank will hold 5% of the beneficial interest in this fund will now exempt it from tax on the interest.  It will exempt the whole vehicle from tax.</p></speech>

I have the prospectus and that is what is in it.  Our guests will not admit something that is black and white because the public is outraged at what Permanent TSB has done.  It is a double outrage that it is now offloading these mortgages to a vehicle from which the CEO of the bank will benefit and which has circumvented our tax codes.  It has done it legally but our guests will not even admit that.  They are wasting my time and that of the committee by refusing to admit something that is black and white.</p></speech>

I will try to answer his question.  In order to allow the transaction to happen it was created as a section 110 company and the tax status comes with the design of the structure.  I cannot make any comment on that but it is, as the Deputy says, in the prospectus.</p> <p>  In order for the securitisation vehicle to be incepted, and based on what Mr. Crowley referred to as the poor practices during the financial crisis, an originator of the mortgages, which is Permanent TSB in this instance, is legally obliged to take a 5% vertical slice.  That has nothing to do with the insinuations the Deputy is making around tax avoidance.</p></speech>

I asked the question which nobody so far, including Mr. Masding, has acknowledged.</p></speech>

That is a fact.  I apologise if I misunderstood the point he was making.  The Deputy challenged me, quite correctly, on those customers who I said in my opening remarks had engaged with us and feel let down by Permanent TSB.  I empathise with why the Deputy made that statement.  The bank has a 6% non-performing loan ratio, split mortgages and part-capital and part-interest mortgages with bullet repayments, which are non-performing loans as defined by the rules.</p><p>As I assured the committee at my previous appearance, we were looking at all the alternatives to reduce the non-performing ratio and this was in our opinion the least worst alternative.  Why?  It was because we found investors who matched the duration of the mortgages, the long-term treatments transfer in full to the vehicle and their protections are maintained and, to the best of our ability, we find a servicer of that vehicle which is experienced in the Irish market.</p><p> To sum up, Deputy Doherty's comments around the section 110 tax status in the prospectus are correct.  I want to bifurcate any perception that McKinsey might have that the bank took the 5% to take advantage of that which was not the case.  It has to take the 5% in order for the vehicle to be valid.  While we will have to agree to disagree, that is the bank's perspective on why this transaction happened in order to reduce its non-performing ratio to a level that makes it an institution that can compete into the future. </p></speech>

This pisses a lot of people off.  There are multi-billion euro investors and all of the profit made from this securitisation vehicle will be tax free.  They are the ones who will benefit.  We have a State-owned bank which is participating in this with the consent of the Minister.  That is what is really annoying.  It is in the prospectus and is a nice boast for bondholders that it will be tax free.</p> <p>  On acquisition and Permanent TSB holding 5% of the notes, does acquiring the notes mean that the bank will have to purchase them or do they come automatically as part of the sale?  </p></speech>

On the Deputy's first question, I understand this perception regarding taxation but I have to play within the rules that I am given.  I am neither the minister for taxation nor the European authority for setting the tax rules.  I am merely saying that the securitisation vehicle was set up in a certain way and we must take 5%.</p></speech>

Mr. Crowley's answer is good news to everybody here.  I will read the first line of the Central Bank code of practice on the transfer of mortgages.

The code, which has been in place since 1990, is clear.  It is voluntary and it is up to the bank whether to apply it.  Mr. Crowley has told this committee that he will apply it.  The former Minister for Finance believes that every bank should apply it and, interestingly, made that statement in a written response to the current Minister for Finance when he tabled a parliamentary question on the matter some years ago.</p> <p>  The code of practice on the transfer of mortgages states very clearly that no bank should transfer a mortgage on residential property without the written consent of the borrower.  It then stipulates exactly what the bank must do in relation to written consent, the undertakings that must be given, the information that the bank must provide if the individual does not give written consent, the interest rates and addresses all of these matters.  Is Mr. Crowley still of the view that the bank will, of course, apply the code of conduct?</p></speech>

I will go through it if Mr. Crowley wishes.  It states:</p><blockquote>When seeking a consent and where there is to be or where there may be an arrangement under which the original lender will service the mortgage as an agent of any transferee, the lender will confirm that the transferee&rsquo;s policy on the handling of arrears and in the setting of mortgage interest rates will be the same as that of the original lender...</blockquote> <p>The bank has to write a letter to the borrower and ask for consent.  The final point in the fourth paragraph of the code states &quot;confirmation that in the absence of a specific consent the existing arrangements will continue to apply.&quot;  There are many other things the bank must do which it has not done.  It has not done it in this case or on Project Glas.  It has not done so at all.  Permanent TSB has thumbed its nose at the Central Bank of Ireland's code of practice on the transfer of mortgages.  I ask Mr. Crowley again if, in this case, the bank is considering applying the Central Bank code of practice, which has been in place for the past two decades.</p></speech>

This is the code of practice on the transfer of mortgages.  I will read Mr. Masding the first line again: "A loan secured by the mortgage of residential property may not be transferred without the written consent of the borrower."  Permanent TSB is a State-owned institution.  I acknowledge the code is voluntary and I will table legislation in the coming days to make it mandatory and place it on a statutory footing.  I hope we will close down this sale but we will cross that bridge when we come to it.  However, this code of practice is supported by the Houses of the Oireachtas and applied by the Central Bank.

Permanent TSB is completely disregarding the code of practice on the transfer of mortgages because that code does not suit it.  This is something that was agreed by the Central Bank.  It is not coming from afar.  Permanent TSB is deciding that something which is in place does not suit it.  It knows that if it asked for the consent of its customers, they would tell it to take a jump.  They would say "Not a chance".</p></speech>

As I, as the chief executive, see the matter, it would suit Ireland a lot less if Permanent TSB maintained an NPR ratio of 16% and was unable to compete.  If the consequences of an economic downturn had an impact on the functioning business of Permanent TSB, Ireland would like that a lot less.</p></speech>

Pepper is an agent.  It is clear from the prospectus that this can be sold at any time.  Indeed, Pepper can be removed as the agent at any time by this vehicle.  We have no idea who owns the vehicle.  The big concern here relates to certainty.  Regardless of people's opinions of high-street banks, they know that they want to be here in 30, 40 or 50 years.  Permanent TSB structured its split mortgages in a way that meant up to 80% of each mortgage was warehoused.  Pepper is saying that unless things change, it will continue to honour those split mortgages all the way through.  What does the word "change" mean in this context?  Does it mean that if somebody's wages increase by 2% or 3% in accordance with inflation - this is subject to legal test - Pepper will be allowed to have a review?  The reality is that nobody has trust in Pepper.  People definitely do not have trust in the vehicle that owns their loans now.  That vehicle did not exist 30 days ago.  This point relates to Bank of New York Mellon and Wilmington.  This is a shelf company.  It shares its registered address with another 126 businesses in a building down the road.  There is no face to this.  Pepper has come in here after a long challenge for us to try to get it to come in.  The people who own these loans are faceless.  We have no idea.</p> <p>  I want to ask about the review.  What does the guarantee mean in terms of change?  Obviously, people's circumstances will change.  We hope they will change for the better.  Nobody is going to stay in exactly the same position.  What guarantee is being given to people?  When Mr. Ryan states that there is a legal guarantee, can he specify where that actually exists?  Can he outline where in the prospectus the issue of the operating committee to which he has spoken, as he said in response to Deputy Michael McGrath, is dealt with?  Perhaps he can dig out a page reference.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-06a.2440" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac Ryan" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018120600002#L01400"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  The review period is talking about the restructuring arrangements.  As I stated at the outset, the majority of the mortgages - approximately 4,000 - are split.  Approximately 2,000 are in part-capital and part-interest arrangements.  The review arrangements are a standard part of the terms and conditions.  Reviews were going on with Permanent TSB.  They are a standard part of any restructuring arrangement.  I have already addressed the point that was made in respect of frequency.  We will look at a range of factors, like we do in any alternative restructuring arrangement.  The first thing I will say is that every single case, in reality with our consumers and under the CCMA, is unique.  No two cases are the same.  The first factor we take into account under the CCMA is the overall indebtedness of the customer, which may have changed in the case of somebody who has not been reviewed for a number of years.  The second factor we take into account is the person's financial situation - whether there are two people working in the family, whether there is an additional person working in the family or whether somebody might have got a new job.  The third factor we take into account is the person's personal circumstances - whether he or she has dependants or whether there are other things that are straining on their income.</p> <p>  When we have formed the overall picture, we take a view.  Basically, there are three outcomes that can happen.  We run it through our affordability assessment, which basically says what a customer can or cannot afford.  The first of the three outcomes is when it is found, after everything has been considered together, that nothing has really changed.  It has been mentioned that we are in a much better economy now than we were in five or ten years ago, thankfully.  The customer may be in the exact same circumstance.  If he is in the exact same circumstance, it is a fairly short conversation.  We will say to the customer that he should stay in this arrangement and nothing should change.  I want to talk about this in real terms rather than in the abstract.  If the customer has received a promotion and is earning more money, or if additional money which is attributable to the property is coming into the family because the customer's partner is starting to work, we work with the customer to say that there is some additional affordability.  We look at the customer's level of affordability under the previous circumstance and point out that there is now increased affordability.</p> <p>  This links into our obligation to be open, fair and transparent and to have the customer's best interests at heart.  For example, we might remind the customer that a big bullet payment is due at the end because of the way these mortgages are structured.  I did not structure them that way; it is how they are structured.  We might suggest to the customer that because he is due to pay a certain amount in ten, 15 or 20 years, the right thing to do in his best interests is to increase his monthly repayment slightly.  Over 20 years, that could make a difference between the customer having &euro;50,000 due at the end of his mortgage and having &euro;10,000 due at the end of his mortgage.  Those are rough numbers, but the difference could be something like that.  We might say to the customer that we think his arrangement should stay in place, with a slight tweak being made to it because that is in his best interests.  This is one example of how things might change.</p> <p>  I would like to speak about our obligations.  Most of my team of specialists have been doing this work for seven or ten years.  We have to be able to stand over these arrangements.  Quality assurance is done by internal teams that look at all the documentation to ascertain whether we documented the numbers correctly and explained these matters to the customer correctly and whether the customer understood what was happening.  Any change in every single one of these arrangements is absolutely subject to review by the Central Bank of Ireland.</p></speech>

I would like to make a final point.  As stated, there are three possible outcomes.  There could be a material disimprovement.  I think that where we are, most people have either been neutral or have improved.  Obviously, every circumstance is different.  If we come across a customer whose circumstances have regrettably disimproved, we need to work with him to deal with that.  We look at the alternative repayment arrangement to see whether the split, as currently arranged, is suitable or whether we need to make an additional change to the portfolio to make it affordable.  All of those three outcomes are available.</p></speech>

In the interests of time, rather than reading the entire paragraph, I will summarise it.  The very last line provides that the final determination of all such matters shall be made by the master servicer acting in accordance with Pepper's policies.  There are various references to this throughout the prospectus.  I am happy to come back to that.</p></speech>

The code is voluntary, as the Deputy stated.  The governing document here is the terms and conditions of the loan agreement, which gives us the right to assign a loan.</p><p>In that case the balance I have to make is between that voluntary code versus the NPL ratio versus trying to find the least worst outcome for the customers.  I suspect we are not aligned here but in terms of the transaction that we have tried to design, the treatments continue and protections of those treatments travel with the loans and they are serviced by Pepper.  Then the bank's MPR ratio comes down.  I am sure we are not aligned but they are the reasons I would give in answer to the question.</p><p> In terms of section 110, I apologise if I appeared to obfuscate.</p></speech>

It is very difficult to believe the Minister for Finance had no objection to this sale and facilitated the betrayal of vulnerable Irish customers.  What is particularly interesting about today is the fact that the banks have appeared before us many times and it has been stated that they cannot let people off without paying their mortgages because other people are responsible and pay their mortgages while others are not bothering to pay.  However, the thousands of citizens who are customers and who we are here to talk about have made the best possible efforts to pay their mortgages and have come to arrangements with the bank, whether it be a split mortgage or another arrangements.  These are responsible citizens who want to pay their fair share and keep their homes.  They are looking at this from a number of perspectives.  What they want is to be able to trust the institution which has the deeds to their homes.  They want certainty and security.</p> <p>  I refer to the tax situation and section 110.  Pepper has &euro;10 billion in assets in Ireland.</p></speech>

I might defer to my finance director.  Again, just to clarify, in terms of our role, we are effectively a service provider in this along with some of the other clients we have.  We provide services and we take a fee.  These assets and the &euro;10 billion of loans I mentioned are not on our balance sheet.

Have we a way of knowing how much tax it paid?  I am trying to tease it out.  The thousands of customers we are dealing with all pay a great deal of tax.

In terms of their dealing with us, the Senator is absolutely right, the economic interest of the loans, in terms of the asset value of those, is held separately in Glenbeigh Securities.  That is separate from Pepper and Pepper does not have an economic interest in the loans.

We think we have achieved that.</p> <p>  The Senator asked me about the consultation with the Minister for Finance.  Again, I repeat that it was a consultation where we followed the obligations we have under the relationship framework, and they were followed to the letter of the law.</p></speech>

The overriding and governing document is the loan facility letter.  As I tried to explain to the Senator, we are trying to get as many moons aligned as we can, where one of those moons is that I, as a chief executive of a management team, have a bank that has a 16% MPR ratio.

We met the ECB and the ECB explicitly told us that it was not putting pressure on the selling off of loans.  It also appeared to be concerned about what was happening and that it was not to work through these loans.  These loans are performing loans as far as we are concerned, that is, split mortgages with people's circumstances improving and with people meeting their obligations.  They are not reckless people in the way that the banks in this country have been.  These are responsible citizens who are trying to hold onto their homes for themselves and their children and that is the bottom line.  They are the people we are here to represent.  These people will find it difficult to deal with Pepper.  They looked at all the banks when they were taking out their mortgages and they looked at the bank that they thought would most service their needs.  They made the decision that it was the Permanent TSB.  Now they find themselves with an operation that is operating in Australia, Britain, Spain and South Korea.  They want to know how all that will impact on them.  Let me ask a very simple question.  Where are the deeds of their homes going to be held?</p></speech>

If they have had a review with PTSB in the past three months - they would have three-yearly reviews, as is the norm in PTSB - will they have a review with Pepper in that period of time or will Pepper wait until the three years are up and have a review at that point?</p></speech>

The contracts in some cases say "at least tri-annually", which does not mean every three years but at least tri-annually.  It is open in other contracts.

We chose three years.  I assert that I would probably have instructed my team, as the mortgages got nearer to maturity, to increase the frequency of those reviews.  That reduces the likelihood of a poor customer outcome because those warehouses or bullets are due.  There is no specific time period.  Mr. Ryan can comment from Pepper's perspective.  I feel those reviews are a positive conversation because those warehouses represent material amounts of capital and they are due.  Having a conversation with a customer to try to move the warehouse or bullet into the main mortgage, therefore reducing the risk of maturity, is good.  That is the bank's perspective.</p></speech>

We are all on the same page about that because I am trying to do the same thing.  Pepper's statement was that it looks at the person, not just the paperwork, which is good on the face of it.  I want to reconcile that with Pepper's failure to pass on a single cent in rate cuts for variable rate mortgages over a five year period.  Reconcile those two matters for me.  European Central Bank, ECB, rates were cut, yet Pepper did not pass on any of that to the mortgage holders.</p></speech>

Pepper is a company with an aim of profit maximisation.  I get that since that is how the world operates.  Pepper would therefore do something such as not pass on the interest rates.  Based on even just that element of Pepper's record, how can consumers, people whose homes Pepper has the deeds to, trust Pepper in the future?

I understand and would need to check that these customers were on standard variable rates, not tracker rates.  It is at the discretion of the holder.  I am happy to come back with the exact detail.  I understand that Pepper was not the sole decision-maker as we would not have been the beneficial owner in that circumstance.  It was in a single portfolio, not across all the portfolios that we manage.  I need to clarify the exact decision-making process.  It was before my time so I cannot give an exact answer.  We are here to talk about Glenbeigh and what that means for its future.  It was part of what I said in the opening statement.  The setting of standard variable rates has been delegated to the master servicer in this situation, which is Pepper.  Pepper will have the ability to move rates up and down.  Many people have made mistakes in predicting interest rates.  I confirm that that is our capacity and we will have the ability to move rates up and down.</p></speech>

By the originator, that is the bank that originally provided the loan.  Permanent TSB was also the bank that was in charge of the loan and it should be acknowledged in this forum that all of these customers did go through a period of distress given that they went through an arrangement.  While the loans are performing now we are extremely aware that these customers have had issues in the past.  Thankfully they are now in an arrangement and are all paying.  I just wanted to make sure that we are clear and that we acknowledge that.  The loans would be in the warehouse treatment, which obviously is quite a big folio, and the first decision we will need to look at is the review periods of the alternative repayment arrangements.  The Senator made a very good point; the review periods may change in the future.  It is not a lock-down term in the contracts.  I have been quite open and I have given five assurances.  We need to be quite open - I believe in being genuine with customers - and the frequency of the review periods has been a product of the number of people who have been assigned to this.  Earlier I had said - verbally as it was not included in my submission - that I do not see any customer being reviewed more than annually unless in exceptional circumstances.  There is not a specific number in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  It does refer to appropriate frequency and we will absolutely consider that as to what is appropriate.  Again, we would consider when the last review was held.  That would be a reasonable way for us to consider when to do the actual review.    I also echo Mr. Masding's comments that while those reviews need to be done in a considerate, sympathetic and constructive way a review is not only in the interests of the servicer and the ultimate beneficial owner.  In many cases it might actually be the in the interests of the mortgage holder.  I have given a few hypothetical examples.  There may be a situation where a mortgage holder has not been reviewed in a couple of years and unfortunately his or her circumstances have not improved.  The mortgage holder may be in a worse position than two or three years ago.  If that is the case and we go through the review we will want to speak to that person to see if we can do something to help.  That is how we will approach the review period.  I cannot say exactly when it will happen.  We will look at all the portfolios and will work out what is appropriate to keep on two years or three years-----</p></speech>

Post six months there is a very regulated process in how loans transfer across.  We had some discussion on that.  Part of this process is that customers will get a goodbye letter from Permanent TSB and a hello letter from Pepper.  They will not get a letter out of the blue that says Pepper would like to speak to them.  The chain of communications will be "Hello, we are Pepper and we have now taken on your mortgage".  That will be a standalone letter and communication to introduce ourselves.</p></speech>

The rates of interest on the loans will pass across as they were on the last day the loan was with Permanent TSB.  Any communication on interest rates would only be if there was a change in the interest rates, and would only be at some point in the future.  The hello letter will introduce Pepper and what we do and will include contact details.  Many customers, outside of the review, may have day-to-day questions.  They may have questions around their tax relief at source or they may need additional statements and so on.  Clearly we need to do the day to day piece also.</p> <p>  At a certain point in time, when we decide that we want to do the review, by law and by the code of conduct on mortgage arrears we need to give the person a month's notice to say that we have reviewed the file and we would like to schedule a review.  We write to the person to give them one month's notice of the review.  That is what the communication would look like.  I cannot tell the committee that they would all be in one or three years.  There are a lot of mortgages in there and we need to work out what is the right thing to do for each of the mortgages.  As with the previous point, we will look at when the last review occurred to work out our regulatory obligation on what is appropriate and what we think is the right thing to do under the circumstances.  </p></speech>

The other loans are part capital and interest where the mortgage holder is paying the interest but only paying off part of the capital.  While they are structured differently the net result is the same.  If the mortgage matures in 20 years for example, rather than the figure being zero at the end of the mortgage there is a sum due at the end.  In each case that sum can be different.</p></speech>

Let us say, for example, that we are dealing with a case 12 months from now.  We would sit down with the customer to look at the situation.  We would go through the assessment I referred to earlier and we would look at the customer's current state of indebtedness.  This is not just the mortgage; it also looks at any other unsecured lending arrangements in place.  We try to see what is the person's overall financial situation, the household financial situation and if there are any dependants or other outgoings that we need to be aware of.  All of the detail on the pieces of information that we need to gather is included in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  We try to get the full picture.  We will take an assessment to see if anything has changed positively or negatively in the arrangement or if things have stayed the same.  I repeat what I said earlier; if a customer's circumstances have changed - and some will have changed materially - we think it is the right thing to have a grown up conversation to tell the customer that now might be a great opportunity to make a change to this and reduce the debt overhang, especially if the loan has a lot of time to run.</p></speech>

I will repeat what I said at the beginning.  The discretion we have and the ways in which we can behave in respect of reperforming loans - and 98% of loans are performing as per their terms - are extremely limited.  We have to follow the original loan agreement, the alternative restructuring arrangement, the CCMA codes, and the consumer protection code.  All of these are, rightly, extremely tight because we consider consumer protection to be quite important in this country.  There are very few things we can do that would give us a lot of discretion.  I do not expect that the process we run will be very different from that of Permanent TSB and I expect it will be very similar to those of other banks and other servicers.  This all goes back to my point that we have to operate within the twin tracks of the protections offered by the legal contract underpinning the loan and the protections offered by the Central Bank and its consumer protection codes.</p></speech>

We want to find a long-term affordable solution for the customer.  It is difficult for me to give an answer to a hypothetical scenario apart from saying that we would want to find a solution for him or her.  As I said in my opening statement, that is what our team does.  In the six years we have been here we have come up with more than 4,000 solutions for various customers in difficult situations.  We will look at the arrangement.  This is a good example of where a person's circumstances may have changed negatively.  We would absolutely want to find something.  It could be a change to the ARA, it could be changing the term of the loan, or it could be an additional interest rate.  We will look at the whole suite of options we have to find something that actually works-----</p></speech>

To be clear, Pepper as a servicer is no different from the other banks.  When we look at these arrangements we look at a customer and at the sums due on that mortgage.  We try to navigate an approach, within the codes and within the customer's contract, to find a way to repay the mortgage over a period of time.  We have many different solutions and strategies to do that.  We are effectively in business to work with customers, understand their individual circumstances, and try to find a solution for them.  As I said, in the past six years we have found 4,000 solutions for 4,000 customers.  That is average of 65 a month.  We work really hard at that.</p></speech>

On the final day, when the loans move across, we take them across at the rates they are then on.  For the avoidance of doubt, where people are availing of warehouse elements, they will move across with the loan and continue to attract zero interest.  We will absolutely replicate how the loans were operating.  The loan will be the same on its first day with Pepper as it was on its last day with Permanent TSB.</p></speech>

Obviously we look at a range of things, as would any other bank.  We would absolutely keep the customer's best interests in mind.  To be upfront, the main determinant, though not the only one, is the European Central Bank, ECB, rate.  As the ECB rate might move up and down over the next ten, 15 or 20 years, I cannot give a cast-iron assurance.  There is a likelihood that, over time, if the ECB rate starts to move, our interest rates will start to move, as will those of every other servicer and every other bank.  Again, that would be no different from what would have happened if the loans had stayed in Permanent TSB.</p></speech>

In this particular case, as we outlined to each of the Senator's colleagues this afternoon, the loans are treated non-performing loans.  They have alternative repayment arrangements in place, therefore they represent a steady stream of cash and are absolutely aligned with the securitisation structure we have outlined this afternoon.  It is a matter of horses for courses.  It depends on the characteristics of the loans, as I said in my opening remarks.</p></speech>

My primary duty is to minimise the use of that capital and to get a return back.  My decisions have to consider how much capital we would burn in a straight loan sale, how much we would burn if I retained and provided the loans and then decrecognised them, and how much capital we would burn if we did a securitisation.  That is one of the key decision rules we apply.  In this particular case we have not burnt any capital.  We have actually got a small capital release, which is a great outcome for the Irish taxpayer.  Our judgment was that we would have burnt taxpayers' capital in the other two alternatives and that capital is not mine to burn.  From my perspective, it is a win for the taxpayer and an outcome for the customers that enables them to keep their treatments and gives them a servicer with experience in Ireland.  It is the least worst alternative to repossessing those homes.</p></speech>

There are things we can do in such circumstances if we think it will not cause more distress.  If we think that arranging a house visit would be helpful to the customer and would be constructive, we can arrange that.</p></speech>

I am very aware that some Glenbeigh customers will be listening to this or reading it and I want to ensure the numbers I provide are taken in context.  As such, of 730,000 mortgages in Ireland, 1,500 homes were repossessed.  Obviously, we would all prefer if that were a smaller number.  The orders for possession Pepper took in 2017 were 51 and the actual orders for repossession that were executed was 18 out of a total number in Ireland of approximately 1,500.  Every one of those is a last resort.  One of the reasons we keep that number as low as possible is that we work extremely hard on mortgage to rent.  We are advocates of mortgage to rent, which is an extremely important solution to keep people in their homes.  It has some requirements and not everyone can qualify for it.  The last number I give relates to those cases where we have exhausted all possibilities.  Typically, these cases take five years.  We have five years working with these customers to find alternative solutions.  Of those cases, approximately 75% have been classified as "non-engaging" at some point in time.  We will work all the way up to the steps of the courthouse for the very small number of cases that go to court.  At least half the cases that get to that point, however, involve customers who are not engaging.</p></speech>

I am just asking.  I note the type of information to which Deputy Michael McGrath referred earlier which comes to committee members.  People tell us that from 2012 or 2013 onwards, it has been extremely difficult to get in touch with Pepper.  Others say Pepper has never engaged with them.  We are told receivers are appointed and there is then no engagement with them.  Receivers collect the rent but there is no evidence it is paid against the original debt.  In some cases, individuals say they have lost their businesses over very small debts with no recourse to Pepper, which simply refused to engage.  In one instance involving Sheldon, which is another company Pepper manages, it was then discovered that Mars Capital were in it as well.  My point is that there are examples where customers have attempted to engage with Pepper and found themselves apparently associated with one vulture fund and another.  A receiver is thrown into the mix and, in spite of the best efforts of the person who had the loan originally, no solution is proposed.  It gives the impression that the individual has no chance against Pepper.  People feel bullied and harassed in their engagement with Pepper.  I am only reading from examples of emails I have received and I have been asked to put that to Mr. Ryan today.  There are real cases behind those allegations.  As Deputy Pearse Doherty set out, it moves on to no signatures on transactions and no approval from the person who had the loan.  Obviously, Pepper is working on the fine print and being enabled to pass on the loans.  As a result, the customer does not know where he or she stands.  With those cases coming to light because of today's hearing, what is Mr. Ryan's response?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-06a.2656" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cormac Ryan" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018120600002#R01200"><p>I thank the Chairman for sharing some of those.  First, we are here talking about Glenbeigh and the securitisation.  The reason I bring that up is that from a CCMA point of view, there are very strict rules about engagement and how we deal with customers.  The whole area of receivers and the processes that apply to buy-to-let and commercial real estate are quite different.  Because of CCMA, how that part of the business is managed is much tighter from a regulatory code point of view.  It is absolutely not my position to make any excuses.  We are not perfect.  There should not be cases where it is difficult for third parties such as receivers or for customers to engage with Pepper.  It is difficult for me to comment on individual cases, but I note that some of these cases are quite difficult.  People are in very difficult circumstances.  What people describe as a lack of engagement can be subjective at different times.</p></speech>

The reason I raise it here is that Mr. Ryan says how good and customer-focused Pepper is.  He referred to Pepper's desire first and foremost to keep people in their homes.  That is its goal.  However, the experience of those who have contacted the committee has been that there were no negotiations.  On the business side, it has been a matter of no negotiations and the appointment of a receiver.  There was no discussion.  That is what they are telling us.  As I say, the debts involved seem to be small.  In one letter, we were asked whether Pepper had an office in Ireland as the person had not been able to engage with it.  I am putting this to Mr. Ryan for clarity because he is telling us the opposite.  He says Pepper's door is open and people can contact it.  He says Pepper engages and protects people's rights legally but that does not appear to have been the case with a lot of people who have written to us.  That is what concerns me.</p></speech>

They get a "Hello" letter.  We are contactable and we will be working with them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-06a.2659" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1248" speakername="John McGuinness" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018120600002#R01500"><p>Pepper says "Hello, how are you?", the customer says "I am looking for all of my paperwork under FOI" and Pepper says "Go to a solicitor."  That is in another email.  I do not think these are made up.  I think these are from different people.  Pepper then presses them into court.  The first court date is in 2018 and the next hearing is November 2019.  It seems to me from this that Pepper is playing around with the lives of people.  I want to ensure that these experiences are not going to happen to the new 6,139 loans Pepper is going to receive.  I ask Mr. Ryan finally on this issue what assurances he can give those people who are not part of Glenbeigh and who are in Pepper's grasp already.  What does he say to them?  Who will they contact?  Who can they speak to?</p></speech>

These are not people in homes, they are investors.  Some of them are small investors and some are larger investors.  There is a different set of rules and a different set of codes that surround those.  Going through those cases is not necessarily indicative of what we are here to talk about today, which is the Glenbeigh portfolio.</p><p>It tells me that I do not want to have anything to do with Pepper.  That is what it would tell me if I was unfortunate enough to end up with Pepper, based on what is being said here.  I am just giving Mr. Ryan an opportunity.  I know it is about Glenbeigh but this discussion is also about what he has told the committee about how Pepper does business.  I want these 6,200 customers, or however many it is, to be reassured by him but what he has said so far has not been reassuring.  I am giving him the opportunity again, in the light of cases where customers are critical of how they were treated by Pepper, to step up and give us the reassurances again and perhaps to reach out to those people and tell them to contact whatever the number might be.</p></speech>

I will absolutely take him up on the offer.  Every customer of Pepper, be it a residential mortgage customer or our investor customers, should be able to contact Pepper.  It is absolutely reasonable for a servicer of our size to be able to facilitate that so I will follow up on it.</p></speech>

The assurance I would like to give is that our residential mortgage business, in terms of how we treat customers and how we contact them, is managed very differently.  The Chairman has read out a few individual cases involving customers and how they feel they are treated.  With his permission, I would like to give the committee an example of some feedback we have received from our residential mortgage customers.  It would also help Glenbeigh customers to get a feeling for some of the unsolicited feedback we receive as a servicer.</p></speech>

There is no excuse from an engagement point of view.  All customers, no matter what part of Pepper they are in, should be able to engage and should be able to get answers to their questions.  We are running a large business.  We have 64,000 customers.  Like any servicing organisation and like any bank, we will have issues.  I said at the beginning that we are not perfect.  It is not an excuse but it means there areas in which we need to get better.  The residential mortgage business is quite different in terms of how we contact customers.  That is the way we are set up.  The CCMA code is extremely prescriptive and we need to set up an operation that reflects the code in how we deal with those customers.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for at least turning up today, which many other credit servicing firms have not done.  To be fair, they deserve thanks for that.  Regarding the approximately &euro;400 million difference between the gross and net book value of the loans, Mr. Crowley said that the figure used was the net book value.  Pepper, on behalf of Glenbeigh, can still pursue the full &euro;1.3 billion.  I presume it will do so and Glenbeigh will effectively be the beneficiary of that gain, if it happens.

I go back again to the fact that all of the loans, as they are restructured, will remain thus.  They will be reviewed regularly.  They are structured in such a way that a significant sum is due at the end of each mortgage.  It is not due at a singular date but as each mortgage comes to its end.</p></speech>

This is a question for Pepper because Permanent TSB will not be involved at that stage.  What is the likely suite of options for those whose arrangement is coming to an end, with a significant lump sum still outstanding?  It is quite likely that a lot of people will not have that lump sum.  Will the loan be restructured again?  Will the loan be re-examined or will the company just repossess the house if the lump sum is not paid?  What is the likely outcome at the end?</p></speech>

The bank is currently going through the reviews, some on a tri-annual basis and some more often.  When the portfolio moves across to Pepper, that job will fall to us.  Every circumstance will be different.  In terms of what happens at the end, that will be part of the review.  Each time we do a review, we will determine if anything has changed.</p> <p>  Let us take the example of someone whose mortgage is due in 20 years.  As we said at the beginning and a number of times today, it is in most people's best interest to have a plan for what happens at the end.  When one is looking at restructuring arrangements, time is a critical factor.  It is not the same for all customers but, thankfully for the majority, there is time.  We would look to engage with them in the first review and see if there is any additional affordability.  We can look at all of the various alternative restructuring arrangements in terms of recapitalisation, term extensions and so on and all of those options are available.  The main piece, however, is whether there is an ability to pay more, whether the affordability has changed or the customer's circumstances have changed.  The easiest way for customers to address it, if it is affordable, sustainable and in their best interests, is to pay more off each month.  That is the most basic arrangement and that can happen if the circumstances change.  If they do not change, then that is off the table and we continue on as we are and look at it again the next year or in two years.  That is effectively how we will approach it.  Every case will be different and it is difficult to give a broad answer, well into the future, as to what will happen at the end.</p></speech>

Typically, how much gets warehoused?  How much of the original loan is warehoused?  If the loan is &euro;100,000, for example, have the banks been warehousing &euro;70,00 or &euro;80,000 or is it more like &euro;10,000 or &euro;20,000?</p></speech>

That is why Permanent TSB is the "market leader" in split mortgages because the alternative is repossession and, therefore, some of the warehouses are quite long.  To reiterate the point made by Mr. Ryan, the vast majority of these warehouses are on a ten-year plus horizon, which gave Permanent TSB, and now gives Pepper, time to work with customers to find the right solution.</p> <p>  In the spirit of being transparent, I must put it on the record that those capital sums are due.  They are part of the borrowing contract with Permanent TSB and they are due.  The benefit of a split mortgage having a long duration is that it allows the lender to work with customers to try to find a way through.</p></speech>

I am trying to establish an important legal point.  This confidentiality agreement is obviously very important.  They are at the core of the commercial transaction that involved the homes of 6,000 people.  Notwithstanding that the witnesses have come before the committee and have been quite co-operative, I want to know the position of the people who are very anxious about their positions?</p></speech>

Let us go right back to the start and I will take the Deputy through the journey.  I will not repeat the non-performing loan, NPL, story.  The Deputy knows where we are at.  I am the chief executive, and while the governing objective of a chief executive is to manage the capital of the bank which the taxpayer gave us, obviously in terms of that governing objective there are also other tests that I have to pass, one of which is right customer outcomes.  That is how I think.  As we constructed the deal, we have a series of stakeholders we must consult.  In my case, as chief executive, and in the case of Mr. Eamonn Crowley, the chief finance officer, the stakeholders include the board of the bank, the Department of Finance, the prudential side of our banking regulator and the conduct side of the banking regulator.  I can assure the committee that we followed the right protocols in terms of dialogue with each of those stakeholders which led us to completing the transaction last week.</p></speech>

Mr. Ryan referred, understandably, to the confidentiality agreements as the operational structure he is operating under, but he also placed considerable stress on the fact the Pepper is regulated.  In terms of the references to the confidentiality agreement, therefore, has the regulator sight of those confidentiality agreements?</p></speech>

We do not have a strict requirement for deals like this, but we do notify the regulator of significant transactions or contracts we are about to enter into.

I cannot recall to date while I have been in the role where the Central Bank of Ireland has made a request that I have not met.  On this case, given that it has some legal implications, I would need to consult my legal team.  I am happy to come back with the technical legal answer, but it is not something that I can answer right now.  In spirit, we try to be as open as we possibly can with the regulator.</p></speech>

The value then was &euro;890 million.  Will Mr. Masding explain this to me?  One way of reading the figure is that there has been a transfer at a valuation or book loss - it is a while since I practised accountancy - or a discount of more than 30%.  I think that is a very generous deal for Glenbeigh.  Maybe that is the value of a lot of the warehoused loans.  I do not understand but would Mr. Masding agree that is the way many people would look at it?  When that goes into the PTSB books, if I am not mistaken, that creates a tax loss because it is the write-down of a debt, and specific bad debts are always allowable, from my experience of tax, as write-downs.</p></speech>

In terms of the deal, I would not agree with the word "generous" because we had provisions against those loans.  If one reads the statement we made to both the Stock Exchange and then to the media, having done all the calculations, actually the capital ratios improved.</p></speech>

It might not happen instantly but, given the long duration of many of the loans, they may be flipped fairly often.  Permanent TSB will have long departed the scene at that stage, however, and Pepper is only a service agent.  Who is there to protect the holders of the different mortgages in the context of the codes?</p></speech>

It is impossible for us to predict the future, but the point of principle is that, regardless of ownership, the consumer protection codes and the contractual projections travel with the loan.  I do not know if Mr. Ryan agrees with that but that is the point in principle.</p></speech>

From an ownership point of view, it is difficult to predict what will happen.  It is a long-term investment vehicle.  The prospectus indicates that some of the investors and bondholders may change over time but, ultimately, the vehicle has long-term assets and is expected to be a long-term vehicle.</p></speech>

In the original documents, PTSB suggested it would receive a bit more, namely, &euro;910 million.  It is a sharp transaction-----</p></speech>

If one thinks back to the specific situation PTSB was in 12 or 18 months ago, when all the European banks started to think about their NPL ratio, many of the notes written by the market, that is, the brokers and the people who write about PTSB, predicted that to reduce its NPL ratio, PTSB would probably have to burn the taxpayers' capital of somewhere between &euro;250 million and &euro;500 million.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Educated analysts examined the valuation of our book and put their valuation on it.  They found that for the purposes of exiting the Gloss and Glenbeigh portfolios, the bank would lose in the region that Mr. Masding outlined.  In fact, we lost in the region of &euro;20 million to &euro;30 million in both sales.  It does not, therefore, reflect a giveaway in any regard.  There is no doubt that in the case of Glenbeigh, there was a discount on the &euro;1.3 billion that is owed by the borrowers, but it will not be paid for ten, 20 or even 30 years.  Anyone buying that book would have to fund the cost, that is, incur an interest cost in funding it, which is part of the discount that would be built in.</p></speech>

If market analysts make a judgment that it was &euro;500 million but it turns out to be &euro;20 million or &euro;30 million, the value of the entity, by definition, is much higher.  I do not agree, therefore, with the Deputy's statement that it was a generous deal.  Rather, it was the right deal for all Irish taxpayers.</p></speech>

When it decided it would take 66%, did it at any stage consider writing to customers to ask whether they had families, friends or anybody else who would be interested?  For example, a mortgage worth &euro;300,000 would become &euro;200,000.  Could the mortgages not have been offered to the ordinary people rather than to vulture funds?</p></speech>

In the councils at the moment, it is &euro;10 for the first &euro;100 and &euro;20 after that.  For the sake of argument, a case involving &euro;500 would involve &euro;90 a week or &euro;360 a month.  If a council says to Pepper in a case involving a &euro;700 mortgage payment that it is too rural, who pays the difference?  I remind Mr. Ryan that I am talking about a case in which the person involved is eligible for social housing.</p></speech>

We would look at both situations.  If we can make a mortgage to rent case work, we will make it work.  As I said at the beginning, we have done more mortgage to rent solutions than any other provider in Ireland.  We are very much engaged with all the housing bodies and with the two mortgage to rent bodies that exist in Ireland.  If a customer reaches the point where mortgage to rent is the last solution apart from going down the road of loss of ownership through assisted voluntary sale or repossession, we will explore all options to make that happen.  I cannot give the Deputy a cast-iron assurance that there would be a "Yes" in such a situation.  My team would need to get into the detail.  I remind the Deputy that we have done more than anybody else.  We think mortgage to rent is a great solution where we can make it work.</p></speech>

All the customers in that portfolio went through distress on their mortgages at some point in time.  Their mortgages were in arrears.  I have already recognised that approximately 6,000 borrowers fall into this category.  All of them are now under the protection of the CCMA.  They are under alternative repayment arrangements.  I stand to be corrected, but my understanding is that well over 95% of them - perhaps 98% - are performing to their new arrangements.  They already have a treatment.  A team has already engaged with them in an effort to find a solution to the situation they are in.  While they are now back in an affordable position, and hopefully some of the distress of the situation they have been in has been taken away, the issue is that a lump sum is due to be paid at the end.  For 86% of them, that will be ten years or more into the future.  We will engage with all those customers when we have review periods.  We work with them sympathetically, constructively and positively.  We work through all our different arrangements to see if there is something that works for the borrower and is realistic.  It has to be realistic and fair.  It has to be in their best interests.  It has to be something that might help them to chip away at the sum to reduce how big it will be at the end.</p></speech>

Since 2013 we have set out, to the best of our ability, to keep people in their homes and to find the correct way to treat them.  I should also say that for both Project Glas and Glenbeigh there is an outer perimeter of mortgages and we go through a process to try to get to the cleanest portfolio.  As Mr. Crowley said, through the course of this year, in both transactions, using mortgage to rent as an example we have taken customers out of that original perimeter and put them in a mortgage-to-rent solution.  The same applies with bankruptcy and insolvency.</p></speech>

We were acutely aware of the 100% ownership - now 75% - of the bank by the taxpayer, and acutely conscious that we were dealing with the capital of Irish taxpayers.  We had to reinforce to those customers, and I am sure Pepper will as well, that those amounts are due and payable.  However, we also had to have sympathy with affordability.  The Irish taxpayers are, in many ways, funding those warehouses because the bank does not receive any interest on them.  That was the balance we were trying to achieve, between something that felt like the correct customer outcome and at the same time, our duty to all Irish taxpayers in terms of the capital due.</p></speech>

The figure for called non-performing loans for Permanent TSB is down at 10% .  Can Mr. Masding explain this to me?  There is talk that pressure is coming from the European Central Bank and from the Central Bank.  Has the Permanent TSB been put under pressure to get rid of non-performing loans?  It seems from the figures I am looking at that Permanent TSB was at 16%.  Now the figure is 6,000.  Is Permanent TSB looking at another 5,000 to bring it down to 5%?  Who is putting Permanent TSB under pressure to bring that figure down?</p></speech>

The Single Supervisory Mechanism wants us to reduce the non-performing loan ratio.  There should be no doubt about that.  We have to contribute to the stability of the Irish banking system.  This is not just about Permanent TSB.  We need to ensure we can withstand future economic shocks.  The regulator has said we need to have detailed and credible plans.  As I said at my previous appearance before this committee, there has been no specific instruction on how we should do this.  There is a very clear view that we need to have realistic and ambitious plans.  I have spoken previously about how such a plan can be delivered.  I hope I have explained to the committee this afternoon that my first duty is to the taxpayer.  We have delivered a plan in a way that minimises any capital destruction.  Obviously, this has other elements.  It is not just about having a hard financial governing objective.  There are also supplementary tests.  One of those tests involves acting in a way that achieves the right customer outcomes.  In the particular case of customers who have treated non-performing loans, the view of the board and the banks was that this was the least worst alternative.</p></speech>

We have approximately &euro;1.5 billion in non-performing loans left.  This equates to less than 10%.  We have to keep managing those down.  The good news is that a sizeable portion will cure automatically.  We need to look at various alternatives in the other cases.  I would not rule anything in and I would not rule anything out.  That was the answer I gave to the Deputy's colleague earlier.</p></speech>

It will not surprise Mr. Masding when I tell him I am not fan of the arrangements that Permanent TSB has entered into.  I would prefer if a greater political urgency could be put into creating a different arrangement to give people a better chance.  I know that Mr. Masding is managing his bank and Mr. Ryan is doing his business with Pepper.  I often consider that we are here to remind them of what customers are saying and to attempt to get better outcomes for them.  When the committee suspended for ten minutes, one of our guests was approached about a freedom of information matter.  That happens in here.  Customers end up coming in here and listening to what goes on.  They are generally looking for information.  I hope our guests can resolve some of the issues about which they may have heard here.  A gentleman approached one of them about an individual issue.</p><p>It might be difficult for all of the delegates to come here, but it is a way of answering publicly the questions people are asking us.  I ask them to see it that way.  Mr. Masding is a hardened attendee at committee meetings.  It is not personal.  It is a real and serious problem for families and we have to follow it up.  That is why I asked delegates at the beginning of the meeting about coming here again at some stage.  It is not to ambush them but to get at what is really happening.  If some of what we are being told is not correct, they will have an opportunity to correct the record.  People are anxious to get on with their lives.  I understand the angst on the delegates' side, but there is also a pressing issue on the side of their customers.  I thank them for coming and their colleagues.  I also thank the clerk and her staff who have been very patient because we have been sitting since 2 p.m.  As I probably will not see Mr. Masding before Christmas, I wish him and all of the delegates a happy Christmas.</p></speech>

This is a minor and somewhat technical Vote we would like to get approved by the committee.  I am here this morning to present the committee with a proposal for a net Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1,000 in respect of Vote 12 - superannuation and retired allowances.  The Supplementary Estimate in respect of this Vote will bring the 2018 Estimate for the Vote to &euro;584.9 million gross and &euro;366.2 million net.  The Supplementary Estimate arises from higher than forecast costs for the year under the pension scheme for established civil servants.  There were also balances payable to former civil servants who retired in 2009 under the incentivised scheme for early retirement.</p> <p>  Pensions and lump sums paid under the pension schemes for established civil servants make up just under 90% of the total gross expenditure on the superannuation and retired allowances Vote.  The main driver of the annual cost is the number of established civil servants who retire in the year.  It is particularly difficult to estimate the number of retirements from one year to the next for a number of reasons.  These include that the majority of established civil servants may choose to retire within a five year window between the ages of 60 and 65.  In addition, a number of people aged under 60 retire each year under the cost neutral early retirement scheme or on the grounds of ill-health.  Each year, a number of former employees become eligible to claim a preserved pension entitlement.  The average pension benefits lump sum and pension that will fall to be payable to new retirees in any given year will depend on the grades and years of service of that specific cohort of retirees.</p> <p>  The 2018 gross Estimate for Vote 12 was &euro;569.9 million, based on a forecast of 1,585 retirements from the established scheme.  As a general rule, for each person who retires the once-off lump sum paid out is three times the size of the annual pension.  Accordingly, increases in retirement levels have a particular effect on subhead A4, which provides for the lump sum payments to established civil servants.  Subhead A4 is, therefore, a key driver of the expenditure variants on the Vote in any given year.  To the end of October, &euro;88.5 million was expended from subhead A4 compared to the original 2018 full year estimate of &euro;94.2 million.  It is now estimated the gross expenditure of the Vote for 2018 will be in the region of &euro;584.9 million, &euro;15 million in excess of the gross Estimate of &euro;569.9 million as voted previously by the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  The committee should also note that the level of gross Supplementary Estimate being sought will be mitigated by anticipated levels of appropriations-in-aid.</p><p>The figure for appropriations-in-aid for 2018 was estimated at &euro;203.8 million.  To end October, receipts of &euro;191.8 million have been received and with receipts with regard to the single public service pension scheme ahead of profile year to date total appropriations are now projected at &euro;218.8 million by year end, which is &euro;15 million more than expected.  I am seeking the committee's approval for the use of this excess to reduce the net effect of the gross Supplementary Estimate.  </p><p> I am satisfied that the appropriate Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1,000 net will confer the necessary legal authority to meet the pension entitlements of the civil servants expected to retire at the end of 2018.  I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the committee.</p></speech>

Members will be aware there was substantial discussion in the Seanad on the application of this Bill to the special categories of personal data specified in Article 9 of the GDPR.  This is in respect of personal data revealing a person's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs or trade union membership, as well as their genetic and biometric data and data concerning their health, sex life and sexual orientation.  On foot of this, the Seanad agreed an amendment which inserted a new section, section 5, which specifically prohibits the use of this legislation to share the special category data referred to.  I also accepted a number of amendments to section 7 that provide that in the event of any part of the public service identity constituted special category data it would not be possible to share that data under this Bill.</p><p>Having discussed the amendments further with the Office of the Attorney General, I am proposing a technical amendment to this section.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 propose to delete the wording agreed in the Seanad and replace it with the wording proposed in amendment No. 3.  The purpose of this wording is to create a specific definition of the public service identity for the purposes of this Bill that specifically excludes those special category data referred to.  This has the same effect as provided for in the wording I am proposing be deleted but it has the advantage of making the application of the Bill to the public service identity easier to understand.</p><p>I ask the committee to support these amendments.</p></speech>

The Minister is now proposing to delete the wording of those amendments and to substitute it with the wording proposed in amendment No. 3.  I do not understand the need for this change.  The Minister of State said it is being done on the basis of advice he received from the Attorney General.  Amendment No. 1 seeks to delete the words "excepting such parts of that public service identity which constitutes special categories of personal data" and amendment No. 2 seeks to delete "compliant with Article 9 of GDPR".  Amendment No. 3 provides for a definition of "specified body" and "public service identity", which is already provided for in section 262 of the Act of 2005.  I ask the Minister of State to explain how what is proposed in amendment No. 3 caters for what is being deleted by amendments Nos. 1 and 2.</p></speech>

We also wanted to avoid a conflict with the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  Having reflected on the matter and wanting to take on board the spirit of what was agreed to in the Seanad, we have decided to remove the wording as proposed in amendments Nos. 1 and 2 and go for a comprehensive measure in amendment No. 3.  The most important line of that amendment, that the section will not include a reference to special categories of personal data, makes it explicit what the Bill will not include.  The amendments are essentially a cleaning-up exercise by removing some wording in the first two amendments and replacing it in the third amendment.</p></speech>

The GDPR is inherently built into the Bill.  In later sections there are clear references to it.  However, in the Seanad we wanted to take on board the spirit of what had been proposed by Senator Higgins.  We have discussed the matter with the Attorney General.  Rather than have any potential contradiction in the wording regarding the special categories of data which will be included, we have decided to go with a new worded section to remove any doubt.</p></speech>

During that debate the Minister of State said:</p><blockquote>I am accepting amendment No. 8 in the names of Senators Higgins and Ruane because it strengthens the language after the word &ldquo;identity&rdquo;.  Similarly with amendment No. 9, where the Senators have drawn attention to Article 9 of the GDPR, it strengthens the language and I am prepared to accept it.</blockquote> <p>I am happy to leave the section as passed by the Seanad.  Accordingly, I will not be supporting amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive.  I would be happy if the Minister of State withdrew them and returned on Report Stage with a more detailed explanation as to why he is removing any reference to Article 9 of the GDPR.  I would prefer to see the original Seanad amendments remain until we have that more detailed discussion.</p></speech>

However, what was attempted to be achieved in the Seanad, which we accepted in principle, is actually strengthened by amendment No. 3.  In fact, it is stronger than the Seanad amendment.  It removes any contradiction and explicitly refers to how the processing of special categories of data will take place.  I am quite open to further consideration of the amendments on Report Stage.  I believe, however, that amendment No. 3 strengthens the original Seanad Report Stage amendment with greater clarity and the removal of the potential contradiction in the wording.</p></speech>

In the Seanad the Minister of State committed to including special categories of data and amendments which would strengthen the Bill.  However, his new amendments provide that they will not be included.  He should return on Report Stage to provide greater reassurance on that point.</p></speech>

We have extended an open invitation for people to engage with us on the matter, but, unfortunately, it has not been taken up.  However, I am more than willing to have that level of engagement before Report Stage.  The debate in the Seanad should be looked at in the round, rather than in isolation.  Article 9 of the GDPR is referred to specifically later in the Bill.

I want to acknowledge the huge amount of work done by Senator Higgins and her efforts to improve the Bill.  I acknowledged on Second Stage that the Minister and his Department engaged with Senator Higgins and either accepted many of her amendments or came back with Government amendments to improve the Bill.  There are still a lot of issues with the Bill as passed by the Seanad and our amendments seek to address these issues.<br/><br/>Many of the Minister amendments today seem to seek to row back on the amendments he accepted in the Seanad.  The problems with the Bill that our amendments try to address mostly relate to how our Bill, particularly in section 7, interacts with the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005.  The Minister of State, when summing up on Second Stage, dismissed our arguments in relation to this Act but this Bill will, whether the Minister of State admits it or not, consolidates the State's prolonged attempt to coerce the citizens to agree to large scale processing of their data - the Government's attempt to finally provide a legal basis for this kind of data processing.  A number of times during the Seanad debate the Minister openly admitted that the Bill was an attempt to provide a legal basis for something that was already happening.  He openly admitted that the kind of large scale processing of personal data that the State has been engaged in for many years is, basically, still illegal.  The GDPR, however, will still make this type of coerced consent illegal even if the Government passes this Bill without our amendments and the State will still be open to considerable fines for violation of the GDPR.<br/><br/>Prior to the GDPR, EU Directive 95/46 made coerced consent, illegal and the law around consent has been strengthened further with GDPR.  Article 4(11) of the GDPR clearly sets out one of the requirements of valid consent in that it must be &quot;freely given&quot;.  The Article 29 Working Party published guidelines on consent in November 2017 to guide people in relation to the consent requirements in GDPR.  It states: &quot;[A]s a general rule, the GDPR prescribes that if the data subject has no real choice, feels compelled to consent or will endure negative consequences if they do not consent, then consent will not be valid.&quot;  The data subject must, therefore, have control over his or her personal data and must not be coerced into consenting.  Withholding a pension payment from an elderly woman for 18 months because she refused to register for a public services card is clearly coerced consent and a form of State coercion.  Withholding basic State services from people because they object to the &quot;once-only&quot; principle and large scale, <i>ad hoc</i>data sharing, is coerced consent.<br/><br/>I hear many people say they have nothing to hide and they do not care who has access to their data, so why should we be worried about this.  We would argue they are missing the point.  The Minister and many others will say that the administration of public services needs to be efficient.  I totally agree with that.  However, there is a basic legal and human right to privacy, for example, in the EU Charter of Human Rights, and even if people do not really care about this right or say they have nothing to hide, it still exists.  We cannot be selective in how we respect and observe basic human rights.  The State should not act illegally, and we should not tolerate the State wilfully and openly acting illegally, even if we do not specifically put much pass on data privacy.  We should not tolerate State coercion, in any forms.<br/><br/>When explaining his decision to refuse Senator Higgins&rsquo;s same amendment in the Seanad, the Minister explained his decision by saying that he could not accept amendments that would be in direct conflict with provisions relating to the public services card set out in existing legislation, referring to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  However, amendments Nos. 4 and 7 are not in conflict with the Social Welfare Consolidation Act.<br/><br/>This Bill interacts in a hugely significant way with the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.  Section 247C of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, as amended, states that the Minister may require any person receiving a benefit to satisfy the Minister as to his or her identity.  This, of course, is a completely reasonable requirement.  Section 247C(3) of the Act specifies the manner in which the Minister of State may be satisfied.  It essentially describes the Standard Authentication Framework Environment 2, SAFE 2, verification process for registering a person&rsquo;s identity.  The problem we have with what the State is trying to do here, however, is that the aim of the public services card and the SAFE 2 process is not just verification.  The aim is to coerce consent to data sharing and to enable the creation of a massive database of citizens&rsquo; data, otherwise known as the single customer view.<br/><br/>However, section 247C(3) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act does not state that the purpose of going through the verification process, or SAFE 2, is to have one's data entered into a national database or that one's data will be shared with 150 other public, specified bodies.  Section 247C(1) also makes it clear that the purpose of the verification process described is &quot;to satisfy the Minister as to his or her identity&quot;.  Once the person&rsquo;s identity has been verified and once the Minister is satisfied as to the person&rsquo;s identity, there is absolutely no legal basis for any more processing of that person&rsquo;s data, unless one has obtained that person&rsquo;s consent.  This Bill is the Government&rsquo;s way to establish this legal basis. <br/><br/>The point of our amendments Nos. 4, 7 and 16 is provide a solution to this practice of coercing consent, so that a person does not have to register for a public services card or agree to the processing of their public service identity dataset to access basic services.  There has to be an alternative.<br/><br/>As I said, we do not have a problem with the SAFE 2 verification process <i>per se</i>.  Verification of identity is obviously essential.  However, the State has, with the public services card, created a bizarre situation where verification of identity leads inevitably to large scale sharing of personal data.  We either need to separate the two, verification of identity and large scale data processing, or we need to provide an alternative to the public services card as a processing of verification.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 5 proposes to use the definition of data sharing provided by Digital Rights Ireland and Castlebridge Associates in their joint submission on the proposals for the Bill.  One of the bigger problems with the Bill, as initiated, was that it failed to distinguish whether the sharing to which it referred was a case by case exchange of data for a specific purpose, or the creation of large scale databases like the single customer view with no specific purpose.  The Minister introduced a Government amendment on Report Stage in the Seanad that I acknowledge went some way towards addressing the lack of specificity in terms of an understanding of what constitutes data sharing.  Section 19 of the Bill, which states what a data sharing agreement shall contain, now states that the agreement must specify whether the information being shared relates to individual data subjects or classes of data subjects, and whether the sharing will be on a once-off or an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

I better not keep the committee here all day.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 10 and 15 are essentially the same as an amendment submitted previously by Senator Higgins.  These amendments also try to address the problem of coerced consent.  It is vital that the Bill gives people a mechanism to opt out of the &quot;once-only&quot; principle and to indicate that it would be their preference to give each of the specified bodies their data separately and that they do not find it a burden to provide their data to specified bodies on a case by case basis.  In response to what was essentially the same amendment on Report Stage in the Seanad, the Minister provided three defences of the Government&rsquo;s position, and none of them was relevant to the problem Senator Higgins was trying to address.</p><p>Firstly, he referred to the right to object to the processing of one&rsquo;s data as specified in the GDPR.  The right to object is not a remedy for coerced consent.  If we do not provide the option for a person to opt out of <i>ad hoc</i>processing of his or her data, then that person will not be able to access public services or welfare services without first consenting to large scale reusing of his or her data.  The right to object in the GDPR is a right to object to already existing processing.  On the basis of this Bill, a person&rsquo;s consent would, by that point, already have been coerced.  The right to object as a process or mechanism to opt out of <i>ad hoc</i>processing or as a way to choose providing data to specified bodies would involve recourse to the courts system and the Data Protection Commission.</p><p>It is an odd suggestion from the Minister.  He wants citizens to have to go through an arduous and difficult court process to access their basic human rights.  In any case, the right to object would not even address the problem for coerced consent.  With all due respect, listening to the Seanad debates, I am not sure if there is a full understanding around the problems of coerced consent.  During that debate, the Minister said that when a person presents to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to apply for a social welfare payment that &quot;it could be inferred that there is consent already contained in that by virtue of the fact that they have presented themselves to look for that particular support or service from the State&rdquo;.</p><p>I mentioned this in my Second Stage speech and I mention it here again because it shows a fundamental failure to understand the nature of consent.  That is a worrying statement as far as we are concerned.  People apply for social welfare support because they are vulnerable and need help so it is strange that the Minister of State could extrapolate from that that at the same time these vulnerable people automatically consent to such widespread sharing of their data with approximately 150 other public bodies, via the single customer view database.  It is amazing that the Minister of State who has responsibility for the biggest data sharing project in the history of the State should reveal such a fundamental understanding of the nature of consent.</p><p> In refusing to accept Senator Alice-Mary Higgins's amendment on the data sharing agreements that the Bill makes necessary, the Minister of State referred to: "A fairly protracted public consultation process that goes on well in advance of the agreements being set out."  The public consultation process that the Minister of State mentioned is of course welcome but it is irrelevant to those people, no matter how rare they are, who would want to provide their data on a case by case basis.  The public consultation process may permit the individuals in question some kind of input into the process on data sharing agreements and it may provide some welcome assurances on data processing but it would not address the specific problem of coerced consent.</p><p> The Minister of State rejected Senator Higgins's amendment on the basis that: "We do not want to have a situation where every single individual would have to be contacted in advance of the data being used."  Maybe the Minister of State misunderstood the nature of Senator Higgins's amendment; if not we would see this as disingenuous.  There would be no reason whatsoever to contact every single individual in advance of the data being used.  Most people would prefer the once only principle and have no problem with their data being shared with all of the listed, specified bodies.  Clearly most people will see it as easier, handier and vastly more efficient to just have to provide their data once but when a person's data is first collected, which at that moment is via registration for a public services card, but a person must also then be able to opt out of further processing without their consent.  To make access to the State's services dependent on consent is a form of safe coercion.</p></speech>

Implicit in the Bill is a governance mechanism on the sharing of information which currently takes place without governance and the Deputy accepts that.  At the very start of this Bill, it is important to say that data sharing is currently taking place in this country legitimately, which people want to take place, including at the birth of a child for instance.  When a child is born, social welfare becomes aware of that child's existence and the parents can derive a social welfare payment from that.  Nobody would expect that we would try to undermine that, neither should anybody expect that we would undermine a situation where a person works in seven or eight different elements of the public sector, that information on their pension entitlements should not be collated and that consent is inferred.</p><p>I stand over what I said in the Seanad which has been accurately referred to here.  Public sector data sharing is taking place in this country for which there is no legal basis but which people want to continue because they want the services that derive from same.  In order to make sure that we get a legal basis for that, we want to put a legal floor underneath it.  In doing that, we have a data sharing governance board, which is referred to later on.  That will give a statutory entitlement for people who have an issue around consent.  When the data sharing agreements are being drawn up, and there will be many of them, they will have an entitlement to have their comments and referrals made.</p><p>On top of all of that, we continue to have the Data Protection Commissioner.  The data sharing and governance board will be obliged under this law, if enacted, to publish the agreements in advance and to make sure that they are properly constructed and will then make reference to the Minister.  What we are doing at the moment around the sharing of information for the development of public services is questionable and I acknowledge the Deputy's point on that.</p><p>We are signatories to the Tallinn Declaration and the once only principle and I recently met with a group of ordinary citizens recently.  They were randomly selected by the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer and everybody universally agreed that when they are deriving public services, they feel this obligatory necessity to constantly provide the same level of information.  In the once only principle, which is referred to as one of the bases for the construction of this Bill, we are giving people an opportunity, under a safe system, namely myGovID and others, through the public services card which the Deputy refers to, which is already in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005, and the Deputy will know from the debate on this in the Seanad that this Bill does not impact in any way on the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005, nor can it.</p><p>Many of the services that we want to actually make sure are done, are being done already but we want to create a safe, legal mechanism for these.  As I have said, one of those is the collation of pensions across the public sector.  Nobody would be disagreeable to that.  If a person moves from an education and training board to the Civil service and on to a semi-State company before working for a primary school, should he or she not have access to a system where all of their information can be shared?  There are likely to be thousands of agreements put in place, overseen by a board which is laid out in the Bill.  We have to ask ourselves if the current system is better or worse than having an independent governance board which will oversee the building, examination and implementation of all of those data sharing agreements which are currently taking place in a vacuum because there is no legal basis for it.</p><p>On consent, article 6 of the GDPR provides for consent as one of the lawful reasons for the processing of data.  Other reasons include compliance with existing legal obligations.  As well as that, in the Seanad we took on board Senator Higgins's suggestion on it being necessary and proportionate.  I have no problem in saying here that it was a very good suggestion and it has now been incorporated into the Bill.  The construct of what we are trying to do will be the thrust of these amendments.  Do we want a safe mechanism for the collation of data for public services or do we not?  It is currently taking place.  Do we want an independent governance board that will oversee it?  Do we want the public to have a right to have an involvement in the drawing up of agreements that will be put in place, have a public consultation and have those consultations published?</p><p>We do not have any of that at the moment.  We have an <i>ad hoc</i>system which is not legally sound.  A pensioner or a social welfare recipient such as the mother of a newborn child, should have access to the once only principle.  It is only right and fair that a person who deals with the Government of Ireland has access to the once only principle when he or she engages with the Government on services that are governed by an independent governance board, set out in an agreement that is put in place after protracted public consultation.  It is perfectly reasonable also that the Data Protection Commissioner will oversee the implementation of same.</p></speech>

That would actually be the net result of what we are doing and then there would be no point in having this in the first instance.  The public service sharing of data that is happening as we speak will be completely undermined and not only for people who currently avail of public services.  I would use the example of people in receipt of third level grants who may need to have information shared between Revenue and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We will end up placing a major burden on the consumer of public services if we do not give a legal floor to what is currently taking place.  I do not believe that Members of the Oireachtas want to create a scenario in which users of public service are inundated with bureaucratic overload.  We would not be thanked for doing that.</p></speech>

Let us say an individual is applying for a SUSI grant.  The application could contain an element related to the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine and an element related to the Revenue Commissioners.  On the basis of what Deputy Wallace is suggesting, that individual might have to carry around all of those elements.  I am not knocking the proposal for the sake of it because this is something that we discussed at length in the Seanad.  We will have people in a bureaucratic swamp if we go down that road and we will undermine the principle of what we are trying to achieve here, which is to make legal the sharing of data between body A and body B.  Everyone accepts that the situation that currently pertains is not acceptable but with this provision, we would end up putting people in a very difficult and ambiguous position.  Pensioners in the public sector would be in a very difficult situation and I do not think anybody wants that.  There are 320,000 people in receipt of various public sector pensions.  The net result of the Deputy's amendment would be to place them in a very difficult legal position.</p></speech>

What is being proposed is that if someone opts into the once-only principle and submits his or her data, there is an implied consent that the data can be shared.  These amendments seek to ensure that there is some mechanism in place that allows an individual to opt out.  Deputy Wallace will correct me if I am wrong but it is my understanding that there would be an implied consent once a person opts into the once-only principle and there would also be an option available to opt out.  It is not the case that everybody will be walking around with bundles of paper under their arms for different bodies because once an individual gives his or her data, those data can be shared under the provisions of the Bill.  However, there must be some opt-out provision for individuals who do not want their data to be shared.</p> <p>  A personal access portal would be put in place through which an individual could view what data have been shared and could also request that the data be deleted but that is after the fact.  It is my understanding that an individual could only ask for data which had been shared to be deleted after they had already been shared.  I can completely understand Deputy Wallace's position.  In fact, Sinn F&eacute;in will support his amendments if he decides to press them.  If he does not press them, a discussion of this issue will be needed before Report Stage.  We are not legislative draftspersons and we do not have access to the Attorney General but we are telling the Government, as public representatives, that we want some mechanism put in place that would allow individuals to opt out of data sharing right across the system, if they so choose.  We do not know how many people would opt out.  It could be a very small number but the option should be available.</p></speech>

I, too, have legitimate concerns, particularly about the way data are being handled in the private sector.  There have been recent examples of problems in that area.  Deputy Wallace has done a lot of very positive work on the penalty points issue, for example.  Imagine a situation where a driver would not give his or her consent to have penalty points information shared between one arm of the State and another, namely, between the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  No one would want this but we could have a situation whereby an individual does not consent to have his or her penalty points data shared between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, via a garda on the side of the road, and the driver licensing authority.  Under the amendment that Deputy Wallace has asked me to accept, we could have a ridiculous scenario where an individual does not give consent to or seeks to withdraw consent from one public body sharing information with another.  We could also have another ridiculous scenario in which a person who is not tax compliant does not give consent to the sharing of his or her data between agencies of the State.  Bodies such as the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine as well as other State bodies responsible for payments would not have access to that information.  This could also include the sheriff's office, the Companies Registration Office, CRO, and any other arm of the State that could be affected by financial fraud.  Revenue is currently in a position to share information but under this provision the ridiculous situation would arise whereby we tie the hands of garda&iacute; on the side of the road, the Revenue Commissioners and so on. I cannot accept these amendments on that basis.</p></speech>

I met a man last Sunday who was stopped at a checkpoint about six years ago.  An individual who was in the car with him happened to be a suspected dissident IRA member.  The information went up onto the PULSE system but he knew nothing about it.  He discovered very recently that his name was on PULSE because he was in a car with a person who was suspected of being engaged in illegal activity.  How mad is that?</p></speech>

Clearly someone should not have the ability to refuse consent in such circumstances but in other cases, we should provide for an effective opt-out.  We must make that real and ensure that people are giving informed consent and that they know what will happen to their data.  The essential idea of a one line sign-off and then an opt-out is a good way to achieve that.</p></speech>

We tabled it to have this discussion.  We are saying express consent would have to be received from a data subject before the data would be shared with certain public bodies.  Obviously, there is an issue in terms of the data to be shared with the Garda or the Revenue Commissioners.  We need some mechanism in that regard.</p></speech>

On the amendments which deal with consent, the Minister of State has given a reasonable explanation of the practical effect of such changes in the case of particular State agencies.  It is incumbent on members to bring forward amendments to provide for an effective opt-out, where possible, but it would have to be balanced with the practical requirements of the different agencies of the State which the Minister of State has mentioned.</p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 4 and 16 in the names of Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly are reasonable in their drafting.  They would mean that a public services card or access to a person's public service identity could not be the exclusive basis for the purposes of verification.  That is reasonable in conducting a transaction or seeking access to a service.  I know that there have been difficulties with identity cards.  Requiring a public services card could be exclusionary.  Amendments Nos. 4 and 16 are reasonable and I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say about them.  I know that we have primarily discussed the other matter, but amendments Nos. 4 and 16 are included in this grouping and we have not discussed them.</p></speech>

The Bill makes it clear that it is up to each service provider to use the mechanism it believes is the most appropriate to determine the identity of the data subject, customer or citizen.  If I were to accept the amendment in the names of Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly on the issue, I would undermine and it would be in direct conflict with other existing legislation which would then have to be unwound as otherwise it would be unenforceable.  Other legislation, including the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 introduced by a previous Government, would be made unworkable because, as identified in that Act, use of particular mechanisms such as the public services card has been specified for certain services.  It is not the intention of this Bill to prescribe what should be used and, as importantly, it is not its intent to prescribe what should not be used.  We are not prescribing what an individual service provider must or must not use.  That is not the intent of the Bill; it is a matter for each individual service provider to determine.  It is also up to each individual service provider to seek legislation, if required, to put in place the mechanism it wishes to use.  It will be up to each service provider to have regard to the Bill, particularly in the context of data sharing arrangements and the consultation that will have to take place on them.  On that basis, I cannot accept the amendments.  They would put the Bill in direct conflict with existing legislation as specific ways by which data must be collected have been spelled out for service providers.  For instance, a family farm uses a herd number.  I cannot state in this Bill that from here on herd numbers cannot be collected or used as an identifier, any more than I can say the public services card cannot be used.</p></speech>

That language gives flexibility to allow the public services card to be used where provision of an additional form of identity is also allowed.  Deputy Wallace has focused mainly on the other aspects of the amendments in the grouping.  Does he want to say anything about this matter?</p></speech>

We will address the points the Minister of State is making and take them on board.  Perhaps it might need to be a little tighter.  Some of the things the Minister of State says I am saying are things I do not want to say.  Consent to data sharing must be freely given according to the GDPR.  That is at the core of much of what we are trying to get around.  We will look at the amendment again and reintroduce it in the Chamber.</p></speech>

As far as I know, that matter is covered in the Data Protection Act 2018 which transposed the law enforcement directive.  That Act deals with the area and explains the circumstances in which law enforcement information can be shared with other necessary bodies.  Nothing that is being proposed would undo it.</p></speech>

To go back to what Deputy Jack Chambers said, if we were in any way to undermine the public services card, as the amendment would because it would prevent it from being used as an exclusive means to verify identity, where would it leave the people who are using it to access free travel?  I do not think that is the intention.</p> <p>  As I said in the earlier part of the debate, Article 6 of the GDPR provides for consent as one element, but it also provides for compliance with legal obligations as set out in law.  In addition, it should also be noted that under the GDPR, public bodies should not rely on consent as the lawful basis for processing a person's data.  There are other elements that have to be relied on in the processing of data.  Consent is one, but it is not the sole element.  Compliance with the law is also one.  I am not suggesting, as I do not think anybody else here is, that we should not have a law that allows it to be the case.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 5 proposes to use the definition of data sharing proposed by Digital Rights Ireland and Castlebridge Associates in their joint submission on proposals for the Bill.  One of the bigger problems with the Bill as initiated was that it failed to clarify whether the sharing to which it referred was a case-by-case exchange of data for a specific purpose or the creation of large-scale databases like the single customer view with no specific purpose.</p><p>The Minister introduced a Government amendment on Report Stage in the Seanad that I acknowledge went some way towards addressing the lack of specificity around what constitutes data sharing.  Section 19, which states what a data-sharing agreement shall contain, now states that the agreement must specify whether the information being shared relates to individual data subjects or classes of data subjects, and whether the sharing will be on a once-off or an ongoing basis.  That is progress, even though these specifications or details might also be included in the definition of data sharing in section 9.  The changes or improvements to this part of the Bill were a result of another amendment submitted by Senator Higgins who, like ourselves, was relying on the Digital Rights Ireland and Castlebridge Associates definition of data sharing.</p><p>In the Seanad the Minister said that a simple definition of data sharing is necessary without really explaining why simplicity in the definition is so important to him.  This amendment proposes to define data sharing as a process, not just as a set of actions.  The Bill's current definition is not very different from the original definition in the proposals for the Bill, which was just a circular statement essentially saying that data sharing is the sharing of data.  We are proposing a definition that suggests a system which might be subject to governance.  The definition of data sharing at the moment is broad to the extent that it will inevitably lead to further functional creep, as we have seen with the public services card and its expansion.</p><p>This is linked with amendment No. 6, is that correct?</p></speech>

In their submission on the proposals for the Bill, Digital Rights Ireland and Castlebridge Associates, based in Wexford, highlighted this problem, particularly the fact that without such a definition there may be variances or discrepancies between Departments and between public bodies.  These discrepancies may arise not only in how each body defines data governance but maybe more importantly on how the principles of data governance are applied.  Digital Rights Ireland and Castlebridge Associates, groups with considerable expertise in this area, believe there should be a clear, centralised, standard definition of the term in the Bill.  We are offering the example they put forward in their joint submission as a possible definition.  The definition they have suggested defines governance as the system that determines who defines the processes and methods of data sharing, what data may be shared, how often, to whom, and under what legislatively supported circumstances.  They also make the point that governance must involve not only decision rights but also accountability to ensure the systems and processes under governance operate effectively.</p></speech>

The definition of data sharing was the subject of considerable debate in the Seanad, and the proposed definition here is ambiguous.  A simple, unambiguous definition of data sharing is required, and that is what we have provided for in the text of the Bill in consultation with the Attorney General.</p><p>Section 13 sets out the purposes for which data sharing can be carried out.  This section was amended following debate in the Seanad to provide specific purposes.  The wording proposed in this amendment directly conflicts with that section.  Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p><p>Amendment No. 6 seeks to create a definition of data governance.  While I do not have a problem with this is principle, the specific term is not used anywhere in the Bill and therefore does not need to be defined.  As the Deputies know, we are establishing a data governance board under the legislation.  Its functions are set out in section 46(1).  One functions of the board, specified in section 46(1)(<i>a</i>), is to &quot;advise the Minister in relation to the prescribing of rules, procedures and standards under <i>section 64</i>&quot;.  This is a definition of governance.  These rules, procedures and standards will in effect be the agreed-upon models which describe who can take what actions with what information and when, what methods can be used and under what circumstances.  These are the questions the Deputies refer to in the proposed amendment.  Unfortunately, because the term &quot;data governance&quot; is not specifically used in the Bill, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

Part of the reason for this section is that we do not know what other types of public bodies may be constructed in the future.  Rather than having to come back and amend this legislation if a new public entity is established, we are allowing the situation to develop in the future.  This is really a "just in case" provision.  It is there just in case there are public bodies that are not covered by the Bill.  As I say, this is a data-sharing and governance board between public bodies. Those public bodies are defined under the Bill.  As such, private entities are not covered by this.  That would be a public body sharing information with a private body, which is not the intent or provision of the Bill.</p></speech>

It is a logical follow-on from the provision of section 10(3) that the Minister may exclude a public body involved in any commercial activity from being able to share data under this legislation.  The proposal arises from an amendment proposed by Senator Higgins on Report State in the Seanad.  I gave a commitment to her that I would propose an amendment to this effect when the Bill reached Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il.

This was discussed at length in the Seanad.  I gave a commitment then that it would not exceed what is required.  During the debate in the Seanad, several Members expressed a strong preference that wording of this legislation should reinforce the requirement under the GDPR.  I accepted several amendments to this affect in sections 13 and 19.  I now propose to strengthen the wording further with these amendments to sections 13 and 19.</p><p>Amendment No. 9 to section 13 sets out an explicit requirement that data sharing under this legislation shall not be lawful unless it is necessary for the performance of the functions of the public bodies concerned and that the disclosure of the information concerned is proportionate in the context of the performance of the functions of the public bodies concerned and the GDPR rights of the data subject whose personal information is being shared.  This is why I will come back on Report Stage to the amendment lost by the Government.  It will also give clarity to the Opposition that, in many cases, this strengthens the issues to which Deputy Wallace referred, with the tests of being necessary and proportionate.  That is why I signalled my intention to the Acting Chairman my intention to revert to the amendment lost earlier on Report Stage.</p><p>Similarly, amendment No. 13 to section 19 requires that as part of a data-sharing agreement, the parties to that agreement must provide a statement setting out why the data sharing is necessary and proportionate.  It is a test that will have to be passed when the data-sharing agreement is put out to public consultation and when the agreement is first drawn up.</p><p>The effect of these two amendments is to strengthen the obligation of the public bodies to ensure that any data sharing they carry out is necessary and proportionate and to provide greater clarity on what tests should be applied to achieve this.  I ask the committee to support these amendments.  It also outlines why I wish to return to the earlier amendment on Report Stage.</p></speech>

In the Seanad, I accepted an amendment to section 17 which would provide that an Oireachtas committee could request that the Minister furnish it with a copy of a data-sharing agreement made under this legislation.  It is a good initiative as it allows the Houses of the Oireachtas as well as members of the public to have a say in any data-sharing agreement that will be published.  Accepting this amendment had the unintended consequence of removing the original requirement under section 17 that the data-sharing agreements be made in writing.  Therefore the purpose of the amendment is to reinstate the original wording that provides for this.</p><p>The provision to provide data-sharing agreements to an Oireachtas committee is better placed in section 60 which covers the Minister's obligation to publish all data-sharing agreements and lay them before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is provided for in amendment No. 26.  The expectation is that Members of the Oireachtas would also be able to make submissions during the consultation.  As was pointed out in the Seanad, it is the norm in any legislation concerning submission of information to committees to exclude the Committees on Members' Interests, and the amendment provides for that.</p><p>On amendment No. 24, I accepted several amendments to section 52 regarding the Minister's reporting obligations under the Bill in the Seanad.  This is technical in nature to improve the section's clarity and readability.  Therefore I ask the committee to approve the amendments.</p></speech>

On Report Stage in the Seanad, I accepted an amendment tabled by Senator Higgins to section 44(2)(d), that the portal would allow data subjects to view any data-sharing agreements used as a basis for data being shared.  As said in the Seanad, this is important and I accepted it because it provides the basis for the sharing.  Amendment No. 17 is a slightly revised version of the text proposed by Senator Higgins.  This amendment moves the text to section 44(2)(c), which is a more appropriate location for the provision.</p><p>Amendment No. 18 deletes Senator Higgins' original text since it will be superseded if the text I propose in amendment No. 17 is accepted.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 19 to 21, inclusive, are technical amendments to insert references to the new section 44(2)(c) so that public bodies have a basis to provide the data-sharing agreement to the portal and that the provision of the data-sharing agreement would only occur on the request of the data subject.  I ask members to accept the amendments.</p></speech>

This was an amendment to section 46 which was tabled and accepted in the Seanad.  The Office of the Attorney General has since advised that it has significant issues with the provision.  Public procurement law applies across the board to all public bodies and it is not the norm to specify in legislation that it applies to a particular body or type of contract.  The Attorney General has advised that the inclusion of this provision could call into question whether procurement law applies to some bodies but not others.  I know that would not be the intention of anybody here.  We cannot have that situation so the provision must be deleted.  I reassure the committee that the laws of public procurement apply to the data governance board in the same way that all the laws of the land would apply to such a body.</p><p>Amendment No. 23 is a technical amendment to section 47(6) concerning membership of the data governance board, to add the word &quot;persons&quot;, which was inadvertently omitted from the text.</p></speech>

I suggest that the Minister of State withdraw amendment No. 22, subject to further discussion.  It is an amendment to provide transparency.  I understand, on the basis of the discussions and the agreement of the Minister of State to accept the amendment, that another amendment from Senator Higgins was then withdrawn.  It was amendment No. 59 on, presumably, Committee Stage in the Seanad.  Will the Minister of State agree to withdraw this now and have further discussion on Report Stage?</p></speech>

We will support No. 23, but given that No. 22 reverses an amendment the Minister of State accepted in the Seanad, similar to those he withdrew previously, I ask him to withdraw this one for consistency.  We can discuss it before Report Stage and he can always resubmit it then.</p></speech>

I accept the spirit of what Senator Higgins proposed.  I am the Minister of State with responsibility for procurement.  We want to avoid any situation where existing procurement contracts and contracts put in place through competitive practice, which are already laid out in frameworks and underpinned by European Union directives on procurement, would be in any way undermined by the proposed amendment.  I said at the time that we would reflect on all the proposals that were made in the Seanad and bring forward proposals on Committee Stage where that would be necessary.  I do not want a situation where we have legislation which is directly in conflict with the established practices of our procurement policies and EU directives on procurement.  The procurement practices are laid out by the Office of Government Procurement and the procurement executive, who are accountable to me.  I would not want to undermine the job that they do.  I will press the amendment and, if we require further discussion on this on Report Stage, I would welcome that.  I reiterate that my officials and those of the procurement section in my Department would be willing to speak to the Deputies and Senator if that signal is made.</p></speech>

Surely the legislation cannot be applied retrospectively to any existing framework or contract?  If something has to be rolled over, the wording of the amendment is that they are subject to public competition.  I am not sure how that would provide any specific directive with legislative consequences for the office of the Minister of State, the procurement process or even EU law.  It simply mentions public competition.  It is general, ambiguous wording.  I am not sure how the retrospective element the Minister of State mentioned in his initial remarks would follow through.</p></speech>

We do not do that as a norm.  To underpin a specific element of public procurement in specific legislation could reflect on other public procurement and suggest that there is somehow an issue with the legality of it.  Rather than do that, the established practice laid out under EU procurement directives is the manner in which we will pursue all procurement across the board, whether in health, education, defence, the Office of Government Procurement or local authorities.  They are all laid out on the same basis.</p><p>We have received advice from the Attorney General that singling out one element could infer a question about the legality of the others which I know, of course, is not what we intend.  It is on that basis that I am seeking to delete lines 21 and 22.</p></speech>

We are talking about the functions of the board.  The Bill reads &quot;The board shall&quot; and lists what its functions will be, of which No. 5 is, &quot;The Minister may enter into an arrangement for the provision of consultancy, advice and other services to the board&quot;.  The Minister of State is proposing to take out the line, &quot;Any contracts in respect of consultancy, advice or other services to the board shall be subject to public competition&quot;.  I do not see the issue.  We are saying that, if a contract is to be entered into by the board for the provision of consultancy, advice or any other service, it will be subject to public competition.  My understanding is it would actually complement the public procurement process.</p><p>This is what the Minister of State said in the Seanad: </p><blockquote>Amendment No. 57 is an amendment to section 56 in respect of the functions of the Data Governance Board to provide [that the Minister may] enter into an arrangement for the provision of consultancy, advice and any other services to the board.  This is a standard provision given to most boards.  I would expect that the skill sets each member will bring to the board will be sufficient for it to carry out its functions internally most of the time.  However, I foresee circumstances where it would appropriate for the board to seek external advice and assistance on specific matters.  We discussed this during a previous debate on the Bill.  This particularly arises where the board is developing data management rules, procedures and standards and may need to draw on specialised, technical advice on certain matters.  Nobody would want a situation where we tie the hands of the board so it could not get external advice.  I propose to accept amendment 58 [for this reason].</blockquote> <p>Perhaps the Minister of State might explain about the procurement process.  We are saying if the boards enter into contracts for the provision of consultancy, advice and other services, those contracts would be subject to public competition.  If we were to take out that line, would we not be saying the contracts would not have to go through the public procurement process and would not have to be subject to public competition and that the board could actually go to one individual and enter into a contract with him or her privately without having a public competition?</p></speech>

Procurement across all agencies, Departments and public bodies is already carried out under a strict code, for which I am the Minister of State with responsibility.  On the advice of the Attorney General, the net result could be perceived as calling into question the legality of everything else we procured.  If committee members are in agreement that I make this amendment today, we can have a further discussion on the matter on Report Stage when I can provide further assurances for the Deputies, if they so wish.  I again invite Deputies to engage with my Department.  We do not specify in any other legislation where there is a necessity for the procurement of services, of which there are probably thousands, if not tens of thousands, that anything other than what is pre-determined in law would be the norm.  The law on procurement is set out in EU directives and applied by the Office of Government Procurement in my Department and the procurement executive.  The advice I have been given is that proceeding with provision this could call into question all other elements of procurement law set out in other legislation in which it is not reflected.  I know that that is not the intention and that it certainly was not the intention in the Seanad.  It is not my intention to do so either.</p></speech>

I sit on the Committee of Public Accounts and one of the consistent findings in most of the Comptroller and Auditor General's reports concerns the failure to comply with public procurement law.  It happens across all Departments where there is a failure in certain cases to comply with public procurement law.  I see nothing in the Bill that it should be subject to public competition, contradicting existing procurement law.  I do not see why there is that contradiction.  Therefore, we will not be supporting the amendment.</p></speech>

If the Minister of State has concerns about the clarity of other legislation, he could amend the particular line he is proposing to delete to allow it to fall within existing procurement law.  Simply deleting it is not the answer when we know that the current guidelines are soft.  As Deputy Jonathan O'Brien mentioned, there are huge issues that arise at the Committee of Public Accounts on a regular basis with a failure to comply with procurement law.  Basic legislative interpretation means that we know that this is the function of the board and it relates specifically to it and the contracts it enters into.  It does not go beyond any other aspect of procurement law.  Someone could not make a challenge on the basis of section 46(6) because, if it does not reference them specifically and relate to them, one could not make that legislative interpretation.  I am not sure where the Attorney General's advice follows through in that regard.  We cannot interpret other legislation or another precedent elsewhere.  Perhaps the Minister of State might amend the amendment and clarify the position on Report Stage but just deleting the lines and forget about the matter is inappropriate at this stage.</p></speech>

This is a technical amendment to tidy up the wording and to make specific reference to Article 5.1 of the GDPR, where the data protection principles are set out.  Basically this is referencing the GDPR.  It is strengthening the fact that while the GDPR is there, and we have to have regard to it, it is really just underlining the fact that we have to have regard to it.  Does it in any way change the construct of the Bill?  No.  Does it make it any stronger than it was before we drafted it?  Probably not.  What it does is satisfy any doubt that might exist that there is not enough reference to the GDPR.  It is on that basis that we are going ahead with it.</p></speech>

This should allow for a greater number of transactions between businesses and public bodies to be carried out online in line with our ambitions to digitise public services to the greatest extent possible.  A consequential technical amendment is also required to the Long Title of the Bill to refer to the proposed amendment of the TCA.  This is provided for in amendment No. 30.

The English version of the title in section 6(1) is the National Shared Services Office; the definite article, &quot;the&quot;, is included.  In the Irish language version provided, Oifig N&aacute;isi&uacute;nta Seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Comhroinnte, the definite article was omitted.  There are two articles in use in the English language, the definite article, &quot;the&quot;, and the indefinite article, &quot;a&quot; or &quot;an&quot;.  As a result, omitting the definite article in English - this is like my leaving certificate modh coinn&iacute;olach - does not render the noun indefinite.  The use of the indefinite article serves for that purpose.  For this reason, the definite article is regularly omitted in titles in English as it allows for the use of a more concise title in signage, for example the &quot;Department of Education and Skills&quot; or the title head of section 6.  However, this is not possible in the Irish language as an omission of the definite article automatically renders a noun indefinite.  The article &quot;the&quot; is clearly intended and expressed in the English version of the title in section 6(1) but in the Irish-language title, the article &quot;an&quot; is omitted.  The purpose of the amendment is to correct this oversight.</p><p>An amendment is also required to the Long Title of the Bill to reflect that it provides an amendment to the National Shared Services Office Act 2017.  This is provided for in amendment No. 31, which also provides for the insertion of a reference to the amendment to the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 2011 in the Long Title of the Bill.  This relates to section 72 of the Bill, which provides for an amendment to section 17(a) of the Ministers and Secretaries Act to allow the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to collect and process public service information under Part 5 of this Bill.  This reference should have been included in the Long Title when the Bill was first published but was omitted due to an oversight.  The amendment is technical in nature and is intended to correct this.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Brendan McGrath and Mr. Dermot Mahon from Galway City Council; Mr. Conn Murray and Ms Aoife Duke from Limerick City and County Council; Mr. Joe McGuinness and Mr. Paddy Donnelly from Louth County Council and Ms Moira Murrell and Mr. Martin O'Donoghue from Kerry County Council.  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Due to the tight schedule, the committee has decided to take the witnesses' opening statements as read.  If they are agreeable, we will go straight into questions rather than reading out the statements.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-06a.3239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018120600002#E00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for taking the time to travel to the committee meeting.  Key issues for the committee are the targets for meeting social and affordable housing need under Rebuilding Ireland and the delivery of those units.  I have the same questions for each local authority on that.  Many members are concerned that the targets, in particular for what many of us call "real social housing", namely, units owned by local authorities or approved housing bodies, are far too low to meet the overall level of need in each of the witnesses' local authority areas.  What I mean by that is that if one takes the current net housing list and the HAP transfer list, it gives one the real social housing need in a local authority area.  If one matches that against the targets in Rebuilding Ireland, including builds, acquisitions and leasing, one third at best of the real social housing need will be met over the next three years.   While the Minister will reply "Yes, but everyone's need will be met through HAP and RAS, etc.", are local authorities concerned about the wide gap between additions to the real social housing stock and the level of need according to their housing and HAP transfer lists?</p> <p>  The next matter is affordable housing.  I appreciate that many local authorities are waiting to see what happens with the cost-rental pilot projects in Dublin, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and Cork.  The serviced sites fund was initially made available to only a small number of local authorities, that is, to 11 of them, but the expectation is that it will be made available to others.  What is the view in the housing departments within the witnesses' local authorities as to the level of need for affordable housing, including purchase and rental, in their administrative areas?  If they have no idea of the need, which I suspect is the case given that I have no idea of what it is in my own local authority area, what must we do to establish what the level of need is?  Is the delivery of affordable rental or purchase homes led by local authorities and approved housing bodies factoring into their plans over the next number of years?</p> <p>  The third question relates to the infamous one-stage approval process.  Have the local authorities represented here today used the one-stage process?  If so, how much use was made of it?  If not, why has it not been used?  Is it because there are no projects of larger size or due to the risks involved?  What would the local authorities like to see in the amended one-stage process regarding the upper financial limits or a greater sharing of risk with the Department?  The age-old question is whether the four-stage process is improving.  We are talking to some local authorities which say it is not improving and that timelines are too slow with too much back and forth between local authorities and the Department at the approval stage.  When the witnesses' counterparts from other local authorities appeared before the committee recently, we asked them what we could do to speed up procurement.  Have any of the witnesses' authorities considered moving from having to tender every new build project to regional framework agreements whereby clusters of local authorities would work together on a big bag tender to get a certain number of contractors on the shelf for developments of up to 50 to 100 units?  What can we do?  Based on the witnesses' expertise on the procurement end, what could the committee argue for with the Department to speed that up?  The delay this causes in delivering projects is a source of frustration for many local authorities.</p></speech>

Can the chief executives outline how many people in their areas are in emergency accommodation and what they plan to do to get them out of it and into proper accommodation?  Are the numbers decreasing or increasing?  Is it still down to the developer, landowner or householder selling houses where people have rented houses?  Is it still due to banks repossessing or is it just that they are selling houses on the open market with an increase in the valuation of houses?</p> <p>  I will direct a few questions to Galway City Council.  I welcome Mr. Brendan McGrath, the chief executive, and Mr. Dermot Mahon.  How many houses is Galway short of at the moment?</p><p>How many houses are needed to get over the crisis?  What is being done to try to deliver that?  How many houses are the councils hoping to build between now and 2021?  What plans are in place to build these houses?  Have they been approved?  Have they gone to tender?  What blockages are there to completing projects?  Is it with getting approval from the Department or with getting contracts signed to get houses?  We have a major crisis.  I am sure every county has that.  As my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, said, there has to be a mechanism for fast-tracking the building of houses.  I am aware of a scheme in County Galway which was held up in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government for months to get approval, particularly about where windows would be in part of the development.  We were told there was only one architect in the Department.  Do the councils find that that still happens?</p><p> Does Galway County Council have enough land to deal with the housing crisis, not just for those in social or affordable housing, but for the ordinary people who want to buy a house?  We seem to forget about the young couples who do not qualify for social or affordable housing who want to buy a house.  I see it in Galway.  Is it happening in other parts of the country?  Is the State coming in and buying full housing estates?  I see there are a number of estates in Galway where the State has bought the whole lot in one fell swoop.  It is unfair on young couples who want to get on the property market.  They cannot bid against the State.  We have a housing crisis, including for young couples.  Many are heading back home and staying with their parents because they cannot afford to pay rent or to get on the property ladder, because the prices are going up, and they cannot bid against the State.</p><p> There is an issue in Galway which may be present around the country.  I go into Galway early every Sunday morning.  From the top of Shop Street to its end, I think I counted 22 rough sleepers indoors in the space of, at most, 100 m.  By 8.30 a.m., they were gone.  There was no sign of them.  They walked down the side ways.  It was as if they disappeared.  They come back at night between 11 p.m. and 12 midnight.  What is being done about that?  It is a disgrace to see so many.  I have walked along and looked at them and they are all foreign.  None is Irish.  I ask Mr. Brendan McGrath, as chief executive in Galway, if anything has been done.  Has there been a survey?  Has the council talked to them?  Who are they?  Where are they from?  What is being done to deal with that?  It is terrible looking in the mornings.  Many tourists walk around the city early in the morning and see that.  Is that being addressed?</p><p> Will Mr. McGrath outline the future development of Galway city?  I know he has done a lot of work, on which I compliment him on, in progressing the Ardaun corridor on the east side of Galway city.  The road has been downgraded.  Funding has been received to get access to it.  When does Mr. McGrath expect to see houses built on that?  How many houses does he hope will be built?  When does he expect to see people move in to these houses?  Will he outline how many people are in emergency accommodation in Galway?  When does he expect to be in a position to get that down to zero?  What is the trend of people getting into emergency accommodation?  How many present to Galway City Council as homeless in a month, on average?  Are they families, couples or single people?  Will Mr. McGrath and other chief executives outline the monthly trends of those presenting as homeless?</p><p> I am not a member of the committee but I thank the Vice Chairman for the opportunity to ask a few questions.</p></speech>

We have 189 adults and just over 100 children in emergency accommodation.  We recently opened the winter beds initiative, with which we increased capacity since last year.  We will have 36 beds available and we also have contingency beds if that is insufficient.  That will run through to next April and extend beyond that if necessary.  We also have a men's hostel, Fairgreen Hostel, run by COPE, a homeless charity in Galway, with 36 beds which are full.  The female hostel, where there are 13 beds, is also full.  This year, we have allocated social housing to 20 homeless families.  It is a difficult cycle and problem.  We have another 49 families on notices to quit who will conceivably come on to our homeless list in the first quarter of 2019.</p> <p>  We have made a significant number of interventions to deal with the homeless challenge.  It includes a homeless housing assistance payment, HAP, placefinder service which has been running since June.  We have already been able to house 27 families under homeless HAP.  Some 17 couples and single people who were registered have been housed under that initiative.  I referred to the cold weather response.  We recently purchased a family hub.  Renovation work is starting next week.  It will be up and running in the first quarter and that will accommodate 12 families.  We are rolling out a modular housing scheme comprising 15 prefabricated two and three bedroom units on lands in city ownership.  That will be up and running in early 2019.  Through the Housing First initiative, where we set ourselves a target of 30 Housing First tenancies, we have also secured funding through the social reform fund, a philanthropic fund.  It provides a wraparound service to homeless people who we are providing accommodation to and works with disability services, mental health services and the HSE.  Work has recently commenced on a new domestic violence refuge in the city which will be ready late next year.  That will provide nine additional accommodation units.</p> <p>  We have a rough sleeping problem.  We have and will have beds for everybody who needs a bed this winter.  The rough sleepers are largely non-habitual residents.  They do not have residency status.  They are generally eastern European.  We have engaged with them consistently but they have refused offers of support other than winter packs.  They are sadly destitute in their own countries.  Young people going out at night might give them money etc., and they do not want to engage with services.  They disappear the following morning and it is a problem we are trying to address.  To be frank, a policy intervention is probably needed involving the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Justice and Equality, relating to non-habitual residency, which would help to ameliorate the challenge.</p> <p>  With regard to housing supply, very little private housing has been built in Galway since 2007.  We estimate that there is a shortage of approximately 3,000 units.  The city's population is growing organically by approximately 1,000 people a year.  That would typically suggest that 300 or 350 units of accommodation are required to keep pace.  We probably have pent-up demand that needs to be dealt with.</p><p> Extant planning permissions in Galway city can deliver 6,020 units.  Our work on brownfield sites and the new suburb at Ardaun have the capacity to accommodate 3,500 accommodation units.  As Deputy Grealish mentioned, we have begun work on Ardaun.  In the past fortnight, we have attracted urban regeneration funds to deal with the access issues.  That funding will go to site in 2019.</p><p> The city council faces a challenge in terms of its landbanks.  We have 18 ha that are suitable for housing and are building on or are about to start building on 10 ha of that.  The next 6.5 ha will go to site next year.</p><p> Galway City Council has approximately 2,300 social houses.  By the end of 2021, we will have increased that number by 50%.  That will create its own challenge for us in terms of the maintenance and management of the increased stock and developing sustainable communities, but we are making significant inroads into tackling the issue.</p><p> One of the quirks of the lack of private building in Galway is that approximately 85% of what is being built is either going to approved housing bodies, AHBs, or is local authority building.  This means that there is a severe shortage of affordable and other housing options for people who fall outside the social housing qualification criteria.  The situation is exacerbated because, on the one hand, those people are generally in rented accommodation and rents are increasing because of the market shortage and, on the other, they are under pressure to meet the Central Bank's mortgage affordability criteria.</p><p> I believe I have answered most of the Deputy's questions.  If not, I will happily speak again.</p></speech>

I will gladly address any Limerick-specific question as well, but we have given a detailed submission on what we are doing.</p> <p>  As to whether the targets in Rebuilding Ireland are realistic, they are the targets that have been set for the respective authorities.  We will achieve them.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked a specific question on direct builds, which have always been the subject of many questions.</p></speech>

I misunderstood.  In terms of the policy that we work under, all aspects of Rebuilding Ireland are worked on and delivered in order to provide appropriate accommodation for the people on our housing lists.  It is a different debate as to whether that is long term or another tenure element.  We will work to deliver on that in terms of whatever direction comes to us.  We have been successful in delivering under the policies that have been set to date, be that under the housing assistance payment, HAP, or the increased amount of leasing.  In turnkey operations, direct builds have been important.</p> <p>  We need to see a strong balance emerging between private sector building and public housing if we are to ensure an appropriate tenure mix while also meeting market demand.  This relates to the question of affordability.  Unless we start seeing a significant improvement in starter homes, we will never move to address that aspect of the situation.  One of the key areas that we would like to see more advancement on is the affordable loan that is available to people.  It is an excellent loan at a good rate.  It is a question of how to mobilise it and get it working more quickly so as to enable people to get starter homes and take some of the pressure off other sectors.</p> <p>  A question was asked about the speed of delivery.  Various policies over the past 30 years - I have worked under most of them - have seen the local authority being the provider, the introduction of AHBs and, at one stage, an emphasis being placed on AHBs.  Addressing that saw shifts in the various elements between private provision, AHBs and us.  Consequently, and particularly in the past eight years, local authorities have not been as geared up for delivery because a different sector was providing housing.  It has taken time to resource and rebuild our respective departments, personnel and expertise to drive forward with various types of build.  We have ramped up considerably.</p> <p>  The 2018 targets will be achieved overall, although individual targets pose challenges for the authorities for which they are set.  That is down to some of the processes.  Authorities will be up in some years and slightly down in others, but it is important that we be measured as a sector overall.  Turnkey operations are a vital part of that.  The four-stage process was mentioned but, in terms of direct build, committee members will see the speed with which turnkey operations can be turned around and delivered as distinct from the four-stage process.  That depends on the activity that is taking place within the respective county.</p> <p>  I will comment on the four-stage process.  There have been improvements.  The introduction of the 59-week process has enabled us to work to more clearly defined timelines.  We would like to see further improvements.  It has been indicated that the four-stage process could be reduced to two.  The first stage would be a combination of the current stages 1 and 2, which would increase its sufficiency prior to formal planning permission.  That would be done to ensure we had confidence going forward.  I am a great believer in-----</p></speech>

Currently, it is approximately 18 months depending on the project.</p></speech>

Stages 1 and 2 are dependent on the planning process, which can differ depending on the local authority, the issues that arise or the locations where one wants to build.  Once planning permission has been acquired and the formal adjudication process has started, one can accelerate the time.  The initial projects are always hard to judge, but once a project gets to the point of having planning permission and surety around the capital appraisal, it can move forward.</p></speech>

I am fortunate in Limerick, in that we have supported the delivery of a number of critical Part 8 projects in recent times, which gives me a 2019 programme.  That does not happen everywhere, though, and depends on the challenges facing authorities.  The statutory timeframe does not take away from our obligation to ensure that the community is heard and the elected body has its say.  If we bring more surety to that and the staged process then delivers, local level will be given more accountability and responsibility for what it does.  That is the argument I would put forward.</p> <p>  Emergency homeless accommodation remains a serious challenge in various parts of the country.  We discuss it at an individual authority level as opposed to a sectoral level, as the challenges differ depending on where the authority is.  In my area, 31 families are in bed and breakfasts.  By the end of 2017, we had reduced the overall number of 79 families by 93% to five, but that number increased again during this year.  We have introduced two hubs with ten families and other sheltered accommodation.  Finding housing first is critical.  We are embarking on that successfully and ensuring that there is support for the families.  It is also important that the communities they are moving into be supported in looking after them.  Doing this has worked well for us.  In terms of the 31 families, I hope to have a new hub early in the new year.  There will be accommodation for everyone as we face into the winter, as Mr. McGrath indicated.</p> <p>  I should have referred to the delivery programme at the start.  People quickly forgot that we had an extraordinary winter that lasted five months at the beginning of the year.  It had an impact on direct delivery, not just for the public sector, but also for the private sector.  If we get a fair wind, we will see a continuous increase in delivery.</p> <p>  We have used the emergency planning powers to deliver hubs in the community.</p><p>It is not something we want to do in going against the wishes of the community or the council but it is there and we have used it practically to ensure it can be delivered.  The other aspect that perhaps will require a little more debate is the single stage, which is something we are looking at directly.  We have not used it to date, although we have one going through at this time.  Because of the complexity of the areas we were dealing with in the context of the city and metropolitan area, the single stage did not give the assurance in terms of the challenges that are sometimes faced on brownfield sites.  It is worth looking at.  It should be greater than &euro;2 million and should be far greater than eight units.  Perhaps-----</p></speech>

We will increase that.  It depends on the area of the country and the demands in terms of spend, going back to the list.  I believe it could be increased to &euro;10 million depending on the cost of operations in the area.  That could be looked at on a regional basis, as distinct from a specific local authority aspect.  The processes and the relationship with the Department at this time are excellent.  We find we are getting the type of response expected and we are supported in delivery on the ground.</p></speech>

In regard to target versus need, the Louth target for 2018 is for 308 units, with a three-year target of 1,147.  We will be close to the 2018 target and I am confident that we will exceed the three-year target.  That target is largely being delivered through AHB-CALF funded units which are produced in significant numbers in Louth, largely due to the rent levels that can be achieved because the rental market is strong so close to Dublin.  That is probably the reason for the success of the CALF scheme.</p> <p>  In regard to the specific question on target versus need, if members refer back to the 1980s, which was seen as the most buoyant time for local authority construction, we were probably constructing in region of 250 units whereas our target now is 308.  While we feel our target is challenging, we will be close to it.  There will always be housing need and there always was &ndash; that is a fact of life.  It is a matter of catching up with what has happened in recent years.</p> <p>  On whether we think there is a need for affordable housing, there are two elements.  First, the market is not yet supporting affordable housing, and market price and construction price have not yet matched.  The availability of construction labour is heavily influencing the price of construction, particularly in Louth, because Dublin is sucking in all the skilled labour.  For us to get local labour, we have to cross the Border and most of our contractors are from Northern Ireland.  All of this is affecting the market price of a house.  The second point is whether there are people fit to acquire affordable units, and the financial institutions have a part to play in providing finance for those units.  We look at our rent schemes and our average rents are going up.  There is more money, therefore, and tenants have more money.  It is a question of supply and demand.  The Deputy is correct that it is a hard question to answer.</p> <p>  We have used the single-stage process once and we are currently using it for our CPO units, which we do in bundles.  It requires an element of work, particularly pre-planning work in preparing schemes and to ensure we have the costings correct.  The single-stage process has worked for us.  We welcome the first increase in the limits and we will welcome the second increase that is coming in January.   It requires an element of work which we are happy to take on.</p> <p>  With regard to emergency accommodation, Louth has a range of 120 to 160 adults in emergency accommodation, and we peaked at 160.  There are various reasons for presentation.  Our submission states that, traditionally, we always had a homeless population of perhaps 40 to 50 individuals, going right back to the 1980s.  The issue is the difference between 50 and 160.  It is a different cohort from previously.  We are talking about people who have lost units, particularly from the buy-to-let sector, where units have been taken back by the financial institutions.  One of the more significant grounds for presentation is where the landlord has lost the property and the tenant presents as homeless.  We never had families presenting as homeless before but we do now.  We have opened our first hub and used private leases and the HAP scheme to get accommodation for those people.  Nonetheless, homelessness is an everyday challenge, even in a small county like Louth.</p></speech>

Our target to the end of the period is 1,780 units, of which 840 are build, 310 are turnkey, 360 are acquisitions and 270 are lease.  They are strong targets and when we look at authorities in Cork, Dublin and Kildare, we see we have the highest targets in the country.  We certainly have a significant focus on achieving those targets.  With regard to land and social housing, we are building on every piece of land we can to achieve the targets, as well as actively acquiring land to build for our purposes.</p> <p>  With regard to affordability, Kerry is different from Louth in that there is the tourism factor.  With 2 million visitors to the county each year, the short-term lets and the Airbnb factor are strong in the competition between residential and tourism.  The change in policy will impact on Kerry.  Separately, we have seen some green shoots in the private market in parts of the county but there is little activity in other parts of the county.  Through our strong programme, the council will be the one developing houses in many areas across the county.  From meetings with the CIF in the county, we find that, as in Louth, it is cheaper to buy a property than it is to build one in parts of the county.</p> <p>  The matter of procurement was raised.  When looking at how to deliver in this regard, procurement is a vital part of any process, and there is also the rural factor.  Kerry County Council has built 65 local authority houses directly this year.  These have been small schemes of some 20 units and our programme has few large schemes because that is the type of county it is.  I take the point on regional procurement but it is important for our local labour market to have local procurement.  Having the skills and the contractors locally to deliver at a time we need them is important.</p> <p>  There is an increase in homelessness, with 131 adults and 63 dependents now homeless.  We do not have rough sleepers in the county.  While we are dealing with the situation, it is certainly something which has increased in the county.</p> <p>  We are working very closely on a cross-agency basis.  The wraparound services are strong and working well in the county.  We have seen an increase in resources recently, which is welcome.  We have had approval from the Department to use our resources for HAP placements, as has the HSE.</p><p>The HAP has been important for us in placing people.  With the HAP placement officer, we will continue to see that activity even within a shrinking market of available properties.  It will be important for us.  The strong housing programme should create some space within the private market in respect of homelessness and we are also in discussions with the Department about the creation of additional family hub facilities in the county.</p></speech>

Cuirim f&aacute;ilte go dt&iacute; an choiste inniu.  I thank each of the witnesses and their housing teams for the work they are doing.  The homelessness crisis is acute throughout the country and I am aware from visiting local authorities and my own local authority in Fingal of the volume of work and emergency work that takes place.  The response has to be almost immediate and it is stressful for staff, which we cannot forget.  It is also stressful for people who are presenting in chaotic and difficult circumstances after being evicted or where a tenancy has been, or is due to be, ended.  I ask our guests to convey to their housing teams and the people associated with them my thanks and the thanks of the committee for the work they do every day, seven days per week.  I genuinely appreciate it.</p> <p>  My colleagues have covered a number of items so I will just make some brief comments.  I was interested in the question about affordability.  It emanated from the fact that the serviced site fund has increased to &euro;310 million over three years.  An affordable housing scheme will be established and it will focus on areas where there are affordability issues.  I do not expect that it will be opened in areas where there are no such issues.  I have a question on the Rebuilding Ireland loans, improvements to that system, common criteria and common financial underwriting.  Is Mr. Mahon the chairman of housing in the CCMA?</p></speech>

Are the criteria for financial underwriting for the Rebuilding Ireland loans uniform among local authorities?  I have evidence they are not.  I raised it with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and he said there is a review taking place to ensure that is happening.  Can Mr. Murray advise the committee on the interaction with the Housing Agency <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the loans?  Is each loan application going to the agency for oversight if not approval?</p><p>I refer to the use of CPO powers, which all the witnesses alluded to it in their opening statements.  It has been useful to get a picture from four local authorities outside Dublin and to consider the different housing issues throughout the country.  The figures are different.  In each of the opening statements the witnesses referred to purchasing units.  Louth County Council has 84 completions, according to the latest figures, in acquiring vacant houses and bringing them back into use.  That is a good performance and I commend the council on it.  The council has been put forward as an example of how this can be done.  There have been no completions in Galway city.  That is also the case in Kerry County Council and Limerick.  This is since 2011 and under the CPO powers.  That information was received under a freedom of information request I made.  I note that the witnesses spoke in their opening statements about acquiring buildings, but the information I received from the Department states that Louth is miles ahead of other councils.  Is there an issue with using the CPO powers?  Do local authorities not want to use them?  The Minister has said on a number of occasions that the threat of the use of CPO might be enough.</p><p>I acknowledge the success Louth has had in bringing vacant units into use.  Galway City Council has identified approximately 500 derelict or unused buildings:</p><blockquote>...the council prepared a vacant home strategy which is currently being implemented.  The initial estimates put the number of vacant homes in the city at <i>circa</i>500. </blockquote> <p>However, the council has completed no CPO since 2011.  Why is that?  What other strategies is the council using?  I am seeking the council's feedback on that; it is not a criticism.  I want to get under the bonnet to see what the issue is.</p><p>The discretionary cap has been referred to in the single stage process that Mr. McGuinness has used.  What impact will the increase in that cap to &euro;6 million have when it is introduced in January with regard to giving councils control over delivering smaller social housing schemes?  The increase was agreed in the last budget.</p><p>I was interested to hear Mr. McGrath speak about the HAP homeless placefinder service in Galway.  Does each local authority have that service?  One of the issues our party is considering is people presenting as homeless after the fact.  In some local authorities - I do not know if this happens in the ones represented by the witnesses - people are told to come back when the tenancy has ceased.  If people come to the local authorities represented here and they know they are going to be evicted or their lease expires in 60 or 80 days, what is the process in the local authority?  Will Mr. McGrath speak in more detail about the placefinder service with which the council has had some success?</p><p>I will conclude with a question on HAP.  Do the councils represented here remove their HAP clients from the main housing list and put them on the transfer list?  Some local authorities have stopped doing that.  What are the witnesses' views on it?  It is not a policy question.  I am asking it from an operational perspective.  I disagree with it.  HAP tenants should stay on the main housing list where there is proper oversight.  Do the witnesses remove somebody who is placed in a HAP tenancy from the housing list?  My main criticism of Rebuilding Ireland is the overdependence on the private rental sector and particularly HAP.  More than 50% of our targets are to be met by people being deemed housed when their need is met by entering into what is mainly a short-term lease.  My party's view of that is that their housing need has not been met.</p></speech>

Mr. Conn Murray was the manager in Louth for a successful period.  Mr. Joe McGuinness has been fantastic in his commitment and the work he has done in County Louth in respect of CPOs, as has Mr. Paddy Donnelly.  They are changing roles at the moment.  The benchmark for efficiency and accountability is what Louth County Council is doing on housing.  I was glad to hear Deputy Darragh O'Brien praising the work in County Louth.</p> <p>  I have said a number of times in this committee that the CPO project needs a national lead.  I have also said it to the Minister.  We ought to have somebody in charge of CPO nationally for the councils that are not doing their job.  I am not naming any council here other than Louth, which is doing a great job.  We could get 2,000 to 3,000 homes in the space of 18 months if it was properly led with the enthusiasm and commitment shown in Louth County Council.  I have travelled around my town with a housing body and the body has picked up a number of homes and is refurbishing them.  The easy win is where one has the services and one does not have to open up any land.  One has to reconstruct or rebuild the property but all the services, such as the footpaths, roads, lighting, sewerage and water, are in place so it is a cheaper operation.  The witnesses can confirm this but I believe the average cost was &euro;100,000 to &euro;110,000 for the CPO purchase from start to finish.  That included all legal and reconstruction or refurbishment costs.</p><p>That is very advantageous to the taxpayer and to the families who go in there.  It is a real blindspot in other counties and has to be driven.  I would appreciate the views of the witnesses because every town centre is full of properties that could be activated.  Do the council officials feel there is a need to, or what do they do, to generate business in this area?</p><p> I know the council identifies empty homes that are boarded up and there is a website for that.  How active are councils where properties are unoccupied particularly in town centres or in brownfield areas in chasing up the owners to see what they are doing with them and engage with them?  What incentives are available to property owners even if they are commercial properties to make them into family homes or one or two bedroom units?  That would make a huge difference.  </p><p> I wonder if any of my colleagues from the county council remember &ndash; I might have served even longer than they have &ndash; when people were on the housing list for one year before getting a house.  That went out to maybe three years, when Fianna F&aacute;il was in power. </p></speech>

To ask a family with children to wait, when the eldest child is ten years of age puts families in an appalling situation.  This continues to improve but it is still very difficult.</p> <p>  I can remember when Drogheda Borough Council wanted to build 20 or 30 houses and did not have the necessary specialities in house the National Building Agency at that time would construct 30 or 80 houses for the council.  All the design, professional fees and input that was needed was supplied.  Dublin City Council is acting in that respect in some way.  Maybe that could be clarified.  It seems that if there is that agency or a like body that will design and build for a council to the correct and proper standards it will take up a lot of the hard work that individuals in the council might have to do.  </p> <p>  We have a crisis in Drogheda because there is no money available to develop the town on the northern side which would increase the population by 20,000 over the next few years.  Is the council making applications under other funding to open up that land?  I know its recent application was not successful.  Will it be making an application to open up that land and build some of that northern cross route?  Will it apply to Departments for that?</p> <p>  The McVerry Trust is a very proactive agency for people who are homeless.  It is in County Louth now.  I welcome the new connection between Louth County Council and agencies such as the McVerry Trust and others.  There is an increasing opportunity for councils and approved housing bodies to work together.  </p></speech>

We have completed three CPOs this year.  We have already brought proposals to table to build a seven-house scheme on one of those.  The CPO is not always necessary because we have made 30 acquisitions of vacant homes this year, where we have negotiated the purchase.</p></speech>

The Central Statistics Office, CSO, said we have 3,500 vacant homes.  The Geodirectory said we have 200.</p> <p>  Through our vacant homes office we have gone out and identified what is there.  Approximately 100 of those are potentially available to us.  We did a survey of 100 homes and discovered 70 were not vacant.  Of the remaining 30 there were problems to do with gentrification, people in nursing homes, "fair deal", probates and family disputes.  The number of houses available is considerably lower than appears on paper. </p> <p>  We are actively looking at the brownfield sites and have processes in place to deal with several of those.  Where we can acquire properties we are doing that.  One of the reasons we have more than 60 void homes at the moment is that the ones we have bought are now in our void stock, being renovated to go into the social housing stream. </p></speech>

It is slightly different and we have used it successfully because we established an urban and village renewal unit to work throughout the county and we carried out a full land management assessment within the metropolitan area to identify lands and areas for development.  We used a different process.</p> <p>  We have successfully acquired properties, where necessary in order to deliver, and our housing programme is part and parcel of our overall regeneration programme and that must be part of output that we deliver on.  It is not that we do not use the CPO.  We know when to use it.  That is an important aspect of this.  Every authority has to make the call on that.  </p> <p>  We have now restructured within the organisation thanks to the opportunities for the merger with a social housing directorate specifically to respond to Rebuilding Ireland.  We have a design and delivery unit with the expertise now built in and the resources to manage design, delivery and procurement as a single unit and develop that expertise.  That can be shared too as we go forward.  </p> <p>  In response to the question about the loans we are aware that the Minister is carrying out a review.  As a sector we looked for that.  We are participating in it.  I do not have the statistics to date as we are going through the process and will feed into that.  We believe it is an excellent product.  We believe there are more opportunities there.  </p></speech>

We are examining where CPOs may be appropriate and are assessing each of those units in terms of those that are derelict and vacant.</p><p> On a related point, we have introduced a significant change towards the development contribution scheme to stimulate the reuse of vacant properties.

We have significantly changed the contribution to stimulate the reuse of the smaller house, which is a positive development.</p></speech>

I hope I am not repeating what has been said already as I was a little late in arriving.</p> <p>Is the degree of pressure on the local authorities regarding land purchase loans in terms of the availability of money to repair voids an issue?  The Minister told me in the D&aacute;il that if any local authority is not in a position to repair voids in its area and it submits an application in that respect by 14 December, he would be prepared to provide additional money for the repair of voids.  He said that categorically last week.</p> <p>  On the issue of CPOs, I will not repeat the praise of various local authorities in that respect.  As a few of the representatives will be aware, I have had a bee in my bonnet for many years about the issue of vacant rural housing.  There has been a great concentration on addressing urban vacant housing.  Anybody who was a candidate in the local authority elections and has traversed the roads will know the degree of vacant rural housing.  Those properties have been identified.  If one or two such properties were taken back into use in every parish, it would rejuvenate local schools facing challenges and it would provide funding for the local community.  By developing the synergies of the IFA and community organisations and making funding available, not necessarily to the local authority but with the help of the local authority, many of those vacant properties could be identified.  Such vacant properties exist and in some of them there is furniture, although I acknowledge there are legal issues regarding some of them.</p> <p>  I refer to the issue of student accommodation.  I note that many of the traditional houses in the vicinity of Dundalk Institute of Technology in my constituency have large gardens.  I mentioned to Deputy Darragh O'Brien that an incentive should be offered to encourage homeowners to build granny flats or single extensions to the rear of properties with large gardens in the vicinity of college areas.  Incentives could be offered to property owners, many of whom would be elderly, to provide a sun-room type accommodation for students and a grant could be provided to people who own plots of land for such development.  Has any of the representatives a view on that proposal?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-06a.3308" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2018120600002#L00900"><p>To return to my original question regarding the gap between the real social housing need and the targets in terms of the increase in real stock, the problem is that in each of the four local authorities represented, the gap is very stark.  For example, in Galway, the gap between the additions to the stock over the lifetime of Rebuilding Ireland and the real level of need is about 65%; in Louth, it is 74%; in Kerry, it is 59%; and in Limerick, it is 71%.  Given the fact that a number of the representatives have said that private sector activity is very slow, if so much of social housing need is to be met outside of local authorities' approved housing bodies' builds and acquisitions, and if the private sector is not building, they will not be able to meet the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, targets.  Leaving aside the fact that HAP and RAS provide security for two or four years, and therefore are not necessarily in the best interests of tenant or good development of communities, that gap is massive.  It is very worrying.  I acknowledge the representatives have to work within the existing policy and that the targets are set not on the basis of what they would like to do but by the Department.  The gap is very big and that will create some difficulties.</p> <p>  In terms of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, the product is very good but the figures as of September for the four local authorities are troubling.  For example, Galway city and county councils sent 83 loan applications to the Housing Agency for underwriting, 22 were recommended and as of September zero have been drawn down.  In the case of Louth County Council, 50 loan applications were sent to the Housing Agency, 19 were recommended for approval and only five have been drawn down.  In the case of Kerry County Council, 60 loan applications were sent to the Housing Agency for approval, 26 were recommended and zero have been drawn down.  In the case of Limerick, the respective figures are 46 loan applications, 28 were recommended and zero have been drawn down.  I acknowledge it is only the first three quarters of the scheme and that does not give us a full indication but clearly there is a problem.  Is it that the period between the date of application and the date of final approval is longer than is necessary for the person meant to be able to purchase his or her home?  Is it that the amounts being offered are less than what the applicants need to purchase their home?  This is not a critical comment of the local authorities or the Housing Agency but clearly the draw downs indicate there is a problem.  Those figures I gave for the local authorities sending loan applications to the Housing Agency represent approximately half of the number of applications received.  Half of the applications made, on average, are not sent to the Housing Agency.  I would be interested to hear the representatives views on that matter.</p> <p>  On the issue of Traveller accommodation and taking account of the budgets for last year and this year, Limerick had a significant overspend in its Traveller accommodation budget last year but as of half way through this year it is way behind the completion of the full spend this year.  Louth did not have an allocation for or a spend on Traveller accommodation last year but it is significantly behind its allocation for this year.  Kerry spent roughly what it was allocated for Traveller accommodation last year but as of half way through this year it has not spent any of the allocation.  In Galway City Council there was a dramatic underspend on Traveller accommodation last year; there was no spend on it in the Galway County Council despite a significant allocation and as of half way through this year the county council had not drawn anything down and the city council had drawn down a fraction of the &euro;1 million or so that was allocated.  My specific question is whether the representatives envisage their local authorities will spend all the money that was allocated this year and whether those that underspent last year will carry that over.  One of the major concerns of this committee is that year on year there are very significant underspends.  While I live in the real world and there is a large Traveller community in my constituency, I understand the complexities involved.  We are due to have Revised Estimates next week.  There has been a significant overspend in social housing and we had a significant overspend in social housing last year.  That is very welcome but there was a significant underspend on Traveller accommodation over the last three years, which is very troubling.</p></speech>

We approve up to 90% of the cost involved.  Part of the issue in Galway is the lack of private house building that is taking place.  People have loan approvals in their back pockets trying to buy a house but the lack of housing is a problem.  There are no significant delays in the recommendation process.  The decision comes back to our credit committee and we do not always agree with what the Housing Agency recommends.  There is not any delay at that end.</p><p>The student accommodation in Galway is quite significant and 1,000 student beds have recently come through, or are in the planning process with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We have a requirement for a further 1,000 beds and brownfield sites are being looked at for them, along with other proposals that are coming through.  Three strategic housing developments which involve student beds are going to the board.  Student beds will reduce pressure in the private sector which, in turn, will help social housing demand.</p><p> We have exceeded our HAP and RAS targets to date in 2018 and we will meet our targets under Rebuilding Ireland because of the work being done by the housing team, through the HAP homeless placefinder and the vacant homes officer.</p><p> I am delighted to report that we have had some success recently, with the HAP homeless placefinder service securing homes for members of the Traveller community.  There are very significant proposals in the pipeline and under discussion with the Department on new, bespoke, culturally appropriate facilities for the Traveller community, in which its members have been involved.  We are doing something relating to the C&uacute;l Tr&aacute; site in Salthill, the Carrowbrowne site on the Headford Road and on Circular Road.  They are multimillion-euro investments and the more money in the kitty for such developments, the better.  We do not underestimate the difficulties we have had in trying to convince our elected members to support this or in dealing with the concerns of the wider community.  We understand, appreciate and value the needs of the Traveller community and that is why we have formulated the proposals about which we are currently talking to the Department.</p></speech>

The amount for the work we are doing is &euro;6.4 million and we would welcome more.  If there is some left over we would like it to be passed on as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  There has always been a gap between lists and needs.  I have been working in housing for a long time and I have seen my housing list reduce by 35%.  This is a fact that is never mentioned.  I have seen 2,500 tenancies given in the past 18 months or two years, which means decent accommodation is provided under a housebuilding lease, a 50% RAS scheme or otherwise.  We will exceed the targets for the current year, which was 251 homes while we expect to deliver maybe 300 through the buy, build and lease programmes.  We have set up a specific unit to target dereliction in villages and have assigned staff directly to the municipal districts on that.  The repair and lease scheme is exceptionally valuable for keeping life in the communities and not allowing them to disappear over time.</p></speech>

We have &euro;60 million of land loans which we are repaying from internal capital receipts and that is impacting on the spending of internal capital receipts.  We have used CPOs for vacant rural housing in limited cases, where they are required.  We are doing it for Traveller accommodation and disability needs at the moment, specifically in rural areas.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin is correct that the Rebuilding Ireland loan offers are not always what applicants are looking for and the value has been reduced.  Applicants are making multiple applications with adjoining counties and we get a good number of Dublin applicants who also apply to Meath and Fingal and may not take up a loan offer with us.</p> <p>  We have an underspend on Traveller accommodation this year.  We have particular issues where the needs have changed and where people have withdrawn their aspirations.  Traveller accommodation programmes have changed, whether this was at the review stage or at a new stage due to feuding.</p></speech>

In the context of local authority voids, has any local authority sold its stock of housing because the cost of refurbishment was excessive, or because of a lack of funding from Central Government to bring houses back into use?  Galway City Council is represented today and Deputy Anne Rabbitte was in my ear last night about the difference in the qualification thresholds for local authority housing in the city, at &euro;35,000, and the county, at &euro;25,000.  Does that have an implication for housing in Galway?  Is the homeless HAP officer in Galway city able to locate tenants in Galway county and take stock out of Galway county?  Is the gap of &euro;10,000 causing problems for tenants in the county who are trying to get accommodation in Galway city, or vice versa?</p></speech>

We have had a number of county applicants who were above the county limit but made an application to the city, which has higher income eligibility levels.  Some require HAP accommodation in the county and secure a property and have a willing landlord but they cannot enter into a HAP arrangement because they do not meet the eligibility criteria in the county so they drift to the city, where they seek to get on its waiting list with a county preference.  Our HAP placefinder officer has secured a number of properties in the county based on the individual preferences of families and of 44 tenancies to date, eight are in the county.  We have not sold any voids.</p></speech>

Funding those loans and bringing those loans on the land we can build on obviously affects the value we can achieve.

Counties Waterford and Kilkenny were also mentioned in that context.  There is another very serious development which, if it were to take hold, would have huge ramifications for democracy.  In recent years I have noted a move towards corporatism, a European idea of the 1930s that, thankfully, we eschewed in favour of democracy.  The idea is that representative groups form the ruling structures, rather than allowing a system of one person, one vote at a certain age, regardless of whether people are well educated.  This measure seems to be putting a toe in the water in respect of a wider thought process and I suspect that is all it is.  The new committee will have a mixture of elected individuals and nominees who will be nominated by the cathaoirligh.  However, we have no idea of what the constraints will be.  It is one of those selective processes where certain qualifications put a person in the "in" group in society and get them onto committees such as this.  It contrasts with being selected by one's peers, by which I mean the electorate.</p>  <p>  The proposal refers to people with experience in the provision of transport and housing, the development of infrastructure or business and trade.  I note that they will not have a vote, although that could change later.  However, they will have enormous influence, which is why they are being put there.  They would not be there if they were not going to have enormous influence.  I see the process being widened progressively to the general local authority scene because that is how the system works.  It is a big idea, but it will hit a wall if it moves forward too quickly; therefore, it will creep forward.  Nevertheless, the people involved will be given the most significant of powers, namely, the power to be involved in planning.</p>  <p>  The new group is not representative.  There will be no one on it from RAPID programme areas.  The people chosen who will be upper middle class and living in salubrious surroundings will have power over those living in less salubrious surroundings in towns, many of which are included in RAPID programme areas.  People living in housing estates bring a lot of expertise, as well as knowledge of what it is like to be at the bottom of the pile and have planning ideas imposed on them without much choice.  Urban areas by far have the biggest social problems and levels of deprivation.  Poor urban areas have the biggest drug problems because of social segregation, but the people who will be nominated will come from a certain class and not have suffered the effects of the problems mentioned.  I suggest the Minister of State looks at this matter again.  If we want good planning, we need to ensure these urban communities will be represented.  They have tended to be represented in the normal democratic way by virtue of being numerous, but the Minister is including super influencers to take away that power.</p>  <p>  The other sector that is totally being ignored is the community and voluntary sector which is of enormous importance in terms of the well-being of Irish society.  If we were to take that sector out of the communities in which we all live, they would be destroyed because a lot of what is good, positive and wholesome and gives huge satisfaction to people does not come under the heading of "It is the economy, stupid ".  That is such a trite statement because it is not all about the economy but about quality of life.</p>  <p>  While the amendments do not directly relate to Galway, they are a precursor of the new approach to local authorities.  They are putting the toe in the water for the first time in respect of a new approach that indicates to us that we cannot trust the people elected by the people and that we need to get the elite in control.  It is to state, "If we get away with this, we will keep going".  It derives from European thinking of the 1930s and we all know what happened in those years.  Thankfully, this was an ordinary plain democracy that was run by the people for the people and we avoided many of the conflicts to which the other approach led.</p></speech>

As he is running three minutes late, I ask the Minister of State to start answering the questions that were raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-06a.3351" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="11:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018120600003#B00700"><p>I will try to answer the questions raised, many of which were asked by several members.  </p>  <p>  Deputy Casey and others expressed regret that the amendments had been tabled late in the day.  I am not criticising the committee, but they all flow from a report adopted by the Government six months ago which was sent to the committee.</p> <p>I have always said there should be two committees in this area.  In the case of the four areas where boundary reviews were conducted, there was an acceptance - even taking me out of the picture, which is difficult to do - that by their nature issues in towns and cities that crossed boundaries were intractable.  It goes to the heart of the Irish identity, the connection with place, parish, community and county.  It was felt, even before I arrived in this position, that we had to look at some new structure that would allow county boundaries to remain as they were but that would also allow for the proper planning and development of cities that spilled into two local authority areas.  I do not know if there are cities that spill into three local authority areas.  The amendments deal solely with towns with a population between 1,500 and 100,000.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that things that work well in one area may not work well in another, which is a fair point.  The premise is to have a full development plan for these towns.  At present both local authorities do their own thing.  A good example was mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Broin last night.  He said there had been good co-operation since the 1950s between the authorities in Carlow town and County Laois.  With many shared services, at the end of the year a cheque is exchanged.  The local authority in Carlow is delivering services for thousands of people who live in County Laois.  It was mentioned in one of the boundary review reports, in respect of which, interestingly, there were only seven submissions received from the general public.  Deputy Eugene Murphy would know about the 20,000 plus submissions received in County Roscommon, while approximately the same number of submissions were received in my own neck of the woods.  However, only seven people living in County Laois and Carlow made submissions because the co-operation had worked, but it is non-statutory.  They also compile their own local area plans independently.  What we are looking at is providing for functions that are either not performed fully or not performed at all under the existing local government structure.  One of the key of functions functions is being provided for to deal with the inability of the system to compile a full plan for a town or a city.</p> <p> Every speaker raised this issue.  Deputy O'Dowd gave a real example in outlining why this measure or its equivalent was needed.  I emphasise that I am fully open - it will be at least two weeks before we take Report Stage - to sitting down with spokespersons and whoever else wants to attend from the different groups and the Independents to discuss the issue.  To accommmodate them, I will table my own ministerial amendments.  There is nothing underhand being done.  In every speech I have made to local authority members, the management association and in the Chamber, both on this Bill and Private Members' Bills on town councils, of which there have been a few, I have spelled out that there will be a joint structure to deal with forward planning in towns and cities.  That is what the Bill aims to achieve.  My private secretary will email all members of the joint committee - other colleagues can be brought along if they so wish - and on Tuesday of next week they can sit down with me and the officials to identify the wording or hierarchy to be used.  I believe that is what Deputy &Oacute; Broin was referring to yesterday.  </p> <p> I am acutely aware that I was attacked from all sides on Deputy Cullinane's local radio station.  It was said this was my revenge on Waterford, but nothing could be further from the truth.</p></speech>

It is a well flagged and genuine attempt to do something new to deal with the intractable boundaries problem.</p>  <p>  Let me give the final explanation as to how we arrived at this measure.  Essentially, what we are asking is that the smaller local authority give up its power to produce a local area plan.  In the case of Drogheda which was mentioned by Deputy O'Dowd, it will mean that Meath County Council will select three members, with Louth County Council.  They will adopt the local area plan for the urban area, most of which is within the boundaries of County Louth.  On the county development plan, they will not do what they did in Drogheda and resile from the joint agreement.  We can avoid the scenarios that were discussed.  It was Deputy &Oacute; Broin or someone else who raised the question of what had emerged in Cork during the years, where the county council was zoning land for housing development on the boundary between the city and the county which resulted in the creation of new settlements.  I am open to changing the amendments in whatever way we can to accommodate the concerns of members of the committee.  We will have multiple meetings in the two weeks in the lead-up to Report Stage.</p>  <p>  I will deal with a number of other specific issues.  To respond to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v comments, I am not particularly wedded to the idea of having outside people.  I emphasise for the Deputy and everybody else present that the role of the groups is to perform functions that are not performed adequately or not at all by councils.  There was no question of having council planners or planning staff included as the experts.  We were looking at the forward planning aspect.  I will have no difficulty in accepting amendments on Report Stage.  I completely accept the Deputy's idea on RAPID programme areas and about the community and voluntary sector in general.</p>  <p>  I believe I have answered most of the questions that were asked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-06a.3355" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="11:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018120600004#C00400"><p>As the Minister of State did not deal with most of my questions, please allow me to go through them again.  I fully accept that the intention behind the Bill to solve what is a particularly difficult problem, about which there is no dispute.  I also accept that the Minister of State flagged the general principle.  Nonetheless, I believe he is underestimating the concerns of committee members in the sense that we are only being given two days to consider the detail of his proposals.  There is a big difference between being given a general indication of the policy direction and flagging it and having adequate time to scrutinise the detail of proposals.  It is not that we want lots of time to scrutinise them.  The committee is incredibly flexible with all of the Minister of State's other ministerial colleagues in providing time, but because of the length of time we are being given to scrutinise the proposals, it is genuinely very tough for us.  I am still not clear on why it is that we are being given so little time.  For example, when we look at earlier amendments on the holding of plebiscites, there is a very clear rationale as to why the Minister of States needs to include them in the Bill because there is a deadline to meet in compiling the registers, etc.  Therefore, I would like to be convinced that this amendment has to be included now, rather than in a stand-alone Bill or in the Local Government Bill 2019.</p>  <p>  On the ratio of elected representatives to voters, I have still not heard an adequate explanation.  I am not making the argument that there should be exact proportionality.  If there was, those in the smaller adjoining local authority would fear that they would be swamped by those in the larger area.  I accept that it works both ways.  What I do not understand is the reason there should be a simple rigid formula of three and three elected members, with the chairpersons or mayors, as opposed to other options because there will be variations in size.  I do not know the demographics of each of the areas listed by the Minister of State, but it seems that there should be some way of thinking it through to avoid the problem he identified to me informally after the meeting, that if you give one too much weight, it will mean that nothing will be agreed.  However, I am yet be convinced on that point.</p>  <p>  The next issue concerns the process of appointment of elected members.  For example, if mine was the majority party in the two councils, is it the case that we could elect the six members?  Where would that leave the smaller parties in terms of diversity in representation?  Likewise, we must consider the geographical locations of the elected representatives.</p> <p>I have not heard the Minister of State address how we deal with that or the question about staff.  If I am reading the Bill right, the committee will decide what staff it requires from the existing local authorities.  Does that have to be approved by the chief executives of those local authorities?  Can the chief executives object?  What happens if the staff that the committee requests are already busy doing something else?  We know there are pressures across all council departments.  How will those functions be replaced within existing staff complements?</p> <p> Whatever this committee decides will have a financial implication which will have to be borne by the two local authorities.  How will that work?  What happens if there are significant disagreements over budgets, zoning or other things?  I am not saying that we should go back to the Drogheda example where local authorities are allowed to block everything.  The option the Minister of State has put on the table is not the only one and is not necessarily the clear option.</p> <p> A number of Deputies asked a reasonable question yesterday about the statutory consultative process with county development plans and local area plans.  The local authorities know which steps they have to go through.  It is not clear from this what that consultative process is.  It is certainly not clear to elected members of the councils or the public, from engagement with them.  I will go back to what I said at the start.  None of us is trying to be difficult or block the Minister of State from having a solution but in the absence of adequate time to go through all these things and be convinced that what he is proposing is the right way to fix this, many of us will be left in a position of not being able to support it today.  I understand his offer to sit down next week and come back with amendments the following week.  That is still a very tight timeframe for something that is relatively complex.  I appreciate the Minister of State and his officials have been working on it for some time but those of us who are only taking it up now have many other significant things on our schedule in these couple of weeks.  Would it not make more sense for the Minister of State to withdraw the amendment at this stage?  We will take the offer of engaging with him both immediately before and after Christmas and insert this into the local government Bill 2019.  Would that not make more sense rather than trying to shoehorn it into the 2018 Bill within a short timeframe?</p></speech>

We are all in favour of it.  We have worked positively on all legislation that has come through here.  This legislation came to us on Tuesday night and this is the first time that we have seen the detail that we are being asked to agree.  The Government introduced 71 amendments on Report Stage of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act last year.  We have to be given time.  This is a positive move but it needs to be looked at critically.  We have not had the opportunity to do that.</p>  <p>  Where does the urban area plan sit in the planning hierarchy?  It is not the national development plan, a regional plan, county plan, environs plan or local area plan.  Is it part of the county development plan or does it sit outside it, standing in its own right like some of the environs plans around the country that go through the same process as the county development plan?  Does the consultation have to follow the same procedures as those plans?  I cannot see that with the way I am reading this.  The other area I was concerned about was the land-grabbing.  Sorry, I will not call it grabbing.  There is no reference to public consultation about the initial boundary, which is in amendment No. 112.</p>  <p>  Going back to what I raised last night, the more I think about this, the stronger I become on it.  The Minister of State said we do not have the expertise and that is why we are considering bringing it in from outside.  How do we not have the expertise for our local area, county and regional plans?  The expertise at local authority level is there for all those plans and is there for these plans.  This should remain in the control of public representatives and we need to return trust on this to public representatives.  The Minister of State is saying one thing here yet we are adopting many other higher, greater plans without that cohort of people.  I do not see the logic behind it.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Brien found out last night that Bray is one of the areas in this.  I am not sure that the local authority in Bray is even aware that this is coming down the track.  Since the establishment of the municipal district, it has spent the whole time creating a municipal district plan to encompass the whole municipal district around Bray.  Now we are told that there will be another plan which will incorporate part of D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Bray will have 75% of the population and landmass with D&uacute;n Laoghaire having 25%.  We then get into the area of proportionality.  Can the smaller side control it?  I want to support this legislation.  I think it is a solution for the future but we are rushing it and mistakes will be made if we try to ram this through in the next two weeks.</p></speech>

I do not intend to get caught up in the hyperbole of this issue with regard to the commentary that will flow from this locally.  It is obviously an issue that will be contentious in Waterford and Kilkenny.  This boundary issue has been contentious for some time.  I have not been one of the politicians that has increased the temperature on the issue and I accept that we need to have a structure, process and framework in place that focuses on the needs of the people who live there and not on all the other issues that seem to gravitate around this issue, which are sometimes somewhat unhelpful.  I have no difficulty in principle with a solution being found.  The difficulty is that the solution which has been brought to the table is very late in the day in a Bill which was designed to do something else.  Notwithstanding that the Minister of State flagged up that he intended to look at a solution and mechanism such as this, the detail of it is now before us and concerns us.  I have spoken to councillors and the management in Waterford and they are concerned about the process.  They have no problem with good planning and sustainable development but they have concerns about the democratic element in this.</p>  <p>  I want the Minister of State to help me to understand how this would work in practice.  We have the example of Waterford and Kilkenny.  I understand that this urban district committee would involve the metropolitan area of Waterford city and the part of south Kilkenny that was subject to a potential boundary extension.  Approximately 45,000 live in the metropolitan part of Waterford city and approximately 7,000 live in that part of south Kilkenny, coming to approximately 52,000.  The vast majority live in Waterford, yet there are three elected representatives from Kilkenny and three from Waterford.  The Minister of State can obviously see how difficult that will be from a democratic point of view for people who live in Waterford.  They will be very concerned about that.  That just relates to the composition of it, not the people who will come from outside, as Teachta Casey mentioned.  The powers and functions that the committee will have will concern members even more.  What relationship will it have with the two councils and, specifically for me, what relationship will it have with Waterford City and County Council?  My understanding of the amendments is that they will have powers to formulate their own local area plan but will that local area plan be able to supersede area plans which have already been crafted by local authorities?  If that is the case, that creates other democratic problems in the sense that there are 32 councillors in Waterford who could formulate a plan which could then be superseded by a smaller number who are not elected to that body.  We do not know how they are appointed.</p> <p>That is going to be problematic.  The same thing applies in the case of development plans.  Will these other councillors be able to vary development plans?  If so, how will that work in practice?</p> <p> I will give a simple example of the types of practical things that need to be worked out.  If the committee of six councillors decides that under the local area plan, a road should be built somewhere entirely within its geographical area, which will include the entire area of Waterford city and the smaller area, there will be budgetary implications.  Given that the budget is decided by the councils, how will this work?  People are struggling to understand how it will work practically.  The Minister of State is correct when he says that this proposal has not gone down well in Waterford for all of these reasons.  People are not opposed to a solution, but they do not like this solution.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I think it would be better if the Minister of State were to withdraw these amendments.  I know from speaking to management personnel in Waterford City Council that they have not been consulted.  They are aware that some sort of proposition is being put on the table, but they have not been consulted on the detail.  How can we force something on local authorities when local authority management is saying it does not see how it will work?  Neither management nor councillors has been consulted.  The Minister of State has said that members of his own party in my constituency are concerned about this as well.  Strong language may have been used if emotions were running high.  They are concerned and they should be consulted.</p> <p> I suggest it would be best to withdraw these amendments at this point.  My strong advice to the Minister of State is to withdraw them and revisit them either in the 2019 Bill that has been mentioned by Deputy &Oacute; Broin or in a separate stand-alone Bill.  We need to examine this dispassionately and appropriately without jumping to conclusions.  It should be given the proper consideration.  We need to look at how it would work practically.  I am certainly up for that.  I want something that will work.  I do not believe the process that is envisaged here will work for Waterford and Kilkenny, whatever about the other areas.  A one-size-fits-all approach will not work here.  I have set out my concerns.  As I have to return to the Committee of Public Accounts, I might not be here when the Minister of State responds.  I am sure Deputy &Oacute; Broin will update me on what he says.  I thank the Chair for her indulgence.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I will have to leave the meeting.  Obviously, this Bill will take in the Monksland area, which has been controversial, as the Minister of State knows.  I have tabled questions to him on it.  I presume we will have an opportunity to discuss the matter at a later stage.</p></speech>

Many fairly specific questions have been asked.  I took all the notes last night.  It was only when Deputy &Oacute; Broin was going through his issues that I used a highlighter to highlight them.  On the time issue, it is intended, as it has been all along, that these structures will come into place when the new councils are elected.  With the best will in the world, next year's local government Bill, which will deal primarily with Galway, will not come into effect until well after the local elections.  I want to say in response to the queries of all Deputies that I am asking them not to vote down these amendments on the basis of my commitment that I will withdraw the whole lot of them if we cannot come up with something constructive in the two weeks before Report Stage.  I agree that this is substantive.  I have been buried in this issue for all of my life.  I suppose I have a unique kind of appreciation of it.  I do not want to be seen to do anything that disadvantages anyone.  I hope we can figure out some amendments within the two-week period I have mentioned.  I am willing to introduce those amendments.  If they are not agreeable, I will withdraw this section.</p>  <p>  I have not heard anyone disagreeing with the idea I am advancing.  The principal objections relate to the composition.  The problem with the composition is that a fear factor kicks in when a smaller local authority is told it will lose its power to do its local area plan.  The fear is that the larger local authority, which could dominate these committees on a proportionality basis, will just dictate in a way that brings about a boundary change by the back door.  I am not going to be dishonest to the Deputies here.  There is no attempt to suggest that it is proportional.  It is a very genuine attempt to deal with a completely intractable issue.  We all know that no county boundaries will be changed for the foreseeable future of the Oireachtas.  That is the position as far as any of us can tell.  In such circumstances, how can we use the existing structures to create something new that looks at these towns and cities in their entirety?  That is where I am coming from with this idea.</p>  <p>  The members of these committees will be elected from the local authority electoral area adjacent to the town or city.  In the case of Drogheda, for example, I understand the Drogheda urban local electoral area of the Drogheda municipal district adjoins the Laytown-Bettystown-Duleek local electoral area.</p></speech>

It will not be up to the ruling groups on the council as a whole.  It will be up to the local councillors who are elected in those areas.

My understanding of the legislation is that it proposes that the two cathaoirligh, along with the chair of the group, will be responsible for choosing the outside people, of whom there will be either two or four.  I am open to extending the backgrounds from which they might come.  I hear what members are saying.  Deputy Casey said it strongly.  He said it might seem in the cold light of day that I am trying to take powers off councillors.  Local authority representative groups have expressed support for the idea that, in certain limited circumstances, somebody from business could be involved.  In the Waterford example, it could be a representative of the traders in the middle of the city.  Business and trade has been mentioned.  There have been massive planning issues through the generations in all of these towns.  Out-of-town centres have been built and town centres have been destroyed.  That is why this provision is included.  Deputies might want it to be worded differently and that can be considered on Report Stage.  I specifically requested that these people would not have votes because that is what elected people are there to do.  I believe there is value in having in the room some people from the community background or the kind of utility background.  Maybe they should not be full members.  Maybe they should have an <i>ex officio </i>type of status.  The elected person should be the paramount person.  I have no issue with that.</p><p>I would like to respond to some of the other stuff that was raised.  Deputy Cullinane asked about the hierarchy.  Essentially, it being proposed that these groups will draw up their local area plans.  We are not throwing out the local area plan that has already been done in Bray, for example.  The next local area plan will include all of Bray, including the part of Bray that is in County Dublin.</p></speech>

One of the amendments - I cannot remember which one - refers to the contiguous areas beside these urban areas.  It will be a matter for each group to decide whether rural areas should be included.  We are giving them the freedom to make that choice.  It may be the case that a one-size-fits-all approach would not work.  It might apply in Bray and it might not apply in Waterford, or <i>vice versa</i>.  We are not prescriptive.  The existing statutory provisions for the drawing up of local area plans are being retained.  We are not changing a word of the consultation questions that are asked, or of the engagement with the public.</p> <p>That all has to be done the same.  I do not accept the argument about staff.  The staff in the local authorities are doing these local area plans anyway.  In this instance we are talking about staff being effectively seconded.  They are not going to be body corporate.  They will not have separate budgets.  The staff that currently do the local area plans in both local authorities will do it together for the whole town.  That is the thinking behind the proposal.  There will not be that cost as it is being borne by the local authorities anyway.  Rather than having two plans, we just want to have one area plan that will make sense of both areas together.</p> <p> Deputy Cullinane referred to budget implications in planning for funding, but this is already the case.  If a road is proposed in one of these areas that crosses the boundary from Meath, for example, into Louth, there are a number of mechanisms they can use.  Both local authorities can apply separately or there can be a lead authority if they agree this is a measure they want to do.  Those mechanisms will remain in place.</p></speech>

The genuine concerns he raised around formalising synergy, shared interests, works programmes and goals between areas that cross county boundaries make absolute sense.  I could argue about the composition, and I will, but we also need to get the sequencing right.  There is a lot of additional work.  We have covered many of the points, including during last night's meeting, but this proposal needs a review period.  If we are to do it, then a review period needs to be formally built into it.  If the idea is to be rolled out to eight areas and if it works, there are more areas it could also go to.  I had mentioned some areas to the Minister of State at yesterday's discussion.  I have concerns around the timing but I take the Minister of State's point that the report was agreed by Government and laid before the committee.</p>  <p>  I and my party want to be reasonable in how we approach this.  I could agree that we would go to the next stage but, if I am not happy, as the spokesperson for my party, I reserve the right to table amendments on Report Stage to withdraw these sections in their entirety.  I would do that because I absolutely agree with the concept.  I have seen the issues in local authorities across the State and in my own local authority.  We need that level of formalisation.  We would have worked with the Minister of State through the process if I had known about it, but it was not on my radar and I do not believe it was on the radar of any of my colleagues that this was coming down the track.  There is more in the Bill that I agree with than I disagree with.</p>  <p>  In the context of being constructive on these sections, I agree with Deputy Casey that the membership of the urban district committees should be for elected members.  I feel very strongly about this.  I have no issue in consulting such a consultative committee, which is useful, and I have been involved in consultative committees in the D&aacute;il and in local authorities with interested groups of people.  They were not from elite or exclusive communities.  They were from the whole community.  That is what I am interested in, as are all of us.  The proportionality piece needs to be dealt with along with how the members of the body are selected.  We need to get under the bonnet a little bit more on this, so to speak.  I am happy to engage with the Minister of State from Tuesday.</p>  <p>  I and my party colleagues have been working through this Bill since yesterday to put forward the changes we would like to see.  As I said yesterday, there are some issues with it but I will assent to letting it go to Report Stage.  Following these discussions, however, if I am not happy that issues are being addressed, I will reserve the right to vote to remove these sections on Report Stage by way of amendment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-06a.3376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018120600007#F00400"><p>I apologise for being late to the meeting and I thank the Chairman for allowing me to contribute.  I did not hear a lot of what has happened but I am not out of sympathy with what I have heard so far.</p>  <p>  Consider the Drogheda-east Meath experience.  I referred yesterday to the controversy that arose there between the two statutory authorities having agreed a plan but which did not have statutory powers.  The local council overrode that plan.  As a result, green belts were no longer green belts, areas that had not been zoned for housing were then zoned, X had land zoned by the county council plan and then it turned out that Y was a beneficiary with regard to zoning.  What we are talking about, when one gets down to it, is green belt planning, recreation and amenity planning and zoning.  Those are the three issues that have to be transparent, accountable and above board in every respect.</p>  <p>  I read through the minutes of Meath County Council and I went back years to look at what was going on.  Perhaps some people in the Department may have read them also.  The point now is what the Department is proposing to do.  Take Drogheda as a model.  Drogheda would have three members on the new body and Laytown-Bettystown would have three members.  I do not have a difficulty with that.  It is a very good thing that they talk to each other because people in one area might have recreational amenities, for example, the Laytown beaches and so on, and the people in those areas may come into Drogheda for their hospitals or education.  That is a good synergy.  My question is around the county development plan, the zoning issues and the green belt issues.  If, as arose before, the county council's view is that the green belt should be from A to B, and if this new committee says the opposite, who is the authority on that planning decision?  I believe this is at the heart of the matter.</p>  <p>  One of the key problems was illustrated when a group of developers understood from meetings with key people, which were well documented, that they would have zoning for X and they did not get it.  This was one of the rows that happened.  I and everybody else wants this never to happen again.  We need transparency, accountability and a direct line of accountability, with input from wherever it should come from.  There must be authoritative, definitive and proper planning in terms of green belt areas, and in recreation and amenity.  This is very important.  Otherwise we might find vast areas of land rezoned for housing, with no proper amenities put in place.  There are a substantial number of houses with very few amenities in the east Meath region.  It was done the wrong way.  That is being addressed now but I am conscious that this could happen again.  Perhaps the Minister of State could come back on those points.</p></speech>

I am of a similar view to Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  If the Minister of State is willing to sit down with us on the basis of what he has just outlined, that is a reasonable proposition that we could support.</p>  <p>  I will sound a word of caution, which I am sure is also going through the heads of the officials even though they may not be able to say it officially.</p></speech>

We are setting ourselves a very difficult task to tease through this stuff within a week to consider amendments and have staff draft amendments.  I am agreeing to this but I am also saying that I am not so sure, even with the best will in the world from everybody, that we will able to do this right.  We may have to review it, which is being eminently reasonable.  The Minister of State still has not answered a range of the questions, but given that we will meet about this again, perhaps the best way to do it would be as an informal working group.  We could set a couple of hours aside next week to tease this out without the formality of an open committee hearing.  This is the way for us to do this.  I would like to see that meeting happening next week.</p></speech>

I am sure that everyone inside the room is very clear on this, but just so nobody outside the room misunderstands, I want to be very clear that I am not supporting the four amendments as they stand.  While I will not object to them today, it will be to facilitate that process as outlined and in recognition that the Minister of State is willing to work with us on it.</p></speech>

I am still not fully clear at what level this new urban area plan is going to be and who adopts it at the end of the day.</p> <p>If it is a local area plan which sits under the county development plan, it goes for only one period of public consultation and is then adopted.  An environs plan is like a county plan.  The variations are made and it is put on public display again.  If I knew what the process was, it would probably put my mind at ease somewhat.</p> <p> I return to the composition of the proposed committee.  If I was elected to Bray Town Council and if I was, unfortunately, not one of the three elected to this new committee, I would have no say in how my town develops.  In order for this to work, all the municipal district members should be on the committee.  We can adopt county development plans with 50 councillors and there is nothing to stop us adopting this plan with the full complement of municipal district councillors.  What is the point in being elected for Bray council if I end up having no say on the plan that will direct the town for the next number of years?  If I was a Bray council public representative who was not on the committee, and if the plan I had adopted was superseded by this plan, in which I have no input to adopt, amend or anything else, I would feel rather left out of the whole process.</p></speech>

In Deputy O'Dowd's absence we used his example of the two local authorities subsequently walking away from an agreed plan.  He outlined the issue well.  It is often the case that a larger town is in one location while a smaller one is, say, on another side of a bridge, but much of the recreational space for the larger town is on the other side of the bridge and there is no input across the boundary.</p>  <p>  We will not be in a position to ensure every councillor and adjoining district will be on the plan.</p></speech>

We can insert a reference to the fact that the members of staff who will draw up the local area plans will be selected from the two authorities.  To use Waterford as an example, most of the staff are planning officials from Waterford City and County Council and there are one or two from Kilkenny.  That reference might be a method of trying to deal with some of the imbalance questions.  The principle of parity at political level is not proportionate but it is essential if we are to avoid the trench warfare that has surrounded boundary questions.  We can insert an amendment that requires the staff composition to follow the population.  Most of us have been members of local authorities and we know the planning section draws up-----</p></speech>

To follow on from points made by Deputies Casey and &Oacute; Broin, letting the Bill as amended pass this Stage does not mean we support its amendments.  We have articulated some serious concerns, omissions and matters we might consider further.  We will allow it to progress but we reserve the right to table amendments should we wish.  As Deputy Casey said in the context of the composition of membership, I hope we can work on that without the door closing.  There are different ideas and we can work through them on Tuesday.</p></speech>

If something were to happen to an appointed joint chief executive officer, therefore, another could be appointed.</p><p>The section seeks to put in place one chief executive with responsibility for both local authorities in Galway.  It arises out of a Government decision taken a number of months ago and will allow for a limited amount of administrative integration.  It does not at this stage diminish the legal position of either local authority.  The scheduled 2019 local elections will be held by the two existing authorities as currently constituted with two separate plenary councils.  The decision to progress preliminary work to set out the basis for a future merger arises from the work of the independent Galway local government committee, which unanimously recommended the establishment of a new unified Galway authority rather than boundary alteration or retention of the <i>status quo </i>in the local authority areas in Galway.</p> <p>The group concluded this would maximise the potential of the region to maintain, secure and grow a sustainable economic base into the future, combining the respective strengths of the two existing authorities in terms of resources, staff and expertise.</p> <p> A subsequent expert advisory group was established in December 2016 to carry out further detailed examination and planning arising from the 2015 recommendation.  The group endorsed and confirmed the recommendation in 2015 of the Galway local government review committee report for amalgamation between the city and county councils, and stated this is now all the more urgent in order to capitalise on the funding opportunities under the national planning framework and the capital programme, and to have the capacity to engage in activity such as capital development funded by borrowings.  The group was unanimous in its view that amalgamation is required to drive the development of Galway in the context of its regional, national and international remit.  Other key specific recommendations include the caveat that any amalgamation must be preceded by addressing noted deficiencies in both human and financial resources, and a need to strengthen the structure of municipal districts so their full potential is explored and resourced.  Work is under way on this issue in a specific way for Galway and in a general way via the report on municipal governance for districts, towns and local electoral areas, which is with the joint committee at present.  I met on a couple of occasions the Galway Oireachtas Members, and I thank them for that.  A full debate on the proposed merger will be possible when the merger legislation is brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas in 2019.</p></speech>

I have been speaking at length with my colleagues in Galway city and county councils, who are very concerned, and I want to relay those concerns to the Minister of State and let him know where we stand.  I am being given the impression there is not a great level of enthusiasm or even public engagement in Galway city or county for the merger proposition.  Unlike Cork, where there was a lively and at times heated exchange which led to the majority view that has since emerged in the legislation, I am being given the impression that is not the case in the first instance in Galway.  Notwithstanding the very strong recommendations of the expert group, the public engagement has been limited.</p>  <p>  It is also clear there has not been the same level of political majority support for the proposition that was eventually hammered out in Cork.  I appreciate these things are complicated and very difficult but, for example, nobody bar one Deputy came in here to express any fundamental objection to the Cork elements of this Bill, although some had concerns with the detail.  I have met delegations of city and county councillors from Cork, as they met all of the housing spokespeople, and I have a sense of where they were at.  Clearly, the situation in Galway is not at the same stage, and I want to put that on record.  Given all of this, why is it that we have one element of the Galway merger in a Bill that is essentially about Cork, when there will be another Bill about Galway early next year?  It would surely have been better to have it all in the one Bill after reaching at least some degree of majority view of the elected members of those constituencies.  I do not understand the timing and sequencing.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State said, the issue of finances is central, and the Galway members will be speaking on this at greater length.  If the finances are crucial and if they have not been resolved, it adds even further to the question of why we should be pressing ahead with the Galway element now.  As somebody who is neutral on this, given it is up to the good people of Galway to decide how these things should run, I do not understand it.  Unless the Minister of State gives me very good answers to those questions, I am left in the position of saying this needs to be taken out of the Bill at this stage.  That does not mean I am opposed to or in favour of the merger, but that it would be better to deal with it in a comprehensive Bill.  Otherwise, it gives the impression that it is notwithstanding public disinterest - the Galway Deputies can correct me if I am wrong on that - and political concern in the Opposition that we are pressing ahead with this.  As a Deputy from outside the city and county of Galway who does not know the detail, that is not something I could support at this stage.</p></speech>

What guides me in the first place is the report published by the expert group.  The report and the letter accompanying it, and the press release issued by the expert group, were clear that, prior to any decision, it is the underlying money issue, not the money for the merger, particularly in Galway County Council but also in Galway City Council, that should be addressed.  The covering letter states: &quot;It is well recognised by the Expert Advisory Group and local government arrangements in Galway that the funding available to the two local authorities in Galway was inadequate&quot;.  The press release stated that the recommended amalgamation must be preceded by addressing efficiency in both human and financial resources as noted by the group.  The report states:</p><blockquote>The Group notes the significant revenue underfunding of the Galway local authorities relative to comparators, in addition to staffing constraints in key areas.  On the basis that the existing resources available to both organisations are not commensurate with realising the vision of an effective amalgamated authority, the Expert Advisory Group recommends that the existing deficiencies in respect of both the human and financial resources be expeditiously resolved as an essential prerequisite to the amalgamation process.</blockquote><p>What I keep saying again and again is that we have to sort the underlying money first.  We have had discussions but the discussions related to a small amount of money that was to be given as part of the merger process, which we would have got anyway, even if we were well funded.  It had nothing with regard to dealing with the underlying financial issue that the experts who were appointed by the Department set as a prerequisite and a prelude.</p><p>There is a second issue of concern.  This seems like a pre-emptive move to decide that merger is the way forward.  Again, we need to look at what happened in Cork.  I understand the recommendation in Cork was for merger but, when it was looked at in a much wider context by a small expert group, and when all the implications were taken into account, it was decided that there would not be a merger but there would be a boundary extension.</p><p>We have submitted a document where we list out the unknowns we need answers to before we could consider this matter further.  Obviously, the first unknown is that we need to have the money on the table but, after that, there are a whole series of other questions on which we need clarification.  Then, we could talk to the public, and to all the interests within the public, from Inishbofin all the way over to Ballinasloe, and from Crusheen on the Galway-Clare border up north, where I live myself, to Dunmore and Glinsk, and all of these areas that are miles away, and then make an informed decision.  These are very practical issues because policy cannot be decided without going in detail through the outworking of how this might work.</p><p>I suggest the Minister of State withdraw this section and find some way to interact with the elected members for Galway, that is, the Oireachtas Members but also the local authority members of both the city and county councils, in order to deal with all these issues.  In that way, we will all come to an informed decision as to what is best not only for Galway city, which is very important, but also for all the people living on the offshore islands, right across the county to the plains of east Galway, where the food we eat is produced.</p> <p> We need to have this debate first.  It seems to me that the Minister is putting the cart before the horse.  We need to take the horse around from the back and hitch it to the front of the cart.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-06a.3413" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="12:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPS2018120600010#J00200"><p>The Minister of State is probably tired of listening to me but I am not going to change my approach.  My approach is based on the fact that I have read all three reports, on my experience as a city councillor for 17 years and on my knowledge that bigger is not better.</p><p>The Minister of State is taking one aspect of the report, the recommendation of the proposed amalgamation and ignoring all the other points outlined by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  The city and county councils are underfunded, under-resourced and do not have enough staff.  Notwithstanding all that, there is a very generous acknowledgement that both local authorities work very well together and they share resources.  Nowhere in this documentation does it jump out that the greatest challenge is the fact that we have two local authorities.  What jumps out is lack of staff, lack of money and the serious problems with regard to housing, transport and so on.  This is not the result of having two local authorities but the direct result of a failure on the part of local authorities at one level and a bigger failure on the part of the Government to ensure funding for housing and providing sustainable transport.  These are the important issues in Galway not a diversion in relation to a proposed amalgamation.</p><p>The report is not consistent.  It refers to the serious lack of staff and then it states the same staff being united and being an enviable resource to any organisation.  It talks about a condition precedent, which has been clearly articulated by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  We need the money and the staff.  The challenge in Galway is money and staff, not amalgamation, but that has not been addressed.  I do not like saying give us the money first, but I would like a recognition by the expert group of a lack of resources and a lack of staff.  That must be dealt with first.</p><p>The expert group also talks about increasing the range of services provided by the local authorities, but the Minister of State has not mentioned any of those.  I have just come from the Committee of Public Accounts and over and over we see that amalgamations have lead to significant problems without proper planning.  We articulate what the taxpayer picks up after the event.  The ETB is the latest example of that.  The ETBs in their accounts have highlighted that they do not have enough resources for the internal audit.  Can one imagine that?  They highlight that the computers and the IT is not suitable.  Five years on from the amalgamation, it is a mess.</p><p>The local ETB has confirmed that to us and it is no reflection on the staff.  They are struggling with a merger that went through without any planning whatsoever, with no anticipation of what could happen and five years later, we are seeing the direct effects of that at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  This is costing a lot of money and is burden on the taxpayer.</p><p>I will now talk about County Galway.  I worked in Ballinasloe for many years in a different capacity so I am very familiar with the town and its hinterland.  Galway goes from the Aran Islands to Portumna and Ahascragh.  The Aran Islands are Irish speaking while in Inish Boffin, which is further north, they speak English.</p><p>It is totally wrong to say we need a city to drive the development of the county.  That is a false concept that is not based on reality.  The initial report of November 2015 stated that from the outset, the committee noticed a distinct lack of vision, planning and resource allocation by key stakeholders in regard to the need to revitalise towns throughout the county.  I have no idea where the committee got that idea.  My colleagues, Deputy<b></b>&Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Grealish, have repeatedly talked about the rural areas dying on their feet for lack of investment.  Ballinasloe has a harbour and a railway station and it is going under.  It makes no sense that it should be going under.  It could be a feeder town for Galway with sustainable transport.  The proposed plan would make the situation worse.</p><p>Even if I am incorrect, I can see no reason the committee want to go ahead with its plan now.  There is no <i>bona fides</i>in what it is proposing to do.  The correct thing would be to bring forward a proper Bill with all the elements that we can discuss and look at.  Well over 90% of all elected Deputies and councillors said &quot;No&quot; to this proposal.  As far as I know, the vast majority engaged in the process.  I certainly did, but was horrified the process was held in a hotel.  I was horrified by the lack of Irish spoken and I was not over impressed by the expertise.  Be that as it may, we now have the reports.  The Minister is ignoring the content of the reports.  I will be pressing my amendment.</p></speech>

I would have liked to have been able to have come into the D&aacute;il and to this meeting and said that I supported this Bill because it is the future for Galway.  It is not, it is ill thought out and it is being rushed.  Proper debate and discussion has not taken place.  The Minister of State has to listen to the politicians from Galway.  We are elected by the people of Galway.  We are on the ground and hear what is happening on the ground.  There are a total of 57 councillors, with only three supporting this merger.</p>  <p>  I request the Minister of State to come to a meeting of Galway County Council and a meeting of Galway City Council and sit in both Chambers with councillors.  I want the Minister of State to give a commitment that he will do that and will listen to the councillors.  They should have a say in this also.  I firmly believe that Galway County Council is being deliberately starved of funds by the Department to force it to agree to a merger.  I am not going to repeat what I said in the D&aacute;il when this was debated.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, said recently that if Galway were to receive the proper level of funding on a par with any local authority, it should be getting an extra &euro;70 million.  We would require an additional &euro;70 million to bring us up to par with other local authorities.</p>  <p>  Galway is at the bottom of the list in respect of the local property tax.  I have been told it will come up the list in the review but I do not want to be told we will be number five in the review of the property.  I want to know exactly what funding will be put in place.  I do not want to vote for a Bill that I will regret in four or five years' time when I see the results of no proper planning and debate.  That includes the elected representatives in Galway also.  I want to know exactly to the penny what funding will be put in place if this happens without the support of all elected representatives from Galway, both local and national, which I think would be very wrong.  It would be very wrong to railroad this Bill through without the political support of the vast majority of the Oireachtas Members and the county councillors.  If one wants this to work and to merge both city and county and have the two chambers coming together, one needs them to support the Bill, and not be against it.</p> <p>I support my colleagues, Deputies Connolly and &Oacute; C&uacute;iv, and the amendment and ask that all reference to Galway is withdrawn from this Bill.  Let the Cork Bill go through.  There is support for the Cork Bill in the Chamber.  I compliment Deputy &Oacute; Broin for listening to us and to our concerns.  He came in here with an open mind.  He has not given a commitment as to what he will do but he has listened to the debate and he will make a decision.  I ask the Minister of State to take Galway out of the Bill.  Let us have a full and proper debate and not appoint a chief executive.  Once that chief executive is appointed for both the city and county, the train will have left the station and will be heading down the railway line and we will not be able to stop it.</p> <p> I support Deputies &Oacute; C&uacute;iv and Connolly and all the councillors in Galway who are of the same view.  I have not heard Deputy Rabbitte's contribution yet but I hope she will support us.  I know Deputy Fitzmaurice has great reservations.</p> <p> Take Galway out of the Bill.  Let us bring in a new Bill in the new year to deal with the appointment of a new chief executive, with the funding, with the merger and with the issues that go one from one end of the county to the other.  That is all I ask of the Minister of State.  I ask that all Oireachtas Members support us on this.</p></speech>

I will be brief in my contribution.  I did not speak on this Bill in the Chamber.  However, I attended all the consultations held in Galway.  I do not like to come under the shadow of anybody, and certainly not under the shadow of Cork.  I would like us to have our own entity, to be out on our own and to have a proper debate and discussion.  We owe it to the citizens of Galway, to our elected representatives, namely, the councillors, and to the Oireachtas Members.  Having us included here is not good enough for the people of Galway.  I reject the idea that this should be allowed to happen.</p>  <p>   Deputy Grealish has put it correctly.  "Starved" is the word we would use in terms of what has happened to Galway.  It has been starved of funding for years.  It is going on since 1996.  We were very fortunate to meet Department officials earlier this year.  They were wonderful in explaining to us the breakdown in terms of where it went wrong.  There were 530 separate accounts all rolled into a number of accounts.  Everything got pulled in together.  The trouble was that when that happened, we saw Mayo take the lead ahead of us and we got left behind.  When one looked at Galway and at Mayo, the only thing that was different was a Taoiseach.  Let us call a spade a spade here.  That was when we started to unravel, and I am not afraid to say it.  We are underfunded, under-resourced and do not have enough staff.  That is what keeps jumping out in the report.  Professor Eoin O'Sullivan did a very comprehensive report.</p>  <p>  Deputy Grealish is right.  He has never heard me say whether I am for or against the merger, and I will still not say.  I will say that we need to get our ducks in a row.  We need to fund the council and put a proper strategy in place.  I live in Portumna and when this strategy was being drawn up, I asked if they could put us in with North Tipperary because we would be far better off.  Galway is made up of three counties in one.  There is the east, the west and the city.  We are poles apart.  What Deputies &Oacute; C&uacute;iv and Connolly talk about is totally different from what I experience in Portumna, Gort, Athenry and Tuam.  Having us all under the one remit, scares the living dickens out of councillors, such as Ivan Canning in Portumna.  He reckons no money will ever make it to Portumna.  He is probably right.  I am not going to rule that out, however.  I keep saying to the Minister of State that I have an open mind on the whole concept.  Unless I see funding going to councillors and unless we start with the money, I will have a serious reservation on it.  I will doubledown until I see a commitment on money.</p>  <p>  My last request is to take Galway out of the Bill and give it its own entity and allow us to have a proper debate in the Chamber.  I want to work with the Minister of State not against him.</p></speech>

I will keep this brief because apart from being a Rossy, there is no point in repeating everything that has said.  However, I represent a Roscommon-Galway constituency.  I agree with everything that has been said by Deputes &Oacute; C&uacute;iv, Connolly, Grealish and Rabbitte.  The reality is that Galway city and county are fantastic.  They have fantastic communities and a fantastic identities.  What has been going on for years is dragging down the city and the county.  Within months of being elected in 2016, the issue of how bad the finances were was brought to my attention by a number of councillors and I attended a number of meetings.  We really need to get this right, as the other speakers have said, and we need a proper discussion.</p>  <p>  Ballinalsoe is less than 40 minutes on a motorway from Galway city.  It feels so left out.  We could make this fantastic.  There could be so much more done with Ballinalsoe.  Galway city is bursting at the seams in so many areas and yet one has these great communities who want more in their area.  They are prepared to work for it and with their politicians to make it happen.</p>  <p>  I would really like for us to have a proper discussion and not rush this through.  I can assure members that if it is rushed through, it will not work.  We will have problem after problem in the city and county if we get it wrong.  Now is the time to get it right.  We need to give it time and to do the right thing.</p></speech>

There was no one in support of it.  The city councillors wished to extend the boundary.  The county councillors were, and remain, completely of a different view.  The same goes for Oireachtas Members.  It has been a process that has gone over a number of years.</p>  <p>  There is nothing rushed about this section which talks about the appointment of a joint chief executive.  The process in question in Galway has been going on for about four years.  The process has not been rushed.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge what numerous contributors said about Galway having its own Bill.  Galway should, and will, have its own Bill in the new year.  The 2019 local government Bill will be a reverse of this.  It will be principally about Galway.  There will be other local government matters, including the urban areas committees, if we do not reach agreement on them, contained in it.  Local government Bills tend to be like that.  The reason this section is included is that in the areas where mergers have happened - for example, in Waterford, Limerick and Tipperary - the first thing that happened was the appointment of a joint chief executive.  I will point out that in Galway until the mid-1980s, there was one county or city manager for the two positions.  It is still the case in some local authorities that people are covering two different areas.  In and of itself, having a joint manager is not a merger.  It is, however, a stepping stone on the road towards a merger.  I am not going to deny that.</p>  <p>  I will return to the chronological order in which questions were asked.  Deputy &Oacute; C&uacute;iv said that the financial resources must be resolved prior to merger and I am not resiling from that at all.  We need to resolve them prior to merger.</p> <p>I will go into some detail about extra resources.  The Deputy is correct that a lot would have been provided in the event of a merger.  Following on from the meetings that have taken place with Galway Members and Deputies Darragh O'Brien and &Oacute; Broin, I reiterate that there will be additional funding built in for the county council which historically was the fourth or fifth most underfunded council in the country.  From the start 18 months ago when I was appointed to this position, Galway councillors were lobbying me.  I do not accept for one minute that I have not engaged, although I have not gone to Galway.  Deputy Grealish should note that well in advance of the Galway Bill I will have a full exchange with Galway city and county representatives.  That is the right approach to adopt.  I understand it did not happen in the case of other mergers, but it is actually the right thing to do and I have no problem in doing it.  I have had plenty of engagement with the Oireachtas Members and councillors, formally and informally, in the past 18 months.  I will not be withdrawing the section because what we are dealing with is not the Galway merger <i>per se</i>.  It is a stepping stone on the road to it and I am not denying or seeking to move away from it.  I agree absolutely that the issue of finance has to be resolved and that a road map towards permanent resolution has to be in place before the nitty gritty of a merger can be dealt with.<br/><br/>I was struck by the Deputy Grealish's comments.  I was not in my current position and was in a position like that of the Deputy when the council mergers happened in other areas.  There is no necessity for the two councils, the two chambers, to merge.  I am familiar with the position in one of the boroughs in London, Richmond upon Thames.  South London-----</p></speech>

I am not trying to open it up to too much in toing and froing.  If I had been making the mergers when they happened a number of years ago, I believe there would have been a certain logic to having what I am talking about, particularly because of the historical factor.  </p>  <p>  Deputy Grealish raised with me before the position of mayor of Galway city.  I believe we can accommodate it, notwithstanding the fact that there is going to be a plebiscite to have a directly elected head of the local authority.  There is, however, a civic function for the city mayor.  When the Bill is put in place, I hope we will be in a position to fully incorporate it.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Connolly's comments, I do not think I put myself right the other evening.  Although I have lived in a city for six or seven years, I come from a part of Kilkenny with a more sparse population than the wildest part of west Galway.  There are 20,000 acres of State forestry at the back of my home.  It is a really rural place.  Despite the fact that Kilkenny is in the east, people believe it is lovely and has a huge population.  There are parts of every county with a sparse population.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that rural areas do not need cities to survive or develop, but that is not the point I was trying to make yesterday.  The point I was trying to make was that when the local government structure was established under the Local Government Act 1898, the interdependence of Ballinasloe and the area to Clifden was not what it is today.  There were some people from Clifden who might never have been in Ballinasloe.  That was the Ireland of 120 years ago.  It is a fact, notwithstanding that the towns might have been in the one county.  Now the world of business and politics has changed.  I am very familiar with Ballinasloe.  Part of the influence is the change in people&rsquo;s behaviour in terms of retail and employment.  As jobs have moved and people&rsquo;s purchasing has moved out of the town of Ballinasloe, a trend is evident that is seen all over the country, but that does not mean that we cannot have new strategies or development plans for the rejuvenation of towns such as Ballinasloe.  It has happened in other parts.  The deadest town in my county in my lifetime has been Castlecomer.  The coal mines closed in the 1960s.  The late Jim Gibbons delivered mills for textile manufacturing, but they closed about 20 years ago.  There was nothing in the place.  Through a combination of the local authority, private enterprise and a few local leaders, the town of Castlecomer has been completely transformed.  The biggest visitor centre that is not an historical monument in the south east is Castlecomer Discovery Park on the edge of the town.  The physical appearance of the town has been improved greatly with grants from what would have been Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s Department in the past, the Department of Rural and Community Affairs, at which the Minister is Deputy Ring.  We cannot freeze the towns in aspic in the belief that what worked in the past will work in the future.  This is about trying to understand-----</p></speech>

One will see from my colleagues in Galway that there are genuine concerns, particularly about funding.  The historical issues are well known.  The issues in Galway deserve a full and proper debate.  We will have a separate Bill on any future merger and my party will reserve its position on it until it is published.  I ask the Minister of State to engage more directly and intensively with the Deputies from Galway, from all parties and none, on their specific concerns, particularly about funding which is the fundamental issue.  There are synergies to be achieved, but we will wait to see the Bill on the merger.  At this stage, what we are talking about is the chief executive function and there being one chief executive.  We are not discussing the merger of the authorities in Galway.  When we do, we will certainly be considering the matter in great detail.  As he knows, I have approached the Minister of State on the issue of funding.  He has given some additional funds and made some commitments, but I ask him to engage with other Members.

I say to those who are not members of the committee that we are really keen to have the Bill finished today.  I will certainly be calling for a vote in opposition to the section, but I ask the Members from Galway, to whom I know that this issue is very important, to allow the committee to proceed with the rest of the business because we have to give up the room in 20 minutes.</p></speech>

Furthermore, it gives the game away in one important national aspect.

I would like to bring forward an amendment to that effect on Report Stage.  I will also bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to subsection (7) of the new section dealing with the annual contribution by the city council to the county council, inserted by amendment No. 71, in the context of Cork.
