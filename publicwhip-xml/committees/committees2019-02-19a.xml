    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-19a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sin&eacute;ad McPhillips" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019021900002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to brief the committee on the latest position in respect of the beef sector and Food Wise 2025.</p> <p>  The agrifood sector is Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous industry, accounting for 7.8% of modified gross national income, 7.9% of employment and 11.1% of merchandise exports.  According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, the estimated output value of the beef sector at farm level in 2018 was almost &euro;2.4 billion.  Last year agrifood sector exports totalled &euro;13.6 billion.  Irish food is produced by thousands of farmers, fishermen and agrifood companies around the country and this locally produced food is exported to more than 180 countries worldwide.  In 2018, beef exports were valued at &euro;2.4 billion.</p> <p>  I am conscious that the past year has been difficult for the beef sector, particularly in terms of unprecedented weather events, which resulted in increased input costs due to fodder shortages.  The Department is deeply committed to fully supporting and developing Ireland&rsquo;s beef sector.</p> <p>  One of the unique strengths of the agrifood sector as a whole has been the shared vision for the sustainable development of the sector in Food Wise 2025.  It is crucial that we all continue to work together to address the challenges facing the sector.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, at meetings of the beef round table, has highlighted the need for stakeholders to recognise their interdependency, to support the sector through efforts to add value and to increase the strength of all links in the supply chain. </p> <p>  Officials in the Department are currently engaging extensively with stakeholders regarding beef producer organisations which have strong potential to help strengthen the position of the primary producer in the supply chain. </p> <p>  The Department is also engaging with the Directorate General of Agriculture and Rural Development and with stakeholders in giving consideration to the possible development of geographical indication, GI, status for Irish beef.</p> <p>  The Minister has also made considerable efforts towards facilitating and developing the live export trade, including leading a trade delegation to Turkey last year.  The live trade will again be a focus of efforts in 2019. </p> <p>  I know the committee has had briefings from colleagues in the Department on Brexit impacts and preparedness as part of the whole-of-Government Brexit preparations.  Brexit poses enormous challenges for the agrifood and fisheries sectors, and for the beef sector in particular.  Almost half of our beef exports, by both value and volume, go to the UK market, accounting for almost &euro;1.2 billion of exports in 2017.  In a worst case, no-deal scenario, tariff and non-tariff barriers, sterling volatility, potentially transport delays and additional overheads would all impact significantly on the competitiveness of Irish beef exports to the UK. </p> <p>  In stepping up to the challenges posed by Brexit, the implementation of the Food Wise 2025 strategic recommendations seems more relevant than ever.</p><p>Food Wise 2025, the ten-year strategy for the agrifood sector, includes more than 400 detailed recommendations, spread across the cross-cutting themes of environmental sustainability, market development, competitiveness, innovation and human capital, as well as specific recommendations for key sectors including beef.  The strategy suggested that ambitious growth projections for the value of the sector were achievable if the recommendations were implemented, for example, projecting an increase of 85% in the total value of exports to &euro;19 billion, and an increase of 23,000 in direct and indirect employment, by 2025.  I should stress that these projections did not include volume growth targets. <br/><br/>Food Wise 2025 implementation is very much a live and continuously updated process.  The Minister chairs the high level implementation committee, HLIC, involving senior officials from relevant Departments and State agencies.  The committee meets seven times annually to review progress, as well as engaging with stakeholders on key sectoral issues.  The meat sector is discussed in detail at the HLIC on a regular basis. <br/><br/>A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, SWOT, analysis was undertaken for each sector and published as part of the Food Wise 2025 strategy in 2015.  This SWOT fed into the actions for beef, and across the wider themes of Food Wise 2025, which are updated quarterly and reported to the Minister through the HLIC. <br/><br/>The beef sector SWOT illustrates the strengths<b></b>of the sector as one of our most important indigenous industries.  The strong reputation of Irish grass fed beef production, our welfare friendly production system, our cattle and beef traceability systems, and Origin Green&rsquo;s sustainable quality assurance scheme, support our strong reputation in traditional markets.<b></b>Opportunities for the sector were identified in the global growth in protein demand and the possibility for expansion into new markets, building on the reputation and quality of our beef.  In addition, the use of beef genomics, breeding indices and sexed semen were identified as opportunities to address beef quality from the dairy herd and improve technical efficiencies in the suckler herd.<b></b>Weaknesses were also identified in the sector, including structural issues, low profitability, the sector&rsquo;s dependence on direct payments and dependency on the UK market.  Threats identified by the SWOT included animal disease outbreaks, food safety incidents, raw material supply changes linked to dairy expansion, and the possible threats linked to new trade deals and CAP reform. <br/><br/>I will now outline how the issues raised in the beef SWOT have been addressed across the five cross-cutting themes of Food Wise 2025.  Market development identifies the need to ensure that food exports are targeted at the right markets, and at the right segments within these markets.  Opening and developing new markets is a key part of the Government's response to the uncertainties arising from Brexit, and is particularly important for beef exports.  The opening of the Chinese beef market, following a huge effort by Team Ireland over a number of years, presents an excellent opportunity for the beef sector from farmers right through to processors. <br/><br/>In 2018, the Minister, announced also the opening of the markets in Qatar and Kuwait to exports of Irish beef, poultry and sheepmeat; again reflecting ongoing efforts on market access and market development.  As part of the Department's action plan on intensifying international market access, a new online international market access tool was developed.  This portal provides information across some of the major export sectors of dairy, meat, seafood and live animals.  These initiatives should be of direct assistance to the beef sector.  They are consistent with the Food Wise 2025 strategy, and are all the more relevant against the background of Brexit.  The Department will keep market access efforts under review, to ensure that resources are deployed to best effect and that our efforts are focused on making real progress in priority markets. <br/><br/>Of course, ensuring the highest standards of food safety is fundamental to our industry, and particularly to our export success.  Environmental sustainability is at the heart of Food Wise<i>. </i>Ireland is one of the world&rsquo;s most efficient food producers, in terms of carbon footprint per unit of output, but under Food Wise 2025, we are implementing measures to drive down the carbon intensity of our food production even further.  Initiatives such as Bord Bia's world leading Origin Green programme, Teagasc's research on climate change and environment and the support for national and locally led environmental schemes and knowledge transfer programmes provided under the Department's rural development programme, RDP, as well as our forestry development programme, all contribute to improving the environmental, as well as the economic and social, sustainability of the sector. <br/><br/>The joint committee will be familiar with the overall climate challenge which Ireland faces.  The Minister has reiterated that every sector will need to play a part and step up to do more on climate action. <br/><br/>Food Wise 2025 identifies competitiveness as a key theme and includes a recommendation that stakeholders work to &quot;improve access to finance for agriculture, forestry and seafood producers and agri-food companies&quot; and the Department has been involved in a number of initiatives in recent years, including the agriculture cash flow loan support scheme, the Brexit loan scheme for SMEs, and the forthcoming future growth loan scheme, focused on capital investment for farmers, fisheries and SMEs.  These initiatives have also acted as a catalyst to encourage financial institutions to improve and develop new loan products for the sector.<br/><br/>Significant progress has also been made on agri-taxation measures focused on the areas of land mobility and succession. <br/><br/>Under the human capital theme, Food Wise identified a series of actions that support the development of ongoing and lifelong education, training and knowledge transfer programmes for farmers.  The knowledge transfer programme under the RDP has provided significant investment in providing high quality training and upskilling for Irish farmers.  The beef programme currently includes approximately 570 knowledge transfer groups comprising approximately 9,300 participants.  Participation by those in the beef sector is by far the largest of all six sectors involved in knowledge transfer.<br/><br/>Under the innovation theme, a key Food Wise 2025 action was the establishment of a meat technology centre, as a centre of excellence for meat processing and innovation.  Meat Technology Ireland opened in 2017.  It is an &euro;8.1 million five-year research and innovation programme, developed by industry and co-funded by Enterprise Ireland and a consortium of nine beef and sheepmeat processing companies.  It is hosted by Teagasc at its Ashtown Food Research Centre facility, with DIT, DCU, UCC and ICBF as research providers.  The centre has an agreed research programme focused on topics, including genomics, tenderness, shelf life, carcase characterisation, meat and health.  Food Wise 2025 also recommended the establishment of a high level innovation team.  This high level team was established last year, and will report back to the HLIC in 2019. <br/><br/>Regarding other supports for beef farmers, the Department has rolled out a range of schemes as part of the &euro;4 billion RDP.  The beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, is currently the main support specifically targeted for the suckler sector, which provides beef farmers with &euro;300 million in funding during the current RDP period.  This scheme is an agri-environmental measure to improve the environmental sustainability of the national suckler herd by increasing genetic merit in the herd.  In addition to the BDGP, other supports which are available for suckler and sheep farmers under Pillar 2 of the CAP include GLAS, areas of natural constraints, ANCs and knowledge transfer groups.  Suckler farmers also benefit significantly from the basic payment scheme, BPS, and greening payments under CAP Pillar 1.  Teagasc's national farm survey data suggests that suckler farmers receive support equivalent to approximately &euro;500 per suckler cow on average across all schemes.  It is also envisaged that suckler farmers will be the primary beneficiaries of the &euro;23 million increase in the areas of natural constraints, ANC, budget announced in the Budget Statement 2019. <br/><br/>A sum of &euro;20 million has been made available under the beef environmental efficiency pilot, BEEP, scheme which was recently launched by the Minister and is open for applications until this Friday, 22 February 2019.  The pilot is aimed at further improving the economic and environmental efficiency of beef production, by measuring the weaning efficiency of suckler cows.<br/><br/>In November 2018, Michael Dowling presented the Food Wise Meat Implementation Group report to the HLIC.  This group was convened to monitor and drive the implementation of the meat-specific Food Wise 2025 actions and the future development of the meat sectors.  The report followed a series of meetings between the Department and stakeholders across the beef, sheep, pig and poultry sectors.  The Department was encouraged that this group, comprising stakeholders across the meat sectors and in different tiers of the supply chain, collaborated to produce a useful report, which will provide valuable input in the effort to deliver on the ambition of Food Wise 2025.</p><p>The issues raised in the group's report included an acknowledgement of the need for specific supports for the suckler sector, and the need to work on the issue of beef from the dairy herd.  The possibility of introducing some form of targeted support for the suckler sector was recommended by the group.  However, it is accepted that such measures, in addition to providing income support, should be clearly geared towards bringing environmental and welfare quality benefits.  Consideration of these issues has fed into the development of additional supports for the sector such as the BEEP pilot.</p><p> The Department's key priority in respect of CAP reform is to ensure an adequate CAP budget for the agrifood sector.  The CAP budget is fundamentally important to Irish farmers, particularly now at a time of Brexit uncertainty and in the context of dealing with serious climate change obligations and challenges in the future.  Based on nine objectives, the future CAP will continue to ensure access to high-quality food and strong support for the unique European farming model.  The Department is currently examining all appropriate measures to support the different agrifood sectors during the CAP reform process.</p><p> Finally, we have now begun preparations within the Department on developing the next ten-year strategy to replace Food Wise 2025.  It is envisaged that this will be published in 2020.  Without pre-empting the content of the next plan, it is clear that the broad, cross-cutting themes contained in the current strategy will continue to remain highly relevant.  Clearly, there are broader policy developments that will have a strong impact on the development of the strategy, particularly the outcome of CAP reform, climate action and Brexit.</p><p> In terms of process, 2019 will see the preparation of background discussion papers, a public consultation, a stakeholder event, the establishment of an independent committee by the Minister, and the beginning of that committee's deliberations.  In 2020, the committee should conclude its work by agreeing a new strategy, which will then be subject to an environmental assessment before finalisation.  The Department will be seeking the views of the joint committee as part of the process, and looks forward to input from the committee on the new strategy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-19a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1378" speakername="Rose Conway Walsh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019021900002#E00300"><p>I thank Ms McPhillips for her presentation.  There is extreme concern in the farming community about current prices and the fact that incomes have fallen by 16%, without Brexit.  The price of beef is at an all-time low.  What has the Department done regarding exports?  Some 52% of beef is exported to Britain.  What specifically has the Department done to ensure that the 52% of product that goes to the British market will be protected and that Irish beef will hold its position within the British market?</p> <p>  Have payments for suckler cows been seriously considered?  The IFA and other farming organisations are asking for a support package of &euro;200 per cow.  What has the Department done to increase the prices paid by factories?  They are tangible issues.  I welcome the developments such as the beef genomics schemes and other schemes Ms McPhillips has mentioned but there is a real urgency around securing the current incomes and addressing the shortfalls that exist even without Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-19a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019021900002#E00400"><p>I thank Ms McPhillips for her opening statement, which was informative.  She said beef exports are valued at &euro;2.4 billion.  Is that the value at the farm gate?  Is it correct that it is the return to the farmer or is that the value from the processors' point of view?</p> <p>  I acknowledge there is a continuous effort to create more markets and to push further afield and ensure more markets for Irish produce wherever the Department can, and to get the right space in the right market as well for our unique product.  However, one gripe I have had for some time concerns the return to the farmer.  In a sense, taxpayers' money is used through Bord Bia and other agencies to find markets and to research and develop them in various countries, yet the primary producer is the one who always seems to be squeezed.  In the context of Food Wise 2025 or its replacement, is there a possibility of putting in some ratio whereby as the price increases for the product, the primary producer will have an entitlement to an element of that price?  The difficulty we have is that farmers get continually squeezed while processors and supermarkets seem to be making money at their expense.  We need to find some way to manage that in a fair and more appropriate manner.</p> <p>  Various supports are in place that go back to the farmer such as for suckler cows and the ANC payment.  From what we hear about the next CAP agreement there will be more of a focus on environmental measures and public good that is being done by the farmer rather than what farmers produce and how they produce it.  I would like more information if it is available on what benefit there will be to farmers in future.  Many suckler farmers I have spoken to say they are keeping as few animals as they can to get the maximum number of benefits and they do not see any payback for increasing stocking levels or even keeping them at the previous level.  Pressure is coming from all directions to scale back.  In her opening remarks, Ms McPhillips referred to increasing the value rather than increasing the volume.  While that may be the case, there is a fear that the value is for somebody else rather than for the farmer.  Some element of clear advantage is needed for farmers to save the suckler cow and beef sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-19a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019021900002#E00500"><p>I thank the officials for their presentation.  I hope they will not take anything I say in the next few minutes personally, but it is an understatement to say I am cross following what I heard.  I am a dairy and beef farmer and the lack of realisation about the current crisis in the beef industry is frightening.  Ms McPhillips said that our food is exported to 180 countries worldwide and that 96% of beef is sold within the EU while the other 4% goes outside in the form of offal.  It is bunkum to say we have all these great markets for beef.  We are not selling it.  We have not moved one iota in the past ten years as regards developing markets.  Let us state facts rather than try to hoodwink people.  The reality is that 96% of beef is sold within the EU and what is sold outside of it, to China and elsewhere, is sold as offal.  Only a wheelbarrow of beef went to the United States.  We also heard that: "The Department is deeply committed to fully supporting and developing Ireland's beef sector."  Our sector is on its knees.  I have never seen such despondency among beef farmers.  There is no mention of the profitability of fattening cattle or producing beef in Food Wise 2025 other than to the reference to low profitability in the sector.  The reality at the moment is that farmers are losing money hand over fist.</p><p>A conservative estimate is that cattle would want to make &euro;4.60 per kg to break even due to cost of feed for cattle at the moment.  Steers are going on the grid at &euro;3.75 per kg.  God help whoever has Friesian steers to kill because one will only get, maybe turnabout, &euro;3.40 per kg.  Cattle are losing a fortune and beef farmers are losing a fortune.</p><p> The opening statement reads: "Minister Creed has also made considerable efforts towards facilitating and developing the live export trade, including leading a trade delegation to Turkey last year.  The live trade will again be a focus of efforts in 2019."  There are no cattle over 12 months of age being exported at the moment.  We have no market for live exports.  We have a situation where we knew that the dairy herd was going to expand rapidly and we did not put the infrastructure in place to get Friesian calves out of the country in greater numbers.  We exported 160,000 calves last year, Bord Bia received a levy of around &euro;300,000 when it exported those calves and we have not got adequate lairage facilities on the Continent to take calves this spring.  Our dairy herd is expanding at a fairly significant rate and we will be lucky to hit exports of 160,000 calves this year.  In my opinion, instead of efforts focusing on live exports we have gone the other way.</p><p> Food Wise 2025 and market development were mentioned in the statement.  I have outlined the figures that clearly show that market development has not happened.  The last line in the first paragraph on Food Wise 2025 reads: "I should stress that these projections did not include volume growth targets".  Why not?  We knew that there would be more cattle in the country so surely there should have been volume growth targets in place.  We knew the dairy herd was going to expand at a very significant rate.  The other side of the report stated we were going to increase milk production by 50% by 2020 so we knew there would be a serious increase in cattle numbers in the country but no volume growth targets were put in place.  To me, that is just ignoring the inevitable.  Unfortunately, the inevitable has arrived and for the past three to four months there has been a kill of 40,000 cattle per week, which we are just not able to sell at a viable price.  That is the reality of Food Wise 2025 and, unfortunately, that reality is not being faced up to.</p><p> I have underlined the parts of the presentation that annoyed me the most.  Sexed semen was mentioned.  Yes, sexed semen would play a huge part but have we done anything to develop it?  Has money been invested in developing sexed semen?  Has sexed semen become economically viable?  Has the fertility of sexed semen improved?  No, it has not and no resources have been put into the sector.</p><p> Again, there are weaknesses such as low probability.  Beef farmers would be delighted if they were able to discuss probability.  The real discussion is on how much is being lost at the moment.  </p><p> All through the document there was no mention of the person who is finishing those cattle.  In reality, the man who buys store cattle coming from the dairy herd or the weanling being chosen by the suckler, is unable to give a viable price for them if he has not got a margin for feeding those cattle.  That is the major problem that faces us with young cattle this spring when cattle start to come out of the sheds to be sold.  Is the man who has finished the cattle going to have any firepower to buy the store cattle?  That is without discussing the complications of Brexit and the huge damage that Brexit can do to our main market, which is the UK.</p><p> In terms of loans and low-cost loans, farmers have waited two years for what was announced in 2017 to be put on the table.  The initiative has repeatedly been postponed.    If a beef man approached a bank for a loan he would not be entertained because, unfortunately, in order to get money from a financial institution one must have the financial capacity to pay it back and no beef man has that capacity at the moment.</p><p> In terms of the statement, there is "&euro;500 per cow on average across all schemes", if one said that to a group of beef farmers in a room one would want to be sitting very near the door because in reality that suckler cow is costing that farmer money.  I accept that, bar the knowledge transfer scheme, he can avail of schemes such as GLAS, ANC, etc., and have donkeys on his holding.  However, he does not have the suckler cows to avail of any of those schemes.  To insert the figure of "&euro;500" in the statement is at best highly irritating to suckler farmers, and I could use a far stronger term.  It is demeaning.</p><p> It is four years since quotas were abolished so it is late in the day to be thinking about the need to work on the issue of beef from the dairy herd.  We have the serious issue of cross-breds being produced in the dairy herd.  As I said earlier in terms of sexed semen, we could produce Aberdeen Angus and heifer cattle from the dairy herd that would go into the heifer prime and the Aberdeen Angus schemes, that have been promoted fairly extensively, but no work has been done whatsoever on this matter.</p><p> The next CAP reform was mentioned.  At the moment beef farmers are eating into their CAP payments to keep bread on the table.  It is going to be a huge Everest to climb to maintain the existing CAP budget.  We have the black hole that will be generated by the exit of the UK from the EU and it is going to be hugely difficult to maintain the CAP budget.</p><p> Immigration and defence are becoming major issues with other EU member states and the importance of CAP has diminished among a lot of our fellow EU members.  Unfortunately, the reliance of farmers on their CAP payments will increase but the same budget will not exist.</p><p> My comments are not a personal criticism of the assistant Secretary General because we are discussing a document produced by the Department.  If that is how the Department responds to the challenges that are being faced by the beef industry then it is an insult.  There is no realisation of the huge crisis that is in beef farming.  If we wait around like Nero watching Rome burn then we will not have a beef industry in 12 months time.  We have failed to get Friesian calves out of the country this spring in the numbers that are needed.  There is now talk about getting facilities in Cherbourg.  We are in the middle of the calving season so we are not getting calves out in the numbers needed and, unfortunately, the 40,000 kill that we had for the last three to four months will be maintained.  There are men who have Friesian bulls coming to 24 months of age and they are begging processors to take them off them.  They are not asking the price just "Will you kill them for me?" because once the bulls go over 24 months of age their value is dramatically reduced.  A neighbour of mine had very good cows to sell the other day and he was told they would be taken off him in three weeks' time.  The crisis that our industry is experiencing cannot be overestimated.  To me, this response by the Department is poor in the extreme.</p></speech>

The body of work for this committee is to analyse where the future of the beef industry lies based on a SWOT analysis.  The Department conducted the SWOT analysis in 2015.  That was before David Cameron even decided to have a referendum on Brexit, before the referendum took place on 23 June 2016 and before the British public made a huge mistake in terms of their decision on Brexit.  How accurate is the analysis in view of all that has happened since 2015?  Are the findings up to date?  Climate change is coming down the line.  How will we square the circle of increasing production while people on the other side of the argument complain that stock numbers have been increased by too much?</p> <p>  It is a fact that 115% of a suckler farmer's income comes from Europe.  I imagine such a situation is unsustainable going forward.  The only way that viability for suckler farmers can be maintained is by getting a decent and fair price for their product at the other end of the scale.</p><p>That is where the problem lies.  What more has been done to try and equalise the situation, particularly as the 115% will not be sustainable?  How can farmers with suckler herds remain viable without depending on the money that comes from Europe on an annual basis?</p><p> I will feed back into the conversation Deputy Cahill started about SWOT analysis and the strengths, weaknesses and challenges for the industry, of which there are many.  The strengths are the obvious ones we know about, grass fed and so on and so forth, and traceability.  The weaknesses and challenges are probably greater in 2019 than they were in 2015 when the analysis was done.  Ms McPhillips might address those points when she is ready.</p></speech>

Please come back to me if I miss any of the questions.</p> <p>  The Department recognises that Brexit is a significant threat to our beef sector and to exports.  Much of that rests on the decision that the UK will take about the tariffs that are applied.  If the UK makes a decision to apply the EU's tariff schedule for beef, the work that the Department has done has estimated that would incur a tariff cost of the order of 70% on our beef exports to the UK.  That would be a cost of &euro;780 million if it was a once-off payment and would seriously undermine the competitiveness of our beef in the UK market.</p> <p>  We hope that is not the decision the UK will take.  It will take its decision over the next week or so, we understand, as to what specific tariff regime it will apply to exports from the EU.  That is largely outside our control.  The Minister has, since the referendum, travelled around Europe, sensitising our partners and the European Commission to the threat that Ireland faces from Brexit, particularly in the context of the beef sector.  The Minister has had significant engagement with his counterparts in other member states about that threat.  He recently met - one of a series of such meetings - Commissioner Hogan, explained the issues to him and sought whatever assistance is available from the EU if that no-deal, hard Brexit, hard-tariff scenario emerges.  We very much hope it will not.  There has been a detailed and good understanding from Commissioner Hogan and Commission officials from the DG Agriculture and Rural Development of the exposure of the beef sector to those impacts.  We recently had a visit from a delegation from the DG Agriculture and Rural Development to discuss in more detail what avenues of EU support might be available in that event.</p></speech>

Our beef industry, or at least the 52% of it that exports to Britain, is completely at the behest of the goodwill of the Tories and dependent on the deal.  In addition to what is happening with beef prices, that is absolutely enormous.  Farmers are concerned that, while discussions may be going on, they need something tangible that can be drawn down at short notice.  The Department knows how long it takes to put schemes in place because of IT systems and whatever else is needed.  If a hard Brexit is followed by eight to 12 months without supports, thousands of farmers, will not be able to remain in business.</p></speech>

We have had detailed discussions, as I mentioned, with Commissioner Hogan and officials from DG Agriculture and Rural Development about the avenues of EU support that might be available.  We stressed the urgency of deploying those measures immediately if that worst case scenario transpires.  The avenues we have been discussing include traditional market supports under the Common Market organisation regulations such as aids to private storage and public intervention.  There is also exceptional aid available under that regulation.</p> <p>  The Minister has made the point strongly that those traditional market supports are not adequate to maintain beef prices because the intervention rate is set at a very low level and would not be impactful on the crisis we would be facing.  We have focused on the ask in terms of exceptional aid.  That has been deployed by the EU in the past.  A particularly relevant example is when the Russian ban was introduced in 2014 and exceptional aid was used to help the Baltic states and Finland, whose market was basically wiped out overnight as a result of the ban.  There was a rapid EU response and deployment of exceptional aid for those countries.</p> <p>  The other avenue we are pursuing, apart from the Common Market organisation regulation, is that relating to state aid regulations.  General state aid is administered by DG Competition.  Along with colleagues in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, we have had a lot of discussion with DG Competition on those general state aids, mainly for the processing sector.  We have also discussed state aid under agriculture guidelines with experts in DG Agriculture and Rural Development and what flexibility might be available.</p> <p>  There has been a willingness on the part of the EU to engage in detailed discussions.  The deployment of those instruments would be urgent if the worst-case scenario transpires.  That is what the Minister will be pushing for.</p></speech>

We have been working on encouraging beef producer organisations.  The legislation is in place for the organisations to be recognised.  We have a funding system in place to provide grants, as well as a system of approved facilitators.  A prospective producer organisation can avail of a grant and assistance from a facilitator to help set it up.  We have had some interest from groups but it is still quite new to the Irish system.  We have had several meetings and facilitated several workshops with interested groups.  The IFA has planned a seminar next month that will involve speakers from the European Commission and the Department.  While it will not be the solution to everything, the producer organisation system should have a role in strengthening the farmers' position in the supply chain.</p> <p>  In the next iteration of the CAP, from the documents I have seen to date, it has a lot more of a central role for these types of organisations.</p></speech>

The general feeling is that what was introduced at Commission level represented an important first step but did not go far enough.  It was a watered-down version of what would be required.  Are there plans in the Department to have a more robust process in place which would complement the commission&rsquo;s proposals for unfair trading practices?</p></speech>

The directive is now at EU level.  It is almost finalised and is subject to final legal scrubbing.  The directive will come in and then there will be a two-year implementation timeframe.  As there is much overlap between the draft directive on unfair trading practices and our existing grocery goods regulations, which come under the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, we are setting up a working group with that Department to work through the issues and consider how the directive will be transposed into Irish law.</p> <p>  The output value of the beef sector at farm level in 2018 was almost &euro;2.4 billion.  That is also the figure for the total value of beef exports.  It is just a coincidence.</p> <p>  Irish food is exported to over 180 countries around the world.  We have market access for beef exports to 70 countries.  The Department&rsquo;s efforts in market access are focused on opening markets.  There can significant barriers to trade.  We must understand the requirements of the importing country and demonstrate that our standards meet them.  This can involve a series of audit and inspection visits until that country is satisfied that we can be given market access.  In the case of China, it was a long drawn-out process over many years, involving a range of people in the Department, industry, at farm level and Bord Bia.  We could see the opportunity in the Chinese market.  The Chinese consumer eats, on average, 5 kg to 6 kg of beef each year.  In comparison, an Irish person consumes 19 kg.  A small increase on the part of the Chinese consumer would mean significant additional demand.  To date, we have exported 1,000 tonnes of beef to China.  It is frozen boneless beef and not offal.  I accept that this is small compared with the 290,000 tonnes we export to the UK.  It is a start, however.  We see significant opportunities in China.  Bord Bia&rsquo;s market insights and consumer research suggests there are significant growth opportunities in the Chinese market.</p> <p>  We are opening the door and then it is up to the industry to develop those opportunities.  The reason we export 52% of our beef to the UK is because it is the best and the highest priced retail market in Europe.  There are good geographical, social, cultural and economic reasons for being there.  If the events around Brexit had not happened, we would be quite content with that market.  Obviously, there is now a focus on expanding market access around the world, creating opportunities which may be taken up by industry, from year to year, depending on what the market situation is.  While they may go elsewhere, our role is about opening the opportunity to more markets.</p> <p>  On payments not being linked to production, we made a policy decision regarding the 2003-2004 CAP reform that we would go for full decoupling of payments from production.  Since then, direct payments under Pillar 1 and payments under the world development programme have not been based on payment per animal.  On world development programme schemes, including BDGP, those payments must be justified.  They must add value and there must be a clear benefit to an environmental or a public good from making a payment.  That is obviously the trend which will continue with CAP reform.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill referred to the CAP budget.  One of the main strengths of the CAP in making the case for additional funding is to be seen to be meeting key demands from the EU consumer around environmental goods, protection of the landscape and of the rural economy.  Being relevant to those priorities is the only way we will ensure the CAP budget is protected in the future.</p></speech>

If that beef is displaced, it creates a significant problem on the EU market and has a significant effect on prices in other EU member states.  In terms of sensitising other Ministers and Departments to Brexit as an Irish problem, we have also presented it as a problem across the EU.  If that product is displaced from the UK market, it will depress prices across the EU and we will need that support in order to try to maintain those supply chains.</p></speech>

The committee is engaging on this project of examining the beef sector in particular with regard to Food Wise 2025 targets because of the significant pressure on the beef sector and, specifically, primary producers and farmers.  They are in the midst of a crisis.  They are not immune to crises, having experienced many previously, but the one they are currently facing is particularly acute.  It is an existential crisis for many farmers who may not be able to continue in the sector.  I did not get the sense from the Department's presentation that there is a vision of how primary producers and farmers can be profitable or how to ensure a viable future for farmers in the beef sector in terms of being able to produce and make a profit from it.  We know the figures in regard to how Food Wise 2025 is increasing exports and that the increased production of meat and beef is also leading to increased exports, although not to a sufficient level.  That is of benefit to the country.  However, the flipside is that the lack of sufficient markets for the increased beef we are producing is causing a significant crisis at farm gate level in terms of farmers not being able to make a profit.  A key part of that has been the growth in our dairy herd and the fact that there is not sufficient outlet for the increased stock and beef coming off that dairy herd.</p> <p>  The committee previously discussed the issue of getting live exports, particularly at calf stage, out of the country.  In her presentation, Ms McPhillips indicated that the Minister and the Government are making efforts in respect of live exports.  I ask her to elaborate further on the stage that process has reached.  The committee will seek to follow up on that issue and, specifically, the ongoing live export trade of calves coming off the dairy herd to France.</p> <p>  I ask Ms McPhillips to provide further information regarding the view the Department takes on the respective viability and future of the suckler cow and dairy beef sectors.   How does the Department envisage the beef sector at farm level evolving over the coming years, particularly the suckler herd because there has been a drop in calf numbers coming off it in recent years?  Without additional support, farmers will not be able to sustain a profit from the suckler herd.</p> <p>  Ms McPhillips referred to the positive impact which the beef producer groups may have.  How might that unfold?  Although I see the merit in them, if one is operating in a market which is already oversupplied, how much of an impact will the beef producer groups be able to make in terms of getting a better outcome and profit level for farmers?  While I may be going outside the Department's territory, the prices paid are critical to where our beef sector is going.  In recent months, the price paid to Irish beef producers has gone from 5% to 10% above the average price paid in the EU to 5% to 10 % below the average EU price.  What is the Department's assessment of the dynamic at play there?</p> <p>  Ms McPhillips referred to moves afoot at Commission level in respect of unfair trading practices.  That issue has been discussed by the committee.  Will it be of specific benefit to the beef sector?  Although there are unfair trading practices in the areas of groceries and contracts, and particularly vegetables and similar produce, I have never seen the impact such action could have on improving transparency in the food chain and, specifically, the pricing chain in the beef sector clearly explained.</p> <p>  The overall objective of Food Wise 2025 is to drive value rather than volume.  However, that is not happening in the beef sector.  While it is evident in other sectors, particularly the dairy sector, unfortunately there is more volume and less value increase in the beef sector and less profit for the farmer as a result.  Deputy Cahill referenced the fact that we are not accessing the increased volume outlets for our beef.  Leaving Brexit aside, that is something we need to promptly address as a country to avoid further pressure on beef prices.</p> <p>  The dairy sector has been rated number one in terms of carbon efficiency in Europe, while the beef sector is placed fifth.  That is a big selling point for Irish agriculture and a key aspect of how we approach the climate change issue.  The witnesses may have had the chance to assess the UN report published this week which would challenge how we make the assessments in regard to carbon efficiency.  We have a very strong product domestically, but that report should be interrogated by the Department and a robust response offered.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill touched on the fact that 96% of our exports are to the EU market.  In spite of increased attention on market diversification and marketing, particularly in light of Brexit, there has been a volume increase in beef exports to the UK market in the past year.  In light of its engagement with and feedback from Bord Bia, what is the Department's assessment of the potential for additional exports to non-EU markets and the likely trends in that regard?</p><p>The American market, in particular, despite much hype at the time, certainly has not delivered to the extent expected.</p><p> The one thing I have not touched on is Brexit.  Whatever about the pressure the beef sector is under, a hard Brexit in a number of weeks would put the kibosh entirely on the viability of the sector.  We must stand ready to intervene and provide supports in the event of a hard Brexit.  I am keen to hear more feedback from the witnesses on the price supports that could be put in place in the event of a hard Brexit.  From the engagement we have had with the sector, we have noted that aid for private storage or intervention that would have the impact of seeing us lose market space in Britain would not be sustainable in the short, medium or longer term.  We have to be able to step in immediately if a hard Brexit comes to pass.  Needless to say, our objective must be to avoid it because it presents an appalling vista, particularly for the beef sector.</p></speech>

The plan, which covers only the next six years, is to grow exports to &euro;19 billion.  Do the witnesses envisage us achieving the targets considering the very many weaknesses and threats facing the sector?</p> <p>  The real concern for livestock farmers is how they will stay in the sector given the prices they are getting.  Farm incomes have dropped by 16% according to a Teagasc report last year.  It is of grave concern to farmers in the sector.  We have to take on board what they are saying.  How is the Department engaging to identify the causes and rectify the problem?</p> <p>  On the climate action plan that the Government is producing, what engagement has there been with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment?  This will be an incredibly challenging area.  While it is tremendous that we are leaders in this area, because of our efficiency, there is grave concern in terms of EU trade policy on taking in beef from the Mercosur countries.  Brazilian beef, for example, is produced by cutting down rainforest.  Brazilian production is four times more carbon-intensive than ours.  How will we meet that challenge, bearing in mind the impact of Brexit and other factors?</p> <p>  My other question is on live exports.  There is a perception that we are not reaching our potential in this regard.  We had some interesting discussions here on lairage capacity.  In what way is the Department examining this with a view to addressing it?</p> <p>  Reference was made to weaknesses and skills gaps at all levels of the supply chain.  How will this be addressed?  If we do not have the skills, we cannot continue to have the output.</p> <p>  We are exporting 50% of our beef to the United Kingdom.  Brexit will have devastating consequences in this regard.  It is the biggest threat facing the sector.  What is the Department doing to try to manage that?</p> <p>  My next question is on the global growth in protein demand.  Has the Department examined in detail the type of protein being sought in order to identify the potential of plant protein production as another option for farmers?  As a butcher's daughter, I am not necessarily recommending that.  If, however, there is a market we could be tapping into, why not enter it?</p> <p>  The delegates referred to the failure to adopt carbon efficient practices.  I do not believe there is any resistance among farmers.  There is no great difficulty.  What we are hearing from farmers is that they are very willing and able to adopt carbon efficient practices.  How is the Department monitoring the potential of farmers to be even more efficient?  Have farmers reached their peak in terms of efficiency?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-19a.53" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1383" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019021900002#K00300"><p>I welcome the officials.  I apologise because I had to leave for a vote.  I apologise if I am repeating anything discussed while I was away.  I will catch up with the debate I missed by reading the transcript.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill hit the nail on the head.  It is very hard to add to or take from what he said.  The report we got today is just paying lip service to the beef sector.  It is basically a progress report on Food Wise 2025, which contains a financial export target.  There are no volume growth targets.  It is a swings and roundabouts approach.  The target is to achieve exports of &euro;19 billion and the authorities do not care how they reach it.  According to this thinking, if we get &euro;19 billion for eggs in 2025, so be it; we will have achieved our target.  There is no consideration given to the various sectors within the agricultural fold.  In that regard, the beef farmer is being thrown under the bus.  I refer, in particular, to those whose land is only good for beef rearing or suckler herds.  The option to diversify into the dairy sector is a non-runner.  We have to be cognisant of that and take into consideration the livelihoods of those who, perhaps following two generations before them, have dedicated their entire farming lives to beef production.  They are set up for beef farming, do not have the option to diversify and are constrained by the land they are farming.  Despite this, the report is as good as saying we are on target, Brexit aside.  We do not even need to mention Brexit here today because none of us knows what is going to happen.  Even if Mr. David Cameron had not called the referendum, we would still be having this discussion today about the beef sector.  It is on its knees and there are people walking away from it.  Brexit will be the last straw or the last nail in the coffin if it goes wrong.  If there were no Brexit, we would still be here today discussing the crisis in the beef sector.</p> <p>  When the target of &euro;19 billion was set, what percentage of it related to the dairy sector and what percentage related to the beef sector?  On the graph, how have those two lines crossed?  What is the current percentage of beef by comparison with the overall figure?  In the witnesses' opinion, what will the beef and dairy percentages be in 2025?  If there is a hard Brexit, we will be throwing the figure of &euro;19 billion in Food Wise 2025 out the window.  It is a whole new ball game.  If there is no Brexit, we can reach the &euro;19 billion target but we will still lose our beef sector.  The report states the Minister is actively pursuing a geographical indicator for Irish beef.  That would be fine if we had recognition around the world but we do not have the beef.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-19a.54" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2019021900002#K00400"><p>I apologise if I am repeating anything that has been said.  I was away on account of a vote.</p> <p>  Last week, Mr. Ray Doyle from ICOS and one of the exporters were here.  They were clearly pointing to a problem with increasing our live exports.  It is a capacity problem over in Cherbourg.</p><p>It is obvious that in respect of the number of calves being born, and thus the number of animals to be moved on, additional capacity is needed.  It is also in the Government's interests that this happens because it is asking farmers to produce these animals.  Additional calves are coming in from the dairy sector as well.  Is the Department working on a solution to the lairage shortage in Cherbourg?  We were told there was no problem with the market or in any other area in transporting animals abroad.  However, a lairage shortage has been identified in Cherbourg.  The Government needs to respond such that farmers can have more options in achieving better prices than they are currently achieving.  </p><p> I agree that beef farmers and suckler farmers are at a low ebb.  They are angry because, despite all their efforts in raising animals, they are losing money.  We all know the current situation in terms of prices is not sustainable.  Brexit has been mentioned.  Another issue that has not been played out in mainstream media is the impact down the line of climate change and what will be expected of farmers.  In regard to the efforts to improve the carbon efficiency of farming, there has been a great deal of criticism of farming, much of it unfair.  The Chairman mentioned the Department's report and SWOT analysis that was carried out in advance of the Brexit vote.  Climate change is now centre stage in reports.  Do the witnesses have any concerns about the Food Wise 2025 plan in terms of what will be demanded of farmers under proposed climate change measures?  What advice do they have farmers?  An additional carbon tax, as proposed by the Citizens' Assembly, has been ruled out.  However, farmers are losing money.  The imposition of more costs on them would push them in the wrong direction.  If they are to continue to produce animals in the same way they have up to now and they continue to lose money, it is will end badly.  </p><p> I understand the cynicism.  It stems from the fact that there have been reports on the weak position of the farmer in the food supply chain but nothing has been done to benefit the farmer.  Farmers continue to be price takers and there have been no gains from all of the efforts.  I have no doubt efforts are being made to resolve this issue.  There is a message being sent abroad by some in the new beef plan movement that people should not join the beef environmental efficiency pilot.  This is what farmers are being told.  There is a lot of cynicism.  The pilot is an opportunity, not a solution.  A lot of us worked hard to make the case pre-budget for more money for farmers.  Farmers are at a low ebb.  They need some pathway out of the current situation.  They must be assisted to put this type of farming on a more sustainable footing.  As mentioned by Senator Daly, we can set all the targets we want for exports, but if the primary producer is being crushed, the process will not last too long.</p></speech>

I will try to not rehash what has been said.  I welcome the report, which provides us with an opportunity to discuss the issues and voice our opinions.</p> <p>  The beef sector is in crisis.  Coming from a rural area, this concerns me.  In counties such as Roscommon and Galway, agriculture is still the backbone of communities.  Many families and communities rely on the farming community.  I am sure the witnesses will have heard it said that when farming is going well, the towns and villages are going well because farmers tend to spend the money they make.  Following on from what was said by other speakers, there is within the farming sector a level of disbelief regarding the future of the sector.  This calls for radical action and a radical plan.  In most cases, cattle prices are down at least &euro;100 on what they were this time last year.  Taking into account all the costs incurred by farmers, production is not sustainable.  The beef plan group is making significant progress in attracting thousands of members.  This shows that the sector is in massive crisis and that people who have been involved in farming over a long time do not want to let go.  They want to continue farming and to be successful at it.  I attend a lot of meetings and what I am hearing from farmers is a level of despondency that concerns me.</p> <p>  The Chinese market is good.  I welcome any efforts made by the Department, the Minister and An Bord Bia to access new markets.  My understanding is that access to the beef market in China will not be significant on the basis that Chinese people like fresh beef, not frozen beef.  While there will be a market for some frozen beef, it will not be significant.  Nevertheless, it is welcome.  Another big issue for farmers is that of control of the beef industry.  Farmers are of the view that they and prices are being controlled by a super power.  In recent times, the C&amp;D Food plant in Edgeworthstown, County Longford, where a by-product of farming is used, was taken over.  The new owner of the plant is a major player in the business throughout the British Isles and Europe, which points to one person controlling this business.  This is frustrating for farmers.  </p> <p>  I am often struck by the lack of respect of factory owners for the farmer's point of view.  They tend to openly dismiss farmers when they have an issue about price or the future of the sector and they do not engage.  When there is a crisis in a particular sector of the economy, engagement is necessary.  It seems that farmers are being slapped down by big business and told to take what they are being given.  Relations are poor between the farmers and factories in this country.  I blame the factories for this because at times their approach towards the farming community is arrogant.  There is no engagement on the part of the factories and this needs to be addressed.  </p> <p>  Bull prices were mentioned.  German, Italian, Spanish and French farmers are getting prices way in excess of what Irish farmers are getting.  The prices Irish farmers are getting are not sustainable.  Increased funding is needed for the suckler cow sector.</p><p>There is no need to repeat that if farmers rearing suckler cows go out of business, the beef business will collapse.</p><p> As Senator Mulherin outlined, climate change is a serious challenge and concern for the farming community which we have to address quickly.</p><p> Without significant intervention by the Department in the beef sector, the crisis will continue and more people will leave the industry.</p></speech>

I was not able to attend earlier but I saw parts of the contributions.  The suckler cow and beef farming sectors are in a critical state and farmers are very concerned.  As Deputy Eugene Murphy said, the numbers attending meetings of the beef round table and beef forum prove that farmers in the sector are seriously concerned.  There have been massive crowds of young and old farmers attending these meetings in Castleisland, Kenmare and all over County Kerry.  Farmers feel they are at a crossroads.  Much of the talk of climate change is rubbish.  When one hears the Taoiseach suggesting that-----</p></speech>

That was grand, as dairy farmers could expand and efforts were made to secure markets for milk and dairy products.  However, the same efforts and force were not put into the export of live cattle.  It is well known that more dairy cows means more calves and there has to be an outlet for them.  One of the major concerns raised at the meetings for farmers is that the factories determine the price of the animal.  The factories have all the data and they know when the animals are reaching 16 months, 24 months and 30 months.  They have that advantage over the farmers because they know when the volume of stock will increase and they seem to be able to reduce the price at will.  The poor farmer is up against that technology now.  I raised this issue on the Order of Business in the House last week.  There is no visible difference in the carcass of an animal of 29 months, 30 months or 31 months and one cannot tell if the animal has been moved once, twice, five times or seven times.  There is something wrong in the system and there needs to be an investigation into what is happening.  The factories and the Department need to be taken to task about the rules and regulations that are manifesting in low prices and hurting farmers in the pocket.  I am calling for an inquiry into this matter.</p> <p>  A programme broadcast the other day on Brexit focused on the marts in the North where farmers are delighted with the prices they were getting at the marts.  The same story applies in England.  How is it that just a few miles away - across the ditch in Northern Ireland - there is such a difference in the price of cattle being sold compared with the South?  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine or his officials need to tell us what has gone wrong and why there is such a difference in the price between North and South.  This is a serious question but I cannot answer it.  I need an answer from the Minister or his Department because the current position is totally wrong.</p> <p>  Farmers in the South jump through every hoop and their animals are treated immaculately.  Nobody can say that farmers are polluters or causing damage to the environment because they are not.  Every farmer I know has built slatted sheds, complies with all the regulations and jumps through every hoop, yet farmers are not being paid.  On the one hand, Bord Bia is carrying out inspections and looking after that side of its role, but it is not marketing our animals and products as good as it could be.</p> <p>  I see from the opening statement that there will be a focus on the live trade this year.  The live trade should be a focus because if markets are not opened up and there is no route to market for the extra animals we are producing, the factories will have another field day at the expense of the farmers.</p> <p>  My questions are very relevant to the farmers.  We need answers on why there is a such a difference in the price of cattle in the North compared with the South.  Somebody has to answer that question for the people I represent.</p></speech>

I understand all the farm organisations walked away from that recently.  At the beginning, the beef forum was seen as the great white hope.  Having all the stakeholders around a table is very important in trying to reach a fair solution.  However, it seemed to become a talking shop more than an action group, if I could describe it as such, before it came to a conclusion.  What is the current position in that regard?  Are there plans in the Department to reinvigorate the forum or institute a similar type of forum?</p> <p>  Ms McPhillips mentioned that the Department is doing another SWOT analysis looking forward to 2030.  The perception, right or wrong, was that Food Wise 2025 was an initiative from a top down perspective.  What kind of a consultation or discussion process does the Department intend having with regard to where we go from now until 2030?  Will officials talk to farm organisations and producers on the ground to get in-depth knowledge of exactly what is happening or what is required to secure the greatest possible benefit for primary producers by 2030?</p></speech>

The Minister used the opportunity to urge stakeholders to recognise their interdependency and to support the sector through examination of mechanisms to add value along the supply chain and increase the strength of all links in the supply chain.  We normally have two of those meetings a year.  While there are no meetings planned as yet for this year, I hope there will be because, as the Chairman said, getting people around the table is positive.</p> <p>  I mentioned the Food Wise meat implementation group, chaired by Mr. Michael Dowling, which included a range of stakeholders from processors and farm organisations.</p><p>It was a very positive group and it came up with some very useful input that has been added in the form of actions to implement Food Wise 2025.</p><p> I will touch on some of the questions asked by a range of committee members.  There can be a slight misconception about the Food Wise 2025 projections, particularly the &euro;19 billion in exports.  Food Wise 2025 is an enabling strategy that seeks to assist the agrifood sector to develop to the best of its potential.  It includes very detailed actions the Department, its agencies and other Departments should take, from a policy point of view, to create the best environment for the sector to grow and prosper.  The committee that developed Food Wise 2025 projected that if all of the recommendations are implemented, the opportunity is there to increase exports by up to &euro;19 billion by 2025.  That figure is not specific in that it was not broken down into sectoral targets; it is a vision of the opportunity that exists.</p><p> In terms of where we are in working towards the vision behind Food Wise 2025, total exports last year were &euro;13.6 billion.  The opportunity is certainly there, particularly in the context of the feedback on market development we get from Bord Bia.  If we did not have Brexit - the elephant in the room - I could quite confidently state that &euro;19 billion in exports is certainly achievable.  When Bord Bia looked to growth markets in Asia, it discovered significant demand for additional protein.  Also, there is a growing middle and upper classes in those markets who want premium quality western-type products.  We are well placed to fill the demand in this regard.</p></speech>

Diets tend to be plant-based when economies are operating at lower levels.  In China, the average consumption of beef is between 5 kg and 6 kg per person per year.  The level of consumption in Ireland is 19 kg per person.  China has a population of 1 billion so there is a huge growth opportunity for us even if the Chinese were only to eat a little bit more beef annually.</p></speech>

In terms of the vision for the suckler sector, the lack of profitability in suckler farming is not a new issue.  Some 20 years ago, over 100% of suckler farm income came from payments, which were really headage payments and coupled payments that were based on retaining the animals.  Since decoupling in 2003, people have generally persisted with their existing farming systems.  Suckler cow numbers have decreased but probably more gradually than we would have expected if we were just operating on the basis of the economics involved.  The Department would like to support the sustainable, efficient and profitable development of the sector through policies to increase competitiveness.  It would also like to act as a regulator in order to ensure that food is produced to the highest standards.  Obviously, food safety must be the basis of everything we do.</p> <p>  A couple of specific questions were asked about beef from dairy.  The Department, in conjunction with Teagasc, ICBF and others, and the meat and dairy processing industries, is currently examining greater integration in the supply of beef from the dairy herd to complement the existing supply of high-quality beef from the suckler herd.  This involves looking at areas in which the dairy industry can work together with the beef industry to improve the quality of beef coming from the dairy herd, improve breeding, calf rearing and management practices and the genotyping of beef progeny from the dairy herd.</p> <p>  There are also initiatives, as I mentioned, such as discussing with DG Agriculture and Rural Development the possibility of achieving geographic indication, GI, status for Irish beef.  GI status is not the answer in the context of profitability but it would be a significant selling point in some markets, particularly when it comes to future EU trade negotiations.  Bord Bia and Teagasc have also considered developing a standard for grass-fed Irish beef and dairy.  Again, the standard would be a significant selling point in certain markets.</p> <p>  Many members commented on Irish prices versus those in other member states.  We acknowledge that such prices are a difficulty.  My opening statement was very much focused on Food Wise 2025 and the beef sector because these are the main topics of discussion for today.  We acknowledge that Irish prices have been at a low level, particularly in the final quarter of last year and coming into this year.  Irish prices did not enjoy that uptick that normally happens towards the end of the winter season and this has been a difficulty for farmers.  We acknowledge that and are making every effort to provide support to the sector, particularly through the BEEP scheme that was announced in the budget and launched recently.  I stress that the closing date for applications for this scheme is next Friday.  The scheme is really good, although the payments relating to it are modest.  It will provide farmers with a cash injection and really detailed information on the weaning efficiency of their suckler cows thus enabling farmers to make better decisions.  If people are hesitating, I urge them to submit an application.  I ask Ms Dunne to comment on the application process.</p></speech>

There was a comment here that people have been told not to avail of the scheme but I urge people to avail of it.  The scheme has been devised to be as simple as possible and ensure that as much of the payment as possible goes to the farmer.  It targets both environmental and economic efficiency.  We really believe that, in terms of supporting the suckler herd, environmental and economic efficiency is the way to progress.  It is a one-year pilot scheme and the payment is up to &euro;40 per calf.  It is a very simple scheme as all one has to do is weigh the calf and dam, record their weights and submit the information to the ICBF.  The application form is simple and is really just an indication that one will submit the weights.  The application needs to be in with the Department by Friday.  Applications can be made online or paper application forms can be obtained from the division in Portlaoise.  We urge people to support the scheme.  We have received very positive feedback about the scheme from the farming bodies.  The payment might not be as much money as they would have liked but it has been acknowledged that the scheme was devised in consultation with them and is a step in the right direction.</p></speech>

The Department is engaging strongly with the FAO on the database results.  It is a database in development.  The FAO has assured us that the results are not comparable between member states.  We are engaging to make sure that the right inputs are put into the exercise.</p> <p>  In terms of carbon efficiency and the climate debate, obviously colleagues are very closely involved in that debate and in input to climate action, with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  A lot of our efforts, under the existing world development programme and BEEP, have focused on increasing carbon efficiency further, which has both environmental and economic benefits for farmers.</p><p>In most cases, taking actions that increase carbon efficiency also have the benefit of improving economic efficiency to some extent.</p><p> Several members mentioned live exports.  The committee held a detailed session with some of my colleagues on the question of the Department's responsibilities relating to live exports.  I am sure my colleagues will be happy to come back and update the committee on those issues.</p><p> Deputy Corcoran Kennedy referred to the skills that are needed in the sector.  Knowledge transfer groups are essential for providing information, for peer learning and for addressing the new challenges in a practical way at farm level.  The best way to transfer skills is for farmers to work together to discuss common issues.</p></speech>

I echo what was said about the BEEP scheme.  It is an important scheme and while it involves little money, we should encourage people to get involved in it.  There is a bit of negativity towards it but farmers should take it up.  The deadline is 22 February.</p></speech>

We had three big successes in beef last year.  China was only one of these, albeit a very important one.  We opened the market for frozen boneless beef.  I take the point that a lot that goes to third-country markets is offal but the Chinese access is in respect of frozen boneless beef.  We now have 11 meat plants - six for beef and five for pigmeat - approved for export to China.  We sat down with the companies that are active in this area and their ask is for more plants to be approved.</p></speech>

They are not asking to expand from boneless beef; there are many things they would like but their priority is for more plants to be approved.  We have 11 more files to deal with.  The companies see potential for a lot more to be shipped to China, purely of frozen boneless beef.  After that, we will look at expanding into other subsectors.</p></speech>

We see beef producer groups as having the potential to give farmers more of a negotiating platform with factories, particularly if they can differentiate themselves by making local products or having GI status.  This could lead to increasing profitability for particular producer groups.</p> <p>  The directive on unfair trading practices proscribes and limits certain practices but it is focused on retail level.  It is the direction of travel and a series of initiatives across the EU are aimed at improving transparency in the supply chain.  At retailer level, there has been significant acknowledgement of the importance of the farmer's role in supplying beef and other products to retailers.  One would hope that would lead to pressure to pass some of the profits back along the chain to the primary producers.</p></speech>

Some of that is related to other markets, such as Germany and France, where prices are highest at this time of the year, while we are at the opposite end of the spectrum.

In respect of the future, I come back to our twin main challenges which are climate change-Brexit and the baseline profitability of suckler farming.  The question is whether people will persist in that occupation.  When Ms Bruce and I analysed suckler farming ten or 15 years ago, we thought that when beef supports were decoupled from production there would be a massive decline in suckler numbers, but that never happened.  There is obviously more at play that just economics and people persist with farming because they are wedded to it.</p></speech>

They have many more options than they had 15 or 20 years ago.  I believe that will have a big bearing on young people who, having gone to college, want a job that provides a reasonable income because most such jobs are in the big urban centres or cities.  Part-time farmers, such as many near me in the west, supplement their income by working part time while doing the best they can on their land.

Even on a part-time basis, young people can bring a lot of innovation and an adaptation of new technology will make farming more efficient.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-19a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1315" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019021900002#O00200"><p>This afternoon's session is a briefing on the provisions of the general scheme of the miscellaneous provisions (withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill 2019.  I welcome the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Richard Bruton, who will brief the committee on the provisions of the Brexit Bill insofar as they relate to the remit of his Department.  I also welcome his officials.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind witnesses and members to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-19a.108" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019021900002#O00300"><p>I circulated a note so I will not read from it exhaustively.  The Department has been considering the contingency for all our various sources of energy in the context of a hard Brexit.</p><p>We have looked at oil, gas, coal and electricity.  We are content that the systems for oil, gas and coal will operate normally and without fear of significant disruption after careful examination by the regulators and various overseers.</p><p> Gas comes predominantly from Scotland and it is on what they call PRISMA software, which will continue to operate post Brexit.  No tariffs are imposed by the EU on gas imports at the moment and that will continue to be the case.  Having done a detailed analysis, GNI and the CRU are happy that there will be no change in cross-Border gas trade in the event of a no-deal Brexit.</p><p> The situation for electricity is more complicated.  In 2007, a single electricity market was established and that is regulated under a single electricity market committee, which has regulators, North and South, and an independent and deputy independent member.  They manage that platform.  It is managed within European law and it is different to the gas market, which is operated on an independent software platform.  There will be some impact on the sort of trading that can occur as a result of the departure of the UK from the European Union.  Certain types of trade will not be able to continue.  There will still be security of supply trades and what they call intra-day trades and it is believed that they will continue to support the vast majority of the flow of activity on it.  However, it will not, strictly speaking, be compliant with European law and, if that continues into the medium term, we will have to negotiate and set out a new basis for the continuance of trade of the single electricity market.  It is the desire of the UK, the EU and ourselves that the single electricity market should continue.  It has brought great benefits, North and South.  It is the only example of a fully integrated EU electricity market with a common trading platform and the UK has clearly signalled its intention, and has published legislation, to ensure, insofar as possible, that the UK will be compliant with the requirements of EU law.  Nonetheless, over time, a medium-term platform will have to be put in place.</p><p> We are taking powers which we do not believe will need to be used in this legislation.  They are being taken in the event that there will be a severe disruption that will lead to some unexpected market activity.  We are giving the CRU the power to alter licences in the event of certain events happening.  This is clearly something precautionary, rather than something we believe will be necessary, but when the full evaluation was done by the CRU and EirGrid and so on, it was believed that this would be prudent legislation.  </p><p> The provision to alter licences will be considerably constrained in that it will have to have ministerial approval to say it is justified.  It can only last for one year and it can only be exercised in the context of a disorderly Brexit and its commencement would be contingent on an absolute necessity being established.  The legislation, which will be published on Friday, will set out the provisions in a number of sections but these are the main provisions.  It is intended to make doubly sure that the CRU will have this reserve power should there be activity in the market that is not anticipated.</p><p>That is the position as I understand it.  Officials accompanying me are experts in this market, including its legal and practical day-to-day dimensions.  I hope we are in a position to answer any questions the committee might have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-19a.111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1232" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019021900002#Q00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his comments.  The main concerns are an interruption to supply and cost.  If I heard him correctly, he indicated there would be no impact from Brexit on the gas supply.  I have a couple of questions on that.  We agree that the single electricity market operating on the island as a whole has brought much benefit.  It is beneficial for the North, as it is questionable whether enough power is generated within the Six Counties.  It is very dependent in that regard.  We have the fourth-highest electricity prices in the Union and prices are above average for gas.  Will those prices increase?  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, my understanding is there would be World Trade Organization, WTO, tariffs on gas.  Will the Minister clarify whether this means energy prices will increase in a month or six or seven weeks, after Brexit?</p> <p>  I have raised an issue with him previously regarding the regulator.  It is accepted that the companies operating utilities here are profitable and that is fair enough as it is the business they are in.  They achieve substantial margins and the regulator can access those retail margins.  It has also been said that the margins are higher than they are in other European countries.  This must be monitored, particularly in the context of Brexit.  Is it the intention of the Minister to have a review?  There was another energy price increase for householders and businesses recently, and there was a wave of them last August, when the weather was very hot and people were not thinking too much about heat, power and light.</p> <p>  The Bill would make changes to the single electricity market and it is right to prepare from a legislative perspective for Brexit.  As of today, we could toss a coin as to what way it will fall.  We do not know if Britain will crash out or whether there will be a deal.  It is looking more likely that Britain could crash out of the EU.  The new market changes that came in with the integrated single energy market last October were meant to save householders and businesses &euro;200 million but what will happen regarding those savings now?</p> <p>  To sum up, what will be the effect of WTO tariffs on gas and will its price increase?  I asked about the escalating prices of energy in general and particularly in the context of Brexit.  We raised before the genuine concern regarding retail margins.  It has been reported that profit margins are higher than in other countries.  Is a review or investigation of that planned, along with ongoing monitoring?  That is required, particularly in light of Brexit.  We were supposed to see &euro;200 million in savings last October as well.</p></speech>

The EU has zero tariffs on gas imports.</p><p>The price of gas will not be affected and the same is true of electricity.  As such, no tariff is being applied to electricity.</p><p> On the issue of controlling the price, this is essentially a market system so the price is governed by supply and demand, under the oversight of regulators.  Clearly, if we are trying to bring renewables onto the grid and rapid call-up capacity is needed, arrangements for such capacity payments can be made within the marketplace.  It is a regulated market in which the regulator set the requirements in the public interest.  The way it works thereafter is that trades occur on a day-to-day basis as a market to clear.  The regulator's decisions are entirely independent.  As Minister, I do not have any role in asking the regulator to carry out a review.  If there was an issue of alleged collusion which people thought the regulator was not overseeing, the competition authority would be the port of call on price issues.  This is essentially a regulated market with the regulators, North and South, directly involved in managing the market.  The reason it may be more expensive than others is that we are a small market and have limited interconnection with the wider European market.  Notwithstanding that, we have been very successful in integrating renewables in the market and we are regarded as something of a model of best practice for how a small grid can integrate renewables to a high level.  Our ambition is to build that much further.</p></speech>

As I recall, there was a commitment last October to deliver overall savings of &euro;200 million to customers.  That does not appear to have happened.  What we have had since have been further cost increases.  In the context of Brexit, the real fear is that with interruption in gas supply in particular, the cost to householders and businesses is very high.  The Minister will appreciate that in the context of increasing insurance costs and other costs that small businesses are facing, this is presenting real challenges.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-19a.115" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019021900002#R00300"><p>The position is that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, has examined margins and it is satisfied that the market is competitive.  Two reports have been published and we can provide the Deputy with copies.  It is also worth saying that it is a wholesale market and there is a volatility with world prices.  World fuel prices will obviously impact on the market.  The savings in capacity were based on having the interconnection.  Two small grids would have to have more standby capacity.  Money is saved by integrating the grids but the price increases are due to wholesale price increases of fuels so the issues are not related.</p> <p>  The Deputy is concerned about the margins.  The CRU, which is independent in this, has done reports and is satisfied in this regard.  I understand that if comparisons are made between prices here and elsewhere, there will be a difference but, in the view of the CRU, this is not due to excessive profit taking.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-19a.116" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1274" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019021900002#R00400"><p>I would like a little clarification on what Deputy Stanley said.  There is no tariff applied for the trade in electricity between the two jurisdictions and what will now effectively be a third country when Brexit takes place.  That is just a straight, linear exercise driven by the market, capacity and requirements.  The same applies to gas regardless of its origins.  Its access to the country is tariff free so there are no concerns in that regard.  The Deputy's only concern on the potential of this legislation is based on concerns that there may be some capacity for actors or players to distort the market in some way.  I do not get this if there is no such tariff related requirement.  In any event, we are giving more powers to the regulator to forearm it in that event.</p><p>In light of the fact that Britain is exiting the European Union, is the Government still of a mind to try to further advance the Celtic interconnector so that we are connected to the European grid with the advantages that would pertain there?  My understanding was that our interconnectedness, particularly on the electricity grid, was more to the benefit of our friends north of the Border in the Six Counties than any great benefit that would accrue to the South.  That was important and of course it is right that we would assist there.  In terms of our long-term vulnerability from a requirement to get access to the wider European grid, I would have thought that we need to advance the Celtic interconnector, particularly in light of our climate change requirements.  Clearly if it works to the extent that more of our transport fleet and more of our heating requirement is electrified, with a greater requirement around the storage of data, we will be using significantly more electricity so we need to be more resilient there and there is obviously a wider debate there about renewables, both onshore and offshore such as wind etc.  Notwithstanding that, I would have thought that the Celtic interconnector was a major requirement that now comes into sharper focus as a result of Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-19a.118" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019021900002#S00200"><p>We are very clear that we want to pursue the Celtic interconnector because, as the Deputy says, an interconnector with a non-member state is not as beneficial, even though it is an important connection and something we would continue to value.  An interconnector to Europe would be very important for us.  The Deputy expressed some wonder over whether disruption or market manipulation could occur in this event.  He is probably right that it is unlikely.  It is a fairly competitive market but to be assured that no manipulation of a market could occur in the event of a disorderly Brexit, we have been advised that it is prudent to give this power to the CRU so that it could manage the way different players operate within the market, should it need to.</p> <p>  While the Deputy is right to say that we supply the North, that is not to say that having the Celtic interconnector does not have mutual benefits because it does.  It obviously permits both sides to have less standby capacity and it makes it easier to take renewables on board so it has benefits for everyone even though we are the net exporters in the present situation.  That is the position.</p></speech>

This was always going to be the great imponderable question, namely how we will work the single electricity market in the case of Brexit or even a hard Brexit and it is very welcome for us to be teasing out these issues.  The Minister did mention that there was no issue on oil in particular and that we have sufficient supplies of oil.  On the Whiddy Island complex, is it at full capacity in light of Brexit and where exactly is the capacity of that terminal, considering the unique standing it has in the State for fuel security and oil security in particular?  It has been questioned down south whether it is at full capacity if it were to come to a hard Brexit.  On the market itself and the volatility that could emerge, it is important that this legislation will try to ensure that there is no volatility.  Have there been any negotiations at UK level on how we will come to this agreement?  Could the Minister elaborate on how the mid-term view of this agreement will come about?  Will it be a bilateral agreement or how does the Minister see these negotiations coming?  Will they come through the European Union?  Where and what will be the actors and where will the negotiations of this debate happen?  Is a bilateral at this level the approach we will take or how does the Minister believe it will happen?</p> <p>  On the pricing structures, there would be a fear that a hard Brexit would increase prices to some degree.</p><p>This legislation gives the CRU power in that regard.  Is the Minister concerned that there may be a price increase or does he believe the legislation will strengthen the hand of the CRU to ensure that the market will not have volatility?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-19a.121" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019021900002#T00200"><p>I will have to get the Senator information on the Whiddy status.  We have 90 day cover for our oil supplies.  There is 60 days of supplies in the Republic, with some further days' supply in Northern Ireland, the UK and Europe.  That diversity whereby we do not have all these supplies located here is not a bad thing.  We are content that we have adequate cover.  The oil markets are open and accessible and while we source much of the supply from the UK, alternative sources are accessible in Europe should we need to divert our source of supply.  Tariffs are not applied to oil.</p> <p>  On the longer term arrangements for the single electricity market, I understand there are third country platforms, recognised by the EU, on which countries trade electricity.  The move is to get that recognised.  There would be some differences in that we know the UK is not recognised.  Even if it had similar law to the European Union, that law might not necessarily be judicable in the European courts.  There will be some differences to be worked out in establishing that.  However, there is a strong belief among all players that this is what they want to do.  The UK has signalled its intention to be compatible with the single electricity market which will continue to operate.  The expectation is that this is something that can be worked through.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-19a.122" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22019021900002#T00300"><p>I support the measures proposed for the legislation.  While I acknowledge that this is legally complex, the Minister referred to trading North and South and the benefits we all derive from that.  Can he give an update on the position regarding the North-South interconnector?  It has been planned for the past 15 or 20 years.  It has been stuck in our planning system and is now stuck in the political system in the North.  I understand the absence of an Executive or Assembly may threaten its urgent delivery.  Is it true that the North is in danger of blackouts and this is costing &euro;30 million annually?  Last week, the High Court in Belfast made a decision that may force the project to go back to planning, although I am unsure of the mechanism involved.  Does the Minister have a note or update on this?</p> <p>  More broadly, I asked Mr. Manley about UK wholesale prices.  My recollection was that they were 50% above the north-west European average wholesale electricity price.  When I checked the latest figures the sterling price converts to approximately 75 cent, while the EU wholesale price is roughly 50 cent when rounded up.  The UK electricity market has been 50% more expensive than those of its neighbours for some years.  The risk for us in the medium to long term is that we will get tied into a UK regional electricity market because we are such close neighbours and there is an interconnection and cross-dependence because of the price of gas influencing our electricity price.  Has the Minister had any dialogue with his counterparts in London, whether it is the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Mr. Greg Clark MP, or whoever is the key person now, about UK policy or strategy will take post Brexit?</p><p>If the UK continues to operate in isolation, its electricity prices will continue to be 50% higher than its continental competitors.  Over time, that would result in the mass migration of the digital services industry which is very sensitive to electricity prices.  Has the Minister been given any indication from the British side that the UK will seek to maintain membership of the North Sea offshore grid initiative which would result in much greater interconnection between Ireland, the UK, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and France?  The UK only has 4% interconnection now.  If it was abiding by European rules, that figure would be 15%.  Apart from that, if the UK wants to reduce its wholesale price, it must have a massive level of interconnection because building yet more nuclear power stations such as Hinkley Point will only make its system more expensive.  From negotiations or discussions with the UK, does the Minister have any sense of Britain's medium or long-term objectives in the electricity market?  If the UK decides to go isolated, there is a risk that we will be connected to an isolated system and we will import these high electricity prices which will place us at a disadvantage to our continental cousins.  Has the Minister examined this as a medium-term strategic issue for the State?</p></speech>

Would a new agreement between North and South be necessary following a crash-out, no deal Brexit?  Would we be back to the drawing board?</p> <p>  What would happen to the interconnector if there is an agreed withdrawal?  Business is very tight.  Brexit will have major consequences for the part of Ireland in which I live and work and which I represent.  One implication will be the tightening of margins on many fronts.  If energy prices rise, it could put firms out of business because many would not withstand energy price increases.  Will the Minister comment?</p></speech>

If there is an agreed withdrawal, the continuance of the North-South single market is recognised in the withdrawal agreement.  There is a strong commitment among all concerned to ensure it continues.  In the event of a crash-out, certain trades on the single electricity market will no longer occur.  However, the expectation is that the remaining trades - the security and supply trades and intra-day trades - will continue to support normal business on the system and that it will not lead to any short-term problems.  The CRU is taking this power which we hope to enact to give it additional capacity to alter licences to ensure the market is protected.</p><p>That is the position.  A  longer-term new agreement would have to be worked out along similar lines to those with Finland, Norway and Switzerland, which have third-party recognised grid interconnection and market operations.  There are precedents for integration of markets that are recognised by the European Union.  That would have to be worked out.  Obviously, we have been engaged in discussions at EU level in that regard.</p><p> On the point raised by Senator O'Reilly and Deputy Eamon Ryan regarding the North-South interconnector, the Supreme Court this morning cleared the project in the South to proceed.  However, as Deputy Eamon Ryan stated, last week the Northern Irish authorities requested that planning permission for the project be quashed in light of the fact that it was wrongly given the go-ahead in the absence of a ministerial presence.  New legislation has been introduced in Northern Ireland and it will allow the secretary general to provide the necessary approvals.  It appears that the Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure is considering restarting the planning process, although I am unaware of the details of that.</p></speech>

These are coal-fired plants that were identified for decommissioning and may not be ideal.  However, I do not think blackouts will occur.  Obviously, the continuing operation of the single market will address that issue.  All involved are determined that it will continue to operate.</p> <p>  I do not wish to be categoric about the UK strategy but, insofar as I can tell, it recognises the importance of being connected to the European Union market and wishes to maintain that benefit.  The statutory instruments on electricity cross-border trading matters it published signal its desire to maintain interconnection and engagement with the European market.  It wishes to continue to avail of the benefits of interconnection in this area.</p></speech>

There is a desire in Europe, the UK and here that the North-South single electricity market should continue to operate.  The wider relationship of the UK to Europe is a somewhat separate issue.  For example, the continuing operation of all interconnection is not noted in the withdrawal agreement as an objective or a desired objective.  I do not wish to speculate on this issue.</p></speech>

The withdrawal agreement has little detail on the energy market.  In effect, it is part of a future arrangement.  We should be honest.  The message I have from Brussels, Berlin and elsewhere is a point-blank insistence on any members of the single electricity market playing by the rules and accepting the ECJ as the final arbiter of those rules.  We would be better off being upfront and honest about that from the start.  There may be some legal hook by virtue of which the EU will allow the UK to get the benefit from that.  If we are not honest and straight about this, we could end up in an isolated UK and Ireland electricity market, which would be 50% more expensive than a continental equivalent and dramatically affect our digital, medical device and other industries as well as consumers.  It would be better to keep the UK in the market and be honest about what that entails.</p></speech>

Wanting to protect the single electricity market, North and South, does not mean we do not wish to rapidly proceed with a Celtic interconnector, as referenced by Deputy Dooley.  Later this year we will make a joint application with France for EU support for that project.  Maintaining the benefits of the single electricity market on the island of Ireland is not mutually exclusive from developing full integration into a wider European market.  Although the withdrawal of the UK is, of course, changing the situation on the east-west interconnector, we are alert to the point made by the Deputy.  We wish to maximise the benefits of EU membership without undermining the obvious benefits of being on an island and having an interconnected electricity system that has conferred significant benefits.</p></speech>

We will probably need several other interconnectors, particularly with the UK.  Another planned interconnector which will connect Wexford to the Welsh coast is imminent.  This is not an insignificant issue.  We should be honest and clear as to what is our strategic intent.  It should be the development of a north-west European regional electricity market.  It is vital that the UK forms part of that market.  We should be upfront on its rules to avoid ending up with a fractured system in five or ten years.  It is necessary to think five or ten years ahead on this issue.</p></speech>

It is great to be here.</p> <p>  The number of Brexit-related matters that lie in the areas of responsibility of my Department or Tusla to address in their entirety are small.  Of course, there is a multitude of issues raised by the Brexit process which may impact across all of Government, on its services and on the citizens and businesses of this State.  I would like to use our time today to focus on issues of specific interest to the committee.  In particular, there are a small number of areas in respect of which, in conjunction with other departmental colleagues, my officials are seeking to mitigate our potential exposure post the UK leaving the European Union.</p> <p>  Before getting to those issues, may I highlight some of the issues that have been consistently raised by young people as matters of concern to them?  I thought it was really important the Department would go to them and hear from them.  Those issues have remained remarkably consistent since the intention of the UK to leave the European Union was confirmed.  </p> <p>  From my own Brexit-related consultations with young people in Croke Park and D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g and the Ombudsman for Children's consultations with young people on Brexit and other events, the themes that are coming from them are pretty much the same.  They may be summarised as follows.  Brexit will impact profoundly on the island of Ireland and the current generation of young people will be those who will have to live with the decisions made during the negotiations.  A hard border and regression to the violence of the past is to be avoided at all costs.  The Good Friday Agreement is to be protected.  Brexit must not be utilised to drive deeper societal division.  Brexit must not limit opportunity for those on the island of Ireland.  Work, travel and study opportunity for all must be maintained.  The North-South co-operation in healthcare, education, policing, safety and child protection must remain.  Access to services must be guaranteed.</p><p>While all of these issues are of concern to young people on this island, most of them fall to other Departments and agencies to address.  For example, access to education is a matter for colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills and the Good Friday Agreement falls within the remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which, as the committee will be aware, is leading on much of our Brexit response, including in respect of areas such as the common travel area.  This matter is really important for young people in particular and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade works closely with the Department of Justice and Equality and a number of other Departments in this area.  Responding to Brexit is a whole-of-Government exercise.</p><p> Moving to my Department, we work with the structures established by the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs and Trade to deal with Brexit related matters.  In this regard, my officials have consistently contributed to the interdepartmental group on EU and Brexit, the Brexit co-ordinators group and the interdepartmental North-South co-ordinators group.  This is in addition to representation on the groups dealing with a no-deal Brexit planning at Secretary General and assistant secretary general level which meet on a weekly basis.  In light of this significant and ongoing analysis, three key issues have been identified as having the potential to impact to a greater or lesser degree on my Department and its work with Tusla.</p><p> The first issue is Council Regulation EC No. 2201/2003, Brussels IIa, which governs jurisdiction and recognition of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility.   While the majority of this regulation is applicable to private law matters and, therefore, related domestic issues would fall to the Department of Justice and Equality for consideration, the regulation does provide the framework by which children in the care of a member state may be transferred to the jurisdiction of another member state.  The regulation also sets out the issues for consideration in any proposed transfer of childcare proceedings from one member state to another, as well as providing a mechanism by which reports on children and families may be sought by relevant courts from member states.  Where this regulation would have most resonance is in the transfer of young people to the UK for secure care or advanced therapeutic mental health services.  At any point, there are roughly ten young Irish citizens being cared for in out-of-State provision.  In a similar fashion, children from Northern Ireland placed in settings predominantly in the Border counties avail of the regulation to govern such placements.  Legislation is not required in the event of Brussels IIa not being carried forward by the UK post-Brexit.  While it would be prudent to draw up an agreement or a bilateral to restate the agreed procedures for out-of-State placements, there would be no legal impediment to such placements even without Brussels II.  Moreover, the Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Act 2000 would facilitate placements similar to that operating under Brussels IIa.  Consideration is being given to the need to put in place new protocols for consistency of practice and effective communications.</p><p> The second issue is recognition of qualifications.  In tandem with other sectors, such as health, the recognition of professional qualifications into the future poses a particular challenge.  Recognition of qualifications is a matter that is being led by colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills.  The greatest source of potential impact for areas covered by my Department would be qualifications relevant to social work given the ongoing drive for the recruitment of social workers by Tusla.  However, the risk associated with any divergence in qualifications is currently considered to be low.  A process already exists within my Department for recognition of early years qualifications from third countries.  This has been discussed with UK representatives at the British-Irish Council early years working group.  This group will continue to provide an opportunity to exchange views on these issues.  My Department has been liaising with the Department of Education and Skills on this matter.  The latter has not raised any concerns regarding recognition of qualifications post-Brexit and is well equipped to deal with future recognition.</p><p>The third area is PEACE funding.  This issue was also raised by young people in some of the earlier sessions.  Youth services are included under the current PEACE IV programme, which means Brexit will impact in the context of PEACE funding.  We welcome the commitments of the UK to the current PEACE programme and to a future PEACE PLUS programme, as well as the European Commission's proposals to ensure continuity of these vital funds.  My Department and I will continue to advocate for the inclusion of the youth streams in a future programme.  Any loss in this area would be a lost opportunity regarding funding for future youth services on both sides of the Border. </p><p> While confident the current PEACE programme will be maintained, any funding impacts on youth services as a result of Brexit will be kept under review throughout 2019.  Depending on the exit mechanism chosen by the UK Government, I am conscious of the potential for Brexit to have varying degrees of impact on the young people of this State.  My officials and I, however, are committed to working closely with colleagues at all levels of Government to ensure everything possible is done to mitigate any potential negative consequences of the decision of the UK to leave the EU in light of Brexit.</p><p> That concludes my opening remarks.  I would be delighted to hear the views of the committee on this important topic and I have a group of great officials here to assist us.</p></speech>

I have two questions before calling Deputy Rabbitte.  I appreciate this matter is not entirely within the remit of the Minister's Department, but given the presumed imminent departure of the UK from the European Union, with or without a deal and perhaps after an extension period, what steps can the State take to ensure mutual recognition of educational qualifications?  Has the UK indicated to the Irish Government any proposed divergence from the standards regarding educational qualifications?  Does the Minister envisage that there will be an impact upon our ability to recruit, in particular, social workers and social care workers?  I am aware the committee discussed this issue last week and those two issues will be very important.  Second, could the Minister go into some more detail about PEACE funding and how it affects her Department?  Those are my two questions.  I will call Deputy Rabbitte after the Minister responds.</p></speech>

In the context of a no-deal Brexit, the Department of Education and Skills is leading work, with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other Departments, to ensure, as far as possible, the provision of arrangements with the UK for the mutual recognition of qualifications.  Aspects of that work will be referenced in the Bill we will be publishing on Brexit.  Regarding anything not required to have a legislative basis, my understanding is that, as with other issues, we wish to ensure as much of an opportunity as possible for our young people by ensuring there are appropriate bilateral agreements between the jurisdictions.</p> <p>   The second part of the question posed concerned the recognition of qualifications and the recruitment of social workers.  I referred to that as well.  I am aware this committee discussed this issue last week or the week before.  We are dealing with a global shortage of social workers.  Tusla is well aware of that difficulty.  It has to accept that situation and still move forward in finding new solutions to those recruitment challenges.  It is also important to state that the issue of mutual recognition of qualifications also arises in the case of newly qualified workers.  My colleague, Mr. Quinlan, might like to comment on that last aspect.</p></speech>

That process already looks at individual applications for recognition and generally approves those.</p><p>As I said, there are already mechanisms in place to ensure that should not be a problem, particularly for social workers.</p></speech>

Has there been any discussion on this issue with the UK and, if so, are there any indications that it is planning to depart from existing arrangements?  In regard to qualification recognition, is there something the UK could or may do that will result in that arrangement being broken or does it fall with Brexit?  To the best of my knowledge, it does not.</p></speech>

My understanding is that it is on the basis of course content rather than qualification.  If course content is recognised, then that will continue.  Currently qualified people will continue to be recognised, but recognition of newly qualified people will be dependent on course content, which is considered by CORU.  As long as there is a course content that is suitable and acceptable to CORU, that will happen.  This goes to the broader question of how the Department of Education and Skills is considering the broader issue of qualifications.  I hope that answers the Chairman's question.</p></speech>

There have been issues in terms of the Department recognising qualifications from other jurisdictions.  In my experience, getting the Department to recognise or make a decision on recognition takes a long time.  My concern is that if the UK failed to address this matter adequately in its negotiations with the EU, or the EU did not adequately address it with the UK, and there were to be a divergence in the future, the delay that might occur when the European Union looked to those criteria in respect of which the curriculum for qualifying social workers or any other profession had changed could mean that Ireland might suffer as a result.  We do not have a large enough population to meet our requirement for social workers.  Rather, we do not have enough of them and recruitment is insufficient to cater for the demand that exists.  I want to flag this as an issue which the Minister might raise in her next conversation on this matter with the Minister for Education and Skills.</p></speech>

Anyone outside of that can apply through CORU for a recognition process.  There is no automatic approval of courses from the UK as such.  People have to apply for recognition based on course content and relevant work experience.  The recognition process considers such applications and approves the applicant as meeting the standards of proficiency as set out in the Act.  There should not be any blockage to anybody, even in a no-deal Brexit, being able to apply for a recognition process through CORU and have his or her qualification recognised here for social work in particular.</p></speech>

On the second question regarding PEACE funding, my Department's Vote for 2019 includes &euro;2.1 million for PEACE funding.  The PEACE programme is 85% funded by the European Union, 7.5% by Ireland and 7.5% by Northern Ireland.  It is important to point out that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has informed us that the Commission has guaranteed to continue funding under the PEACE IV programme, including the UK Government element should the UK Government renege on its previous commitment to fund its portion of the current programme, which is in place until 2021.</p><p>That is not to say the UK is anywhere near considering that option.  Should that be the case, however, this is the contingency plan.  The draft withdrawal agreement and the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal for regulation in the event of a disorderly Brexit both provide the legal basis for the PEACE and INTERREG programmes to continue once the UK leaves the EU.</p></speech>

I felt they were ahead of the curve, whereas adults might not have been taking the matter as seriously.  Those children were taking it very seriously and their voices were well heard.  My question to the Minister concerns what she said in her opening statement about her Department having a small role to play.  That may be the case but what happens in her Department feeds into the other Departments that have a larger role.  I am referring to the Department of Justice and Equality, in particular, regarding issues of child protection.  We have a good working relationship at the moment with the PSNI and the British police forces and there is good sharing of information across borders.</p> <p>  In the context of a no-deal Brexit, which is the vacuum we are talking about, what is the Minister's understanding of how we will share information?  How are we also going to ensure we deal effectively with the issue of child protection?  That is a major concern for me.   A unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the Phoenix Park specialises in working on child protection issues, including child trafficking.  How will those issues be approached if the United Kingdom becomes a third country?  What I have referred to relates to the Department of Justice and Equality. </p> <p>  How many meetings have the Minister and her officials had with the Minister for Health, the Minister of State with special responsibility for mental health issues and older people, the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Justice and Equality in the past 12 months?  I am sure those Departments are liaising with the Minister&rsquo;s Department on issues such as care orders which might involve having to send children to the UK for various forms of support or treatment.  How will that continue?  In her statement, the Minister referred to "consideration" being given to the need for putting in place new protocols for consistency of practice and effective communications.  What does "consideration" mean?  Why has it not been put into practice and where are we at with that process of consideration?  Those are my questions and I thank the Minister. </p></speech>

Deputy Rabbitte was right when she stated that the concerns I referenced were expressed already by the young people themselves.  Issues concerning child protection and the sharing of information, especially between the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are critical.  We discussed some of those issues today at Cabinet as a number are covered in the legislative change required in the context of Brexit.  At the same time, we fully intend that type of information sharing to continue, both in the context of the practices and protocols that have developed as well as in any legislative changes required.  Those issues, therefore, are being dealt with very explicitly.</p> <p>  In the context of the legislative framework, sharing of information continues as well from the perspective of the child&rsquo;s best interest, the public interest and on the legal basis of the Children First Act 2015 and the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012.  That is just to begin to answer Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s first question.  Turning to the Deputy's second question, there have been regular conversations, to which I have contributed, at Cabinet with the other Ministers concerned with these issues.</p><p>Complementing that, and perhaps more in terms of the detail to which the Deputy is referring, all of the Secretaries General have been meeting on a regular basis during the past six months in order to tease out some of the detail of some of these other issues.  Ms Fisher will add to my remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-19a.180" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Eacute;imear Fisher" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019021900002#J00200"><p>We certainly have had contact on a bilateral basis but also all of this is co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach through our weekly meetings of Secretaries General, the weekly meetings of the assistant secretaries and the meetings of the co-ordinators, where these issues are raised.  Apart from that we have raised issues that we have identified and which all Departments were required to do some time ago.  The Deputy has raised a question on the key issues for our Department.</p> <p>  In respect of child protection and sharing of information, the legal advice we received was that it was quite strong in that the child's best interest would always trump any other situation, for example if it is in the child's best interest to share the information, one shares the information.  Falling back from that is the public interest, which would be a safety net also but finally there would be the legal basis for the sharing of information, which is set out in the Children First Act 2015, and the Criminal Justice (Withholding of information on Offences Against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012.  If all of that still does not provide the certainty, which we would say it does, if there is still something behind that, then there would be a need for a protocol, but there is no legislation required as of this time.  </p> <p>  Secure care information can be shared on those three bases also, but in the light of the uncertainty as to how Britain will leave, it is impossible to put those agreements in place at present.  The understanding from the Department of Justice and Equality is that the Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Act 2000 steps in regarding the placing of children in other jurisdictions, from one member state to another member state.  That would facilitate the placing of children in another member state.  If Britain moves, the Hague Convention steps in.  Behind that we are also considering a protocol for a belt and braces requirement.  It will not be required, but at the same time, ar eagla na heagla we will look at that as well. </p></speech>

We have spoken about the belt and braces and we have spoken about secure care, but if we could step it back a little further again, what about a child protection issue where a child would be abducted in Ireland and brought to the United Kingdom or Northern Ireland, or <i>vice versa</i>, a child abducted in the UK and brought into Northern Ireland?  What measures and protocols would be in place there?</p></speech>

First the Hague Convention would apply.  On the protection of children in the context of criminal offences, sharing of information would always be done.  In the case of the prevention of crime, if there was even a suggestion that a child might be abducted, even before the child was actually abducted, where it was in the interest of the prevention of crime, there would be a sharing of information.  If the child is actually abducted, the police would share information but the Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Act 2000  would also be a safety net.</p></speech>

I have a question on foster care placements.  Is there any expected impact on these services because I note in the general scheme of the Bill, there is a mention of an amendment to ensure that payments coming from the British authorities will not be taxed in Ireland?  I am guessing from that this relates to cross-Border fostering.  How many cross-Border fostering placements do we have?  Regardless of the deal, will this have an impact on the children who are in foster care?</p></speech>

My question was pre-empted by Deputy Rabbitte.  My main concern is about out-of-state placements for our children.  We all know how difficult it is to make these placements.  Sometimes, it can take months and even years.  In her opening statement, the Minister said there would be no legal impediment to such placements.  What impediments could there be?</p> <p>  Why does she not know how Britain will respond if it is going to leave the European Union?  Will it still honour any out-of-state placements?  The Hague Convention will kick in if there are issues.  However, has she had conversations with her British counterpart about out-of-state placements?</p></speech>

I do not believe it should be lost in the discussion that they brought the voices of young people here, which is to be welcomed.  That is a shift from the past and from my experience in these buildings.  Modernity beckons and change is all around.  In terms of the all-island civil dialogue, young people in the North are increasingly looking to the progress we have made here, be it through marriage equality or repeal of the eighth amendment.</p><p>Change is all around and the challenge we face is managing it.  In the event of a crash-out, the Department must be ready and willing to again go back to listen to the voices of young people and their aspirations.  My sense is that the call for Irish unity is building and we should not be afraid of that conversation.  That conversation should be inclusive.</p><p> I have a Bill which concerns one of the actions in the LGBTI youth strategy regarding conversion therapy.  The deadline for this action is 2019.  Does the Minister have a concern that the ongoing work of her Department across the strategies will be impacted?  Can we expect delays in the delivery of any of the actions in the LGBTI youth strategy?</p></speech>

It is in my memory of those larger events.  In the ongoing conversations about the reality of Brexit, young people have voiced concerns and effectively stated there are things that cannot change on our island.  They do not have any memory of ways other than what they have experienced.  They are not willing to go back and want the adults to sort it out.  They have given us much time to sort it out and we are still working on that.  Whatever the resolutions are, it would be important to have young people assist us in finding better solutions than we were able to do ourselves.  Young people should be able to insist that they should have similar opportunities and the access that they have now.</p> <p>  On the Senator&rsquo;s second question, it ultimately depends on how the change will happen.  It will depend on whether there is an acceptance of the withdrawal agreement as it is, or a long extension is granted to the withdrawal or there is a no-deal crash-out.  Each will have a different economic impact.  I have just come from an extended conversation about these issues at the Cabinet.  The Government is aware that the economic impact of whatever will happen will be massive.  We have to figure out a way to ensure that not only are we able to find ways to build on the positive economic changes we have had for some time, but also to build on the social changes, as well as finding the resources to continue to do so.</p> <p>  Can we absolutely guarantee this?  I do not know if we can guarantee anything at the moment, certainly in terms of the resources which would be available for such work.  Our EU membership is our greatest protection from the challenges that Brexit will bring.  Whatever way the exit happens, we will depend on our membership of the EU and look for new ways as to how this membership will assist us economically, as well as socially.</p></speech>

We looked at the issue of child protection and that was discounted as one that would be escalated to the level of a key issue because of the safety nets that are there.</p> <p>  The three issues remain the Brussels II regulation, qualifications and PEACE funding.  There are no others.  We trawled the entire Department and the units within it twice in order to be absolutely sure that no Brexit impact was lurking for the Department or for children's services.  There was absolutely nothing apart from the three which were escalated to this level.</p> <p>  We are confident about child protection.  We have had discussions with our legal advisers on that.  I do not think there is anything else that we could have done, to be perfectly honest.  We attend the weekly Secretaries General meeting and assistant secretaries meeting, so we listen to what is happening in other Departments.  We get all those papers and that informs our thinking.  We are fairly confident that all corners have been covered.</p></speech>

Regardless of which path the UK takes, it is the citizens of this State to whom this committee and the Department are answerable.  They will feel the effects for many years to come and it is important to say that.  I also re-state something the Minister said a few moments ago which is critical and supported by all Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  It speaks to the direction this State has taken the negotiations and its approach to Brexit and it should speak volumes when the children of today look back on what the Government and the Oireachtas were doing when Brexit occurred.  We have found strength in one another in the context of our approach to the problem which has presented itself but which is not of our making.  The Minister correctly pointed out that our strength is in our membership of the European Union and the fact that we are going to deal with this collectively.</p> <p>  Does the Minister wish to make any concluding remarks?</p></speech>

This meeting has been preceded by correspondence spanning more than a year and a half and, as such, I am sure that all concerned are pleased that we have finally reached this point.  As I am time bound in delivering my opening statement, I will get to the point.  The question was posed at the committee's meeting of 5 February as to whether the ODCE is fit for purpose.  In a similar, albeit more colourful, vein, it was asserted that the ODCE is &quot;an appallingly failed entity&quot;.  It is, of course, entirely legitimate for legislators to question whether the ODCE is fit for purpose given the provenance of the general scheme of the Bill currently before the committee.  However, it is respectfully submitted that any such assessment should be conducted by reference to the facts &ndash; and I will return to the facts later.<br/><br/>Incorporation with limited liability is a privilege conferred by the State for the purpose of encouraging and facilitating entrepreneurial activity.  In return, company law imposes requirements on those who benefit from that privilege and confers rights upon, among others, companies' members and creditors.  However, 20 years ago, company law was, to all intents and purposes, unenforced in this jurisdiction.  That state of affairs was judged to be unacceptable by the legislators of the day and gave rise to the enactment of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, CLEA, which provided for the establishment of the ODCE.<br/><br/>The CLEA, which was subsequently subsumed into the Companies Act 2014, conferred the ODCE with three core functions, namely, to promote compliance with company law, to exercise a supervisory remit <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>insolvent companies, and to investigate suspected breaches of company law and take appropriate enforcement action.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, the office has, through a combination of High Court applications, detailed assessment of liquidators' statutory reports and, more recently, by way of offering statutory undertakings, overseen the restriction of 1,648 directors of insolvent companies and the disqualification of a further 228 company directors.  While both restriction and disqualification have a punitive dimension, their principal purpose is to protect members of the public.  Consequently, both have serious implications for the almost 1,900 individuals concerned and contravention of either can expose one to both unlimited personal liability and criminal sanction.<br/><br/>For similar reasons of creditor protection, company law imposes limits on the extent to which company directors, and persons connected with them, can extract funds from companies by way of borrowings, thereby reducing the funds available to meet creditor obligations.  Over the past decade, ODCE intervention has resulted in unlawful directors' loans to the value of &euro;500 million being rectified.  Multiple other instances of non-compliance have, similarly, been addressed through cost effective approaches including the issuing of warnings and statutory directions.  The latter category of action includes, for example, assisting homeowners to vindicate their rights as members of property management companies &ndash; an extraordinarily important issue for those concerned.<br/><br/>At the other end of the civil enforcement spectrum, following a major investigation over the course of a year and a half the ODCE filed papers with the High Court in March 2018 signalling its intention to apply for the appointment of inspectors to the publicly quoted Independent News &amp;amp; Media plc.  In response, the company initiated judicial review proceedings seeking to quash the ODCE's decision to seek the appointment of inspectors, and in so doing, arguing that the ODCE had been under an obligation to consult with the company in advance.  In June 2018, the High Court rejected the company's arguments and dismissed the judicial review.  Following the hearing of the subsequent application for the appointment of inspectors, which was vigorously opposed, the High Court delivered judgment in September 2018.  In delivering his judgment, the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Kelly, concluded: </p> <blockquote> 	As I said in the DCC case on the topic of proportionality, the appointment of inspectors is a serious matter and such a sledgehammer should not be used to crack a nut.  What has been disclosed in the evidence before me is no nut.  The appointment of inspectors to ascertain the truth of what has allegedly gone on in the company is well justified and is not disproportionate.  None of the issues raised by the company warrant the court exercising its discretion against making the order sought.  It may be that there will be a complete explanation for all of the Director's concerns but if there is not then what is alleged is very serious indeed.  The evidence merits the appointment of inspectors and that is the order I make...&rdquo;. </blockquote> <p>In the realm of criminal law, over the past decade, the ODCE has both initiated prosecutions in the District Court and referred matters to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, on foot of which numerous charges have been directed on indictment.  Over that period, convictions have been recorded on 97 counts in the District Court, with multiple other charges being taken into consideration, and convictions on indictment have been recorded on 46 counts in the Circuit Court.<br/><br/>Of course, by far the highest profile prosecutions associated with the ODCE are those that related to the former Anglo Irish Bank Corporation plc, or Anglo.  Before I address the matter of DPP <i>v</i>. FitzPatrick, it is important to place on record that the ODCE's Anglo-related investigation, which comprised of five separate investigations, resulted in four trials, all of which resulted in persons being convicted on indictment of criminal offences.  In the narrative that has followed DPP <i>v</i>. FitzPatrick, sight is sometimes lost of that fact.  It is also important to note that it has never been suggested in any court that any of the investigations were in any way deficient or below the requisite standard.  Specifically, the aforementioned trials resulted in Mr. William McAteer and Mr. Patrick Whelan, both former directors of Anglo, each being convicted on ten counts of the provision of unlawful financial assistance contrary to section 60 of the Companies Act 1963, as amended; Mr. William McAteer being convicted on one count of fraudulent trading contrary to section 297 of the Companies Act 1963; Mr. Patrick Whelan being convicted on one count of failure to maintain a licensed bank's register of lending to directors contrary to section 44 of the Companies Act 1990; and Mr. David Drumm, also a former director of Anglo, being convicted on ten counts of the provision of unlawful financial assistance contrary to section 60 of the Companies Act 1963, as amended.<br/><br/>In addition to all of the foregoing, since its establishment, the ODCE has published a substantial number of guidance documents for the benefit of those engaging with companies in a range of capacities.  Those documents are widely regarded by stakeholders, both professional and lay, as being of an excellent standard and an invaluable reference tool.<br/><br/>I will turn now to the matter of DPP <i>v</i>. FitzPatrick.  In circumstances where the report that I submitted to the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation in June 2017 cannot be published, in response to the committee's stated desire to discuss the matter of DPP <i>v</i>. FitzPatrick, by letter dated 22 December 2017, I indicated my intention to provide the committee with a detailed submission on the matter in order that it could discharge its functions of holding the ODCE to account and scrutinising proposed legislation on an informed basis.</p><p>As is plainly evident from my correspondence with the committee, of necessity, there is considerable overlap between my proposed submission and the report submitted to the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister.  However, on two separate occasions thereafter, the committee stated to the ODCE-----</p></speech>

In a statement dated 23 May 2017, the ODCE fully accepted the judicial criticism directed at it.  Moreover, valuable lessons, particularly as regards risk management, have been learned.<br/><br/>However, in assessing whether serious failures that manifested in one investigation, which was a subset of a broader suite of investigations, which, in turn, were a subset of the ODCE's broader enforcement work, can validly be extrapolated to draw conclusions as to the ODCE's overall fitness for purpose almost ten years later or as to whether it is &quot;an appallingly failed entity&quot;, the following considerations are of relevance.<br/><br/>The scale of the five investigations into Anglo Irish Bank, when taken in aggregate, was unprecedented, not merely in terms of the ODCE's history up to that point but, arguably, in the history of the State.  Unfortunately, the risks associated with taking on a suite of investigations of this scale were not sufficiently appreciated at the time.  As a consequence, those risks were not appropriately mitigated.<br/><br/>Given that the trial judge cited, as being the most fundamental error, the manner in which the ODCE went about taking witness statements from two Ernst &amp;amp; Young audit partners, among several matters, the following is of relevance.  The statements in question were obtained during the period January 2009 to June 2012, almost ten years ago.  During the period July 2010 to January 2012, approximately 60 statements were taken from other witnesses during the course of the investigation.  None of those statements attracted any criticism from either the defence or the court.  As is evidenced by the transcripts of the trial and other relevant documentation, much of which is included in the proposed submission and virtually all of which was ventilated in open court, the factors that contributed to the trial judge ultimately directing the jury to acquit the accused extend well beyond the failures that occurred within the ODCE.  Whereas it may not fit neatly with the narrative, as evidenced by the fact that four of the five Anglo-related investigations conducted by the ODCE resulted in convictions before the courts, notwithstanding the failures that occurred in the investigation that preceded DPP <i>v</i>. FitzPatrick, an enormous level of high-quality investigative work was done over that period, an achievement that, unfortunately, came at a considerable human cost.<br/><br/>I trust the briefing material provided in advance of the meeting has been of assistance.  My colleagues and I look forward to the discussion to follow.  In particular, I reiterate that I am happy to discuss any aspect of DPP <i>v</i>. FitzPatrick, provided that any such discussion is based on the facts.</p></speech>

It is not just the integrity of company law that is involved but the integrity of the State and how it is viewed by the outside world.  It is important we ensure the office has a prosecutorial role with the capacity and wherewithal to do its job.  I do not want to see the office as a failed entity.  It must have all the resources available to it to perform its duties.</p> <p>  In that context, the questions we must ask are around the proposed scheme of companies (corporate enforcement authority) Bill.  Would it have addressed some of the challenges which the ODCE has faced?  While we might try to put a gloss on it and pretend it did not happen, there was a large criminal trial.  Judge John Aylmer, the trial judge, was, to say the least, unkind to the ODCE about its performance and how it collated evidence, addressed the issue of statement taking and the basic presentation of the case in the trial itself.  That is a fact which cannot be disputed.  If it is, we can move it to another stage in our discussions.  Are the heads of the Bill, as outlined, sufficient to address the issues of what was thrown up during the trial and of which Judge Aylmer was so scathing in terms of the State's ability to prosecute?</p> <p>  I was once a Minister of State in the Department which oversees the ODCE.  I would have had discussions with Mr. Drennan's predecessor around the issue of resourcing.  Complex trials can come about in the area of company law.  Resources can be taken from or bequeathed to the ODCE at the whim of the Department, a Secretary General, Minister or Minister of State.  Looking at the make-up of the staff available to the office over many years, it is certainly not compatible with what is required to deal with the complexities of company law, investigate any breaches and then potentially prosecute them.</p> <p>  Is Mr. Drennan satisfied there is enough independence provided in the heads of the Bill around the issue of assessing and adjudicating the required resources for the day-to-day workings of the office and taking an individual or a company to court?  It must be borne in mind that the largest criminal trial involving the ODCE collapsed and the judge was not complimentary to say the least.</p> <p>  The report suggested there should be greater co-operation or use of the resources of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in presenting a case and taking statements.  Does Mr. Drennan believe that has been sufficiently addressed in the heads of the Bill?</p> <p>  When one looks at the expertise on which the ODCE can call, where does Mr. Drennan see the decision-making process sitting with the DPP?  Is there an overlap?  Should the DPP have more of a prosecutorial role in the ODCE or should the ODCE be allowed to act more independently?</p></speech>

Initially, he used the word "unkind" and then subsequently used the word "scathing".  I agree scathing is the more accurate adjective.  The trial judge was scathing.  We are on record as saying rightly so in respect of many of the issues which arose.</p><p>On the resources that the Deputy referenced, there are a couple of issue within that such as expertise.  When I took up the position, I went on record soon after being appointed that I was of the view that the office would require further professionalisation.  That resulted, with the support of various Ministers and Governments.  A fairly significant recruitment programme has taken place thereafter and many of the people sitting before the committee are people who are a product of that.  Both of the enforcement managers sitting beside me are relatively new, one of whom is a barrister while the other is a forensic accountant.  We also have a digital forensic specialist and a whole range of new skills have been brought to the organisation and have fairly substantially enhanced our capability across a range of activities.<br/><br/>The Deputy referenced independence.  On statutory independence and decision-making, in my tenure there has never been an issue and I have never experienced any degree of interference or anything such as that.  Independence is about being able to do one's job on a day-to-day basis, which is tied in with resources and the Deputy raised an important point, namely that one of the key measures within this Bill is the proposal to transition the ODCE from being an office of the Department to being an agency.  I know the Deputy is fully conversant with that, having been there.  I should preface my remarks by saying that I was formerly a chief executive officer, CEO, of an agency, the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, which also comes within the committee's remit.  As I did that for eight years, I have a pretty significant level of understanding as to how an agency operates, how an office operates and the differences between them.  The reality is that one's ability to manage one's own resources, to fill vacancies when they arise and to do important things such as a succession plan is considerably enhanced in an agency environment <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>an office because the reality is that whereas we have a number of individuals who are hired directly through open competition in the newspapers, another cohort of staff are officers of the Department, who are effectively assigned to the ODCE and that area is more problematic.  The Deputy will know that himself from the internal workings of Departments.  When a vacancy within that cohort arises, one really just joins the queue and the officials from the Department effectively touched on that last week.  Then one becomes part of the broader staffing priorities of a Department, which are entirely legitimate from a Department's perspective but do not necessarily align with our interests, whereas if one is in an agency and a vacancy is coming up, one can just get on with filling the vacancy through open competition to ensure that people with the requisite skill sets are being hired.<br/><br/>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was the next issue.  The first thing I should say is that in my experience, during the six years I have been in the organisation, we have had an excellent working relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As the Deputy is aware, we have a cohort of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na seconded to the office.  Traditionally they are seconded from what used to be the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and is now the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, GNECB.  Detective Inspector O'Keeffe is here with us and he heads up our Garda unit.  In addition to having those individuals in house, we also have an excellent working relationship with the fraud bureau and more broadly with Garda management.  We participate on an ongoing basis in the training which I referenced in some of the documents, such as interview training and search training and we have only done some of that relatively recently.  We have participated in education programmes that it has run and so on.  Detective Inspector O'Keeffe may or may not wish to add to this but if, for example, we were engaging in a search operation or in arrests and detentions, he is in a position to call in a dedicated search team from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to assist.  Does he wish to elaborate on that?</p></speech>

An operation called on assistance from the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau for resources, as well as for resources from around the country when we were effecting an arrest in respect of an ODCE investigation.  I was seconded late last year and we have two detective sergeants and four detective garda&iacute; who are attached and it is full-time secondment to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.

It is important to make the distinction that no more than An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we are an investigative body.  The DPP is entirely independent and decides whether charges should be directed.  It is entirely independent and while we have a good working relationship with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, it is nevertheless the case that we each respect each other's independence.  The Deputy's question in effect was whether the DPP should be taking a greater role if I understood it correctly.  That would probably be inconsistent with our role and with that of the DPP because there has to be clear blue water between us.  We do the investigation and submit the file to the DPP, whereupon it decides, based on the evidence before it, whether there is a sufficient case to direct charges against an individual.</p></speech>

What is likely to be different is that, given the nature of that broad white-collar category, a great volume of the material that we would ordinarily obtain through whatever course in an investigation of that nature is documentary based, either in hard copies or electronic copies, whatever the case may be.  We can obtain that by production orders, which is a statutory order we serve on individuals.  A search can be executed as well.  That can be supplemented by witness statements and various other information and evidence that has been accumulated.  It is all brought together in the same way as any other investigative file.  We pull together what we have and then we generally have recommendations on the front based on the evidence we have identified before us.  We make recommendations to the DPP and thereafter, it is entirely a matter for that office.  In the normal course, particularly in the larger investigations, it engages counsel to provide advices on proofs and so on.  It identifies its particular issues with meeting ingredients of particular offences and whether it needs to come back to us for further statements, or whatever the case may be, and then it ultimately will make the decision on whether it is appropriate to direct charges on indictment.</p></speech>

That ongoing dialogue obviously respects the independence of both parties but generally speaking, the DPP will take in the file and if it is in any way complicated, it generally will engage counsel to give advices on proofs.  Issues will undoubtedly arise out of that and there are discussions around a whole range of issues, about which I will not go into the detail, but that dialogue is ongoing and as I said earlier, we have an excellent working relationship with the DPP.</p></speech>

It is most helpful and appreciated and it will assist us in our work.  We met for over two hours just before the ODCE's attendance here to discuss the document and the ODCE's submission.  We had quite a robust exchange and the majority of members want to see that document in the public domain in the public interest and that is very much supported by the Chairman.  I was persuaded by Mr. Drennan's argument that as a committee, we would be unable to reach fact-based and evidence-based conclusions in our pre-legislative scrutiny work without having sight of that document in its entirety.  I found that to be a highly persuasive argument from someone who is an officer of the State, having served for a number of years in his role and having considerable experience.  That particular advice from Mr. Drennan was quite persuasive.  We may have challenges, as the ODCE probably will be aware.  The issue around the status of the document, were it to be circulated to committee members, as opposed to through the clerk, was identified and the ODCE is aware of that also.  I would be eager to see that go to the clerk and be circulated.  The ODCE probably also will be aware that we could have difficulties, in that it is likely that it would be referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser and there could be some blockages there.  We certainly will do our best, however, in the public interest to get all relevant information to the public, so I thank the ODCE for that.</p> <p>  On the necessary information to which the ODCE refers and the information it says members need to do their work of pre-legislative scrutiny, can the witnesses give us some idea as to what that information is?  I understand the restrictions in giving out that information but can the witnesses give us some broad parameters as to what we might be looking at and what we are missing while we are doing our work?  Can Mr. Drennan give an opinion on whether any of the information he seeks to provide might prejudice him in his current role?</p><p>Could Mr. Drennan articulate why he says we need the information he was seeking to provide in order for us to perform our parliamentary duty of pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill?</p></speech>

The first is on what the information is.  The first letter I received from the committee in the days following the direction to acquit the accused set out in pretty strident terms what it wanted to discuss.  It was perfectly understandable at the time.  My concern at that time was that the Parliament has a statutory duty to hold the ODCE to account.  As I hope has been abundantly clear from the correspondence issued by the ODCE to the committee, our duty to account to the Parliament is one I take very seriously.  In more recent correspondence, there was a specific reference to the question of whether I had views on whether the trial judge's final ruling was a comprehensive analysis of the issues within the ODCE and so on.  As I said in the correspondence in reply, the trial judge's final ruling was in respect of two defence applications.  The Deputy is a barrister so she will understand that.  The ruling was in relation to two defence applications; it was not a full account of the whole investigation of the whole trial.  It was not a full critique.  Therefore, by definition, that ruling could never provide a full understanding of all the issues that arose before it was made.  Given the particular issues and themes that arose in the ruling, including coaching, contamination and cross-contamination, it seems that in order to form a view as to whether this legislation meets the requirements in terms of where it came from and so on, one needs to understand what went wrong.  If one wants to understand what went wrong, one must realise that one trial judge ruling that deals with very specific issues arising over any amount of newspaper coverage or whatever will not give one an understanding at the level needed.  That can really only be gained by reference to the underlying documents.  Clearly, it is not a comprehensive account, nor is it an investigation.  I have made that clear before.  Rather, it was a matter of pulling together the more salient documents and other pieces of information, correspondence and communications so members could look at the matter in the round and say they understood what happened, what went wrong, what ultimately led the trial judge to rule in a particular way, and the basis for the defence counsel mounting certain arguments and so on.  That specifically relates to the coaching, contamination, cross-contamination, investigative bias and the failure to investigate issues because they are all tied up in the one package.  I refer to the two EY witnesses.</p> <p>  The trial judge made reference to the issue of disclosure.  The document I had prepared for the committee elaborates on this and where there may have been difficulties in order to give it a better understanding of why the judge might have taken a particular view on disclosure and the deficiency, or otherwise, thereof.  The other issue is the destruction of documents, which is in a completely different category.  That is the nature of the information.  It is to give committee members a fuller understanding of how these issues arose and, in essence, what went wrong.</p> <p>  The Deputy's second question was whether there is anything in the document that, in my assessment, prejudices my functions.  In a letter at some time around December 2017 &mdash; I cannot remember the exact date &mdash; I corresponded with the committee.  At that point, I set out the basis on which I had formed the view that it was lawful to give the committee the information because it was information in my possession.  I have a statutory duty to be accountable to the committee, as a committee of the Oireachtas.  Deputy Kelleher said there is a provision in section 955 that, in effect, means I can avail of an exemption whereby I do not have to provide the committee with certain information if, in my view, it would be prejudicial to discharging my functions.  That would be under normal circumstances.  What I said in the letter was that these are clearly not normal circumstances.  Therefore, it would do a disservice to the ODCE to have the committee trying to assess our performance without being in possession of the requisite information.  It does the committee a disservice and certainly does us a disservice.  I hope the members accept our bona fides regarding how seriously we take our obligations to be accountable to the committee and put the members in a position in which they can understand what went wrong and make an assessment of our organisation and the legislation they are currently charged with scrutinising.</p> <p>  The third question was on why we need the information.  I hope I have answered that at this point.</p></speech>

We have been waiting a long time for him to come in.  His participation will be very useful to us.  I hope we can engage today and in the future.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, was appointed on 30 November 2017.  How many times has Mr. Drennan met her since?  Has he met the Department to discuss the failings in the Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick investigation and the preparation of the Bill we are now considering?</p> <p>  In Mr. Drennan's opening statement, he said that, until 20 years ago, company law was, to all intents and purposes, unenforced in this jurisdiction.  Does he believe the enforcement of company law in Ireland is now as robust as it could be?  Could more be done?  What could be improved?</p></speech>

I met the previous Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, once.  I met the former Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, once and I met the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, once.  That would be in recent years.  I have regular meetings with the Department on a range of issues, including on the outcome of the case he referred to, the Bill and more routine matters.  Either my colleagues or I meet regularly.  For the record, it is important to say I have an excellent working relationship with my opposite number in the Department, and have had for many years.<br/><br/>On the question of whether the enforcement of company law is robust, I believe it is.  As I said in my opening remarks, through our supervision and direct actions <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>insolvent companies, we have almost 1,900 people sanctioned through either restriction or disqualification.  I am aware that the Deputy has asked a number of questions about this in the past and he has got a lot of data on it.  In recent years, and certainly after the Anglo Irish Bank developments, even when the investigations finished, trials were enormously time-consuming in terms of supporting the prosecution and so on, particularly in terms of Garda resources and supporting the disclosure process which is ongoing through trial.  Having got that behind us and, as I alluded to earlier, having hired a number of new staff, we are now looking at a range of complex matters that arise from various avenues, assisted by our Garda colleagues.  This means we have now got to a point where, in addition to referring files to the DPP, on which process I touched with Deputy Kelleher, and in addition to having recommendations for company law charges, it is now quite common to have recommendations for a possible offence under theft and fraud offences legislation.  More recently, we had charges directed by the DPP under criminal justice money laundering legislation because many of these things go hand in hand.</p></speech>

The Chairman can therefore take it as a given that these issues were factored into the thinking of the senior officials in their ongoing dialogue with the Minister on these heads.</p> <p>  As for the second issue the Deputy raised, that is, the appreciation of the risk and so on, the reality is that if December 2008 happened again in the morning, we would not be equipped to deal with it.  Very few organisations in the country would be, though, because that was off the scale in that there were massive lines of inquiry which in turn resulted in the uplifting of hundreds upon thousands, if not millions, of documents, and that organisation at the time, in fairness, had no understanding of what it was walking into because one does not until one goes in.  Now we know, though.  The risks are enormous, and much more thought would have to go into identifying and appropriately mitigating those risks such that we would not have a repetition of what has happened.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Drennan feel better equipped when the new statutory body is in place to address the issues the ODCE dealt with in 2008?  We want to try to make this new entity, this new statutory body, as robust as possible in order that the witnesses will have every opportunity open to it to investigate white-collar crime.  That is why we are here and that is what we are focusing on.  Does Mr. Drennan feel that this new entity that is to be put in place will be robust enough to help him to the best of his ability?</p></speech>

I appreciate them but I also understand what she is trying to convey.  As I said, the transition from an office to an agency undoubtedly assists with flexibility around staffing, being more agile in dealing with succession planning and bringing in a greater level of expertise in specialist areas and so on.  That said, hindsight is 20-20 vision.  I think anyone in that situation again, without knowing what was to come, would run the same risks.  It was completely unprecedented - I do not use the word lightly - in the sheer scale of five separate strands of investigation, each of which on its own merits was enormous.  The reality of any organisation, irrespective of how big or small it is, is that if one tries to carry that kind of load, that level of complexity and volume, across a relatively small number of people, things go wrong.  Unfortunately, in this case they went wrong in a pretty catastrophic way and the wheels came off.</p></speech>

Listening to and reading his opening statement, if I understand correctly, he is dividing the history of corporate enforcement in Ireland into three stages.  The first is the period from 1963 to 20 years ago, when there was effectively no corporate enforcement in place, which is quite concerning.  There is nothing we can do about it now, but that is quite a stark statement to make.  Then there appears to be a period from the establishment of the office to perhaps 2009 or 2010, and I think the implication is that the situation left much to be desired even then.  Then there is now.  Reading on in the statement he made and the material we have been supplied with, a number of actions have been taken in recent years to address any gaps that exist, to increase the resources available in Mr. Drennan's office, including training, and really to ramp up the office and its activities to an acceptable level.  I commend him on this.  It is good to see this progress being made, albeit from a low bar, as he said himself.  The previous position is worrying but is water under the bridge, to an extent.</p> <p>  I might put a few questions to Mr. Drennan for him to respond to together.  First, will he clarify whether my understanding of this three-stage categorisation is correct?</p> <p>  Second, quite a number of statistics on restrictions, disqualifications and indeed prosecutions that have been successfully brought are given in the material provided.  Mr. Drennan talks about the recruitment and training to which the ODCE's teams have been subject.  Again, this is great to see, and I commend him on it.  Quite extensive training and recruitment seem to be taking place.  One figure that jumps out concerns the recruitment.  It appears that many competent professionals, including forensic accountants and garda&iacute;, have been hired into the office, and rightly so.  However, it appears that only two barristers have been taken on across the board.  This is straying into the DPP and the FitzPatrick trial, and I appreciate it is not the be-all and end-all, but given the high-level finding that there appeared to be evidential issues with presentation and preparation for court, the way in which evidence was processed in court and the nature of that processing and of prior deliberation on it, it appears that the gap was in the areas of courtroom practice and preparation, which constitute the professional skill set of barristers.  Would it perhaps be wise to engage further barristers, considering only two appear to have been taken on, or does the ODCE engage with counsel in other ways?  Is there a detailed and ongoing engagement with counsel on any case that goes to court?  This would probably be wise because while the other people certainly have very important roles and skill sets, given what appears to be the deficiency highlighted, namely, courtroom practice and preparation, is very much within the barrister's domain of expertise, perhaps it would be wise to engage that profession more.</p> <p>  I have another question, but perhaps Mr. Drennan would like to respond to those I have asked and I could ask my other questions when I come in again.  Is that okay?</p></speech>

The former Attorney General and Minister for Justice and current Senator, Michael McDowell, produced a report at the time at the request of the then T&aacute;naiste, Mary Harney, when she was the Minister responsible for that Department.  It was he who recommended to the Government at the time the establishment of the ODCE.  I am paraphrasing but I think the soundbite at the time was that the enforcer's footsteps were never heard.  This was at a time when levels of non-compliance with even basic obligations under the Companies Acts, such as the filing of annual accounts and returns with the Companies Registration Office, CRO, were very high.  It is a stark statement but it probably does withstand scrutiny.  Certainly, that is in essence what Senator McDowell found at the time.</p> <p>  I refer to the three-stage approach.  The first stage certainly lasted until Senator McDowell's report.  Then there were the early days of the ODCE, when it was finding its feet and did some very good work.  Then Anglo hit and the office was completely consumed for several years thereafter and, as I said at the outset, did some very good work.  We have discussed this at some length.  Some of this, to refer to Deputy Kelleher's comments earlier, resulted in scathing findings, which were fully accepted.  That was the second phase.  The third phase follows those events.  Now we are trying to enhance the skill sets of the organisation and learn from the issues that arose as a consequence of the second phase to try to leverage off them to engage in our stock in trade, our day-to-day business, which involves files with a view to submitting to the DPP, as opposed to the District Court prosecutions, although we still do those on occasion.</p> <p>  Deputy Lawless is correct that we have two barristers at present.  We also have two solicitors, so we have four lawyers in total.  He can take it as a given that in any investigation of any significance, certainly criminal investigations, we engage counsel at quite an early stage for a variety of reasons, not least, as I referred to earlier in comments to the Chairman, as part of the learning from mitigating risks.</p><p>In civil investigations, such I referenced earlier, we similarly engage counsel early.  As the Deputy stated, that is a fundamental aspect of risk mitigation.  He also referred to specific issues.  In light of our earlier conversation, and if the Deputy does not mind, I will not get into those issues pending receipt of the document.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Drennan.  Regarding the issues we are not going to get into today, we did discuss the submission from the ODCE as to whether, when and how we get  that submission.  One point pertinent to that, as well as to the previous<i>in camera</i>discussion before this session, was mentioned in Mr. Drennan's opening statement or perhaps in some of the other materials supplied.  It was stated that the report consisted of exhibits and affidavits used in the various trials.  Those transcripts are available.Are the transcripts of the relevant trial, and much of the evidence, in the public domain as well?</p></speech>

We are in possession of them and we went through certain processes before I included excerpts from them.  Deputy Lawless will appreciate the retrial lasted for more than 100 days and the resultant transcripts are enormous.  We included the more salient aspects concerning particular issues in the report.  A number of those documents were opened in court.  While I do not know if the Deputy would like me to go back into it, as I said in previous correspondence, I did not conduct an investigation or inquiry.  It was, rather, a compilation of key documents.  Multiple people were named in those documents.  Most of them did not give evidence and none of them have had a right of reply, which gives rise to the sensitivities we have referred to earlier.</p></speech>

I welcome the establishment of the ODCE as an independent agency.  It will have more autonomy, including the ability to recruit people with specialist skills and build on existing expertise.  That experience will strengthen the capability available to the ODCE and its ability to investigate increasingly complex breaches of company law.  It will also build on the organisational procedural reforms that have been implemented.  I will not repeat what was said before but I have some questions.  Would the witnesses like to see any additional parts of the Bill enacted?  Has there been communication with the Minister or the Department or both regarding additional aspects the ODCE would like to see added to the Bill?  Are there any extra powers Mr. Drennan believes the ODCE could avail of?  What are the challenges that may be experienced in the changeover to becoming an agency?  Could challenges be faced in respect of recruitment or infrastructure?  I may also have a follow-up question, depending on the answers.</p></speech>

I will defer to some of my colleagues on the earlier questions.  There will be some crossover in the challenges we face.  The main challenges relate to the sheer complexity of what we do.  Previously, certainly when I trained back in the day, everything was kept on paper.  Everything is now electronic and there are many issues with legal, professionally privileged material being embedded within electronic data.  There has been much litigation on such issues.  Those are the kinds of issues we have to deal with daily.  Returning to my dialogue with Deputy Lawless, those are the types of issues that we bring counsel in on at an early stage.  I ask my colleague, Mr. Hegarty, to deal with some of the additional powers already in the heads of the general scheme.  I ask my colleague, Mr. David McGill, to then speak about some of the other aspects that could, potentially, go into the Bill or certainly those to which we have given some thought.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-19a.268" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019021900002#U00800"><p>As has been pointed out, the Bill is in six parts.  The new powers of the director are primarily in Parts 5 and 6.  Part 5 is a civil power relating to an additional ground upon which the director can seek to disqualify an individual under section 819 if he or she fails to hold meetings, AGMs, etc.  The other provisions in heads 43, 45 and 46 touch upon the requirement of directors to provide a PPS number to the registrar for verification purposes.  That is an additional compliance measure.  There is additional security and verification of individual identities when companies file documents with the CRO.</p> <p>  Two of the more significant powers are contained in heads 45 and 46.  Head 45 allows for the admissibility of statements from accomplices.  Normally, hearsay statements would be inadmissible but head 45 will permit these statements be made admissible.  It is based on a Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, power and it is normally used in cartel investigations.  It is a useful power for us as well.  The fourth salient head to which I draw the committee's attention is head 46, which relates to section 787 of the principal Act regarding the power to search and enter premises.  I will defer to my colleague, Mr. McGill, in a moment on that aspect because it is more on the forensic side.  We have also been in discussion with the Department on various additional matters that could go into the Bill.   </p> <p>  I can divide those into three separate categories.  There are evidential provisions which could assist us in the gathering of evidence, procedural matters in respect of the conduct of investigations, as well as matters relating to the institutional design of the corporate enforcement authority, CEA.  We are discussing those issues with the Department, they are not in the Bill.   Some of them may, ultimately, feature in the Bill.  Discussions, therefore, have been taking place and they have been subdivided into those three categories concerning what additional material might go into the Bill.  The most salient feature, the one that has drawn the most attention, is head 46 regarding search warrant power.  Mr. McGill can speak to that aspect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-19a.269" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David McGill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019021900002#U00900"><p>Head 46 is an innovative head in respect of the new legislation.  It allows us to keep abreast of new evolutions in technology.  At present our powers under section 787 of the Companies Act allow us to apply for search warrants to enter premises.  That search warrant allows us to interrogate any electronic devices found on the premises.  We are also allowed to use any devices to search any connected devices, whether at that premises or somewhere else.  One of the issues that poses for us comes back to maintaining risk concerning evidence and maintaining best evidence.  By using evidential items on-site to access other evidence, we are actually interfering with evidence.  That is not best practice.</p> <p>  We also have a substantial amount of equipment and software that we could bring with us and use that instead to interrogate devices in offices.  Our current powers, however, do not allow us to do that.  There is also the issue of the proliferation of mobile devices.  They have permeated every aspect of our society.  Most of the data stored on those devices are now stored in cloud services and not on the physical devices.  Trying to transfer data from a device into an evidential item, such as a USB key, is virtually prohibitive.  If enacted the way we envisage, this new section will allow us to use our own devices and the log-in credentials from the mobile devices on-site to access the cloud services instead.  We can then take the data down that way.  It is a much sounder and more robust approach.</p></speech>

We interpret the search warrant as stipulating that once a device is lawfully accessible from a device on the premises, then we have the authority to search it.  That is the case even if that device is outside of the State.  We have interpreted that as being lawfully accessible because the device or the people using the device are on-site in the State.  The current search powers allow us to do that.  We are just ameliorating that slightly.</p></speech>

I touched on that in the material.  As referred to earlier, we have engaged in a significant recruitment programme in recent years.  The current vacancy is a senior position.  I have taken the view that it is more important to let some of the more senior people recruited lately bed in first, find their feet and allow that process to complete before we fill this position.  That is because we are a fast-evolving organisation and we work in a fast-moving environment.  How we go about designing a job description will depend, to some extent, on how things pan out.  I think it is a more sensible approach rather than filling the position now and perhaps getting it wrong in respect of necessary specifications and qualifications.  Sometimes less haste is better.</p></speech>

Anyone who deals with the law knows these costs can be extremely high.  Mr. Drennan referred to the appointment of inspectors in the case of INM and significant expenses are accruing on this case.

There are issues, as just because the money is there it does not mean it can be spent on anything else.  We cannot move non-pay money into pay money and items of that nature.  If we do need to engage counsel, as was discussed earlier and which we do on a regular basis, we have the resources to do so.  It is not a problem.</p></speech>

The mechanism is somewhat different.  As an office we are a subhead of the Department so at the end of the year we give back what we have not spent.  At the agency I was involved in previously, at the end of the year if it had cash in the bank it did not hand it back but it was offset against the following year's budget.  The cash movement is not really an issue.  When we get to mid-year we begin to budget for the following year and we approach the Department and state whether we have an issue with inspectors or that we are likely to have legal costs or digital forensic expenditure.  It is all factored into the routine early.  The irony of one of the functions of the underspend that leaps off the page is there is a significant amount for contingency because, by definition, a contingency fund is not normally used.  What we do has peaks and troughs.  When we get to a particular point where we hit superior court litigation, the costs ramp up very quickly but we might not have another such case for two years.</p></speech>

The 2014 Act is relatively new.  As we work with the 2014 Act and apply it to real life situations we frequently come across instances where if the law was slightly different it might suit us slightly better.  There are very few things we can point to that present significant problems, if I can put it in these terms.  When situations arise with potentially significant problems, we are in a position to seek to include them in legislation and to liaise with Departments.  I anticipate that most of what is in the heads and has been discussed with the Department will address most of the issues that are raised.  It is an ongoing process and new issues arise all the time.</p></speech>

We have significant powers.  Anything in the Bill or that we might discuss with the Department, and anything to which the Department is giving consideration for further down the line, is with a view to further enhance our ability to do particular things.  We can take it as a given that if we had a particular issue whereby we did not have the power to do something we needed to do on a day-to-day basis, it would have been subject to discussion with the Department and, generally speaking, in fairness to the Department it would be acted upon pretty quickly.  There are no fundamental major lacunae.  As Mr. Hegarty said, we identify issues in a fast evolving environment and there are particular opportunities for nuance or further enhancement.  I will ask Mr. McGill to speak briefly about the telecoms issue.</p></speech>

One of the powers being considered for the CCPC is that it be included as part of the communications (retention of data) Bill.  This would give it access to retain telecommunications data, and proving communication can form a significant part of white-collar and criminal investigations.  Another power the CCPC has that we are considering is with regard to the Garda being able to bring in non-garda&iacute; to question people detained under section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.  This is a significant power for the Garda because it allows it to bring in experts to the questioning of someone who is a technical or financial expert.  We also discussed gaining access to suspicious transaction reports under money-laundering legislation so it can be considered as part of other investigations.  There are also powers with regard to the intimidation of officers.  They are subject to ongoing discussions.</p></speech>

There is no particular mechanism.  We do not have golden handcuffs, unfortunately.  We hire good people, as I hope is evident, and they know what they are about.  I hope the committee has got a sense that what we do is very interesting work.  It is high-risk work but it is very interesting.  Certainly, my sense in recent years is this is what motivates people.  Clearly people have other life imperatives but the staff would say to a man and woman that it is certainly not a boring job.

If we look at the size of companies in sectors such as aircraft leasing and of other companies, such as PwC, does Mr. Drennan feel he has the resources to carry out a major investigation?  The Anglo Irish Bank investigation was quite a while ago but it caused reputational damage to the State.  In the context of Brexit and corporate headquarters setting up in Ireland, we are open to reputational damage if we do not have the capability.  It is a judgment call for Mr. Drennan but is the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement strong enough to carry out a major investigation into enormous companies with very powerful backing?</p></speech>

On a serious note, for example, most of the companies relocating to the Republic of Ireland as a consequence of Brexit thus far appear to be in the financial services sector.  That came up with the departmental officials on a previous occasion.  There was a particular report about a proposal to transfer substantial sums of investments to this jurisdiction.  Those entities all clearly come within the remit of the Central Bank.  They would need to be authorised and go through that whole approval process.  Unless there was a particular company law or criminality issue, the general risks attaching to the large-scale financial institutions and the sorts of issues that can arise would very much come within the remit of the Central Bank and not the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p></speech>

Forgive me if some of these questions have already been asked and I will afford Mr. Drennan the same courtesy that Senator Humphreys did.  I can read the record if Mr. Drennan directs me to.</p> <p>  There was mention of new staff and recommendations around garda&iacute; and I welcome Detective Inspector Brian O'Keeffe before the committee.

One thing we have learned is that one needs horses for courses.  We have seven or eight accountants with very impressive backgrounds in financial services, private practice, forensics, law enforcement and a whole range of areas.  They are the workhorses, if they would pardon that phrase, for analysing complex financial data.  The interaction is that they analyse the data and prepare what we call interview packs, which would then be handed over to Detective Inspector O'Keeffe and his colleagues who would do the interviewing of witnesses, or suspects, or whatever the case may be.  Generally speaking, if it is a witness, one of our Garda colleagues would lead the witness interview and might be accompanied by an accountant if it is a particularly complex issue.  There is a complementarity there.</p> <p>  Detective Inspector O'Keeffe might want to say something about the skill set of our Garda colleagues.</p></speech>

One of the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a trained accountant.  I am a trained senior investigating officer.  We have a broad range of skills but, as Mr. Drennan has alluded to, for investigations of a complex nature we can call on the extensive skill set available to us with forensic accountants and our digital forensic capabilities.

What does Mr. Drennan think was the major thing the office could have done differently in the Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick trial?  I acknowledge that he has outlined how successful the office has been in many other prosecutions.  Does Mr. Drennan believe that the changes required to successfully prosecute major cases, like those relating to Anglo Irish Bank, are there now?  Representatives from the Department who appeared before the committee stated there was no legislative failure involved in the prosecution of that trial.  Does Mr. Drennan agree, notwithstanding his earlier contribution about suggested changes to the Bill, that his office now has the wherewithal to prosecute cases like that?  There obviously has been a significant amount of change.</p></speech>

I have no problem with that.</p> <p>  On the question regarding Anglo, I answered it earlier but I note that at any given time, we are undertaking a number of investigations that are quite large in scale.  I said earlier that were December 2008 to hit again and we were faced with what the people who were there at the time were faced with, we would not have the resources to deal with it.  It was enormous and in all fairness to those people who were there at the time, they had no inkling at the outset as to the scale it ended up being.  There were, regrettably, some serious failures but the people who were there at the time also deserve a lot of credit for the positive outcomes to which I alluded earlier.  Significant work was done in bringing four other lines of investigation to successful prosecutions.  Very few organisations in the State would be equipped to take on something of that sheer scale.  We have learned to have a greater appreciation of the risks involved and how to go about mitigating them by trying to narrow the number and scope of investigations we take on, to supplement what we have internally with external expertise and a range of other avenues that need to be explored.  In 2009, we were in the depths of the aftermath of a financial crisis and people at the time were cognisant that the Exchequer was under enormous pressure and it was a perfect storm in many respects when one considers what subsequently transpired.</p></speech>

I kept a check on the screens and many of the questions have been answered.  I acknowledge much of the great work the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement has done.  As Mr. Drennan said, the office had four big results out of five and the one is tagging the office down.  Most people perhaps thought that the head of the snake would be the most obvious result but that is the way these things go.  There have been high-profile cases recently relating to insurance, print and whatever else.  The office and its staff have to be commended.  They have shown themselves to be no shrinking violets and I acknowledge that.</p><p>The last paragraph of the report that Mr. Drennan gave us on DPP<i>v. </i>FitzPatrick refers to the fact that the case came at a considerable human cost in his department.  That is a poignant line and Mr. Drennan might like to expand on that.</p><p>I appreciate the lack of staffing and resources for a case of that size and I have no doubt it was a mountain to climb, to say the least.  I certainly feel for Mr. Drennan and his staff and the work that was thrown at their door when they were so short of resources and I understand that Mr. Drennan would like us to get the full report.  That said, the judge stressed the point about cross-contamination and coaching and, evidently, the destruction of files.  That is not something that any normal arm of the State carries out and, to be fair, something has to come out of today's proceedings other than the lack of staffing and resources.  A lack of staffing and resources does not lead to this.  I cannot see that, even if we say that one or two staff members were rogue or whatever.  As we know, some of that has come out through the media and we might hear more of that at a further case.  I would appreciate a little elaboration on that point.  The committee, after long and considered work on this today, would appreciate if Mr. Drennan could broaden that slightly for us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-02-19a.306" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ian Drennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019021900002#W01000"><p>I thank the Senator.  Human cost is a poignant term and I hope none of the individuals concerned will mind me saying so but many people were badly damaged by this experience.</p><p>There is not much else I can say about it, other than to point out how there is a narrative in the public domain which, suffice it to say, is not complete.  There are dots to be joined and bits missing.  If and when the full story comes out, it will put a different complexion on things.  Certain issues were ventilated in court, while certain others were not.  In fairness to the individuals concerned, one in particular, it would not be appropriate or fair for me to go beyond that, other than to say I have observed this at first hand and chosen my words carefully.</p><p> I appreciate the sentiment in wanting more to come out of this.  I will go this far and give the committee a high-level response.  In the normal course of events, if the Senator sees Mr. A hitting Mr. B over the head on the street with an iron bar and a garda asks him for a statement, the Senator will say he was walking down Molesworth Street when he observed Mr. A hitting Mr. B over the head with an iron bar and that he was wearing a red jumper or whatever the case may be.  Compare that with trying to take a statement from an audit partner.  An audit of a listed company is a large undertaking, takes a considerable amount of time and involves a substantial number of individuals.  It is not really something that lends itself to rocking up to someone's door and asking for his or her statement.  It requires a great deal of thought.  Like any professional services firm, audit firms must, rightly, have regard to their reputation which they guard jealously.  They must guard against their litigation risks carefully.  As such, giving a statement in that context would not be the same as someone making a statement about what he or she had seen.  What subsequently ensued in the way the statements came into being was, to some extent, a reflection of that and its complexity.  The trial judge formed the view that all concerned either completely lost sight of the fact that what was happening was inappropriate or failed to recognise, in the first instance, that it was inappropriate.</p><p> While I appreciate the Senator's position, it is difficult for me to go much beyond that.  Suffice it to say, however, the document I prepared and that we discussed at some length earlier will, if and when he reads it, give the Senator a much better understanding of how the process came to crystallise and the moving parts within it ultimately fell foul of the prohibition on the coaching of witnesses.  The contamination issue is tied to it, as are the judicial findings surrounding a failure to investigate and investigative bias.  These issues all relate to the two witnesses and the mechanism or manner in which their statements were obtained over two years or thereabouts.  It is completely different from someone stating he or she witnessed something which happened on Kildare Street at X time.</p></speech>

Did the ODCE feel pressure at any stage to get a result at all costs, something that might have led to this situation?  I have examined the matter in some detail and it seems like a result had to be achieved at all costs in this case and that, apart from staffing and so on, it possibly led to further problems.</p></speech>

Therefore, I cannot answer that question.  I cannot put myself in the mindset of the individuals who were there at the time and the pressures they were under.  The document will help the Senator to some extent.  These matters were ventilated at length during the course of examination and cross-examination.  I do not imagine for one moment that the Senator wants to read all of the transcripts, but if he ever chooses to do so, it is laid out at length.  In fairness, senior counsel for the defence did so forensically.  As I said, I cannot put myself in the minds of others.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Drennan satisfied with the proposed structure?  Will the statute give the authority enough flexibility to, for example, appoint individual commissioners to separate investigations?</p> <p>  In what common law or similar legal system across the globe is there an exemplary office of director of corporate enforcement or an enforcer of corporate governance and corporate law?</p> <p>  In reading Mr. Drennan's opening statement, the bottom line stands out for me.  According to him, "An enormous level of high-quality investigative work was done over that period, an achievement that, unfortunately, came at a considerable human cost."  We alluded to this matter in our discussions before Mr. Drennan's attendance.  We have to see that 450-page document in order that we can have a statutory process in place that protects the integrity of corporate law and the State internationally and ensures financial services, those overseeing them and the underpinning legal system can be upheld and vindicated.  That can only be achieved by having an office with the statutory powers and administrative supports necessary to go about its business of upholding corporate law in a way that does it credit, but we can only ensure that will happen by seeing the document and reflecting what is learned from it in the legislation and the resources provided for the office, whatever guise it will take once the statute is concluded.</p> <p>  Mr. Drennan referred to the "considerable human cost."  Does the office now have a proper code of conduct and supports in place for staff?  Does "human cost" mean threats and intimidation or just workloads?  Is Mr. Drennan satisfied that the office now has sufficient oversight and HR systems to ensure its employees are protected and looked after in taking on large caseloads?</p></speech>

I will ask my colleague Mr. Hegarty to address the Deputy's question about other jurisdictions.</p> <p>  To reply to the third question, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Employment has a well developed and sophisticated HR function.  In my experience, it is one that operates well and on a compassionate basis.  I have already answered this question to some extent in response to Senator Davitt and I am not sure whether there is much more to be said over and above what I have said.</p></speech>

It is important to point out that the ODCE is not a white collar crime agency.  To a certain extent, it is not even a corporate crime agency.  It is responsible for the enforcement of the Companies Act 2014 which I believe will carry over in head 8 of the new Bill.</p> <p>  Some of the main comparable regulators are the Serious Fraud Office, SFO, in the United Kingdom and the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, in the United States, but they are probably not directly comparable to the regulators in Ireland.  The Swedish Economic Crime Authority is a one-size-fits-all organisation.</p><p>It employs 600 people and has a budget of &euro;61 million a year.  It engages in a broad range of work.  The 2016 report talks about prosecuting gross fraud and obstruction of tax inspections, raiding illegal tobacco factories, prosecuting exercise of serious improper market influence, raids regarding unreported employment in the restaurant industry, raids against driver schools and it focuses on tax evasion and false accounting.  Other countries have organisations that do different things but that would be an example of a broad range, and much broader than what the ODCE does.  In this country, traditionally, the division has been along sectoral lines, if I can put it like that.</p></speech>

I had to step out for two votes in the Seanad.  We were dealing with legislation.  Apologies for the crossover of responsibilities today.  However, I heard the ODCE's opening statement.  As the ODCE representatives will be aware, the committee will be receiving its documentation and engaging on those issues.</p><p>First, I want to go back to 2012.  In 2012, Mr. Remy Farrell SC made an intentionally provocative statement that it was the best time to be a white collar criminal.  He pointed to the dearth of resources in the ODCE at that time.  This was four years after the economic collapse of the State.  Most people would agree that sharp practice in the banking and business sectors led to the collapse of the State.  One would have assumed that four years after that, we would have had a properly resourced corporate enforcement agency in the State.  I draw the ODCE representatives attention to those comments and ask for their thoughts on them.  The second point is the issue of policy cohesion.  As they will be aware, the Law Reform Commission in recent times has talked about a corporate crime agency.  I would draw their attention again to an article they may recall, written by the columnist, Dr. Elaine Byrne, in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>.  Dr. Byrne pointed to the need for all the agencies in the State, including the ODCE, the Data Protection Commissioner, the computer crime investigation unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, that are tasked with looking at corporate crime to come under one roof.  I want to hear the ODCE's thoughts, both on this issue of resources and on the issue of cohesion and proposals to join up all the agencies of State under one roof.</p></speech>

In fairness, those comments were delivered in a particular context.<br/><br/>On a serious note, I need to make an important point that sometimes gets lost in the narrative.  None of the investigations that we were involved in related in any way to collapse or the issues that gave rise to the collapse of Anglo Irish Bank or any other bank.  Bar one, they were all issues that manifested themselves in the dying days of that organisation, for example, the share support scheme.  They were particular, if you like, end-of-life issues.  It is a common misperception but the individuals in question, in fairness to them, were not on trial for bringing Ireland to its knees or for bringing the banking crisis.  That is not the purpose of the company law charges.  Indeed, there were other charges as a consequence of Garda investigations which were similarly not for that purpose.<br/><br/>That brings me neatly to the Law Reform Commission report.  I heard the Senator speak of it on the previous occasion and it is clearly something he has studied careful.  I could talk to the Senator about that report all day.  Implicit in the very fact that there was a recommendation in that report that this idea of egregiously reckless lending should be criminalised is a recognition that what happened, albeit unpalatable, was not necessarily criminal.  That is probably what brought them to that point.  I will come back to the Law Reform Commission, LRC, in a minute.<br/><br/>Given that Senator Mac Lochlainn referenced Dr. Byrne, he may be aware that one of the other limbs to the Government's package of white collar measures that accompany the proposed Bill that we are discussing today was the establishment of a group under the former DPP, Mr. Jim Hamilton.  Myself and Mr. Hegarty sit on that committee and, indeed, Dr. Byrne is a member of that committee.  If the Senator does not have the terms of reference, we can get them for him - there is no difficulty with that.  Some of the issues the Senator touched on are some of the issues that we are looking at within that committee.  That committee, the Senator can take it as a given, will have the benefit of Dr. Byrne's perspective on those issues.  We can send the terms of reference through to the Senator tomorrow.<br/><br/>Returning to the LRC report, as I said, I am quite happy to talk to the Senator about that all day.  I certainly have particular views on chapter 1 of that report which deals with the ODCE.  While I take no pleasure in saying so, there are a number of quite significant errors in that chapter.  Indeed, some of the analysis contained in that chapter, specifically, around DPP <i>v</i>. FitzPatrick, is not supported by the facts and is demonstrative of a certain lack of understanding of some of the issues involved in that.<br/><br/>As a separate issue, there is a disconnect in that the report starts out saying we had a financial crisis and we need to identify a mechanism whereby we ensure that we as a State never repeat that financial crisis, then seems to take a quantum leap into DPP <i>v</i>. FitzPatrick which had nothing to do with that - I said earlier that trial had nothing to do with causes of the financial crisis - and then seeks to leverage off certain deficiencies in that as a means of recommending the creation of a corporate crime agency.  We would have some quite significant observations around the level of analysis or otherwise that underpin that recommendation.  First and foremost, in the report the LRC stated that it endorses the vehicle that is in the proposed Bill notwithstanding that this agency that we are talking about is an entity that will continue to have the same functions as the ODCE, namely, company law, but then goes on to talk about corporate crime, which is a much broader remit.  The first difficulty is that whereas the report discusses at length the issue of corporate crime, it does not define it anywhere.  It, in some instances, likens it to fraud, then likens it to white collar crime and then it likens it to corporate crime, all of which mean different things.  If one takes that at its broadest - white collar crime is even wider - let us leave it at corporate crime, that is, any crime that involves a corporate entity.  That includes everything from company law to, say, tax evasion of VAT in a pub or something like that, or to a company that owns the building site whereby the trench collapses on some poor unfortunate, to the company that constructed Grenfell Tower, the <i>MS Herald of Free Enterprise</i>or whatever the case may be to a company that is being used as a moneylaundering vehicle.  We issued a press statement about this some considerable time ago.  The breadth of the scope is enormous.<br/><br/>Are we going to denude Revenue, the ODCE, the Health and Safety Authority, etc., of their enforcement activities and put these into one entity or is the corporate crime agency to do the more serious corporate crime and the other entities continue to do what they are doing, in which case the Revenue Commissioners, for one, would certainly have a view in terms of the implications that would have for its intelligence gathering?<br/><br/>There is a very obvious issue in that if, for example, one sets up a corporate crime agency and its mandate is to deal with more serious corporate crime, I can predict - it is fairly close to a fact - it would become a dumping ground because anybody who does criminal investigation and who wants to get rid of a difficult case or one that will be contentious would merely refer it across to it.  That is as sure as night follows day.  It is a recommendation that is worthy of consideration, but one that requires a lot more thought.</p></speech>

One of the key conclusions I arrived at was the need for far more accountancy expertise.  At the time we had one in-house accountant.  Perhaps I look at that perspective because that is my profession but, ultimately, everything we do comes down to numbers and transactions.  In my assessment an organisation carrying out that type of work cannot function if it does not have people who understand those transactions and the way accountants, auditors and businesses operate.  I had a discussion with the Department.  I sent in a proposal at the time and that subsequently evolved into hiring some of the people here now.</p> <p>  As I said earlier, I have met with nothing but supportive attitudes from any Minister I have dealt with in that respect.  As a consequence, these people are here now.  For me it is not about more people or bodies but the right people and bodies.  Broadly speaking, we have the same head count as when I was appointed, but the profile of the organisation is different in terms of its staff complement and the capabilities, backgrounds, experiences and willingness of staff to accept risk.  In fairness to the people who were there at the time some of these things happened, some of them ended up being at the business end of risks that they probably never envisaged when they were appointed ten years prior to that, whereas the people who are appointed now fully understand the risks involved.  They will confirm that.  I have interviewed them all and the conversation we have is about whether they understand the risks that are attached to doing this type of work and whether they are prepared to take on those risks.  It is the same numbers but the composition is very different.</p></speech>

There was huge public interest in the Se&aacute;n FitzPatrick trial.  Would he have requested additional resources to assist with all of that?  As that arrived on his desk, would he have said to the Department that he needed additional resources as this was big stuff?</p></speech>

We are all individuals.  I am sure I would have arrived at my own analysis which may or may not have been different from that of other people.  To some extent it is an impossible question to answer but I know now, and I mentioned it earlier, that if something like that descended upon us now, I believe the thought processes would be entirely different.  Hindsight is 20-20 vision but when one has been through it and when one appreciates how badly things can go wrong when these risks crystallise, one looks at everything through a completely different prism.  With everything we look at now, be it civil or criminal investigations, we look at it through the prism of risk.</p></speech>

When I was questioning the senior departmental officials last week I mentioned that significant financial assets are being transferred due to Brexit, including &euro;190 billion alone from Barclays.  Mr. Drennan will understand that there are legitimate concerns that the ODCE is resourced adequately to monitor all of that, not just from Britain but also from other states.  Is the office currently adequately resourced to deal with the major challenges all of that presents?</p></speech>

I am aware that he had specifically referred to that issue.  It is a huge sum of assets being transferred.  However, as I said earlier, what we have observed thus far is that most of the businesses that appear to be relocating or are giving consideration to relocation on foot of the risks they perceive Brexit causing for them in the UK appear to be in the financial services area.  All of those entities have to be authorised by the Central Bank and thereafter must operate in accordance with Central Bank rules and regulations.  The Central Bank is a regulator so it authorises, supervises and so forth.  Our office is an enforcer so we do not have an engagement with an entity unless an indication of a potential issue has come to us.  I am aware the Senator expressed a particular interest in this at the last meeting, but for the most part when we are on a business as usual operational footing we would have no engagement with such entities.  It would only occur if a particular issue arose from an auditor or whatever the case may be.  Generally speaking, in our experience and without breaching confidentiality, and Ms Sterritt might wish to speak about auditor reports, a very significant proportion of auditor reports do not attach to large financial institutions because of the nature of those entities.</p></speech>

There is a provision for them to report to us.  We have seen an increase since the Companies Act 2014 commenced.  That is something on which we are working with accountancy bodies and professions.  We have technical liaison groups so we are keeping abreast of changes and challenges in that area.  As the director pointed out, different trends are emerging.  There is an increase in financial services entities in the State.  This is something I and my colleagues are keeping track of.</p></speech>

Obviously that is not enough.  Hindsight is 20-20 vision but the ODCE was given major responsibilities on behalf of the people of the State.  The lives of many people were utterly destroyed in many ways by the economic collapse and the office carried responsibility for holding people to account, if necessary and if it found that to be the case.  One of the matters the body politic has examined is the area of regulatory oversight and the role of auditors who gave the banks a clean bill of health.  In the case of Anglo Irish Bank, Ernst &amp;amp; Young were the auditors that gave the bank a clean bill of health.  Was there any sense in that case or others of wondering how that happened?  How could it have given Anglo Irish Bank a clean bill of health?</p></speech>

If members of the public were here, they would want to ask it.  Perhaps we will get more light in the documentation and we will revisit this on another day.  However, I leave that question hanging there as it is a question that is asked regarding the show trial of one individual and whether there is an issue where other bodies gave these institutions clean bills of health.  It is a little like when one travels in an aeroplane.</p><p>One trusts the pilot can fly the plane, one puts one's life in his or her hands.  We put a lot of trust in people much of the time.  In this State, we put our trust in people who presented themselves as professionals who conducted audits and gave organisations clean bills of health.  We, and investors, put our trust in them.  It seems there may be more work to do in this area.  I will leave the question hanging there as the officials cannot be drawn into specifics but maybe we can revisit the matter again.</p></speech>

Should they be reflected as we work our way through this legislation and any possible amendments thereto?</p></speech>

We are violently in agreement that people's lives were destroyed.  That is a given and we all accept that.  I said earlier, and need to reiterate it, that the ODCE's remit under law is company law.  The various investigations in which we were involved and subsequently resulted in trials, irrespective of what way those trials went, were concerned with alleged breaches of company law.  There are parameters within company law.  Company law was never intended to be designed to deal with the component or contributory factors that gave rise to some of those financial institutions becoming insolvent.  This has been well documented.  That is much more in the area of financial services law regarding the manner in which those entities were stewarded, the manner in which those entities were understood, appreciated, calibrated, mitigated and all those good things, which are squarely within the scope of financial services.  In terms of company law, similar to tax law, there are clear parameters around it.  Bringing a bank to its knees, to use that parlance, is unlikely, in the circumstances that gave rise to the issues about which the Senator spoke, to ever come within the remit of company law.  That is financial services law.</p> <p>  Second, as the Chair has suggested we will not get into a particular issue but the area of audit is something about which I would be quite happy to speak to the Senator at length.  An audit is a very misunderstood thing in terms of what it is that auditors are charged with doing.  A corner shop is relatively easy to audit, that is quite straightforward.  However, with a bank, where there are complex financial instruments and huge levels of judgments and estimates involved, the accounting standards were applicable and they in turn had come directly from the likes of Enron and the issues which arose as a consequence of that.  These things must all be seen in the round.  It does not lend itself to a straightforward analysis as these are complex issues.  Those things must all be understood before one can start to think about the performance of auditors.  I am not opining on that but I am saying that there are a huge number of moving parts around all those complexities, the fact that audit is not forward looking, it is rear looking.  It is not a certificate that these financial statements are correct, it is an opinion based on a particular methodology.  Those things all factor into it.  Mr. O'Mahony may want to supplement my remarks as he is a member of the board of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, which has a specific role in that area.  There have been huge developments in recent years that I have probably lost touch with since I was there.  </p> <p>  Before I hand over to Mr. O'Mahony, and give him a chance to formulate his thoughts, I will ask Mr. Hegarty-----</p></speech>

From the perspective of the ordinary layperson, which is what I would regard myself as in this regard, the full picture was not fully examined.  This committee has received submissions which pointed out that in a court of law in a particular case only matters pertinent to the case can be examined, even where there are issues outside that that would provide the full picture.  I strikes me that what Mr. Drennan said strengthens the case for everything to be under the one roof that the full range of potential catastrophic failure, particularly for this State and its people, would be fully examined, that all persons who had any hand, act or part in that failing would be examined.  It is a case for an umbrella agency where there are defined roles but someone is up there in a helicopter, if one likes, ensuring that everything is being held to account.</p></speech>

I want to be clear on that.  What I mean by that is what we do is enforcement, that is non-compliance with the law.  The issues that the Senator speaks to are about performance, so the performance of auditors in this particular instance.  That is like apples and oranges.  If one follows the logic of that through, there would be one entity that prosecutes company law but also invigilates the performance of solicitors, for example, because the performance of solicitors, of doctors, of auditors is a performance issue.  There would be no logic to that because their natures are so completely different.  What auditors do is highly specialised but is also a performance issue.  It is not a wrong-doing issue but one of performance, the same way as a doctor, lawyer or whatever acts in a way that is substandard <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>his or her obligations to their professions, that there are mechanisms there.  IAASA does accounting, the Law Society or the Legal Services Regulatory Board does solicitors and barristers and so on.  They do that for a reason, because they are two very different things.  That is not what I was suggesting and with the greatest respect, I do not think that what I said necessarily brings one to that conclusion.  I hope that is helpful.</p></speech>

It is a function of what the audit report is.  It should be born in mind that if the year end is 31 December, the investor will not get it until March or April.  When one makes an investment decision one is looking forward not backward.  One is making one's decisions on whether an entity is profitable and what is coming down the line in terms of income streams and so on.  One is not looking at the rearview mirror.  The audit report is addressed to the shareholders and serves an entirely different purpose.</p></speech>

There is a difference between enforcement and regulation.  Enforcement is different.  The Law Reform Commission report sets out what three distinguishing features of a regulator would be.  One is the setting of standards, the second is a supervisory function and the third is enforcement.  Unequivocally, we perform the third function.  There is no real supervisory function in the way that there would be with regulated entities. That is where the Law Reform Commission report speaks more to regulators than to enforcers.  It talks more about the supervisory functions.</p> <p>  There are two further issues relating to the existing powers.  The Law Reform Commission summarised the existing powers of all the regulators and enforcers, namely, investigation and inquiry, search and investigation, negative enforcement - we have all of those powers.  We do not so much have powers in civil financial sanctions.  There is provision in sections 957AA to 957I of the 2018 Act to allow for limited administrative financial sanctions in discrete circumstances under Part 13 of the Act, but that is a subset.</p><p>There are summary prosecutions and so on.  Those are the powers that regulatory enforcement agencies have.  A great deal of significance is attributed to the regulatory toolkit in the LRC's report.</p><p> We have many of the powers that an enforcer needs and others would not be appropriate for us to have in all circumstances, or it could be argued that it would not be appropriate to have them as an enforcement authority.  Those include the powers to enter and search promises, to impose administrative sanctions and to bring summary prosecutions.  While it would be a policy decision, it could be argued that others relating to a wide range of regulatory compliance agreements or settlements might not be appropriate.  If an enforcement agency detects criminality and it is sufficiently serious to invoke the criminal resources that the agency has, it probably is not an appropriate matter for a regulatory settlement.  Chapters 3, 4 and 5 of the LRC report refer to administrative financial sanctions, settlement agreements and deferred prosecution agreements.  Of those, deferred prosecution agreements would be most relevant in some senses but that would be a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions to determine, not the ODCE or other corporate enforcement authorities.</p><p> The overarching thrust of the LRC report is more directed towards regulatory agencies.  An enforcer does not have that kind of interaction with a supervised body.  The director spoke to that earlier.  If one had one overarching authority and left each of the other agencies with a right of election as to whether to keep a prosecution themselves or pass it on, there is a theoretical possibility that each of those might say that they will pass one on and keep another for various reasons.  By centralising everything, there is also a nexus between the regulator and regulatee that would be very important in broadcasting and other sectors where highly technical expertise is necessary.  That is not strictly as relevant to the performance of the ODCE or the corporate enforcement authority of their functions.  That ultimately all comes back to the distinction between an enforcer and a regulator.  I do not want to say the LRC report conflated the two but it was much more focused on addressing issues relating to regulatory governance.</p></speech>

While I am on the board of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, I am not here in that capacity and I am not authorised by the board to answer these queries.  I will give some very high level observations.  Following the collapse of the banking sector, there were not just banking problems in Ireland but across the world.  A significant debate at the time was whether the auditors had been asleep at the wheel or if the auditing standards had been up to scratch.  There was intense debate on that around the world.  Auditing standards were changed to try to address what happened in Enron some years earlier.  When that revised standard was tested by what happened in the financial maelstrom of 2007 and 2008, there were strong arguments that the revised auditing standards were found wanting.  The auditor certainly argued that they were required to give a pass to what was going on.  It was quite unsatisfactory.</p> <p>  The standard has subsequently been changed dramatically.  It was an incredibly complex area.  IAASA required the Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board, CARB, to conduct reviews of all of the major, Irish-registered bank audits and required them to get an independent expert in from the UK.  I think Mr. Drennan was involved in requiring that in his previous capacity and there was in-depth work on that.  That ended up being delayed for a number of years because it could not be progressed while the Anglo-Irish investigations and criminal proceedings were ongoing.  The whole thing was complex.  I know that is not a very satisfying answer in that it does not attribute blame but these are complex areas.  It goes back to what the director said, which is that auditors do a particular job but it is probably not the job that the man on the street expects them to do.</p></speech>

I talked about how, when one goes on an aeroplane, one puts one's faith in the pilot being adequately trained and one's life in the pilot's hands.  We have perhaps a foolish perception that auditors sign off on accounts and give a company a clean bill of health.  If an engineering company cleared an aeroplane and it goes down, my life is gone.  I would like to think that my loved ones would ask questions of the engineering company that gave a clean bill of health as part of the investigatory process.  I feel that we are not getting a complete picture.  If the witnesses' response is that this was all that they could look at, that is good enough for me, but my sense is that there are missing elements that somebody else should have been examining and that was not done.  If their response is that, in the terms of reference of the ODCE, that is all they could investigate, that is fair enough.  There is something in the public interest that the witnesses could not have fulfilled but that we as a State have not ensured that somebody was fulfilling.</p></speech>

Auditor performance does not fall within our remit.  It is not that there was some sort of impediment but that it falls completely outside of our mandate.  IAASA is an entity which also comes within the committee's remit, given its jurisdiction with the Department.  Up until recently, it had a specific mandate which has now changed on foot of European legislation and it has a direct relationship with the audit firms that the Senator refers to.  Back in my time, one could not go into an audit firm and carry out an inspection on an audit file.  That has now changed to where they can, and do, do that.  That entire regulatory mechanism and framework has changed in recent years.  There is a statutory entity that not only can, but does, look at auditor performance.  It just does not happen to be the ODCE because we do something completely different.  I hope that helps.  I am quite happy to talk about that outside the committee.</p></speech>

Mr. Drennan just answered one comprehensively so I will not repeat it.  Page 1 of the opening statement refers to vindicating the rights of members of a property management company.  I understand that statement but I am involved in assisting several management companies and some very brave directors who stepped in on a voluntary basis to try to sort out the mess of what a management company is, especially in this city.  I am not sure what it is like outside Dublin but most management companies we have tried to resolve issues in respect of are a mess.  Some were never even registered with the Companies Registration Office by the developer.  I am dealing with one where the developer has been gone for 12 years and we have now discovered that the management company was never registered.  There have been no returned accounts for 12 years and brave individuals in the apartment block are trying to resolve it.  Those are the individuals it falls on and there are significant costs in trying to resolve those messes across the city.  We have to re-register them as companies.</p></speech>

They have explained a lot of stuff that would not necessarily have been obvious to us.  That is the first thing to say.  A number of issues arise.  I share Senator Humphreys's concern around management companies.  Has the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement prosecuted somebody for misdemeanours of the type he has outlined, rather than prosecuting a company?  In those prosecutions, somebody pays a bit of a fine.  Good luck.</p></speech>

Much of what was referred to a few moments ago is still problematic in the city.  There is an expert sitting behind us.  That is very much a fact.  The other issue I wanted to briefly address was raised by Senator Mac Lochlainn, namely, auditors and the value of an audit.  The ordinary man on the street sees companies like Enron, Anglo Irish Bank, and so many others.  The big four firms go around the world, sticking their chests out, auditing and charging big fat fees for it.  What does it actually mean?  The witnesses mentioned the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA.  Mr. O'Mahony is on its board.  Is he saying that is the body we should invite in to discuss this issue with us?  I would be very happy to do that, and do a service to the public and perhaps a service to IAASA.  I would like to highlight and explain to people what auditors do and what they do not do.  People put a misplaced trust in an audit and in audited accounts, as Senator Mac Lochlainn said.  Audited accounts only look backwards and cannot predict with any certainty what is going to happen in the future.  That is fair enough.  Nobody can do that.  However, surely they should have picked up much of what was going on in Enron for quite some time.</p></speech>
