Finally, I have received no apologies.</p> <p>  Today, we will discuss the costs of living, minimum wage increases and the report by the Low Pay Commission.  Most employees are entitled to the minimum wage under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  Since 1 January 2022, the national minimum wage is &euro;10.50 per hour.  In July, the Low Pay Commission published its report and recommendations for the national minimum wage.  On 14 September, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Leo Varadkar, announced that he had received the Government's proposal to accept the recommendation by the Low Pay Commission to increase the national minimum wage by 80 cent to &euro;11.30 per hour from 1 January 2023.  I am pleased that we have this opportunity to consider these matters further with the following representatives.</p><p>I welcome Mr. Ultan Courtney, chairman, Low Pay Commission; Ms Claire Pyke, assistant principal officer, and Mr. Ois&iacute;n Gilmore, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who form part of the secretariat to the commission; and Mr. Gerry Light, general secretary, Mr. Jonathan Hogan, assistant general secretary, and Mr. Jim Fuery, divisional organiser for the Dublin north division, Mandate.  </p><p> Before we start I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in regard to references witnesses and members may make to another person in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant both to the Constitution and Statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements, therefore, are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction they may be given.</p><p> The opening statements have been circulated to all members.  I invite Mr. Courtney to make his opening remarks on behalf of the commission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-28a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ultan Courtney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022092800002#B00200"><p>Good morning, Chairman, and members of the committee.  I am glad to have the opportunity to meet with you all and discuss the commission&rsquo;s recent report and recommendations on the national minimum wage.</p> <p>  Mandate has also been invited to the meeting.  Since 2016, the accommodation and food, and the wholesale and retail sectors combined have consistently accounted for more than 50% of national minimum wage workers.  In 2020, they accounted for 54.4% of all national minimum wage workers.  Mandate&rsquo;s experience of their representation of retail, bar and administrative workers is always of interest to the Low Pay Commission and its contributions to the commission&rsquo;s consultations on minimum wage issues are always welcome.  I look forward to hearing its contributions to today&rsquo;s discussions.  </p> <p>  I was appointed as chair of the commission last October.  I started my working life with CIE and recently finished a seven-year term as chairman of Dublin Bus.  I run a management consultancy business that I established in 2008.  I have expertise in economics, industrial relations, employment law and human resources, both in the public and private sector, and act as an independent person in a number of other organisations.  The Low Pay Commission was established in 2015 as an independent body.  Its statutory function pursuant to the National Minimum Wage Acts is to make recommendations to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the appropriate rate of the national minimum wage.  It is important to emphasise that the commission recommends a national minimum wage but the Government decides on the rate.  The legislation provides for the Government to accept and implement the commission&rsquo;s recommendation or to implement a different rate.  </p> <p>  The national minimum wage seeks to find a balance between a fair and sustainable rate for low-paid workers and one that will not have significant negative consequences for employment and competitiveness.  It might be useful for me to outline how the commission comes to its recommendations.  The commission comprises eight members and myself as an independent chair.  There are members who have an understanding of the interests of employees, especially the impact of living on the minimum wage and the sectors where low pay and minimum wage workers are concentrated.  There are members who have an understanding of the interests of employers, particularly small to medium-sized employers and those operating in traditionally low-pay sectors and who possess a good knowledge and understanding of the specific issues faced by Irish businesses particularly in respect of labour costs and competitiveness.  There are also academics who have particular knowledge and expertise in relation to economics, labour market economics and statistics.</p> <p>  The National Minimum Wage Acts set out the issues we are obliged to consider when we are making our recommendations.   These include the cost of living, earnings and income distribution, competitiveness and the likely effect that any proposed recommendation will have on future levels of employment.  Statute requires incremental adjustment to the national minimum wage.  The recommendations that the commission makes are always based on the best available evidence at the time.  The commission has a research partnership agreement with the ESRI to undertake and disseminate research on the issues surrounding low pay in Ireland.  This has led to the publication of high-quality research on the impact of changes to the national minimum wage.  The commission recently awarded research bursaries for two independent pieces of research on minimum wages issues.  This research is being finalised and its publication will further improve our understanding of the issues surrounding low pay.</p> <p>  Since my appointment last October, the commission has met 15 times.  Meetings are used to analyse the most recent research and data on low pay issues and on general economic performance.  We also met with representatives of the Department of Finance, OECD, UK Low Pay Commission, Eurofound, ESRI, Central Bank of Ireland, as well as academics from the University of Oxford and University College Dublin, to hear their expert opinion on issues relevant to our work.  We also received commissioned reports from the ESRI and Maynooth University, which provided analysis of the impact of changes in the minimum wage on several areas including employment and hours of work.  The commission also met with several representative groups representing both employers and employees, including Mandate.  As part of our deliberations the commission conducted a public consultation this year where we invited submissions on the appropriate rate of the national minimum wage for 2023.  The commission received 297 submissions.  This contrasts with 85 submissions received last year and highlights the interest in and awareness of low-pay issues at this time.  These meetings and submissions provided further information and context for us to consider when it came to making our final recommendations.  </p> <p>  Our recommendation to the Government was for an 80 cent increase in the national minimum wage.  This represents a 7.6% increase and is the largest increase recommended by the commission to date.  This recommendation was supported by seven of the nine members of the commission.  Two of the three employee representative members dissented from the majority decision of an increase of 80 cent in the national minimum wage.  Those members sought a higher increase phased in in tranches beginning with a temporary increase in October 2022.  The Government recently announced that it had accepted the commission&rsquo;s recommendation and that the national minimum wage will rise to &euro;11.30 from 1 January 2023. </p> <p>  It is expected that more than 164,000 people will be in line for an increase based on our recommendation to increase the national minimum wage.  However, the real figure is likely to be much higher given that there will be a knock-on increase for those currently earning slightly above the minimum wage.  The commission&rsquo;s recommendation for 2023 equates to gross increases of approximately &euro;30 a week, &euro;120 a month or &euro;1,600 a year for those working full-time on the national minimum wage.  When we made our recommendation of a 7.6% increase in the national minimum wage inflation was predicted to be 4% in 2023 with wage growth predicted to reach 4.5%.  There are those who will say that this increase is not enough in a time of high inflation and others will say this increase is too much when employers are also facing high inflation and challenges to their competitiveness.  When coming to our recommendation we sought to make it fair, balanced and sustainable.  We examined our commissioned research from the ESRI and Maynooth University, which indicates that previous minimum wage increases recommended by the commission have had little effect on employment while reducing wage inequality.  These have been gradual increases and when we consider changes to the national minimum wage we have to make sure that we make changes in a way that does not give rise to a fall in the employment or a fall in hours worked.  To do so would be counterproductive.  This year&rsquo;s recommendations were made at a time the economy is grappling with its third severe economic shock in as many years due to Brexit, Covid-19 and, most recently, the fallout from the crisis in Ukraine.  We, of course, gave great consideration to the rising cost of living.  As we recognised in our report the cost of living has increased significantly since the commission made its recommendation for the 2022 national minimum wage.  Housing, childcare and transportation continue to be significant issues for minimum wage and low-paid workers.  These issues however cannot be resolved by the minimum wage increases alone.  The national minimum wage is not a panacea.  We have made it clear in our recommendations that the national minimum wage alone will not compensate workers for inflation and recent increases in the cost of living.  Our 80 cent recommendation is significant but we also recommended that supports to low-paid workers should be considered in the context of budget 2023.  The Government indicated that should be a cost-of-living budget and the commission recommended that additional measures are taken to support minimum wage and low-paid workers.</p> <p>  The commission also recommended that supports to employers are considered by the Government.  We are all aware of the rising costs affecting individuals and families but the commission also had to consider the rising costs affecting employers.  Employers and their representatives told us that rising costs are affecting all sectors and that they face further labour costs such as pensions auto-enrolment and mandatory sick pay.  We were also conscious of the need to avoid generating inflationary pressures and the need to avoid a wage price spiral when considering wage increases.  We try to balance this by ensuring that low-paid workers receive an increase that helps to ease the pressures they face in meeting day-to-day living costs.</p><p>When we talk about next year&rsquo;s increase in the national minimum wage, it is important to highlight the commission&rsquo;s recent recommendations on the progression to a living wage.  Members will be aware that earlier this year we submitted its report on how best the Government could progress to a living wage.  We recommended adopting a fixed-threshold approach for the calculation of a living wage and setting the fixed threshold at 60% of the median wage in the economy.  The commission also recommended that after the 60% target has been reached, subject to an assessment of the impact of this, we should assess the economic practicality of gradually increasing the targeted threshold rate towards 66% of the median wage and make appropriate recommendations.</p><p> I thank members and am happy to take any questions they may have on the commission&rsquo;s report and recommendations.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-28a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jonathan Hogan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022092800002#C00500"><p>I thank the Chairperson, members, and staff for the invitation to appear before the committee.  Mandate Trade Union represents almost 27,000 workers, primarily in the retail sector.  The union also represents workers within the licensed trade and those in administrative roles.  Many of these workers were operating on the front line during the pandemic.  Our comments reflect their views on the cost of living, the minimum wage, and the report of the Low Pay Commission.</p> <p>  We remind the committee that the programme for Government contains a commitment to increase the minimum wage to a living wage by the conclusion of the current D&aacute;il.  We trust that the Government does not mean to renege on this commitment.</p> <p>  Our members are being squeezed between low wages and a high cost of living.  The only viable solution to protect these workers is to increase their wages and reduce the cost of the essential public services that these workers rely on.  To ensure our most vulnerable workers have an adequate income, the Government must increase the minimum wage to a living wage, which is just over &euro;14 per hour, as a starting point.  Mandate based this calculation on last year&rsquo;s estimate by the living wage technical group of a living wage hourly rate of &euro;12.90, which is based on a 39-hour working week.  We added 8.5% to reflect the cost of inflation.  The figure of 8.5% is the rate of price inflation projected by Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, this year.  NERI projects further inflation of 4.5% in 2023.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, the Low Pay Commission&rsquo;s recommendation of &euro;11.30 per hour, a 7.6% increase, fails to keep pace with 2022 inflation rate and is just 80.7% of a &euro;14 minimum wage.  Matching inflation is the bare minimum expectation of workers.  Anything less would be a pay cut.  How can we have faith in a process that leads to pay cuts and declining living standards for workers?  Wages in Ireland&rsquo;s low-pay sectors of retail and hospitality significantly trail behind wages in the same sectors in other high-income EU countries.  There is no competitiveness issue.</p> <p>  Mandate also notes the impact of the commission&rsquo;s last three annual recommendations, which effectively amounts to a cut in real pay.  The rate of nominal increase from 2020 to 2023 is 11.9%, but the rate of economy-wide consumer price inflation between January 2020 and August 2022 was almost 12%, at 11.9%.  Does the commission believe there will be no further price increases between August 2022 and January 2023?  This is not what any institutional forecaster or the European Central Bank, ECB, seems to believe.  Even headline inflation understates the rate of price increases for low-wage workers.  Lower-income households generally spend a higher portion of their incomes on the type of necessities, such as energy, food and rent that are experiencing the sharpest price increases.</p> <p>  The commission&rsquo;s recommendation means that minimum-wage workers in 2023 will be even further away from earning a living wage.  The recommendation also means that minimum-wage workers will have seen deterioration in their position relative to the median wage over the five years between 2018 and 2023.  By any measure, we can see that minimum-wage workers are falling further behind.</p> <p>  The Low Pay Commission is failing in its mandate to protect workers, and we strongly oppose its recommendation because it is too low.  In addition, we are calling for the removal of the discriminatory sub-minimum rates of the minimum wage.  Such discrimination against young workers is a grave injustice that has no place in a modern economy or society.  Equal work should mean equal pay.</p> <p>  On the economic impact, the commission will no doubt raise concerns about the impact of a higher minimum wage on the economy, yet the economic literature is clear in that minimum wages and minimum wage increases close to but above inflation do not have any meaningful impact on net employment.  The current national minimum wage in Ireland is barely over half that of the median wage.  This compares to 60% in countries such as France, Portugal and Luxembourg.</p> <p>  The economy and the labour market itself are in a strong position.  We are now close to full employment and hours worked in the economy are at record levels.  The unemployment rate is just 4.3% and the job vacancy rate is higher than pre-pandemic levels.  There is an excess of labour demand over labour supply.</p> <p>  Low-paid sectors experienced a rapid recovery in 2022.  Net business income exceeds pre-pandemic business income in both the restaurant and retail sectors.  The seasonally adjusted retail sales index in July was 10% higher than its level on the eve of the pandemic.  The hotel sector has also made a robust recovery.</p> <p>  It is clear that wages are not driving the current inflationary spike; it is being driven by supply-side factors related to supply chain problems, commodity market shocks and the energy crisis.  In this context, increasing the minimum wage to the living wage would have a minimal impact on price growth.</p> <p>  Of course, wage growth is far from keeping pace with inflation.  If the economy gets into a dynamic of falling real incomes, consumer spending will fall and businesses will fail.  That is the reality.  NERI advises that a combination of tightening monetary policy and falling real incomes could push the economy into recession.  On the other hand, a higher wage will result in higher consumer spending.  Low-wage workers have a high propensity to spend and a much higher propensity to spend domestically.  Unlike high-income households, low-paid workers cannot afford to save or, indeed, spend their money on expensive foreign luxuries and holidays.  Their wage increases flow back to businesses across the domestic economy.  Any negative impact of higher wages on business costs will be offset by the benefits arising from the increase in domestic demand.  In addition, higher wages tend to drive a positive dynamic of more motivated and engaged workers and, therefore, improve goodwill and promote effort-based productivity.  Better wages also lead to reduced employee turnover, therefore, lowering recruitment and training costs.  Loss of experience itself means a loss of productivity.  Overall, higher minimum wages increase aggregate demand and facilitate higher productivity dynamics within the firm.</p> <p>  Mandate believes the Government should enable workers to improve their own wages directly with their employer.  The best way to do this is to implement enhanced collective bargaining legislation and through union access to legislative rights.  Increasing the hourly rate of pay for workers is irrelevant if their employer cuts their hours or refuses to give them extra hours.  Collective bargaining is the only way to protect workers from unscrupulous employers and ensure they receive an acceptable weekly living wage.  Legislative access for workers who wish to avail of extra hours that become available to improve and secure higher incomes is an absolute need within the sector in addition to securing increases in hourly rates of pay.</p></speech>

I appreciate them coming before the committee for this important topic.</p> <p>  I begin by declaring an interest.  Mr. Courtney said: "There are those who will say that this increase is not enough in a time of high inflation and others will say this increase is too much."  I am one of the former.  I am a trade union member and have been a proud trade union activist for most of my life.  That is my perspective.  It is best to be clear and upfront about that.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Courtney accept Mandate's point that the recommendations of the past three years from the Low Pay Commission have effectively resulted in a pay cut for the lowest-paid workers in the State?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-28a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ultan Courtney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022092800002#C00800"><p>When looked at solely from an economic perspective, it is probably true but that is an economic measurement.</p><p>If one looks at it from a different perspective, the remit of the Low Pay Commission is to look at an increase that is fair and sustainable but also to ensure that account is taken of the employment and competitiveness of the economy.  That acts as a brake on what the commission has to or wants to do.  It is a legitimate way of looking at how increases in this pay in the economy should take place.  On that basis the commission does its best at a point in time with the information that it has from a particular and very large component of the working population, 164,000 people, in very disparate and different kinds of employment, and tries to analyse what will be the best increase going forward.  This is very different from the collective bargaining system that obtains in a very large part of the employment sectors.  In that context, what the Senator has said is probably factually correct but it is not how we try to do business in the sense of trying to keep pace with inflation or the cost of living.  We all know from previous incarnations of ourselves that chasing inflation can lead to all sorts of problems, as such.  It is not precisely what the commission is set up to do.</p><p> The commission is set up to try to deal with low pay in a progressive and incremental way over time.  To do anything more quickly can lead to shocks for the system and can lead to potential loss of hours for the workers one is trying to help, and potential loss of jobs where employers start to make substitutions in the hours that they work or in the employment that they have.</p></speech>

Given the fact that the increase recommended by the commission, the &euro;0.80, has been completely wiped out by inflation, would the commission consider making a recommendation for a supplemental wage increase during next year, given the impact of inflation?</p></speech>

On that basis, we are restricted in what recommendations we can make and in the things we can take into consideration.  We are also restricted in time.  My understanding is that the only time we make a recommendation is July of any particular year which is when we make the recommendation.  After that, it is up to the Government to decide what to do with it.</p></speech>

One of the things that one discovers in this whole process is that the information available to a person is not as good as one would want it to be and we have made decisions based on the information that is available to us.  It would be important to recognise that this is something we must look at if we reach the 60% of the median wage, and that the potential and possibility of looking at the 66% is something we should do.

I apologise but I have only a minute and 33 seconds, like my colleagues.  What do the witnesses make of the arguments they have heard about what I regard as an overly cautious approach to raising the minimum wage?  As was pointed out, it has been a pay cut in the past three years.  What are the prospects of the Low Pay Commission actually delivering the living wage to which the Government says it is committed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-28a.73" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Light" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022092800002#E01300"><p>I will pick up on that because I come to this issue and this whole subject with considerable inside knowledge from having been a commissioner for six years.  I was one of the founding low pay commissioners on the Low Pay Commission.  The argument is not new to me.  I have heard it constantly through the years.  It is about the rate being driven to a certain level and the negative impact or the potential consequential impacts.</p> <p>  On the Low Pay Commission, my colleague, Patricia King, the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and I were very keen to use the considerable budget available to the commission to commission new research because there was a dearth of research, as Mr. Courtney said, and there probably still is.  All research has clearly shown that despite all the sabre-rattling and scaremongering that the impact of a particular rate and above that rate will in some way cost jobs or reduce earnings, that has not proven to be the case up to this point and is not supported by any credible research.  I certainly never heard in all my years a low-paid worker urging caution against getting a pay increase.  Such arguments always came from the employer side on the commission.  It continues to make such arguments.  Looking at the minority report this time around, the difference is stark in that the worker representatives say the increase should be higher, there should be two phases and it should be introduced over the course of this and next year, while the employers are requesting that it be phased in, which is an absolutely nonsensical suggestion in respect of the workers we are talking about.  That certainly would not be in any way progressive, as far as they are concerned.</p></speech>

Like all budgets, it is a mixed bag.  I will be succinct.  I do not think any increases in social welfare supports or State supports are a replacement for decent wages.  Already this morning I heard an employer spokesperson on RT&Eacute; radio say, when answering a similar question put to them, that it was great the welfare supports have increased because it takes the pressure off employers to increase wages.  I will leave my comments on the budget at that.</p></speech>

Between February 2015, when, as we are aware, the Low Pay Commission was established, and July 2021, prices increased by 4.4%.  In February 2015, the minimum wage was &euro;8.65, as we are aware, and in July 2021 the commission recommended a minimum wage of &euro;10.50 an hour, which, naturally, the Government agreed to.  That was a 21% increase over the same period when there was only a 4.5% increase in prices.  Clearly, for a variety of reasons, we have seen much higher inflation most recently, and that needs to be addressed, but does Mandate accept that, prior to the recent surge in inflation, and certainly until July 2021, the Low Pay Commission was ensuring the situation of lower income workers was improving consistently?</p></speech>

As a member of the commission, I and my colleagues certainly tried to ensure that.  What is critical is where we are going in the future and what low-paid workers are confronting today as we sit in this committee room.  I will not go over the points Senator Gavan has made, but the linkage between the past three years, the effective pay cut and the median wage has drifted further away.  That is the important thing we need to consider.  In that context, we have put in a submission with specific targets and specific rates contained within it.  The minority report also clearly outlines a much more realistic and fairer approach for low-paid workers.  After all, one in five workers in this country is on low pay.  It is one of the highest rates, if not the highest, in Europe.  I am not coming back to the question about the budget, Chair, do not worry, but 1 million of those workers, nearly a third of them, earn wages that are so low they are not even in the tax net.  The way to look at this situation, then, and it is to be hoped we are all in this mindset, is to look forward now, address the real challenges that face low-paid workers today and move forward to ensure they do not drift further into working poverty.</p></speech>

Is it Mandate's view that if a business cannot afford the rate, that business is not sustainable anyway?  What exactly is the outlook?  I am trying to understand whether Mandate looks at this solely from the perspective of the workers or whether it also looks at it through the wider economic lens.</p></speech>

We have always looked at this through the wider economic lens.  It is always important to remind committees such as this, as we remind ourselves regularly, that there is ample consideration in the low pay legislation for any employer who cites inability to pay.  They can go to the Labour Court and lay out their case and, as always, I presume the Labour Court will give a very fair and balanced consideration of their case.  The broader perspective is looked at, and I am sure my colleagues now on the Low Pay Commission, and Mr. Courtney has said it himself this morning, look at the broader perspective.  It is unfortunate that, at times, businesses will have to consider whether they are viable if they cannot afford a statutory minimum rate of pay.  That is a consideration they must look at but, as I have said, for those businesses that look to the State to supplement low pay, I do not think that is a viable business model going forward.</p></speech>

That provision has been there for years.</p> <p>  Deputy Bruton has indicated to speak.  He is sharing time with Deputy Stanton.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-28a.87" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022092800002#E02700"><p>I believe we should increase the national minimum wage as fast as is sustainably deliverable, and that qualification is what I wish to explore a little with both speakers.  When the commission looks at setting the minimum wage, which it set at an increase of 7.6%, what are the factors other than inflation which it has to look at?</p><p>I know that's yesterday's budget, for example, indicated that domestic growth would be very weak next year so businesses will be in a more difficult environment, with just 1% growth in the domestic economy.  Perhaps the Low Pay Commission can explain how it put that calculation together.</p><p> On a question to Mandate, it says Government measures should not influence what an employer pays.  It is the case that, at the moment, the economy is being asked to pay &euro;10 billion extra in energy due to external factors.  That is &euro;10 billion taken out of the economy and we have no control over it.  Given the Government is trying to shelter people and businesses from the impact of that, is it not valid to say that, if the Government can avoid a wage-price spiral in Ireland, it should be doing so, and part of the motivation of the Government is to prevent excessive wages at a difficult time?  Is that not a reasonable position?  I believe that has motivated the Government in the things it is doing on rent, working family payments, electricity, GP cards and so on.  I would like to hear the Mandate view on that.  In trying to accelerate the growth of the national minimum wage, I feel we have to look at things like an energy crisis of such scale, and that does modify what we do in that period.</p></speech>

It also commissions research from Maynooth University and the ESRI makes a lot of valuable contributions.  Many contributions come from submissions that people make, such as small employers and the unions, including Mandate.  All of that goes into the mix to try to make a recommendation.</p> <p>  We are constrained by what we are asked to do.  We literally cannot make it up.  We cannot just decide on an increase because we think that is the right increase.  We have to take account of all of these things.  There are two main issues.  The main thing is obviously to do what we are tasked to do.  I was interested to hear the Deputy&rsquo;s comment about a fair and sustainable increase in low pay.  That is what we are here to do as well over time, but we are tasked also to ensure that we do not impact on employment and competitiveness, which would be a negative impact for the workers we are trying to help at the end of the day.  There are lots of good reasons for raising the minimum wage and there are negatives to doing it as well but, overall, we want to try to improve the position for people without having the net effect of a deterioration in jobs in the economy or of making the economy worse off.</p> <p>  The critical difficulty, as noted in the discussion with Senator Gavan, is the inflationary impact which is now impacting on what we do.  We have not had that for the last ten years or so.  That has been a period of price stability from which we have all benefited.  Trying to get inflation back down is a critical matter which helps us inordinately in our work as well.  The last thing we want to do, and it is the same problem the trade union movement faces, is to do wage deals that do not have a real increase in income.  Everybody states that the public sector pay deals that were done in Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail, organisations that I had dealings with, will all have to face that.  They do not seek to try to put them beyond inflationary pressure because we all know, particularly those who went through all of this in the 1970s and 1980s, what a wage spiral does.  It takes away the good of what we are trying to do, which is to improve the lot of those who have the least.</p></speech>

First and foremost, I want to be very clear on the point I made.  I have always maintained the position, both as a trade union official for many years and as a member of the Low Pay Commission, that the primary responsibility to pay a decent wage rests with an employer.  I have already quoted the attitude of one employer I heard this morning that in some way what happened in the budget yesterday is substituting responsibility or taking away that responsibility from an employer to pay a decent wage.  That is always the primary responsibility.</p> <p>  Based on my years of experience on the commission and also based on the research that has been carried out on the issue, I do not accept the point made by Mr. Courtney.  He talks about the activity largely within the unionised sector.  We have to realise that the workers we are talking about are predominantly non-union.  They are the lowest paid workers in our society and I do not believe that a decent pay increase for them has the potential to spike inflation in any major way.  Again, previous research has shown in respect of competitiveness and productivity that one of the important points is that many of the jobs we are talking about are not internationally comparable and they are very much in the domestic economy.  There is no evidence that a decent wage for low-paid workers, the most vulnerable in our society, spikes inflation.</p></speech>

If we are in a situation, as we are at the moment, where &euro;10 billion extra has gone out of the economy to pay for oil and gas and we have no control over that, and it is gone and is not in the hands of employers or in the hands of the Government, and if the Government intervenes as it did yesterday to try to cushion the impact on workers, is it not legitimate for that to be reflected in lower pay settlements in this time of crisis?  That is the question I am asking.  It is not about this long-term theory that people say that many jobs will be lost.  It is just that, at the moment, with very flat demand and employers like everyone else having big challenges, is the Government intervention not legitimate and does it not modify the need for pay increases during this crisis, even though we have the ambition to move as quickly as is sustainable to the higher levels?  That is the question.</p></speech>

It does seem not unreasonable that in a time of such uncertainty, Government intervention to protect people would be reflected in the pay demands that accompany that in the economy.  That is the only point I am making.  I do not think that is an unreasonable balance to expect to work through.</p></speech>

Before I finish, and on a point we have not made thus far, among all of the low-paid workers, particularly workers who are on minimum wage, a large cohort are young people.  They still have to deal with what I believe is the discriminatory framework of the Low Pay Commission structure and the minimum wage, which has a rate which is below the full rate.  Any other worker in this country would be citing a case for discrimination.  We have legislation that deals with age discrimination yet it still prevails.  I point out to the committee that, if we are looking at other ways, and making recommendations or suggestions beyond the Low Pay Commission and trying to influence that, there are certain areas that are adequately outlined in the minority report.  One area that probably is not touched on sufficiently is the plight of young, low-paid workers.</p></speech>

Ireland does not have a social wage economy.  We do not have a welfare State.  Yesterday we heard about a once-off spend that does not even address the housing crisis.  Many of the people who are affected by the housing crisis are young workers, which the national minimum wage and the Low Pay Commission did not address to the satisfaction we believe should have been addressed in the recommendations.</p> <p>  The budget provided very little help for the student population.  Many Mandate members who work part-time have telephoned the organisation to tell us that they have deferred their college places because they cannot find accommodation and cannot afford accommodation if they find it, yet the Low Pay Commission has recommended that some of these people who are under the age of 20 should get a lower rate because of their age. Deputy Bruton is disingenuous to refer to what happened yesterday because, traditionally, Ireland has one of the lowest rates of public spending per person in the European Union and that must be taken into consideration.</p> <p>  We do not know what the median wage is made of that has been discussed the length and breadth of the recommendation by the Low Pay Commission and perhaps the commission tell us.  I understand that the median wage is comprised of a whole host of wage rates but that inflates the average wage, which does not reflect the workers we represent in the retail sector because they are all low paid, paid by the hour and not guaranteed a weekly wage.  Many of these workers' pay goes up to certain bands and their hours fluctuate from week to week.  These are the people we represent.</p></speech>

I would not like a political view of the budget to be presented without contest.</p></speech>

As a former union official who for years soldiered with Mandate on these issues concerning the minimum wage, I am delighted that the Mandate trade union is represented here today.</p> <p>  My first question is for the Low Pay Commission.  Some people perceive the minimum wage as a transient or temporary first wage for people when they enter the labour market while others have a different view, including the trade union movement.  Can Mr. Courtney give me some insight into how the commission perceives the national minimum wage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-28a.106" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ultan Courtney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022092800002#G00700"><p>Quite simply, the national minimum wage is an important component of the national economy.  Its history is very simple in that there was no real organisation or representation for people at the lowest level of earnings within the economy.  At the time there were allegations of exploitation, misrepresentation and no representation of people at that particular level.  The Low Pay Commission and its predecessors came into existence to do something about that and give safeguards.</p> <p>  Mr. Gerry Light was quite correct to say that there is no collective bargaining for that very indistinct group of people that was made up of very different components.  For example, the group is comprised of a large percentage of young people.  There is also a regional mix.  That means the minimum wage is more important the further south, west and north one travels but less important in the midlands and eastern regions.  The minimum wage is also important in particular sectors such as accommodation, wholesale and retail areas.  It is important that recognition is given to the fact that the group is made up of different groups.</p> <p>  The problem for us in the Low Pay Commission and for organisations who wish to make submissions is to address all of those different groups or combinations or segments of particular sectors with one recommendation that fits all.  As members can see, that does not always work because people have different inputs into that.  Some people say we should not do this or that which makes it extremely difficult to create a joint recommendation.  It would be much easier if we had collective bargaining with a company or firm and dealt with a particular union where both parties had much more perfect knowledge of the circumstances of the business so in that sense it is important.</p> <p>  Form the perspective of the Low Pay Commission, commissioners are all fully conscious of how important the minimum wage is to anyone who gets it.  We do believe that it is important as an entry point in terms of people progressing.  Evidence shows that people, and sometimes up to 30% of those people in a nine-month period, progressed to the next stage of their pay within the business so the minimum wage can facilitate that.  The minimum wage can also facilitate people who wish to pursue further education and do not want to work as many hours as they did.  It can act as a very important mechanism for ensuring that people progress within the economy and I think that is important.  I am sure that most of us will remember that before one could get secondary education people did not have the education or ability to seek higher paid jobs, which is one of the transformations that has happened in Ireland over the past 70 years.</p></speech>

As he will be aware, we do not have a right to be recognised for collective bargaining purposes in this country and I look forward to him giving me his support on that issue in the future.</p> <p>  Mr. Courtney made an important point about the minimum wage being a stepping stone.  That is how some people perceive the minimum wage and we know that from the data.  I give huge credit to the Low Pay Commission for upping its game over the years in providing data and undertaking research.  As a result we know the following - 56% of all of the people who are paid the minimum wage receive it for a year or more and 23% receive it for four years or more so a very large cohort of workers hugely depend on the recommendations made by the Low Pay Commission for increases in their pay because they are not going to get that anywhere else.</p> <p>   When exactly did the Low Pay Commission issue its report to the Government this year? </p></speech>

Did discussion take place with the Government on when the two components would be introduced?</p></speech>

The commission determined that the increase should have two components, which the Senator correctly pointed out.  We just wanted to take account of an increase in the overall amount of the money involved and also a correction.  We believe that it was important to have a correction because the increases before that had been quite low.</p> <p>  The commission had been quite prudent in its response, which is understandable in the crisis being faced in terms of Brexit and Covid-19.  Nobody was sure what was going to happen, many businesses closed and many people survived on the schemes that the Government had put in place so the commission was understandably cautious.  We felt that with better information and the way things were going, we could make a correction.</p> <p>  It is important to note in terms of the living wage proposal that the commission would have the power to speed things up if necessary or slow them down.  If we were going to go into a major recession then we must take account of that situation.  If the economy still manages to grow, and the economy is able to take it and it does not impact on competitiveness then we are going to move faster in terms of the implementation.</p></speech>

It is a real concern that the commission does not reflect in its recommendation that there may have to be future changes to the minimum wage rate.</p> <p>  I wish to ask about engagement with research.  Earlier Mr. Courtney said that the ESRI had forecasted an inflation increase of 4% for next year.  Has the Low Pay Commission factored in that when the ESRI forecasted 4% that the institute believed the percentage reflects the base effect of a radical increase in inflation in 2023?</p><p>I am confused as to why the commission would knowingly recommend a real pay cut in the face of the forecasting that the ESRI proposed for this year and for next year.</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance yesterday predicted that inflation will be 7% next year.  If Mr. Courtney had that information then and if the projections then were that inflation would be 7% next year, would a different recommendation have been made for a higher increase?</p></speech>

I will give the Deputy a short answer on that.  As a commission, we would always have to take consideration of changing circumstances.  We try to have the most up-to-date information available and try to read it in the best way we can going forward.  I honestly do not know the answer to the question.</p> <p>  I would be concerned - Mandate has made this point too - in relation to doing more harm than good.  What I mean by that is all of us start chasing inflation in the economy and we end up in a situation where inflation gets out of hand and we cannot control it.</p></speech>

As a commission, it is often said people look at what is happening at the lower end of the scale without looking at what is happening at the top end of the scale.  It is hugely important to understand that any increases in money in the economy in an inflationary situation could lead to a wage spiral.  One would, as various Ministers have referenced previously, make sure that there is no situation where people are making profits that are not acceptable in society.  That is a different issue but it is for Government to deal with.</p></speech>

The Government has tasked us to look at that again.  I welcome that review because it is something to get submissions on and to listen to what people have to say as to whether that is something that is still sustainable going forward or not sustainable in a growing economy.  Traditionally, there are various ways of dealing with these kind of issues in relation to age and experience, whether using increments and so on.  Whether they are still appropriate is a question.  I think it is open.  It is a valid question for review.  The commission would nothing but a good report on that.  I would like to come back to the committee with that to see what conclusions we come to.</p></speech>

As the Deputy probably will recall, in the initial legislation that was set out there were two subminimum rates.  I and my colleague, Ms Patricia King, were successful in having the training rate removed.  We clearly then targeted the age-related rate.  That is something that should be addressed as soon as possible because the difficulties being faced, particularly by young people and those who are on low pay, are not in any way diminishing and they need every support they can get.</p></speech>

Has Mandate had any engagement or, as far as Mandate is aware, has ICTU, with the Government on developing this action plan for collective bargaining?</p></speech>

There is no doubt that with the existence of a statutory right to collective bargaining, and we mentioned it in our submission, along with proper access to workers, one can start to meaningfully tackle low pay, whether within the unionised or non-unionised sector.  That is a key target and a key objective.</p></speech>

It is discriminatory.  Age is one of the nine grounds under equality legislation.</p> <p>  It is simply a case of trying to justify why it is still here.  There is no justification.  It is a scandalous attempt, by the Government or the Low Pay Commission, to push this issue down the road and it is exploitation of workers under a certain age.</p></speech>

Within that, we have many different sectors.  The broad-brush approach to pay that I hear unions talk about does not apply.  A company that was topical a couple of years ago was Debenhams, where a significant number of people were employed by a multinational on low-paid contract hours.  I do not think anybody could think that what happened there was just treatment of workers.</p> <p>  However, that policy cannot be applied to  small businesses, especially rural and regional employers.  I will give a simple metric.  If one employs four low-paid workers, in which one can include oneself as a promoter, one's annual wage bill, including employer cost, will be close to &euro;100,000.  If one is working off a 20% revenue model, which many businesses are, that means one needs to turn over &euro;500,000 to cover those costs.  I challenge many people at the meeting to develop a business, employ four people and see how successful they will be in developing &euro;500,000 in annual sales.  </p> <p>  Many businesses are struggling.  They are having a difficult time in the current business environment and wages are just one of the significant cost burdens that they bear.  I can tell Mr. Courtney, as someone who has run businesses, that many will not bother to go to the Labour Court to cite inability to pay.  They will reduce their working time and the number of operators they have and they will change their systems of how they do their business to try to reduce the employment component within that.  That is a significant problem in the economy.</p> <p>  As Mr. Courtney has made reference to, having a low skill set is a problem in getting a decent wage because, ultimately, it feeds into how much people are worth.  Having said that, the economy has been doing quite well up until now and most workers are getting a reasonable wage.  The budget yesterday was certainly favourable to the lower paid and the public service has to support low-paid working in terms of healthcare, medical card access, employment subsidies and family income supplement because small businesses cannot carry that.  I am inundated at present with small business owners who are in serious trouble because of inflation in the economy.  I hear people here talking about employers being very hard on employees in what they pay.  Some members on this committee are not living in the real world.</p> <p>  Mr. Courtney said the terms of reference of the Low Pay Commission are fairly narrow.  Will he tell me how many employer groups on the commission deal with the SME sector?</p></speech>

What I mean by that is people who are appointed by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, on the basis that they expressed an interest in being the employer person on the commission as such.  I do not know if there are particular profiles.  One relates to hotels, another is IBEC and the other has a great deal of experience in dealing with accountancy in many small firms.  There is quite a-----</p></speech>

We have people who have expressed an interest through the PAS in representing the employer or employee interest.  I do not believe there are any nominating bodies as such but, certainly from my experience, no matter whether the representatives come from the independent employer side or the employee side, they are very knowledgeable about what they are doing.</p> <p>  The other safeguard we have in mind for that is that we take many submissions.  I think we have taken 297 submissions.  We talk to various organisations, including ISME, IBEC and ICTU to get their insights.  Much of what the Deputy articulated is what many smaller companies, in particular, are saying.  He is quite correct that there is a smaller profile of companies that are entrepreneurs who have taken considerable risk and find the challenge of business at present extremely strong.  They tell us they find it difficult to absorb or pass on any costs and, at the end of the day, to keep going.  That does not mean they will not.  They will do whatever they can to safeguard their investment and jobs going forward because they want to be there in the future.</p></speech>

Nobody is looking at this problem.  There are forklift drivers working in logistics companies who will, over time, be taken out by robotised pallet systems.  That is just one area of many.  Nobody is talking about this but, as wages rise further and technology becomes cheaper, more and more of this will happen.  We need to discuss this problem and how we will upskill people and try to point them to employment that will pay them properly in the future.</p></speech>

I will make a remark I do not mean in an offensive way but we all know that women are overrepresented in low-paid work.  It is regrettable.  I welcome the woman who is here but I regret that there are not more women because we are disproportionately represented among the low-paid, as Ms Pyke and the other witnesses will be aware.</p> <p>  A simplistic narrative emerging from the Government is one in which we cannot give poor people too much money because they might cause some kind of a massive inflationary spiral, yet there appears to be some necessary supports put in place for business that will not, somehow, contribute to inflation.  Will Mr. Courtney square that circle?  It seems counterintuitive because, on the one hand, we all know that the money put into the pockets of low-paid workers does not sit in investment funds or languish in bank accounts, but goes straight back into the economy while, on the other, we are told welfare is good for business and will not increase inflation.  Mr. Courtney expressed a high degree of concern about wage inflation spirals.  Does he not see there is a danger that welfare to businesses could contribute to inflation? </p></speech>

It can be caused by many different factors, including supply-side shocks such as the oil crisis we had in the 1970s and the energy crisis at present.  The hope is that something such as that is short, sharp and then ends.  The concern is that will go on and we will continue to have an inflationary increase.  That can continue to be exacerbated by prices and sometimes by people sometimes taking profits that are too high.  Minister have referred to that but I do not have evidence of it.  I do not know whether that is happening, nor do I have evidence of it.  That is an issue for Government, but the Deputy is quite correct.  It would be wrong to leave here today and say it is all the fault of this group or that group; it is not.  Inflation is invidious and insidious because once it gets into one part of the economy, it spreads and continues to spread and we have a real problem.</p></speech>

I am asking Mr. Courtney a simple question.  Does he believe that there should be equal emphasis on wherever supports are going and the contribution they could make to inflation?

Some commentators have said the low level of trade union density in this State more or less rules out the prospect of wage inflation.  Even though it is the job of the Government to put some sort of a floor in place, there is no substitute for being an active trade union member.  That is the best way to achieve a pay increase at work and always will be.  You can hang around and wait for right-wing governments to give you a pay rise that will keep pace with inflation, but all the evidence suggests it will not.  In terms of Mr. Courtney's view, does he have in mind a move towards the living wage when he is making his recommendations?  Does that factor in when he is considering it?  Does he consider the 80 cent as a stopping-off point in that direction or does he just consider it in isolation?</p></speech>

I remember when the national minimum wage came in first.  It was under the Minister at the time, Mary Harney, if I remember correctly.  It was a seismic change.  It is now embedded, thankfully, and we talk about it as being normal.  As Deputy Bruton said, we want it to be sustainable.  We want people to get the most they can out of it.</p> <p>  I notice in Mr. Courtney's recommendation that he says it is not a panacea and that the minimum wage will not now compensate workers for inflation and recent increases.  He goes on to say that the supports to low-paid workers should be considered in the context of budget 2023, which, as Deputy Bruton pointed out, has happened.  Mr. Courtney also states the budget should be a cost-of-living budget and the commission recommends that additional measures be taken to support the minimum wage and low-paid workers.  Am I right in saying that, when Mr. Courtney is making his recommendation, he is factoring in supports from the State to low-paid workers as well?  Mr. Light seems to feel that should not be the case, that it should be an add-on.  Correct me if I am wrong.  There seems to be a situation where the State is supporting low-paid workers to quite a large extent.</p> <p>  One figure I noticed is that the number of people receiving the working family payment has dropped quite a bit from 2016 to this year, by almost 9,000.  I do not know why that is.  Perhaps Mr. Light can explain why that might be the case, given we are at almost full employment.  We have 4.5% unemployment, which is essentially full employment.  That is one question and observation rolled into one.</p> <p>  We should have employers and business in before the committee as well as soon as possible to discuss this.  We have all received a lot of fairly startling information from small and family businesses regarding the pressures they are under now, such as the cost of energy increases, the cost of rates going up, the cost of turnover going up in some instances, which is related to rates, and so forth.  Many of them are under an awful lot of pressure.  I would contend, and I am sure Mr. Light and others would agree with me, that it is better that people be at work and getting the minimum wage, as articulated, and the State supports than to be out of work.  I am concerned that we could have a lot of small and family businesses going to the wall in the next few months because they just cannot be sustained.  They are telling us that some of the things they might have to do is to reduce hours, reduce labour costs or let people go.  We do not want this to happen either.</p> <p>  Mr. Courtney and his team have a tough job in trying balance the competitiveness of the economy with trying to keep people in jobs and to keep businesses sustainable.  We live in unprecedented times.  People are talking about nuclear war.  This is just phenomenal.  As Deputy Carthy, I think, said, we have to start thinking about where we are at.  This is unprecedented.  I am old enough to remember the 1970s and the fuel crisis at that stage.  That was scary but it was short and sharp.  This is a crazy time we are living in at the moment.  I hope we will get to the end of it, but who knows.  I will leave it at that.  Perhaps the Mr. Courtney could respond.</p></speech>

I do recognise the difficulties.  I believe I have already made that submission to the committee about the pressures everybody is under regarding this issue, no matter if they are a worker, an employer, the State or anybody else.  The only good news is we have a surplus in the budget and we are able to do something to try to alleviate that pressure.  That should, I hope, be a one-off.  If it is not, we have a different problem.  We have faced this before.  We have to figure out how we are going to deal with that, which will require a different response.  At the end of the day, the role of the Low Pay Commission is to contribute to trying to find a solution to some of these issues.</p> <p>  There was a very telling comment made, I think by Deputy Stanton, about different times and the sense there is a progression in the thinking on these matters.  Certainly, when I was younger, any talk of a minimum wage was seen as completely anathema.  It was seen as something that would have devastating consequences for employment.  That has not proven to be the case.  I believe part of the reason for that has been that the economy has grown.  Many of the actual factors we need for growth in the economy are there.</p> <p>  The challenge, and it is a challenge, and I thank the Deputy for recognising that, and while I do not have the answer, I do have a path going forward with the co-operation of the commission, the Government, the Oireachtas, obviously, and everyone else, is to try to get to a situation where a living wage, if it is to be implemented, is implemented in a sensible fashion from which people will benefit.  I am a strong believer, and I know all of the members of the commission are, that it is important to keep businesses competitive to provide additional income for people and give them an opportunity to progress and grow into the future.  That is very important going forward.  Rather than being a low-wage economy, we need to be a higher-wage economy, giving the benefits of that particular growth to, or trying to share the benefits of it with, everybody as we do that.  We are constrained by this fear that at the end of the day we do more harm than good.  The more information and statistics we get, the better.</p> <p>  I was quite taken aback by a comment in the Maynooth report where it was stated that there was not really any evidence - there was some - that the impact on employment was in any way substantial.</p><p>That was an eye-opener for me because the traditional economic model suggested there would be.  Much of our thinking was framed by that, but the report is also cautious about the 60% and 66% targets.  It states that because people are not at that level, there is no information and the academic research is not available to support that approach.  Until we get that information, we must be cautious about it.  I do not make an apology for that because at the end of the day, I will not suffer.  Either a small business will close, and they do close, or a worker will have his or her hours reduced or lose his or her job.  I certainly do not want to go back to that.</p></speech>

First I am not sure why the working family payment has been reduced in recent times.  One thing I can say as a low-paid commissioner, when we had the Department in giving us all the statistics and the details and the degree of workers who depend on that payment was very surprising.

The important point is that it exists.  We must recognise that very high numbers of workers are on low pay and the State must intervene.  I do not subscribe to the concept that any job is better than no job.  I know the Deputy is not advocating it, and he has a particular view, but if we get into that space, we very quickly have to start to deal with potential exploitation and indeed compulsion in respect of people being forced to take up work.  Work should always be attractive enough to invite people to participate in the labour market.  My colleagues and I presented the statistics earlier.  We still have a high level of low pay in this country.  As a practising trade union official and a low pay commissioner for six years, I have always had huge sympathy for the challenges faced by businesses and small businesses in particular.  We try to take that on board.  Measures are available to protect them.  Notwithstanding what one of the previous contributors said about a reluctance to go to the Labour Court to state they are unable to pay, that provision is available.  It is a considerable safety net but one that is rarely used.  I would also point out to the commission that, contrary to the view expressed by the Deputy, research does not support the position that employers who find themselves in challenging situations either reduce the number of staff or staff hours.  Since the introduction of the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018, employers are required to afford workers hours they have established over a reference period.  That is the best answer I can give to the points raised by the Deputy.</p></speech>

There is a huge amount of unpredictability here.  The number of people on the minimum wage has been stated to be 164,000.  There has been huge growth in employment.  Walking around this city and many towns in Ireland, staff-wanted notices are visible in many places.  Why has the competitiveness in the labour market not increased wages if people can change jobs and get a better wage?  Hotels and restaurants are crying out for staff, at least they were until recently.  Whether that will continue is another issue because they may not be able to keep going because of other factors, such as energy costs and so forth.  The figure of 164,000, the number of people at work-----</p></speech>

Mr. Courtney from the Low Pay Commission spoke earlier about the range of factors the commission has to consider when making its recommendation.  I note the report states that the Low Pay Commission has previously recommended that data on firm output to profitability be made available to help monitor the impact of the changes in the minimum wage on firms and workers.  What progress has the commission made on accessing those data on profitability and operating costs?  To what extent are those data a feature in its calculations?  Overall, how important is profitability when the commission is assessing what the minimum wage should be for the following year?</p></speech>

Will Mr. Light outline in more detail what Mandate's experience is as regards profitability among the employers it deals with?</p></speech>

It is always difficult to get to the bottom line.  The big players constantly appear, right up to the Labour Court, and refuse to give any information regarding their profitability.  An honest approach is probably more likely from the smaller operators who will sit down in a room, open books and show the staff.  From that point forward, both the owner and the workers can gauge what is in the best interests of that business going forward.  That is the way it should work.  Deputy O'Reilly spoke about the value of having that access and the statutory right to collectively bargain.  The big fear among many employers, and it is certainly the perception that is put out, is that if unions have the right to collectively bargain, it will end with employers having to pay excessive wage costs and ultimately go to the wall.  That is not the case.</p> <p>  The problem with declaring profitability and establishing the level of profitability is always a challenge to the trade union movement and it is certainly an invaluable piece of information to allow us and our members to make the right decision for everybody concerned with any particular enterprise.</p></speech>

If the Low Pay Commission does not factor in profitability of firms, then surely that is a shortcoming in how it operates, particularly at this point in time when we see some firms doing quite well and others less so.  Does Mr. Light have any comment to make on that?</p></speech>

It is the case that this matter was on the agenda.  In the past, we have tended to sit down every year and identify what relevant research projects we want to commission.  There is a fairly substantial budget available as I have said and it was always my objective on the commission to ensure we spent that budget on relevant research projects because it was vitally important.  We cannot on one hand argue that there was a dearth of information while not using the resources available to us.  Given the diverse nature of the employers that we are dealing with within the Low Pay Commission's remit, we tend to look at it from a central viewpoint as opposed to an individual firm viewpoint.</p></speech>

It is incumbent upon the commission to ensure all that available information, however dated, is used and that there is up-to-date profitability information available to it.  For employers to come along and allege that something is going to cost jobs and not have the evidence, that is a real issue for the Low Pay Commission.  I hope when we have an engagement next year that there will be much greater research into profitability within sectors.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-28a.209" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Light" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022092800002#M00700"><p>It is a very direct approach.  It would not be the standard industrial relations approach which goes through layers of procedures.  The companies have direct access to the Labour Court and they go in and lay out all the relevant details and the court will deal with that in a very experienced and professional way.  My understanding is, in the very few cases that travel to the court, that recommendations would be adhered to.  Again, I am not entirely positive on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-28a.210" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022092800002#M00800"><p>That is fair enough but it is important nonetheless. The commission has to take a balanced approach and I fully accept that.  All the available information has to be looked at but  by virtue of the fact that there is a negligible number that actually front up and go to the court - a minuscule number of them - they are almost irrelevant.  It is a tiny number compared to the number of companies that say that the cost of pay will send them to the wall.  </p> <p>  I am coming back to the 80 cent, I cannot bend my head around that.  It strikes me that there is a lot more tolerance for a higher increase given that there is no evidence to suggest that there is not.  If this was not the case, the modest increases, which now amount effectively to a pay cut for low-income workers, a raft of cases into the Labour Court would be expected.  That does not happen.  The court is not inundated.  Will Mr. Light accept that there might be a higher tolerance for a wage increase?  I accept that his approach has to be cautious and balanced but I suggest that it has been a little over-cautious.  There does not seem to be any evidence to support these amounts.  We are calling them a pay-cut as that is effectively what they are in real terms; even if that was not the intention, that is how it will work out in pounds, shillings and pence for low-income workers.</p></speech>

The proxy that we look at is what happens to employment in the economy in general and that is why the Maynooth report was very significant.  It is not, seemingly, binding evidence that it is impacting on employment.  That is the thing we most worry about.  We all accept that for small employers in particular, there are many problems in how they get on with their business.  At the end of the day, we do not have the data on that.  People do not come to us pleading inability to pay.  They go to the union or to the Labour Court.  All we can do is look and see what is actually happening and what the impact is.  If the impact is negative, we get worried and if it is not negative, we move forward.  That is what we are trying to do.  We are being cautious in relation to that.</p></speech>

You have to have something in your mind.  I picked a deliberately exaggerated figure but something is causing you to come to the conclusion that 80 cent is reasonable.  Presumably that is a balance between the demands of the workers, whose demands as very clearly articulated in the minority report are not met by that, and the demands of the employers.  It appears that the employers are not coming with any evidence.  It is a bit like the smoking ban.  Before it was introduced, everybody said that the whole country would fall off the edge of the world into the sea and then it happened and nothing bad happened as a result of it, except that many people, me included, gave up smoking.  If the evidence does not exist, and the Labour Court is not inundated, does the commission just take the employers at their word - and I am not suggesting anybody is spoofing -  when they come in and say that it will finish them?</p></speech>

The commission listens to the submissions and the cases made in relation to employers who say that they are having difficulties.  Some of that is anecdotal but we have all seen evidence of it where restaurants, for example, are not opening on Mondays or Tuesdays and maybe hours are being reduced as a result of that.  There is evidence that employers are under pressure.  I would like better evidence if I could get it.  I would like a situation going forward where we have a good fact-based decision making process.  The significance of the Maynooth report was that it suggested we could move forward on pay.  We have done that but we have also been prudent because of the shocks happening in the economy at the moment.</p></speech>

I do not imagine that it is a fear that low-income workers are suddenly going to be making loads of money.  It is more likely that the housing prices and Government policies that have caused them are causing that particular pressure.</p></speech>

In all of those cases, along with the smoking ban legislation that the Deputy cited, in which we were very heavily involved with Mandate, none of that materialised.  That is not to say you do not sit down and reasonably engage with employers, whether it is at a sectoral, multinational or indeed a small local enterprise level.  You must listen to their case but it must be a credible one to be able to sustain an argument that low pay is essential.  Low pay is never essential.  I go back to the point I made earlier on.  Real questions have to be asked and that is why I do not believe the concept that any job is better than no job.  A job must offer employees more than earnings; it must offer them dignity at work as well.  Earnings are one of those aspects.  If an employee feels they are undervalued, as was said in the minority report and in the commission's submission, that is a key aspect of productivity and somebody's enjoyment of life.</p><p>Certainly one must listen to those arguments but also interrogate them.</p></speech>

I thank the Chair and the distinguished members of the committee.  My colleague, Mr. O&rsquo;Shea, and myself are delighted to have this opportunity to engage and address the committee here today on behalf of EMI.  It is lovely to be back in person, given that the most recent couple of presentations were done virtually.</p> <p>  It is a privilege to be here and, as the Chair, outlined we will discuss EMI&rsquo;s annual Ireland and EU poll and the Conference on the Future of Europe.  Both these topics and the insights presented by them have particular significance this year, because not only have we marked the 50th anniversary on 10 May 2022 of the vote by the Irish people to join the then EEC, we will mark our formal accession on 1 January 2023.  Next year also marks the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.  While I will not go into that too much in my opening remarks, we will be happy to discuss it further during our exchanges later.</p> <p>  As members well know, since 2013, when Ireland held the rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU, we in EMI have carried out annual, independent polling on how people throughout the country view Ireland&rsquo;s relationship with the European Union.  This year, as a special marking of Ireland EU 50, we carried out our research in two parts.  We presented the first set of findings on 9 May, coinciding with Europe Day and with 50 years since the referendum.  We presented and published our second set of findings on 21 September, which was last week.</p> <p>  Going back to May, and to the stalwart question that we pose each year, we found that support for Ireland remaining a member of the EU increased by 4% since last year&rsquo;s finding to 88%.  The May 2022 poll also found that 76% of respondents agreed that they have a good understanding of how the EU works.</p><p>However, our September poll found that 56% of people in Ireland believe that the EU is moving in the right direction.  While a slight increase of 3% from past year, it does nonetheless show a gap between the 88% who support Ireland's EU membership and those who believe the EU is going in the right direction.  It is perhaps a useful cautionary reminder.<br/><br/>We found that young people, those in the 18- to 34-year-old demographic, and the older cohort of people aged between 55 and 65 plus, had the strongest level of belief that the EU is moving in the right direction, up to 69% in some instances.  While those in the middle cohort of the 35- to 54-year-olds being the most pessimistic.  Interestingly, that mirrors a similar trend that we found across a number of questions.<br/><br/>Turning topically and understandably to the issues of climate change and the energy crisis, 58% agree that member states should be allowed to delay meeting EU environmental targets to deal with the current energy crisis.An overwhelming majority of people &ndash; some 86% &ndash; are concerned that the cost-of-living crisis is harming the EU economy.  When we asked if the euro has been positive for Ireland, support remained high at 72% but, interestingly, represents a 14% decline on 2019 when we last posed this question when 86% of people then believed that the euro was positive for Ireland.<br/><br/>As the Russian invasion of Ukraine now enters its seventh month, 65% of people are in favour of Ukraine joining the EU, while 62% of people, when we turn to the topic of enlargement, agree that the EU should continue to allow more countries to join.  The poll also shows that half of people believe the security situation in Europe means that Ireland should increase its defence spending.  In our poll when we asked if Ireland should be part of increased EU defence and security co-operation, 59% agreed, which was up 5% from the previous year.<br/><br/>Turning to Northern Ireland, some 57% supported the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland while 35% did not know and 8% disagreed.  This is the highest level of do not knows and may indicate that there is a knowledge deficit in this area.  Interestingly as well, we saw the greatest levels of divergences across the different age ranges in replies to this question.  Up to 50% of those in the younger 18 to 34 year-old demographic stating that they did not know if they supported the protocol.  However, we saw increased support and fewer do not knows for the protocol in older age ranges, in particular those over 55 where support levels reached 75%.  Meanwhile almost one third of people, some 31%,, believe there will be a united Ireland in the EU in the next ten years, while 43% disagree and 26% do not know.  Of any question that we have asked in our polling data, the responses we have received on this issue have remained constant for three years, which is noteworthy in itself going, up or down one or two percentage points within the margin of error every year.<br/><br/>The Conference on the Future of Europe polling, and our annual Ireland in the EU poll, provide but a snapshot of sentiment at a point in time but our community engagement work builds on this to understand the views and ideas of people across the country.  This approach was most recently applied to our work on the Conference on the Future of Europe, which concluded the first phase of its work during the summer.  Many members of the committee will be familiar with the work of the Conference.  I want to mention those Oireachtas Members who were also members of the conference plenary, Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, Senator Higgins, Deputy Richmond, Deputy Niamh Smyth and, separately, Ms Deirdre Clune, Ireland South MEP.  I also thank the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, for his strong and consistent support and engagement with the Conference on the Future of Europe process.  Many others also engaged with it in the House or through some of the many regional events, and indeed local county councillors as well.  This engagement and support of public representatives was vital to contributing to the success of the conference process in Ireland.  We in EMI work closely in collaboration with the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs and the Department of Foreign Affairs to co-ordinate and organise broad, open, and inclusive events where people shared their ideas and inputted their views around the many key themes of the conference.  Due to the pandemic, these events took place virtually and we were delighted when health guidelines permitted these events to take place in person.  More than 70 events organised by many different organisations throughout Ireland, which included more than 4,500 people representing people from island communities, minority groups, young people, community activists, our diaspora, the newly arrived Irish people across the island and also our community overseas.  For us in European Movement Ireland we made a particular effort to speak to and engage with people outside of the so-called bubble and it was fantastic to see their input and their buy-in.  As part of the conference, the multilingual digital platform was launched which received almost 19,000 ideas from more than 53,000 participants across the EU.  The strong level of Irish engagement from citizens was with the with the topic of European democracy.  Other areas with high levels of engagement included a stronger economy, social justice and jobs, digital transformation, climate change and the environment, education, culture, youth, sport and health.<br/><br/>Interestingly, in our discussions in Ireland, two key themes emerged and were the most dominant.  Simply, people wanted better communication about the EU, issues and policies.  They want information that is delivered in a simple accessible and digestible way.  That came across regardless of which of the panels or the engagements that took place, regionally, geographically or demographically.  Second, what we thought was encouraging as well, was that people in Ireland felt that there is untapped potential to share best practice across member states and the EU institutions in policy areas.  People want more opportunity to learn how to do things better from our EU neighbours and <i>vice versa</i>.  People want information to understand how the EU relates to their lives and how it can make people's lives better.  <br/><br/>Complementing the work of EMI on the conference, I was also honoured to serve as Ireland&rsquo;s national citizens&rsquo; representative to the conference plenary.  Following an open and independent competition, I, as the national citizens&rsquo; representative, and Ms Emmy Coffey Nguyen as the alternate national citizens&rsquo; representative had the honour to represent Ireland and present our national recommendations over many days in the European Parliament in Strasbourg last winter and up to the end of May this year.  I was appointed to the digital transformation working group and there was a huge level of engagement and input that we were able to feed back into the process throughout Ireland as part of this work.  <br/><br/>As members will be aware, the plenary culminated in a report centred on 49 proposals that include more than 320 measures for the EU institutions to follow up on under nine topics.  We now need to ensure that these recommendations are followed by tangible, implementable proposals that will deliver on the issues raised.  They cannot be allowed to gather dust in some report on a shelf.  We want to see action and implementation.  Interestingly, the European Parliament responded to the conference by calling for a convention for the revision of the treaties on 9 June, proposing among other things, a reform of voting procedures, more competences in the area of health, the right of initiative for the European Parliament and strengthening rule of law procedures.  Earlier this month, the European Commission rowed in behind the call for a convention, with President von der Leyen expressing support during her state of the Union speech.<br/><br/>While many of the proposals do not require treaty change, some may do so and it is certainly evident from these calls for a convention that reform of the treaties is back as a talking point after being somewhat of a taboo subject for some years.  Understandably, there is reluctance in terms of potential treaty change.  However, a democratic process such as the Conference on the Future of Europe is a very much a two-sided bargain.  If people are asked to engage then we cannot ignore the results of that engagement.  We believe a lack of follow through on recommendations from the conference will only erode public trust in the EU and any future public engagement.</p><p>The conference process was a bold democratic experiment; in fact, it was the world's largest experiment in participatory democracy.  Of course, it was not perfect.  Perfection is hard and difficult to achieve over one year, but the system of democracy is one we must cherish and hold dear.  It is based on evolution - one rooted in change.  It rests on the principle of continually striving to be better, more inclusive and more representative.  This was something that the citizens and all participants in the conference strongly called for.  It is part of that process.  Those of us invested must advocate that this wish becomes part of the political infrastructure of the EU.</p><p> We know from the conference, our engagement and my own participation as the national citizen representative that people in this country want to be engaged in what the EU is doing, have their voices heard and contribute their opinions.  From our perspective in the EMI, we are very clear that we want this process and dialogue to continue, up to and including treaty change, if that proves necessary.  It does not have to be the starting-off point, but nor should it be excluded.  We welcome the sentiments in this regard expressed by the Taoiseach and Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs.  If we waste the opportunity presented by the conference, there will be consequences.  Equally, if we grasp the opportunity afforded by it, we will be a little further along on the journey towards a more inclusive, more democratic and better-functioning Europe, which is something we can all aspire to.  I thank the members of the committee.  I look forward to their questions.</p></speech>

Ms O'Connell said she has been busy recently, but she may be busier if she is advocating for treaty change.  We know how that goes in this country.  It is a big job of work.  Ms O'Connell is correct; we should not be afraid of it, if it is needed.  Things move on and the Union has evolved since the most recent treaty change.  We should not be afraid to update the treaties.</p> <p>   Ms O'Connell said, I think, 56% of respondents believe that the EU is moving in the right direction, which means 44% do not or do not know.  How was the question phrased?  Was it, "Do you think the EU is moving in the right direction?"  That is very subjective.  What does that even mean?  How was the question asked?</p></speech>

With that health warning, in terms of treaty change, what we feel very strong is, as the process evolves and people buy into it, it is really important that the process is not allowed to wither on the vine and is not just filed away.  There is that desire to keep the momentum and that dialogue and engagement going.  We should not be afraid of treaty change if that is what is required, but we do not believe it should be the starting-off point.  There is a lot that can be done under the existing treaties and clauses.  There are opportunities via the passerelle clause.  We are calling for a stronger and more robust Union that is more agile and able to be more proactive in reacting to the views and inputs of its citizens.  It is something we feel strongly about.  It is also something that came across throughout the dialogues we engaged with as part of this process.  I am sure Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; will agree, through being involved in the conference plenaries, it is something that came across from all of the European citizens and the stakeholders, Members of the European Parliament and national parliamentarians.  There is broad buy-in and ambition.  If we have seen anything, it has been the value of that collective or shared EU.  With the departure of a member state on the west and an invasion on the east, we cannot afford to take lightly or for granted our membership of the Union.</p> <p>  That was a great question about the polling methodology.  We commissioned RED C to carry out the poll and the questions are delivered as statements.  To aid people's ability to respond and engage with the question, they are put as statements, for example, "Ireland should remain a member of the EU".  They are then asked, "Do you agree strongly, slightly, disagree strongly, disagree slightly or do not know?"  We see a big role for ourselves in working with the "do not know" cohort.  In many of the questions, we saw quite high levels of "do not knows", indicating perhaps an understanding deficit or information deficit.  In our role of communicating on all aspects of Ireland's relationship with the EU, that communications work is something that we want to continue to ramp up.</p></speech>

Are there any plans on the part of EMI to delve further into that space given it is quite controversial?  What does greater co-operation in defence mean?  What does it look like?  We saw quite an adverse reaction to Ireland joining the Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO, which involves co-operating on training exercises and sharing of knowledge, not troops on the ground anywhere.  Ms O'Connell mentioned that citizens want to see us learn from each other in respect of best practice and that is what PESCO is about.  Are there plans to delve a bit further into what that might look like and what people are comfortable with?</p> <p>  On the Conference on the Future of Europe, what level of participation or engagement was there from Irish citizens?  I mean ordinary citizens, not those working in the sector, like us, for example.  How was participation measured and what was the level?</p></speech>

The dial has slowly shifted with people being more open to talking and engaging about it, pretty much across the board in terms of demographics, geography and gender.  We cannot deny the impact the Russian invasion of Ukraine had on this.  In the May poll, the fieldwork took place in and around the same time as the HSE cyberattack.  That outlined how fragile we are.  We are not an island in the cyber-digital world.  It is something that we believe quite strongly we should look at.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. O'Shea, to come in on that particular point.</p></speech>

As defence has become more of a priority at EU level over the past six or seven months, but also prior to that, we have noticed more engagement from our members on the issue.  For example, we published an explainer policy document on the publication of the strategic compass by the institutions last spring.  The general point is that as defence shoots up the European agenda, it will naturally become a feature of our work to explain what is happening at an EU level to an Irish audience.</p></speech>

As we mentioned in our opening remarks, 74 events took place with more than 4,500 people taking part, whether in our events, virtually or in events organised by the Department of Foreign Affairs events.  Civil society and business groups also organised events and Members of this House organised events and debates as part of the conference process.  The level of Irish engagement per head of population was quite high and this is something we can be very proud of.  It reflects well on our strong tradition of participatory democratic engagement and the citizens' assembly model was frequently held up among our European colleagues as a best-in-class or best-practice model.  A number of randomly selected Irish citizens were chosen to take part and represent Ireland as part of the European citizens' panels.  They were active and engaged.  It was great to have a European citizens' panel event take place in Dublin Castle.  The date had to be rearranged due to the C-word - the Covid pandemic - but it was fantastic and, as the saying goes, we punched above our weight in our active engagement.  If I may pay tribute, Members of the Oireachtas, including Deputy &Oacute; M&uacute;rch&uacute;, attended in Strasbourg and we made interventions at the plenary.  That active engagement and input are important, particularly on the working group side.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-28a.256" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022092800002#E00400"><p>I will start with the Conference on the Future of Europe, the idea of the convention and everything that was done imperfectly from the point of view of the conference, especially at the beginning.  The idea that greater and more consistent interaction with citizens is needed and that Europe is well removed from a considerable number of people was a big thing.  Anyone who goes out into the street here would know that.  We must follow up on the work that has been done and maintain a forum in which we can do it.  Everyone bought into that idea.  As important as all the interventions were, I was never quite clear why certain interventions made at plenary session or working group level were recorded on the books.  We could probably say that about a lot of the work the European Movement Ireland did too.</p> <p>  As I stated in Europe, interactions and civic engagements on Ireland took place.  I am referring specifically to Ireland's Future and we know it will hold a big event in the 3 Arena on Saturday.  None of that plugged in, however, and even if it had, it would not have mattered.  Only certain State interactions ended up in the overall report and it must have been on the basis of how the selections were made.  That was a flaw at the organisers' end.  I do not blame the European Movement Ireland, the committee or anyone else.</p> <p>  I understand that this all happened during the period of Covid initially.  This was followed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and we were also coming out of the Brexit situation, if we are ever to come out of it, and dealing with the relationship with Britain.  The solidarity shown across Europe then and the vital pieces of work done at a European level, in particular the block-buying of vaccines, shows the European Union has an ability to operate even in areas where it does not have a competence.  That could be missed to some degree when people are looking at reshaping the European Union.  Major work needs to be done and follow-through is definitely needed.  I am a bit disappointed with how some of the process went and that definitely needs to be dealt with at a later stage of interaction.</p> <p>  As regards the question of defence, it is probably not that surprising that people see defence in a slightly different form now.   We see it from a point of view of the Russian invasion and asymmetrical warfare and hybrid operations, to use those great terms.  We also see the absolute necessity of cyber.  People realise what neutrality means and to some degree defence spending needs to be increased to enable neutrality and a non-aligned position and to do our fair share in that regard.</p> <p>  As Senator Chambers said, we probably need to do a lot of diving down into many of these questions.  Some of the answers to the issues related to the Irish protocol are frightening.  I assume, perhaps wrongly, that there is a misunderstanding as regards some of the answers that have come back.</p> <p>  Everybody deals with the issue in front of them, be it health or whatever else, in a silo and sometimes it gets simplified, as if we had five people in a room and we need to get a majority decision.  People begin to think this does not make sense.  At European level, everyone is thinking about Hungary and people are arguing that we need to move from unanimity to qualified majority voting, while missing the big wins for the European Union in recent times such as the fact that we could do deals.  It was difficult for people to come up with agreements but they did and the European Union as a collection of democracies was able to operate on a level that controlled states or economies were not able to do.  The arguments relating to the European Union and democracy within it have held up in recent times.</p> <p>  My main questions relate to drilling down on the questions that were asked, the issues surrounding the Conference on the Future of Europe and any proposals the witnesses have on how that could be improved as regards engagement.  There was a failure on some level to provide the citizens with some of the information from the institutions in relation to what is being done and what can be done.  Sometimes they are looking for answers that are not needed in the sense that, as a collective, we have shown an ability to come up with agreements.  Treaty change or whatever will not necessarily be needed, although I do not rule it out.</p></speech>

We were alphabetically seated next to one another for many of the plenaries.</p> <p>  As regards Deputy &Oacute; M&uacute;rch&uacute;'s comments on the methodology of the conference, we certainly do not claim it was perfect in every way.</p><p>Did everything that Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; or I or others put forward as recommendations and views from the Irish perspective end up in the final report?  No, but we were able to input and shape it and as in all things European Union-related it reflects a compromise with something that is as multifaceted and as challenging as trying to piece it all together notwithstanding the structural challenges of the conference in terms of the sometimes opposing interests between and within the EU institutions; and the various challenges of being overshadowed by external events.  What came across very strongly, and something that we are calling for, is the recommendations prepared by the citizens' panels and by the outcome of the conference.  It really demonstrates, and especially to elected representatives and to all of us, the expectations that citizens across Europe have and that they place on the European Union.  The fact is that people believe, - and this is borne out by our polls - that the EU should assume more responsibility, perhaps exhibit greater external unity and use its strengths, regulatory powers and economic policies to advance those great transformation projects such as the Green Deal or the digital agenda, which is something that I saw very strongly in the digital transformation working group.  </p><p> In terms of implementing the conference proposals, exclusively predicating them on the questions of treaty change is not really what a lot of the citizens were talking about.   They just want the EU to work better for everyone collectively.  It then becomes more transparent and it picks up on Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s point as well on how it communicates better outside of that conference process; we really believe that this ongoing task should continue.  It should be a model of representative citizens' panels.  It is certainly one that can be taken away.  The good work and the example that we in Ireland have done on that is certainly credible.  It creates a genuine European input and a momentum.  If there is some way that the EU and the institutions could institutionalise and harness this engagement, it would be really welcome.   </p><p> I might ask Mr. O'Shea to come in on the methodology and to do the drilling down for some of the questions in the poll.  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; is absolutely right.  I know that we have a follow-on event on 2 December that we will attend in Brussels.  If we could keep that momentum going and keep that conversation alive, that is really important.  </p></speech>

Obviously there is always more we would like to learn from the polling.  To a certain degree, like any opinion polling, we are restricted in a certain sense.  For us it is really valuable because each year we look at priorities that are topical.  It is a really valuable test of sentiment for us in terms of guiding our own work, and guiding our citizen engagement that arises from it.  We do try to drill down in that way.  For example, on energy and the cost of living we are running four events around the country on energy with the European Commission over the winter.  The sentiment and the findings in the polling will guide our engagement through those events.</p> <p>  Likewise, to give another example on the euro question, what we can try to do as well is to match it up with other research.  Since we last asked that question support for the euro has fallen by about 14%.  If one matches that there is some research from Lund University that postulates that support for the common currency is linked to employment and inflation.  That insight will guide our work on those issues over the period ahead.  It is very difficult to drill down into why certain figures in Connacht-Ulster might be lower or why we see across a lot of questions the middle age brackets being less supportive than other age groups.  Anecdotally we know that is pretty consistent with a lot of opinion polling.  If we look back at some of the research that has been done on the Brexit referendum, yes there was an element of a left behind marginalised group, but there was also an issue in that squeezed middle or whatever one wants to call that group.  Scepticism was a factor in Brexit and I think that you see it in political polling as well.  It is not a perfect science, as politicians know well, but it is very useful in terms of guiding our own work, evaluating that the issues that we are focusing on are those which are relevant to public sentiment at a point in time.  I hope that is helpful.</p></speech>

I suppose to sell the necessary moves in climate change, whether it is in Ireland or across Europe, the idea that we are going to have to sell is that some of these moves, if it is into wind energy or renewables and all the rest, will provide us with solutions which will improve the situation on either a geopolitical level and also from a point of view of saving the planet.  Again, one would  probably need to drill down into three or four questions.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-28a.266" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1552" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022092800002#F00700"><p>I will start with the EU poll.  One thing that struck me is in relation to the Ireland and the Northern Ireland protocol.  That 34% do not know whether they support it.  That is a surprise given the amount of publicity the protocol is getting.  There obviously is a job of work to do for the Government, the Oireachtas and dare I say it, by European Movement Ireland as well to try to explain the importance of that.</p> <p>  Generally speaking, support for the EU is strong in Ireland, give or take slight variations here and there on some of the questions and that is a good thing.  Could witnesses clarify a point on the age cohorts?  I know they made some reference to the older demographic and the younger demographic.  Perhaps I picked it up wrong or is there a sense that younger people are less supportive of the EU, or aspects of the EU, because that would be a surprise to me on the basis of the Brexit referendum whereby the young people by and large supported remaining and it was the older people who wanted to leave?  I would be interested to know whether there is a sharp divergence between young people and old people's attitudes to the EU.  </p> <p>  On the conference, I would like to thank European Movement Ireland for the work that it did, and Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and others.  They did the State some service I would say by their participation in that and we do all appreciate it.  It is great to see Ireland strongly represented.</p> <p>  I want to zone in on two issues.  I worry a little about the proposal for a European political community put forward by President Macron and supported by the European Commission President.  Is that seen as a substitute for full membership of the European Union or how do the witnesses see that working in practice?  Is the proposal by President Macron something they would support?  One would wonder if this is getting into a two-tier Europe in terms of membership and I would be interested in witnesses' views on that.  </p> <p>  The second question relates to treaty change and the proposal for a convention on treaty change, supported by the European Parliament and the European Commission.  A number of issues arise there: switching from unanimity to qualified majority voting; strengthening EU competence in health and energy; incorporating the pillar of social rights into the treaty and providing the European Parliament with a right to legislative initiative.</p><p>They are some of the issues that could be embraced by treaty change.  Like Senator Chambers, I worry about it in an Irish context although I am probably not too afraid of it, I suppose.</p><p> Which issues does EMI think are important in respect of treaty change?  What are the most important things we could do?  I feel that treaty change should be limited and very clear-cut.  It should not be wide-ranging because we are talking about a referendum.</p><p> Finally, the opening statement mentioned plans for the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of our joining the EU next year.  Are plans being formulated at this stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-28a.268" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noelle O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022092800002#G00200"><p>I advise the committee to watch this space for our plans to mark the anniversary on 1 January 2023.  We have lots in store.  As I know Deputy Haughey is aware, it is very much a 24-month process, if we can do it that way.  We see it as part of the ongoing work we are doing.  We would appreciate the ongoing support and engagement of the members for the Ireland EU50 competition for primary, post-primary and third levels.  It is an initiative of the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs and is supported by the Department of Education.  It involves encouraging all young people across the country to enter a competition on what Ireland EU50 means to them.  That is a big part of the work that we will be doing.  We will be commemorating it digitally as well.  We are doing a digital anthology on Ireland's EU relationship.  We are also publishing a series of papers called 50 steps to 50 years of membership.  We see it as a way of getting people to engage, looking forward to the type of EU that people in Ireland want to be part of, and examining how we shape and influence that for the next 50 years.  It is a really ambitious range of projects and programmes across our different streams.</p> <p>  Also on engagement, we were delighted to have the Taoiseach do an "in conversation" podcast moderated by Professor Brigid Laffan in which he shared his reflections.  We hope to continue the EU 50 podcast in the coming months and in the year ahead.  We will keep the committee members engaged as ever.  I thank the Deputy for his support on that.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a really good point on the European political community, EPC.  EMI supports anything that can encourage debate and engagement on the EU and all matters European but we believe the EPC must be complementary and must not be a substitute for enlargement and for that process.  As we have seen in our Ireland and the EU poll, 62% of people are very much aligned with the Government's priorities of supporting enlargement and accession countries.  There is a high level of support for enlargement.  We do not want to see the EPC being a substitute.  We are living in an increasingly geopolitically challenged and more diverse continent.  With Brexit, which none of us wanted or welcomed, how we navigate and engage with countries that are not part of the EU, the multilateral world order and the rule of law system is something that the EU saw as part of the conference process.  People want the EU to be more robust and to be a beacon for the values on which it was founded.</p> <p>  I absolutely understand the point about treaty change and referendums and hear where the Deputy is coming from.  What we hear across our counterparts and networks is that the possibility of this happening imminently has probably waned and is somewhat on the back burner.  There is certainly reluctance among member states, notwithstanding the views of the Parliament and the Commission.  This can only happen with political will.  We must see where it aligns.  We are not calling for treaty change for the sake of it.  We have always been very clear that we want a better, more reflective and more efficiently functioning EU that responds in an agile and proactive manner to the needs, wants and wishes of all its citizens, notwithstanding the challenges.  The geostrategic transformation of Europe which is going on at the moment is something we need to keep an eye on.</p> <p>  On some of the changes and how we look at things like qualified majority voting in the foreign policy arena, we think there is a way to look at this via the Passerelle clause and others, as I mentioned.  We saw with the fiscal compact treaty how workaround solutions can come about.  That is something where there is precedent.  The next generation of EU funding is also an example of the EU nimbly working to come up with solutions at short notice.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Shea might like to come in on the younger demographic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-28a.269" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen O'Shea" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022092800002#G00300"><p>I can clarify that for the Deputy.  By and large, the younger demographic and the older demographic are the most supportive.  We tend to see a sort of U curve across many questions.  It is among those in the 35 to 54 age range that support falls off.  On the EU energy targets question, we found that young people were most likely to disagree with the notion that energy targets should be cast aside because of the current pressures we face.  Young people tend to be quite enthusiastic and quite idealistic in their responses.  I have some more interesting nuggets.  We find "don't knows" higher among females than males quite a lot.  At the beginning of the meeting, the Chair mentioned that levels of support are less than the national average in Connacht-Ulster in particular.</p> <p>  On the EPC, personally I thought the state of the Union address was interesting in respect of the President's commitment to grant Ukraine access to certain aspects of the Single Market and to provide mobile roaming rights to Ukraine.  It is interesting in terms of the debate about the EPC.  It could be an interesting structure around which to build co-operation whereby you grant aspiring member states some of the privileges and rights of membership before membership actually takes place.  That is a way to keep them engaged and to reward progress or whatever you want to call it.  Perhaps there is potential for a structure which would provide some of the benefits of membership while being on the road to membership because as we know the accession process is long and tortuous.  We see that in the western Balkans where people tend to find it difficult to keep communities and populations engaged.  That is just a personal view on that aspect of the matter.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-28a.270" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022092800002#H00100"><p>I thank both Ms O'Connell and Mr. O'Shea for the very good presentation and for the ongoing work of EMI.</p> <p>  If it is okay, I want to go back and ask about polling.  It was stated that a large number say they do not understand the protocol, which Ms O'Connell indicated is of concern.  However, is that a surprise, considering that the vast majority of people who negotiated the protocol in the UK do not seem to understand it either, based on how it is being implemented and their approach?</p> <p>  My second question relates to the direction of the EU.  To be honest, this question is probably a bit more serious.  While I welcome the finding on the percentage of people who are happy with the direction, is this the space that the Conference on the Future of Europe - at which the witnesses represented the citizens of Ireland so well - needs to fill?  I do not believe many of the 50-odd recommendations from the conference will address that, but I will highlight a number of them, for example, the recommendation that more aspects of health be made a European competence and the recommendation that a greater focus be placed on where co-operation can deliver tangible results for European citizens.  Mr. O'Shea mentioned enthusiastic and idealistic young people.  In a roundabout way, in order to get hold of the direction of the European Union, does the conference lead to a convention that will lead, in due course, to treaty change and a referendum in this jurisdiction?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-09-28a.271" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Noelle O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022092800002#H00200"><p>We could not possibly comment on the implementation of the protocol, but we are members of the EU's Trade and Cooperation Agreement domestic advisory group.  That is a very useful and important forum in which we make an input and work to try to mitigate the challenges and difficulties posed by Brexit.  This is something we take very seriously.  It has come across in all of our engagements with this committee that there is a body of work to be done on the communication and explanation of the information to aid and increase greater understanding of the protocol both North and South and, in particular, east and west as well.  It is something that we will continue to do in our engagement work.</p> <p>  Deputy Richmond is correct about the direction of the EU and the Conference on the Future of Europe, and how we could perhaps increase the percentage of people in this country who believe the EU is moving in the right direction.  There are certainly some areas of the conference outcome and recommendations on which we feel more could be done.  The Deputy mentioned health competencies in particular.  A very interesting suggestion that came across not only in my own digital transformation working group work but also in the health working group was that the Covid vaccine pass and other such information could be uploaded very simply onto the European health insurance card.  That is a very practical measure that I hope can be examined.  There are many very good initiatives in terms of digital literacy and ensuring that no one is left behind, including having broadband access across the EU, financial literacy skills and how we combat misinformation and disinformation.  These are all very practical initiatives that came across from the conference that I hope will provide ideas for committee members, as elected representatives, to look to lead on initiatives and champion them.  We have seen that the desire and input are there.  It is very encouraging that people want to shape and influence what direction the European Union takes.</p> <p>  Treaty change and referendums are issues that we touched upon in our engagement this morning.  We do not believe treaty change should be a starting off point but, as Senator Chambers and Deputy Haughey stated, we have to be mindful of it.  We should not fear it, if it makes the European Union function more effectively.  However, there are mechanisms in place that can be used to make the EU more efficient and effective and do not necessarily necessitate treaty change.  We do not want to see an institutional tug-of-war take place over the EU's strategic direction.  There are areas I mentioned such as the Passerelle clause.  We should not just look for treaty change for the sake of it.  As we saw, there are always ways around some of the challenges.  We saw that with the approach taken during the Covid vaccine crisis, the health crisis and the fiscal compact.  There is precedent.  There is flexibility within the current treaties to accommodate individual positions, as we know only too well in Ireland.  We think some of the outcomes from the Conference on the Future of Europe process can be implemented and driven forward without too great a difficulty.  That is something that we are very strongly calling on all parties to the conference process to drive forward.  As we mentioned, we cannot afford to have an erosion of trust and confidence in the European Union and in the participatory parliamentary democracy process.  That would not benefit anyone.  What we have seen is that, politically, we have a more united European Union, one that represents the values on which it was founded.  We want to make sure that is maintained.</p></speech>

I agree with all that has been said and the need for a continuation and possibly an upscaling of citizen engagement.  This is a single transferable speech in the sense that there are those at the periphery who are removed from politics on every level.  I would have thought that was another failing.  It was probably members of the European middle class who met at the Conference on the Future of Europe.  There probably needs to be an element of work done at a domestic and European level to engage with the cohort on the periphery.  I accept we will never engage with those who are outside the periphery, but there is a piece of work to be done.</p> <p>  I found it strange that certain issues did not come up that would pertain to communities I deal with daily.  I refer to the wider issue of where the antisocial meets drug gang criminality, but there was no mention of it.  I cannot believe that is not an issue right across the entirety of modern Europe.  I think certain voices were missed.  I am sure the witnesses, no more than me, do not necessarily have a whole suite of solutions to provide to the committee, but it is something we must put on the agenda.</p></speech>

I also thank Ms O'Connell and Mr. O'Shea.  The engagement has been very helpful and informative.  We will take the witnesses up on the suggestion to look at areas where we can work together.  Our focus as a committee is to continue to look at the eastern front of Europe.  We want to continue with our engagement with the Balkan countries.  We had a representative of North Macedonia before us last week.  We have learned a lot from our trip to Moldova and Romania.  Peripherality is an issue.  Many countries on the eastern side of Europe believe the region is getting attention now because of the war, which gives rise to the question of why the attention was not on it in the first place.</p> <p>  We could look at the inverse of that on the north-west coast of Ireland and the various percentages.  In terms of peripherality, it is not just about having meetings in peripheral areas, although that is a big part of it.  The witnesses held one of the four national meetings in Donegal town, which was a big deal.  Core versus periphery is more than just a logical analysis; it is a feeling.</p><p>We will be happy to engage with EMI in our work, as we continue to work with the Balkans and with eastern Europe.  If there is anything we can do in that space, especially to commemorate a significant landmark like the 50-year anniversary, as well as the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, we will be happy to do it.</p><p> Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe ar&iacute;s.
