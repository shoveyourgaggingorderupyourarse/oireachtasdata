We are joined, in person, by Mr. Wayne Stanley, Chair, Home for Good Coalition, and Ms Rebecca Keatinge, Mercy Law Research Centre.  We are joined, via video link, by Professor Gerry Whyte, Trinity College Dublin, and Ms Rosemary Hennigan, Focus Ireland.  I thank them for their attendance and for the submissions they made in advance.</p> <p>  Members have been circulated with the opening statement as well as a more detailed briefing note.  I shall first ask the representative of the Home for Good Coalition to make an opening statement and members will then be invited to address their questions.  I urge people to limit their questions and answers to five minutes so that we can get around the room for a second round of questions, and follow-up questions.</p> <p>  The witnesses attending in the committee room are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation that they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege.  It is my duty, as Chair, to ensure that such privilege is not abused and, therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as enjoyed by a witness who is physically present.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  </p> <p>  I invite Mr. Stanley or Ms Keatinge to make an opening statement on behalf of the Home for Good Coalition.  On conclusion we will proceed to questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Wayne Stanley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110300002#B00200"><p>My colleague, Ms Keatinge, and I shall share the delivery of our opening statement.  As chairperson of the Home for Good Coalition, I extend our thanks to the Oireachtas committee for the invitation to present on this issue of bringing forward the referendum on a right to housing.</p> <p>  Home for Good is a coalition of housing non-governmental organisations or NGOs.  They include the F&oacute;rsa trade union, academics, activists and lawyers.  As a group, we believe that constitutional change is urgently required to rebalance our Constitution, and ensure that enabling the provision of secure and adequate housing be recognised as a central role of the State.  We call for a referendum to provide a constitutional amendment that would insert a stand-alone right to housing in our Constitution.</p> <p>  As advocates and experts, we understand how important a right to housing will be for those experiencing homelessness, and for those in inadequate, unaffordable, unsafe, insecure or overcrowded accommodation.  A constitutional right to housing will recognise that a balance must be struck between the right to private property, on the one hand, and the right to housing, on the other hand.</p> <p>  The period of the Covid-19 pandemic has starkly demonstrated the importance of an adequate home to keep a person safe.  As a group we are more certain than ever of the need to amend the Constitution to ensure that the necessary policies can be implemented to work towards ending the housing exclusion and homelessness that has marred our society for too long, and in the pandemic has left too many vulnerable.</p> <p>  The Home for Good Coalition welcomes the inclusion of a referendum on housing in the programme for Government.  We have monitored the discussions of the committee so welcome, within the committee, what appears to us to be a very strong cross-party consensus that this will be a referendum on a right to housing.  We now wish to work closely with the committee to get the process under way of determining the wording and aims of this amendment.  To that end, we began working with a group of legal experts to develop an amendment that will meet the objectives I have briefly outlined.</p> <p>  Professor Gerry Whyte has joined the meeting via Zoom technology and is professor of law at Trinity College Dublin.  He is one of the experts who have given generously of their time.</p><p>We are also joined by Rosemary Hennigan, who is part of that legal group and who is a colleague from Focus Ireland.  I will hand over to Rebecca Keatinge, who will outline why this referendum should be proposed with a view to having a stand-alone right to housing, and the wording which Home For Good has endorsed and believes best achieves this right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rebecca Keatinge" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110300002#C00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting Home For Good to discuss this important topic.  I am managing solicitor at Mercy Law Resource Centre, which is one of the founding members of Home For Good, and we chair the legal subgroup of which Ms Hennigan and Professor Whyte are members.  I refer to the existing protections of private property rights in the Constitution and why a referendum specifically on a stand-alone right to housing is needed, in our view, and I will also to set out the wording that Home For Good is proposing to progress this important discussion.<br/><br/>The Constitution currently provides protection of private property rights in Article 43 and Article 40.3 but there is no equivalent right to housing protected in the Constitution.  This means that the starting point of every legal analysis in respect of the regulation of land begins from the perspective of the property owner&rsquo;s right.  While this right may be restricted in the interests of the common good, the starting point for analysis remains the private interest, with the common good only relevant insofar as it justifies the State in limiting this right to private property.  As a result, the Constitution perceives property as a private interest held by a rights holder, though this interest is capable of being restricted by the State in appropriate circumstances in the interest of the common good.  A difficulty, however, is that it may not be easy in advance to predict when the common good would justify a restriction on the right to private property.  Furthermore, it is a complex task to identify in what circumstances such considerations may justify an interference in private property rights.<br/><br/>A more effective and proactive constitutional approach, which we propose, would be to continue the existing protection for private property rights but weigh these against the protection of a right to housing.  In this recast scenario, the Legislature and the courts would be tasked with balancing two rights against each other, subject to the usual restrictions around proportionality and rationality.  This, in our view, would remove the current overly narrow interpretation of private property rights in the Constitution and enable the Government to respond to the current housing and homelessness crisis in a manner that properly and fairly balances competing interests.  Not only does this create a fairer balance, it will better frame the State&rsquo;s role in housing, not only as a protector of private property rights but as a protector of our human right to safe and secure housing.  Thus, the State would have an obligation to provide for the realisation of this right within available resources, analogous to the existing constitutional obligation to provide for free primary education.<br/><br/>Our proposal, therefore, is for a stand-alone right, one that is directly enforceable and that includes a separate statement of the State's obligation to realise that right within available resources.  Home For Good proposes the insertion of a new Article 43A, which states:</p> <blockquote> 	Housing<br /><br />Article 43A<br /><br />1. The State recognises, and shall vindicate, the right of all persons to have access to adequate housing.<br /><br />2. The State shall, through legislative and other measures, provide for the realisation of this right within its available resources. </blockquote> <p>In conclusion, we very much welcome this session.  It is an occasion to both consult and discuss the formulation of this amendment in public session.  The committee's scrutiny is an important preparatory step towards any referendum.  We hope the committee's engagement and consideration will progress this important issue and give impetus and a clear timeline within which the referendum can be held.  We look forward to engaging with the committee and thank members for their time. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110300002#C00300"><p>We move to questions from the members.  I call Senator Mary Fitzpatrick.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1656" speakername="Mary Fitzpatrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110300002#C00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending and I am delighted to welcome them to the committee.  As the other speakers in my group will indicate, Fianna F&aacute;il is very supportive of this proposal.  I come from Dublin Central and I have been a city councillor for 15 years.  I come at the housing crisis, therefore, from the lived experience of my constituents over those 15-odd years.</p><p>I firmly believe in a couple of things, one of which is that the housing crisis will only be solved if there is the political will to do so.  The inclusion of such a commitment in the Constitution would take it away from the transience of day-to-day politics and would make it a State commitment to provide adequate housing to citizens, which is really important.  It is only with that strong commitment that it will become something that is perpetuated, which is what we need it to be.  As I am not a constitutional lawyer by any stretch of the imagination, I will defer to those with much greater knowledge but I strongly believe that traditionally and historically, everything has been weighted towards the rights of private property, which is understandable.  Not to take away from that, we should use this as an opportunity to assert the State's commitment to people's human rights and their rights as individuals to achieve their full potential.  Mr. Stanley mentioned the Covid-19 pandemic.  Through the housing crisis, I have seen how not having a home or a place that is secure and to which one can go, close the door and have a bit of quiet time and peace of mind - without necessarily owning it - deprives people of their ability to go to school, do their homework, go to college, progress in life or contribute to our society.  </p><p> As we approach this issue, we should look at asserting that right, namely, the provision of housing and secure homes, as contributing to each individual's right to achieve his or her full potential.  I am interested to hear from the lawyers how that can be captured in any amendment.  From my understanding, there are very limited examples internationally of such a right being included in constitutions but the witnesses should talk a little about how or if it has worked and how that can be demonstrated.  I thank the witnesses for their engagement with the committee and look forward to working with them to deliver this referendum as part of the work in the next four years of the Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Wayne Stanley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110300002#D00200"><p>I thank the Senator for her contribution and her reiteration of that commitment.  It is really valuable to us to know that we are building the sort of cross-party consensus around the need for this referendum.  On the question the Senator raised on its full potential and the examples from other countries, I will defer to Professor Whyte and Ms Keatinge, as the lawyers present, to provide the legal examples.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rebecca Keatinge" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110300002#D00300"><p>In respect of Covid-19, we have seen that both our individual and our collective well-being depend on people having secure and safe homes, so it has brought this issue into a sharp focus.  We see the referendum as being future-looking.  It is to provide that floor of protection against recurring crises looking forward, as the Senator commented.</p> <p>  In other jurisdictions, there are 83 constitutions that protect the right to housing across the world.  This is constituted in a whole range of different wordings, and as a sub-group, we have looked at many of those wordings.  As an organisation, the Mercy Law Resource Centre produced a report on the protection of the right in other jurisdictions in Europe, including Finland, and the statutory protections that exist in France and Scotland.  That details how, in those legal frameworks, the protections exist and the impact they have had.  The overall conclusions I would draw from that report and from our own research is that to introduce the protection we would not be an outlier.  It is a common protection that exists in modern, well-functioning democracies.  The other comment I would make is a bit of a caveat and while Ms Hennigan and Professor Whyte will be able to speak to some of the specific examples, we have a very specific legal framework.  It is difficult to import how some things operate in other jurisdictions.  For example, Finland has a protection in relation to housing but its laws operate and are formed through a very different process.  There is pre-legislative scrutiny to make sure that things are constitution-proofed, and there are other interventions, but we have quite a unique system.  We have looked at the South African example, which is obviously a very different context, but that does have some comparators with our own legal system.  The committee will see in our note that we have commented on how that example can be used.  I will defer now to Professor Whyte and Ms Hennigan might add some further comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerard Whyte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110300002#E00100"><p>If I may, I will comment briefly on the South African experience.  When we were drawing up our formula, we looked at the experience in South Africa.  The first clause of our proposal is based on section 26 of the South African Constitution.  The important point to make is that when it came to judicial enforcement of the right of access to adequate housing, the South African constitutional court used a standard of reasonableness which leaves considerable room to the legislative and executive powers in South Africa to protect or vindicate this particular right.</p> <p>  In one particular instance, the Grootboom case, the South African Supreme Court, using this standard, highlighted an omission from the then policy.  It did not address the position of people who are in crisis situations as a result of eviction and who needed emergency accommodation.  It stated that the absence of this provision made the existing policy unreasonable or failed to comply with the constitution.  The ball was then passed back to the legislature and executive and within a period of four years both at state and provincial level they had adopted policies which addressed this problem.  That is how we would see a constitutional guarantee of right of access to adequate housing operating in this jurisdiction as well.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110300002#E00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I commend the work of Home for Good.  It is a really good alliance and initiative to try to bring this issue to the next level.  I acknowledge the good campaigning work of other networks, such as Raise the Roof, which has been strongly arguing for such a constitutional referendum.  As committee members will know, Sinn F&eacute;in has long supported such a referendum.  It is important to acknowledge that this is probably the fifth time we have discussed this issue in this room and in this format.  We did it on four separate occasions, twice when Mercy Law Resource Centre had published two very good reports and at two other hearings.  At some point, we have to stop discussing it in this room, we must have a referendum campaign and try to change the Constitution.  Perhaps this will be the D&aacute;il and the committee that pushes it on to the next level.</p> <p>  Three arguments are often used against such a referendum.  I will put them to the witnesses because I would like to hear their responses.  The first is that such a constitutional right would guarantee everybody in the State the right to a free home and there would be a big queue outside Government Buildings where everybody would looking to get their keys.  It is a counter-argument often used by critics.  I would like the witnesses to respond specifically to it.  Another counter-argument we hear is that a constitutional right to housing will not build any homes and there are many jurisdictions that have such rights and their housing crises are as bad if not worse than ours.  I would interested to hear the witnesses' response to that argument.  A third argument, which was used heavily by opponents of economic, social and cultural rights in the Constitutional Convention, is that this would be an interference in the role of the Legislature and Government to set policy and it would give the courts undue influence in that area.  I will give the witnesses an opportunity to respond to those points.</p> <p>  The witnesses might outline, for those members who do not know, what the outcomes of the Ninth Report of the Convention on the Constitution 2014 were, specifically with respect to this right.  More than 80% of people at that convention voted strongly in favour of such a right.  I would like to hear the witnesses' thoughts on that.  Will they explain, in plain English to those of us who are not lawyers or constitutional experts, why this is valuable, what use this would be to those members of this committee who are genuinely concerned about the state of our housing crisis and would like additional tools to try to resolve those problems?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110300002#E00500"><p>I will let them decide who can best respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Wayne Stanley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110300002#F00100"><p>The referendum is to last well beyond Covid-19 but the reason we mentioned Covid-19, and why it stands out so starkly, is we have been using the language of crisis about housing and homelessness for a number of years.  Constantly in Oireachtas discussions, when more far-reaching proposals were put forward to address the crisis, the Constitution was held up as the barrier.  When the Covid crisis - an almost existential crisis for the State - arose, this barrier was got over.  I do not believe the public needs us to be at this level of crisis to be able to address what everyone acknowledges is a housing and homelessness crisis but it seems the Constitution does, or certainly the political system engaging with the Constitution does.  This was a watershed moment in my thinking but I would have supported the referendum prior to the onset of Covid-19.</p> <p>  As for the constitutional convention on this issue, the important and interesting aspect of this for me was that when citizens entered an iterative discursive unpacking of all of the issues in the three arguments outlined, which always have had a lot of force and effect, more than 80% of people said we should put it in our Constitution.  When citizens enter into this discussion, I believe a referendum on it will be passed because people will see the true value of it.</p> <p>  I have answers for the Deputy's three questions but the lawyers would be much better placed to speak about them, particularly on the right to a free home and interfering with the role of the State.  I will hand over to Ms Keatinge and then we might go to all of my colleagues.</p></speech>

With regard to whether this gives people the right to a free home, it is certainly not the position.  Criticism levelled against such a protection in other countries is that it has not provided people with homes.  In this, we are looking at generalised access to housing for people who are not able to provide for their own housing, as well as providing that to an appropriate standard.  The second section of our proposed wording refers to available resources.  As for this not leading to the building of any homes, it is an enabling provision designed to influence and enable the Government to bring forward progressive policy measures and a legal framework that can develop the housing infrastructure we need to meet the need that is not being met at present.</p> <p>  With regard to interference in the separation of powers, Professor Whyte will pick up on the reasonableness point.  He mentioned the South African example.  This is an assessment of whether the measures being taken by the State are reasonable.  We see cases that would get to the court as being very egregious.  In these situations, the courts will simply pass it over to the Legislature or the State to determine what policy responses are required.</p></speech>

This would give rise to a dialogue whereby the courts would indicate whether there was a problem with a particular policy that needed to be addressed and the matter would be passed back to the other two organs of government.  We have had experience of this in our Constitution in a different context.  If we look at the guarantee of the right to free primary education, in the mid-1990s the High Court in the O'Donoghue case drew attention to the fact that existing educational policy at the time was falling short of the constitutional guarantee because it did not provide properly for children with severe or profound learning difficulties.  Mr. Justice O'Hanlon granted a declaration in the High Court to this effect and ultimately it led to the adoption of State policies providing appropriate support for children at the more severe end of the learning difficulty spectrum.</p><p>That is a good example, which we have in our constitutional order, of how the courts, the Legislature and the Executive would dialogue about the problem, leaving it ultimately to the Legislature and the Executive to come up with a particular solution.</p></speech>

I respect their bona fides.  As a politician of 11 years and a former member of Waterford City and County Council who has dealt with many housing projects, I share their goal that everybody should have secure and adequate housing.  However, as a committee it is our job to interrogate that and to ask the hard questions.  I preface my questions with those remarks.</p> <p>  I would like to know a little more about the potential impact of such a move and a referendum, assuming it is passed.  For example, I would like to know what the witnesses consider to be secure and adequate accommodation.  Is it accommodation leased for one year, two years, five years, ten years or on a lifelong basis?  Is it a small, cramped apartment or a house that is suitable for a person's current or future needs?  If I am an 18-year old who cannot afford to purchase a house, which any young person I know would not be able to do, can I potentially take a case against the State for breaching my constitutional rights in terms of it not being able to provide me with a home, presuming that this referendum is passed?  </p> <p>  I have read the opening statements and I note the reference therein to "within available resources" being stated in the proposed amendment.  Would the witnesses agree that is very subjective?  One could argue, if taking a case against the State on these grounds, that there were plenty of resources available to the State or the Government of the day but, perhaps, they chose not to apply them in the area of housing.  Government must make these very difficult decisions at budget time and all of the time, and it may choose to put additional resources into health over housing or into community over another area.  As somebody taking a case against the State, I could argue that the resources were plenty but the State chose not to use them in that manner.  Are we opening up the State to potential significant legal costs into the future?  I would welcome the witnesses' opinions on those matters.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Cummins for his question.  The first point to make in regard to the definition of "adequate" is that primarily it is for the Oireachtas and policymakers to decide what it means.  This constitutional provision would require the State to make that decision and to have that debate in a substantive way.  If the State fell short on that, it would be open to an individual to challenge that.  At that point, the Judiciary would step in with a form of oversight.  This is common across many different rights areas which already exist in our Constitution.  We would be coming out of the current housing crisis having learned a lot of lessons the hard way.  We want to build on that now by having this constitutional amendment such that the State is committed to investing in housing.  Professor Whyte may be able to expand further on that.</p></speech>

If this constitutional referendum is adopted, we will have a right to private property and a right of access to adequate housing.  In that scenario the Oireachtas would be required to balance two competing rights, for example, to regulate property rights and the rights of landlords to vindicate the right of access to adequate housing.  The Supreme Court indicated a number of years ago that it takes a very deferential approach to any judgment the Oireachtas would make.</p><p>It would only be if the Oireachtas struck a balance which was contrary to reason and fairness that the courts would intervene.  Again, it gets back to this point that having a Constitutional provision would require the Oireachtas and the executive to address housing issues and housing crises but they retain considerable room for manoeuvre.  The courts would only intervene if there were serious or egregious neglect of the rights of somebody to adequate housing.</p></speech>

It sets out seven different characteristics, which include security of tenure, accessibility, cultural adequacy and location.  It is about measuring those factual circumstances the Senator drew out against those characteristics.  There is a whole body of opinion that will guide the Government's consideration around what is adequate, so I do not think it is about specifying the size of an apartment.</p></speech>

We do not believe it is constructive to define an exact form of accommodation that is adequate because every factual situation is different and diverse.  I know this from my own practice.

Those housing needs would be different so I refer the Senator to the characteristics.</p></speech>

It is a very positive movement and I am very familiar with it.  I do not need to be convinced because this is critically important.  I thank the representatives for their papers and the documents they have submitted, which we have all had an opportunity to read.  I want to share some of my observations and comments on this.  I have only one question, which I will ask at the end.</p> <p>  All citizens should have a constitutional right to adequate, secure and affordable housing.  We know that 80% of the participants in the Convention on the Constitution on this issue said as much and that the right should be enshrined in our Constitution.  That is fact and it is worth every member of this committee taking time out to look at the recommendations and the findings.  Some 80% of the people who sat on Convention on the Constitution came out strongly in favour of this referendum.  Providing for the constitutional right to a home will be challenging.  As people identified earlier, it will oblige the State to make reasonable provision to vindicate that right through its policies and its actions.  That is reasonable and fair and would be a natural follow-on from if there were a successful outcome in such a referendum.</p><p>As has been alluded to, more than 80 countries around the world provide a right to housing in their constitutions.  Home for Good identified and considered the issue of providing a constitutional right to housing.  Having read some documentation, we acknowledge that this would not be an instant solution and would not provide homes for everyone.  However, it lays down a marker and it is a good aspiration.  The United Nations special rapporteur on the issue also spoke in favour of it.</p><p> We are in the middle of an unprecedented housing and homelessness crisis.  That sentence has been rolled out often but it is true.  In recent weeks, a number of people who were homeless died.  I am not saying they died because they were homeless but they were homeless when they died.  There are a number of questions around that and we need to ask them of ourselves.</p><p> Thousands of low and middle income families which would once have been able to secure local authority or social and affordable homes are now languishing on never-ending lists.  As someone who spent many years in local government and who was involved with the housing sector generally, I know that we have thousands of people with no hope of a home.  I am not talking about owning a home.  I am not in the business of owning a home.  I do not really care who builds a home, be it public, private, social or in a partnership.  I am talking about having a place to call home in which people feel safe and secure.</p><p> Behind all the homelessness figures, there are lives and real people.  For many years now, this committee has spent most of its time discussing housing and homelessness.  Too many children have nowhere to sleep at night.  A few years ago, the then Government stated that no person would be in a hotel within six months.  That never happened.  People are in emergency accommodation and bed and breakfast and other inappropriate accommodation.  People slept under hedges last night.  That is the reality and the crisis we have.</p><p>We can bring this crisis under control.  We need to believe in ourselves as members of this committee, politicians and advocates for housing.  We need to believe we can bring about and effect real change.  It can be done.  We have land banks of public and private land.  I do not want to get hung up on public versus private because I believe the way forward lies in having synergy and co-operation between the private and public sectors to address this issue.  We have the capacity to build homes.  We have the vision and the land.  We need collaboration and we need to change the direction of policy.  The most important phrase I am hearing today is that housing is a "human right".  It is a human right that people have a place to call home.</p><p> On the formulation of the wording, Ms Keatinge indicated there are two aspects to the recommendation, namely, the recognition of directly enforceable rights because that is important and the separate statement about the State's obligation to realise that right within available resources.  The latter could be used as a bit of a get-out but that is the reality.  How did the witnesses arrive at the formula of words they are recommending?  Will they tease that out for me?</p><p> To be clear, I fundamentally support citizens having a constitutional right to adequate and reasonable housing.  For far too long, we have talked about this crisis across all parties and none.  We can now do something about it.  I am highly impressed when people such as the witnesses, with their strong credentials in housing and advocacy, come to the table.  I thank them for sticking with this issue, pursuing it and, more important, making it simple for people to grasp because that is the real key.  I ask Ms Keatinge to respond on the wording.</p></speech>

It came in the context of Mercy Law Resource Centre's discussion and examination of other jurisdictions, to which I referred.  Home For Good came together and formed a legal subgroup.  A specific objective was to examine what wording might work in an Irish context.  We examined wording from other constitutions and put together a document featuring the wording from all 81 constitutions.  We looked at the Irish legal framework.  We brought in legal experts, including Professor Whyte and others, to examine different formulations.</p><p>Then we examined our constitutional framework, where it would be best positioned and the best wording.  We examined the international guidance I referred to and then arrived at the formulation.</p><p> We are putting our formulation out for discussion and for engagement with the committee.  We have legal experts engaged but we would be interested in hearing everybody's comments on the formulation so we can arrive at the right wording for this referendum.  That is crucial.</p></speech>

The Green Party argued for this referendum to be included in the programme for Government and therefore welcomes the discourse today to make progress on this human right.  As the witnesses mentioned, the Government has an obligation to provide free primary education through the Constitution.  This being the case, could the witnesses state why, according to their understanding, a right to housing has never been part of our Constitution?  Given the strong political support for a referendum, what could hold up the proposed legislation?  How would obstacles be overcome?</p></speech>

The right to free primary education was an outlier.  The Irish Constitution does not specifically recognise any socioeconomic right other than the right to free primary education.  At the turn of this century, the Supreme Court indicated it was not appropriate for the courts to identify implied socioeconomic rights.  That is why we are in the current circumstances, in which we have to argue for referring the matter to the people to allow them to vote on including a right to adequate housing in the Constitution.</p></speech>

If the Oireachtas decides to have a referendum, we will go to the people and we will state our case.  When the matter was brought to the Convention on the Constitution, these arguments were all played out.  Some very authoritative people on both sides of the argument spoke to the members and there were significant conversations.  It was felt that some of the decisions that emerged from that process were far too radical and would never be accepted by the public but they were fully endorsed by the public so I do not believe there is an issue.</p> <p>  To go back to the first question, it seems there is an historical context.  When the Constitution was written, food was much more expensive than housing.  There was an abundance of housing.  We had a very different country and context.  For me, part of this process is modernising the Constitution to reflect the world and country we are in now.</p></speech>

I appreciate all the work that has been done on this issue to date.  The Social Democrats have been very supportive of a constitutional right to housing.  It is good to see near cross-party consensus on this.</p><p>According to research carried out by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, approximately 13 different Bills could not go through the Oireachtas and proceed on the basis of the Constitution, which is certainly one of the reasons we need this referendum.  As has been referenced, the Constitutional Convention in 2014 recommended a constitutional amendment to include the right to housing.  This has been knocking about and has been before other Oireachtas committees.  It is now in the programme for Government and there is a proposed wording for a referendum on the right to housing.  What sort of timeframe do our guests think we are looking at?  What sort of preparatory work would be needed on the wording and building political consensus?  What sort of timeframe are we looking at?  We do not know when we can have a referendum because of Covid-19 but if we park that consideration and assume it would not be a factor, how soon could we have a referendum?  How soon do our guests think we need to have a referendum on this matter?  There is a strong argument from a housing rights perspective.  We also know from previous cycles that if commitments included in a programme for Government do not happen within the first couple of years, they will not always be delivered on in the final year, or whatever.  What would be our guests' views about the timing of a referendum?</p></speech>

Getting agreement to a date for the referendum would be fantastic because it would give us a framework within which to engage the public and agree a form of wording.  A referendum within a year would be our preference but we are bearing in mind difficulties around that.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked if we feel the referendum is urgent; we absolutely do.  A good example of why we think it is urgent is the recent legislation banning evictions that came to an end in July.  There is now a much narrower restriction in place as long as level 5 is activated.  It is only at the highest level of lockdown that there are protections in place to protect people from homelessness.  That is the case because of constitutional concerns.  It just shows that not only have there been historical Bills and the Deputy mentioned the Oireachtas research briefing, but there is an ongoing issue even in the midst of a public health crisis.  There is a real urgency to this and we would like to see it advanced as soon as possible.</p></speech>

If this is brought in, we would have clarity as to how far the Oireachtas wants to go or not when it comes to housing initiatives.  It would remove the constitutional argument as a barrier and something that is used to delay progress.  It would be useful because it then becomes purely a matter of what the Oireachtas or the Government want to do or do not want to do.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses from Home for Good.  The committee and I firmly believe that everybody needs a home.  It is a human right and, as previous speakers said, we are in a different world now.  I have been a councillor, Senator and Deputy for more than 20 years and have seen the need and criteria for housing over the years.  This referendum has to happen.  The policy measure to meet the need is the biggest issue we will have, going forward.  That needs to be addressed, whether we are considering people living with disabilities or older people.  People are living longer and the housing systems within the 31 local authorities are not catering for that fact.  All of us here know people who suffer from mental health problems.  Local authorities are not equipped to deal with people who are looking for housing.  We must implement policies to meet the needs and criteria of how people are living now.</p><p>Families and single people are coming to me now.  We have no housing for single people.  This needs to happen.  We cannot leave it any longer.  All of us have a duty to the people of Ireland to meet and to give them this referendum so that we can change policy because we are falling down on policy.  We cannot blame our local authorities but we, as a Government, have to do this.  One of the speakers said that, hopefully, this should be done within a year.  As we know, in 2014 this was spoken about and we said it would happen but we need to make it happen now.  </p><p> The Government is paying out so much money on rented properties to local authorities through HAPs for people who are looking for housing and we now need a policy to build.  To do this we need proper legislation and policies in each local authority.  We need to look at a different road and to build more rather than having rented properties.</p><p> We also need to look at the eviction ban.  I do not want to see anybody facing homelessness or families living in hotels which is a very emotional issue.  I am dealing with cases in Carlow where I have particular people who are in homeless situation and are in this position for over a year now.  That is unacceptable.  I am aware that we cannot solve everything overnight with a referendum but by putting this into the Constitution we can make significant changes.  We need a proper referendum and a Constitution in which we can deal with everyday living.  </p><p> We have lost that.  Everybody is doing their best and I am not here to criticise anyone.  Due to our situation and the way in which everybody&rsquo;s livelihood has changed, people who are working and are looking for mortgages cannot get them anymore.  These people are working and paying such high rents and we have no proper policy in place for them.  We cannot say that they do not have to go on the local authority list because we can now help them to get a mortgage.  That is what is happening.  This policy with a referendum will play a significant part in people&rsquo;s lives and will give people a different outlook on what we can do as a Government to give them that better quality of life which people need.  Children need to know that they have a home and if we cannot deliver on this, as a Government, we are failing our country.  </p><p> My questions are as follows.  The timescale is of great importance.  Speaking on the housing committee is fine but have our Home for Good Coalition guest witnesses been meeting with other organisations?  In order for us to move forward and more quickly on this, what do our witnesses believe we need to do now, besides our meeting today?  What do they believe we can deliver upon to ensure that we get this referendum and can bring in proper policies to meet the criteria of the changing times that we are living in now?  That is the biggest issue here as we are in a completely different world now.  </p><p> I welcome this proposal and I will give it my full support.  I see it in my own constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny where I am dealing with families every day.  It is getting harder.  It is just one case after another.  People are getting angry and think that they are forgotten.  We cannot allow this to continue any longer.  What do we need to do in order that we are not sitting here again in another six years with no referendum or change in the Constitution, or do not have the proper policies that need to be brought into our local authorities, through the Government?  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

Ultimately, it is the Oireachtas that will decide this.  I know that this committee engages regularly with the Minister who has oversight of housing.  I hope that we can move very quickly to a process where a wording is agreed.  Deputy O'Callaghan noted the fact that we are in the middle of a pandemic so there is fluidity around that issue.  We could, however, within the next six months decide on a wording and be ready to go with a constitutional referendum.  It is then a case of when we schedule it to ensure that we keep everybody safe, which is the priority.  I do not see any bar to us deciding this in the next six months.  The Department will obviously have its own opinion on that.  Do Professor Whyte or Ms Hennigan wish to come in on this point?</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions on how the wording was arrived at and what is included in it.  Did the group consider including &quot;security of tenure&quot; in the wording?  &quot;Security&quot; and &quot;adequacy&quot; can be two separate things.  Did the group give consideration to that?  If so, what were the reasons it was decided to go with the more general wording?  Did the group consider things such as proportionality to income?  One can have adequate housing that is not proportionate to income and one can then be left with income inadequacy in other areas.</p><p>Of the 83 constitutions that protect the right to housing, could Ms Keatinge provide a couple of examples of court-directed interventions?  What has been the effect of those constitutional protections?  There is a good mini-series that came out last year called &quot;Show Me a Hero&quot;.  There was a federal court-directed construction of public housing in that.  This happened in Yonkers, New York in the 1980s.  I would be interested in that type of example.  In terms of protection of housing in a constitution, what has the outcome of that been?  Have there been court directions to build public housing or just to facilitate an environment in which housing is built?  Is there an over-reliance on the private sector in that, as sometimes happens in Ireland? </p><p>In more general terms, what actions do the witnesses think could have been taken in this country over the last number of years that have not been taken because of what the witnesses consider overly restrictive interpretation of the legal advice?  I am particularly interested in the area of a more general eviction ban, not in the context of a pandemic, and also in the area of rent caps and rent freezes.  Many people will argue that Blake <i>v</i>. Attorney General was not about rent freezes and that it was a particular judgment which does not mean there is a blanket ban on rent increases.</p><p>I am also interested in the area of legislation to back up the amendment because that has worked successfully in other referendums we have had in terms of killing the more vexatious arguments that can come out.  We have even heard such arguments in this room today relating to an 18-year-old demanding a house to buy for themselves.  I have concerns that some arguments could be made that this could become a developer's charter.  A developer could take the State to court saying he or she should be able to build 30 storeys because this will provide housing.  We have heard developers use the housing crisis in their arguments to create developers' charters.  They said strategic housing development, SHD, would give us many housing units and we have not seen that happen.</p><p>Like Deputy O'Callaghan, I would like to hear about the next steps.  What would the witnesses like to happen following this meeting?  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, previous committees have discussed this issue.  How do the witnesses think we should proceed?</p></speech>

I will refer almost all of them to my colleagues, starting with Professor Whyte.</p> <p>  On the politics of the situation and what the committee can do, we have started a process here today.  The quality of the questioning has been useful.  In terms of developing wording, this could well be the committee to do that.  If this committee could decide on the wording within six months that would be incredibly welcome.  I will pass the other substantive questions to Professor Whyte.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.70" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerard Whyte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110300002#O00300"><p>On some of the questions posed by Senator Moynihan, the first point related to security of tenure and whether that is separate and distinct from adequacy.  Our reliance on the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights addresses that point.  Security of tenure under that covenant is seen as an aspect of access to adequate housing.  We consciously used language from that covenant so that these sorts of issues would be encompassed in the wording we have proposed.<br/><br/>In terms of examples of court-directed interventions, I do not want to repeat myself but the South African example is probably the most obvious place to go to.  It adopted its Constitution in 1996 and made explicit provision for the right of access to adequate housing.  That was done while being conscious of the fact that Irish people, judges, lawyers and politicians could look to the South African experience with that wording and see how it panned out there. <br/><br/>As I said earlier, the court engages in a dialogue with the Legislature and Executive.  It holds up the policies of the State and tests them against the principle of reasonableness.  It is only where the State falls short when there is some sort of egregious neglect of the housing needs of a group of people that the courts will require the authorities to take some steps.  It will leave it to the authorities to decide what those steps are, as long as they are reasonable.<br/><br/>On what actions could be taken now that might have been seen as being precluded in the past because of the emphasis on the right to private property, rent freezes were mentioned.  The Senator is right.  The Blake case was quite a peculiar and specific case in the 1980s.  The issue in that case was not so much the concept of a rent freeze <i>per se</i>.  Rather, it was the fact that the legislation was old and anachronistic which led to situations where the ability of landlords to charge rent was being restricted when the landlord was more economically needy than the tenant.  It was that element of arbitrariness that was the problem with the rent restriction legislation struck down in that case, not the concept of regulating rents <i>per se</i>.  If a constitutional referendum was introduced it would set a balance against the right to private property that featured in the Blake case and would enhance the room for manoeuvre that the Oireachtas would have for regulating property rights.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.71" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rosemary Hennigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110300002#O00400"><p>There is a benefit to having a slightly more general wording in that our understanding of these things develops over time.  If a provision in the Constitution is very specific there is a risk that we are essentially stuck with that wording and an understanding of that wording which is very much rooted in a time and place.  The Constitution, we hope, extends over the decades.</p><p>Consequently, there is much to be said for leaving some scope for developing that language, in particular through legislation where making changes is much easier.  Along with what Professor Whyte mentioned, that is why we went with this general wording.</p><p> Regarding what actions could have been taken that have not been so far, I do not need to tell the housing committee about the chilling effect of Article 43 on many measures that might have been introduced, for example, rent freezes, rent caps and anti-eviction measures for families that would otherwise be homeless.  A number of policy and legislative proposals over the past few years from Private Members and the Government have stalled, usually on Second Stage, over constitutional concerns.  There are two problems with that.  First, we do not always see that constitutional advice.  Second, we never get into a discussion on the substantive policy itself and whether it would make a difference to the housing crisis and the people affected.  Moving us past that point will have a significant benefit in terms of getting to grips with the issues and asking ourselves whether rent freezes would make a difference and do they constitute a substantive policy that we should pursue instead of stopping short at the initial point of it being unconstitutional due to Article 43.</p></speech>

This is a major issue.  In my maiden speech after I was first elected to Cork City Council in 2009, I spoke on the homelessness and housing crisis.  I was actually challenged on that and told that there was no crisis but anyone who was on the ground could see it.  Here we are 11 years later in the midst of the worst housing crisis in the history of the State.  It is why we support a referendum.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, has been a fierce advocate and has led the charge on housing and homelessness.</p> <p>  I wish to ask a few questions.  For the people we represent, the housing crisis does not just affect people who are sleeping on the streets or in shelters or emergency accommodation.  There can be three generations of the same family in one house.  People are sleeping on couches.  There are families who have broken up, with the mother and kids in one house and the father on his own or with some of the kids in his parents' house.  It is a tragedy that needs to be resolved, which is why this referendum is key.  I understand that it will not solve the housing crisis by itself but it will be a tool to help us down the road of putting policies in place whereby we can tackle the crisis in a constructive way.</p> <p>  Due to the D&aacute;il's extension of the eviction ban the week before last, people who had been facing eviction can now stay on into the new year.  However, we will still face the issue of notices to quit and evictions in January and February.  This major issue needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  Whose job do the witnesses believe it is to define social and affordable housing?  The programme for Government states there will be a referendum on housing.  Have the witnesses met the Minister to discuss what he considers to be in the programme for Government?  Is it a referendum on housing or a referendum on the right to housing?  Is it a referendum on housing as a human right?  Have the witnesses asked the Minister these questions?</p> <p>  A question was asked about how far the Government wanted to go.  We need to move on a referendum as quickly as possible.  We want to support the witnesses.  I have met them already on this matter.  I listened with great interest about the wording and how the witnesses were trying to bring everyone together and progress this.  I want to be constructive and we want complete cross-party support in that regard.  I would like to hear the witnesses' thoughts on my questions.</p></speech>

Ms Hennigan may have some remarks to make as well.</p> <p>  We have seen that a right to housing has been included in the programme for Government.  We are encouraged by the public statements by the Minister and, most recently, the T&aacute;naiste indicating that this has been interpreted to mean a right to housing.  That is our understanding.  We very much hope to meet with Minister and we have written to him to seek a meeting.  We hope to have a constructive engagement with him and his officials.  We are here to present wording and to engage with members of the committee today and we also want to engage with the Minister and his Department so that we can arrive at something that will bring everyone along in what we hope will be an inclusive and constructive process.</p> <p>  In terms of defining social and affordable housing, and to speak to the points raised by Senator Moynihan, the wording we propose is quite stark.  It is not detailed because we do not see the Constitution as a place to include a detailed description of a form of housing.  We believe that housing should be adequate, a matter to which Professor Whyte spoke, and that is what is defined and explored in General Comment No. 4, the document to which I referred the committee earlier.  I refer to words such as "affordable" and "secure".  These are all things that we are on board with but we do not feel that the Constitution is the appropriate place to include them.  We also think that there are interpretative difficulties with those two words as well.  That is my comment on how we have arrived at the wording.  Ms Hennigan may have something to add.</p></speech>

We will be led by the committee in terms of what happens next but, as Mr. Stanley has mentioned, there is a need to have some kind of agreement on a form of wording.  We are conscious that it does not have to be our wording, as presented.  Members might like to engage with our wording a little further and make their own amendments.  Having a form of wording that involves a consensus, particularly on the part of a cross-party committee like this one, would be helpful to us when we meet the Minister and engage with him on a referendum on the right to housing.</p></speech>

The witnesses have clearly explained that a constitutional right to a home does not mean that everybody becomes entitled to a free house.  I would love if they could explain a little bit more the additional legal obligations a constitutional right to housing would put on the State.  The witnesses have likened it to a right to education.  My understanding is that the right to education places an obligation on the State to provide enough schools and sufficient school places.  If a right to housing is introduced, would it then be up to the State to provide enough houses and accommodation at all times for our expanding population?  Would the responsibility be divided between the private sector developers, whose business it is to build homes, and the State?  Would it be a legal position that the buck stops with the State because local authorities are responsible for the zoning of land and the granting of planning permission?</p><p>I am also wondering if additional legal obligations would be put on banks to allow people to access mortgages and what impact that would have on people's household budgets.  I am interested to hear how "adequate accommodation" would be defined and what legal questions arise in specific circumstances.  I have two examples.  If a situation arises where a homeless person for whatever reason prefers not to enter accommodation, does that homeless person waive his or her right or can a third party bring a case on his or her behalf?  My second example is in the case of family separations and relationship breakdowns.  For example, in a situation where a couple or a family were self-sufficient in terms of their housing need but now, unexpectedly, their housing need doubles because they need two homes instead of one, and often two quite large homes in the case of shared custody, what role, if any, would the State be expected to play in intervening in such circumstances?</p><p> My questions relate to the impact and implications of a constitutional right to housing.  I would like to understand better the witnesses' perspective on that and I thank them.</p></speech>

I pointed out those characteristics of the right, which include security of tenure, accessibility, affordability, availability of infrastructure and cultural adequacy, habitability and location.  Those characteristics are the touchstone in terms of what adequate provision would look like.</p> <p>  As for those two examples, the situation of the homeless person who has refused an offer of accommodation is quite familiar to me in my own day-to-day practice.  This constitutional protection operates rationally and proportionally, and in circumstances where an offer has been made, I cannot see that it will come to the assistance of that individual in circumstances where that offer was made of adequate housing.</p> <p>  As for the separated family, in the current architecture such a family would be able to register their housing need with the local authority and I am not sure it will recast that in any great sense.  I suppose our overarching aim with this is that it influences the broader housing infrastructure and essentially enables more progressive policies that increase housing supply that ultimately mean that those two families will not be waiting for a considerable period in perhaps insecure private rented accommodation and they may be able to get more secure accommodation, be that through greater security of tenure or State housing.</p> <p>  I might pass over to Professor Whyte on the analogy with primary education.</p></speech>

We do not use that exact formula.  We talk about the State recognising and vindicating this right to access adequate housing.  What that means is that the State cannot be passive in relation to a housing crisis.  It cannot sit on its hands and just decide that it will abdicate its responsibility to the markets.  The State has to take some action to ensure everyone has access to adequate housing.</p> <p>  The State can do that, under our wording, in one or both of two ways.  Clearly, the State could get involved directly in providing housing.  The State did this historically in the past and continues to do it to some level, but the State could ramp up its efforts in that regard in directly providing.  Equally, and here one has the analogy with the education clause, the State could support others, perhaps financially, in addressing the need for adequate housing.  The obligation, though, is imposed only on the State, at least, directly.  This referendum would not impose any direct constitutional obligations, in my opinion anyway, on third parties such as banks.  As to whether the State would wish to see fit to legislate for such obligations, if the State saw fit to legislate for such obligations, this clause would protect that legislation but that would be a step beyond the referendum itself or beyond this constitutional clause.</p></speech>

I would welcome a constitutional right to housing.  I have been in construction all my life and I have listened to people in the room talking about building houses and giving people the right to live.  When co-living was brought up recently in the D&aacute;il, I voted against it because there should not be any co-living.  When we consider the Covid virus today, I do not believe we should have 20 people sharing accommodation and sharing one kitchen and one sitting room.  I do not believe in one-bed units and there should be no units that have fewer than two bedrooms.  If somebody gets sick, they will need someone to cater for them.  In addition, the building cost to build a two-bed unit is only 10% more than that of a one-bed unit.</p> <p>  From a rural point of view and in the context of giving everyone the right to a house, under the Project Ireland 2040 plan, an environmental impact study has to be done for any project that requires planning.  I am thinking of rural parts of County Limerick outside the city.  If people are looking for the right to housing and the right to live, rural Ireland has no infrastructure and has had no investment in infrastructure over the past ten years, when it has been looking for it.  If people want a right to live in Oola, therefore, they cannot live there because there is no infrastructure.  Askeaton has been 30 years looking for a sewerage plant and, again, people cannot have a right to live there either.  All I am hearing with regard to the right to live is about people within a city area where there is infrastructure.  However, for people living in an area that has no public transport, or very little, and no infrastructure, where do they get a right to live if they want to live in their own area?  That is my question.  Once people leave a large town or city, there is no infrastructure for them to have a right to live in their own area.</p> <p>  If there are estates to be built in certain areas, who will the rights be given to?  For example, the local authority might get a parcel of land, although people might have bought land in a certain area or bought a house in the boom times because they wanted a location.  We will want to provide housing for everyone, so they can work together in areas.  If people have a right to live, do they have a right to live in County Limerick?  Do they have a right to live in an area which does not have infrastructure or investment?  Is the right to live only where there is infrastructure at the moment? </p></speech>

This is something that needs to be engaged with and needs to be acceptable to everybody.  This is not about people who live in cities, although I appreciate the discussion seems to be focused on that.</p> <p>  In terms of "adequacy", we have gone for that word because adequacy does not encompass just simply the physical dimensions of where people are living but also encompasses a range of aspects of the type of housing, including infrastructure.  All of those elements would require planning, legislation, resources and political will, so there is a whole element to that which is not within the scope of this proposal.  However, I point to the general comments that I highlighted.  It is not proposed that this would simply protect a structure; this is designed to promote housing and living in the broad sense of the word.  I will pass over to Ms Hennigan.</p></speech>

It is not so much a right to a house in a place of a person's choice but more about building into our laws and planning, and our decisions on budget and infrastructure, a thought and a consideration for housing and for the impact on people of housing.</p><p>That is one of the very important effects of the right to housing.  In that specific case, when it comes to decisions on investment in Limerick, infrastructure such as roads and all of those kinds of issues, one would ask how that will have an impact on the right to housing locally in Limerick or anywhere in the country.  It works more in that sense.  Finland, for example, which Ms Keatinge mentioned briefly earlier, has a pre-legislative rights committee, which it set up as a way to vindicate the right to housing in a way that works best for it.  An Oireachtas committee such as this one would sit down and consider, when dealing with planning legislation, how it impacts on the right to housing and what needs to be considered to vindicate that right.  That is probably the way that we would see the right to housing working in that sort of case.</p></speech>

They are already involved in our infrastructure but I am looking at this from a planning law point of view.  We have many buildings that are derelict and many under conservation orders.  Under the current planning regulations, those buildings cannot be done up.  They cannot afford to do up those properties even though they are enrolled within our current infrastructure.  It is about getting people into areas where such buildings are already listed in the infrastructure within our areas.  We have buildings under conservation orders across the county that cannot be done up because that has to be done in accordance with the conservation laws but it is not affordable to do that under the laws.  I believe that conservation buildings in towns and villages that are not iconic should be allowed keep the front facade and the roof structure and then be modernised.  We should get people back into villages and living in such buildings, which are already included in our infrastructure.  When this is being handed down to our local authorities the investment needs to go back out into the counties.  As we can see in this pandemic, people are trying to move out of the cities to areas where they can have more space.  The buildings are available.  The infrastructure is there, in parts, but it is not in the entire county.  I want this to cover everyone.</p></speech>

I have a question on other jurisdictions.  Ms Hennigan mentioned Finland.  Did it start from the same position as Ireland in having a private property right enshrined in its constitution?  Are we starting from the same place as Finland or the other international examples she gave?</p> <p>  I do not have the wording in front of me but I refer to available resources.  We need more clarity on what Ms Hennigan means by "available resources".</p> <p>  Following on from Deputy O'Donoghue's point, in terms of our land activation or housing provision policy and our objectives in regard to cost rental or land being subject to CPO, what policies have been stymied by the lack of balance in the Constitution, which is tipped more towards private property rights than the right to housing?  What type of policies does she believe would be more successful if there was such a balance in the Constitution?</p></speech>

It is a different constitutional system.  Whenever we look at those international comparators, there are limits to them.  We raised them because in creating this sort of a right we have options open to us in terms of how we as a state will go about vindicating that right, especially in terms of economic and social rights.  They are different so it does not have to be business as usual in terms of how we interact with them.  We can develop our own way of doing that in the best way for Ireland, bearing in mind our own constitutional system.  It is worth looking to other jurisdictions in that sense but my colleagues might have more on that for the Chairman.</p> <p>  In terms of the policies that might have been brought forward were it not for this protection of private property rights, Article 43 does have regard for the common good.  What we are seeing in many cases is that Bills do not even get past Second Stage.</p><p>I have not seen the courts look at Article 43 and determine what the content of it might be, as regards private property rights.  That means that we are very much stuck with case law from decades ago which is tied up in different contexts, and that is very important to think about when we are looking at this issue.  However, at the same time, there is a very deep political chilling effect from Article 43, which we have seen in a range of different areas, the most recent one being the eviction ban which came to an end in July 2020.  As I said, we do not know what the reason was for that, but it is on the record that it was constitutional concerns.  I do not want to repeat myself, but in circumstances where there is an ongoing public health threat to the extent that we can close restaurants, pubs, caf&eacute;s, shops, yet we can only protect the interests of tenants in the private rental market in a very narrow way, then we really have to ask ourselves if Article 43 can have a outside influence on our political culture when it comes to housing policy and law.</p></speech>

I know that in the context of the conversations that were had around it, we wanted to emphasise that ultimately, somebody who is a homeowner currently has the protection of the sanctity of their personal life, and the protection of their private property.  Following a change to the Constitution, they would also have the protection of their home and housing in the Constitution, so it would be another addition to the homeowner in that way.  Perhaps Professor Whyte wants to build on that comment.</p></speech>

Therefore, this right to housing does not threaten homeowners - if anything, it enhances the protection available to them under the Constitution.</p></speech>

Our primary concern here is homelessness and the provision of housing.  If this right is put into the Constitution, could it go further in terms of adequate housing, in areas such as universal housing design, adaptability, future use etc.?  Could it be called on that it is in the Constitution that we provide adequate housing and housing of an adequate size where we are looking at the average occupancy rates of houses now dropping, so that going forward, planning permissions or applications have to meet adequate design standards?</p></speech>

I will defer to Professor Whyte or Ms Keatinge on the legal impact of those kind of changes in terms of the long-term viability of different housing options and how we might look at it.  I would imagine that certainly constitutional change would increase the capacity for the necessary conversations.  I will hand over to Professor Whyte on the legal force and effect of such change.</p></speech>

First, I wish to state my clear commitment to the right to housing and I am appreciative that it is included in the programme for Government.  I am a little disappointed that we have had arguments perhaps being rehearsed here that were made by the previous Government about why this would not happen.  This is a Government commitment and I believe all parties to the Government should be committed to championing it, and I hope that we can continue to do that in this committee.</p><p>My fear is this will pass but make no practical difference, so let us ensure that when it passes, it will have teeth.</p><p> I looked back at the document published by Mercy Law Resource Centre and the Trinity free legal advice centre in 2014, which is a really good synopsis for any members who wish to read about international examples.  One of the biggest issues seems to be that of judicial activism.  There is a fear that even if this referendum passed and a case was brought to court, and if the State pointed to the homeless assistance payment, HAP, homelessness hubs and emergency accommodation, the case would be lost and there would be no additional obligation.  That would be a greatly missed opportunity.  Given the State's failure to interpret the terms "public good" or "social justice" in the Constitution in an ambitious way, I am sceptical that it would do differently in this case.  That is something we need to think about.</p><p> In the environmental area, we talked about moving away from individual change to systems change.  Again, the proposed wording leans too heavily on individual change rather than systems change.  Local authority members have said the real reason for many difficulties is private property rights.  There cannot be a complete ban on evictions or rent increases because of property rights.  None of the proposed wording would necessarily allow the Government to do that.  We would put the obligation on the Government to provide housing but not give it the tools to balance that against private property rights.  I am very concerned about the phrase "within its resources".  I would like to remove that and to see how it could be teased out.  Why was consideration not given to defining the common good in the context of a right to housing?  Even if there is a balance and we still have to pay full market value to developers or property owners, which does not provide any affordability or enable us to deliver housing, that will not achieve what we want either.</p><p> We are leaning too strongly towards individual change.  I think we should focus a little more on the interpretation of the common good in the context of providing housing, although I greatly appreciate our guests' work.</p></speech>

This was considered through the Home for Good Coalition and the legal subgroup.  Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that a stand-alone right would provide much greater protection and have greater force and impact.  That is because two stand-alone rights would be competing against each other, rather than the internal tweaking and balance that happens, which has been the block that has been identified and discussed to such an extent during the meeting.</p></speech>

In other forums, such as the Finnish example, there is similar phrasing but it has led to legislation being examined in a broader way and not just in respect of the individual rights.  For example, in our report on Finland, the constitutional committee that Ms Hennigan mentioned considered legislation that would give subsidy to entities providing social housing and whether they could sell the properties.  It was ultimately decided that would not be consistent with the constitutional protection to the right to housing because it would reduce the stock.  That is looking at the broader, more systemic impact it could have.  Professor Whyte will speak to the broader constitutional architecture.  It is fitting that within the architecture, it is phrased as "all persons", and that it states that all policies and legislative measures will have an impact on persons.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's query about judicial activism, we at Mercy Law Resource Centre have been working very much at the sharp end of the housing crisis.  We work with homeless families, many of whom are constituents whom members will have met.  The 1988 Act is a discretionary provision.  At the moment, we rely on rights around the edges, such as the rights to fair procedure and to family life, but this measure would enable us to tell local authorities they need to act in a manner compatible with the Constitution, which protects access to adequate housing.  It would recast how that assessment would be done.  As Professor Whyte has highlighted, we do not foresee matters coming before the courts.  This is not designed to create legal cases.  It will only be in egregious and serious infringements that such cases get to the courts.  That is an example from our practice.</p></speech>

It goes back to the point we made earlier that where there are two competing constitutional rights, and where the Oireachtas attempts to balance those rights, the court will only upset that legislative balance if the balance is completely contrary to reason, rationality or fairness.  Currently, with regard to property rights, there is a guarantee of private property qualified by the concept of the common good.  That is a different situation, and we do not really have enough detail as to what the common good requires in this specific situation to predict confidently that legislation restricting private property rights would pass.  However, in a scenario in which we are told legislation will be sustained by the courts unless it is unreasonable and contrary to common sense, that gives a lot of room for the Oireachtas to legislate on security of tenure, rent freezes and the like.  Therefore, from a technical point of view, I think that inserting in the Constitution this specific right to access to adequate housing would address the issue of the perceived limits on the ability of the Oireachtas to legislate in this area.</p></speech>

I have been involved in the provision of social housing, worked with the homeless and, as a public representative, advocated on behalf of families in need.  I therefore support absolutely the spirit of the witnesses' presentation and the work they are doing.  Over recent years, as we have emerged from an economic crisis, and it is the economic element I wish to address, we have seen a rise year on year in the provision of housing, with this year seeing the largest ever commitment in that regard.</p><p>My question arises from the witnesses' positioning of the proposed amendment under Article 43 and the use of its placement within that article.  I hear them in that this is a qualifying right to the interpretation of the right to private property and how that would be applied.  I hear them also on the chilling effect it has and respect that contention.  To be fair, as a lawyer who has worked in a <i>pro bono</i>capacity trying to keep people in their homes as a consequence of sub-prime lending and so on, I could see it being a really useful tool for me arguing in court.  The wording of it does raise concern, however.  There is a lack of precision in the term &quot;adequate housing&quot;.  I understand why at a constitutional level one would want as broad a church as possible.  Then, however, we get into what is adequate.  How does any Government start legislating as to what is adequate?  Does it mean that children have to have a bedroom each?  I think we could get into that, and that concerns me.</p><p>The greater concern I have with the amendment, however, are the words &quot;within the available resources&quot;.  That means we will have competing rights within a budget or within the context of a pandemic or an economic crisis arising from an exuberance of policy.  One of my judicial heroes is Mr. Justice Peter Kelly.  He got himself into a lot of hot water back in 2000 by attempting to injunct Ministers in the application of policy on care packages for young people.</p><p>Did the witnesses consider perhaps addressing Article 45 instead and looking at invigorating that?</p><p>Any Government putting forward a budget must look at competing spends.  My concern is this could go in, and its aspiration is fantastic and the right is fantastic, but it could end up being non-justiciable because we will have a budget competition.  If we were addressing the idea of social policy, and Article 45 specifically speaks to the directive of social policy, why not then include housing or a roof over people's head?  I assume the amendment would not propose that no one would ever rent again and that we would arrive at such nirvana.  There will always be different types of tenure, whether that is home ownership or rental.  Was any consideration given to the possibility of ensuring that in the competing budgetary rights we could move the right to a roof over people's heads higher, with the Government being directive on social policy in this respect?  Consequently, flowing from this we could have the administration of budget happening on a particular hierarchy, such as homes always being above law and order.  We could look at it in this way, whereby a radical overhaul of Article 45 would be a consideration.  I am interested to hear what the witnesses have to say on this.</p></speech>

They cannot be relied on by the courts when the courts are scrutinising the laws the Oireachtas has made.  If this clause were to go into Article 45 and if, at some point, there was a concern that some piece of legislation did not adequately vindicate the right to access adequate housing, its location in Article 45 would mean the courts could not entertain that argument.  This is why we consciously decided it should be a stand-alone right.  We propose it would have its own clause in the Constitution.  The numeration simply reflects the fact that it comes between the existing Article 43 on private property and Article 44 on the completely unrelated issue of religion.  Saying it is Article 43A does not mean it is a subordinate part of the guarantee of private property.  If this were to go through they would be two separate provisions, in the same way that children's rights are protected in a separate provision in Article 42A of the Constitution.</p></speech>

It comes back to the fact that the right is being attached to individuals and not to the Oireachtas.  I would have thought putting the impetus and obligation on the Oireachtas would be a more secure means of ensuring it would be more effective in budgetary allocation.  If we are always going to have the qualification of available resources it does not secure the right.</p></speech>

The reason we included the availability of resources was more to safeguard the role of the Oireachtas within it.  It is also to draw out the reality that a court will not overstep these bounds.  It is not usually what our courts do.  We have made this explicit within the clause but, in any event, it is not something the courts generally do as I am sure the Senator is aware.  A constitutional amendment can only do so much.  It can lead and create a political culture, and this is what we hope to do, but it very much will depend on the political will in the Oireachtas to act on it.  When it comes to budgetary decisions and how allocations are made the Constitution is not the best place to do it.</p><p>All it can do is set out a value, a principle and a framework for what we, the people, think should be done.  We then hand over those decisions to the Oireachtas.  I understand what the Senator means about it positioning the right in terms of individuals' access to courts.  We see it as doing both.  It both empowers the Oireachtas to better legislate in this area and, in the extreme cases which Ms Keatinge mentioned, it gives an individual the ability to step forward and declare that he or she has fallen through the gaps and has a right to housing that has not been vindicated. </p></speech>

It was not until the Fine Gael-led Government came to power that that was brought into law.  There can be a 20-year gap.  Just because something is written into the Constitution does not mean it will happen.</p></speech>

Something very significant has happened in this meeting today.  This is the first time in my five years in the Oireachtas that a clear majority of the housing committee has spoken in favour of the holding of a referendum to enshrine the right to housing in the Constitution.  That is really significant.  I say that while not in any way questioning the motives of other members who have different views or are still teasing out the issue because that is the purpose of this committee.  We tried very hard to get that commitment into the 2016 report of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness but we did not succeed.  We also tried to get into subsequent documents of the committee but we could not do that either.  This is a really positive moment. </p> <p>  I suggest that on foot of this meeting, the Chairman write to the Minister setting out a flavour of the different views of the committee, because all of the views of the committee are valid, but also urging him to meet the Home for Good Coalition at the earliest available opportunity to take this dialogue to the next step.  I do not think the committee should commit to a position one way or another because there are differing views but the Chairman could set out a cross-section of our views and ask the Minister to meet the Home for Good Coalition.  I think that would be a positive outcome from what has been a very good discussion today.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that this has been a very worthwhile meeting and that there is consensus but it is important that we tease out the issue further.  The Constitution is very precious and important.  Any proposed changes to it must be well-thought out and well balanced.  I agree there is broad consensus and that the committee should write to the Minister.  My colleagues and I will take up the matter with the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy O'Brien.  We should be ambitious.  Once Cover is over, let us be ready and make this happen.  Let us give people the opportunity to amend our Constitution to reflect our societal values.  There will obviously be a great deal of work for politicians to do, not just in this Oireachtas but in future Oireachtais, to deliver on the constitutional commitment that I believe the people of Ireland will approve.

NPHET met last Thursday, October 29, and reviewed the latest epidemiological data.  In the interests of time, I will just refer to the data rather than going through the details, given that they will have changed ever so slightly over the course of recent days.  The data are set out in the first two pages of my submission.</p> <p>  Internationally speaking, our national epidemiological profile is occurring in the context of a widespread resurgence of this disease across Europe.  We have seen reports and have shared concerns at the deteriorating situation globally, particularly in Europe and North America where governments are facing common challenges, which have required many countries to reintroduce restrictions of the kind we have in place.  Some of the worst affected places at present are capitals and major cities in Europe and there is pressure on ICU capacity in several cities.  The average seven-day incidence across EU and UK countries is 241 per 100,000 population, which compares with 169 in the previous seven-day period, indicating the deteriorating situation across Europe.  Data reported by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, on 28 October rank Ireland 17th out of 31 countries in terms of 14-day incidence rates.  In terms of the seven-day incidence rate, the epidemiological situation in Ireland compares more favourably with European counterparts.  According to NPHET&rsquo;s figures from last week, there had been a 20% decline in the seven-day incidence rate in Ireland.  Indeed, it has declined further in the intervening time.  This at a time the majority of countries are experiencing an upward trend.</p> <p>  The most recent rapid risk assessment, which is the ECDC&rsquo;s instrument for setting out its assessment of the disease on an approximately monthly basis, is dated 23 October.  It highlights that all EU-EEA countries and the UK have implemented various &ldquo;non-pharmaceutical interventions&rdquo;, which is its term for social restrictions, but that these have not been fully successful in controlling transmission and the epidemiological situation is now rapidly deteriorating.  Implementing stricter non-pharmaceutical interventions, which proved to be effective in controlling the epidemic in all EU-EEA countries and the UK during spring 2020, appears to be the only available strategy that may have a moderate, as opposed to high, impact on the disease for individuals and healthcare provision.  This results in an overall assessment of the general population across Europe as being at high risk.</p> <p>  The landscape in respect of restrictive measures is rapidly evolving, with significantly more restrictive measures having been introduced or proposed in a number of European countries over the past week.  This includes stay-at-home recommendations and overnight curfews, limits on numbers of individuals that may gather in indoor and outdoor settings as well as mixing of households, and restrictions or closure of the hospitality sector and other non-essential services.</p><p>The WHO, for its part, in its weekly epidemiological update from 27 October stated that the number of new cases in Europe is increasing exponentially, with over 1.3 million new cases recorded during the most recent seven-day reporting period.  Against this backdrop, there is a substantial risk associated with international travel at the current time.</p><p> Our focus, as a country, is now very much on suppressing the spread of the disease domestically.  We have moved early in our efforts to break the transmission cycle.  Many European counterparts are now following a similar path and we have seen daily reports on the reintroduction of restrictions by European governments, in some cases quite stringent measures such as curfews.  Once we bring the disease back under control in this country, it will be necessary to manage very carefully the risks of importation, among other risks to that status.  In circumstances of sustained low levels of domestic transmission, the relative impact of imported cases is all the greater, as was seen in this country at times during the summer when travel-related cases increased and accounted for up to approximately a quarter of cases on occasion.</p><p> International travel will represent a prominent area of risk as the disease comes under control nationally and we subsequently aim to maintain suppressed disease activity and low incidence rates.  I am aware that agreement has been reached at EU level on a common approach to intra-EU travel and that the Government has decided on how these recommendations are to be implemented in Ireland.  Senior officials from across Government, including from the Department of Health, are engaged actively in discussions on its implementation.  Acknowledging the likely duration of the pandemic, countries are transitioning from emergency management of Covid to more sustainable strategies such as the EU agreement, and it represents an important step for that reason.</p><p> It is important that countries adopt approaches that facilitate travel, especially essential travel, while ensuring that those who need to travel are not posing an additional risk to wider populations.  I stress that countries which have adopted PCR testing as part of their travel policies in those circumstances have tended to do so as part of a suite of measures applying to international travel, often including more restrictive measures than apply here such as travel bans, mandatory quarantines and border closures.  Our experts and many of their counterparts internationally consider that, should testing of asymptomatic passengers be introduced, a five- to seven-day period of restricted movement, with a symptom check and test on day five, is the most efficient means of containing importation of the virus.  This approach can still miss up to 15% of potentially imported cases.</p><p> At the request of NPHET, HIQA recently undertook a rapid health technology assessment on the use of alternatives to laboratory-based PCR testing.  HIQA found that these tests offer possibilities to enhance prevention and control, including expanding of testing capacity, reduced test turnaround times and improved access.  These tests work best where there is high prevalence and incidence of the disease, particularly amongst symptomatic patients.  HIQA's findings confirm the WHO advice which shows that the currently available rapid antigen detection tests are not suitable for use in screening asymptomatic populations with unknown levels of disease, such as would be the case with arriving passengers.</p><p> The HSE recently established an expert group to review the antigen tests currently available and how they might be deployed in clinical and non-clinical settings.  Validation studies in respect of these with two rapid antigen tests are already under way in Ireland in connection with their potential use in vulnerable populations.  I emphasise that, over the course of the pandemic, NPHET's advice to the Government has been informed by the latest scientific evidence.  As evidence accrues and our understanding of the disease develops, our advice to Government develops alongside the evidence base.</p><p> It is essential that people who arrive in this country or who have returned from travel pay close attention to maintaining the basic public health measures of 2 m distancing, hand hygiene, wearing face coverings and avoiding crowded situations for a full 14 days, even if they are not asked to restrict their movements for that period.</p><p> In returning to the risks associated with international travel, while we recognise that long-term travel restrictions are, of course, difficult, we need only look to the travel policies of countries that have achieved sustained low rates of transmission, particularly countries in Asia, to see the importance that this has in helping to control importations.  Our core national objectives are to maintain the safe reopening our education and health sectors, and to protect our vulnerable people in particular.  Achieving these goals is predicated on maintaining low rates of community transmission and avoiding an ongoing reseeding of cases through whatever means, including travel.</p></speech>

I know Liam from a former life in University of Limerick, although I have not seen him for quite a while.  It is good to see the three witnesses here and I thank them for all the work they have been doing over many difficult months.</p> <p>  I have a number of brief questions.  I may interject when the witnesses are replying so I apologise in advance to Dr. Holohan but there are a few answers I would like to get .  First, as Ireland's Chief Medical Officer, does Dr. Holohan see international travel as being safe and possible between now and Christmas and from Christmas to springtime?  The aviation sector sees its season reopening around March, which is what it calls the summer season.  Does Dr. Holohan believe international air travel could be considered safe and possible between now and then?</p></speech>

The situation at the moment is that international travel of a non-essential nature is not safe.  Movement of populations around areas with a high experience of this disease, particularly in Europe and North America, in and out of this country is not safe.</p></speech>

I have in mind that this Sunday evening at a political level, and Dr. Holohan is dealing in the realm of health policy, the EU traffic light system comes into force.  There will be green regions but for orange and red regions it becomes quite unworkable in that people will have to quarantine if they come here from those regions.  What advice has NPHET been giving to the Government in the lead-up to Sunday evening?</p></speech>

We believe that testing is most appropriate for people and for populations where the risks, and the likelihood of disease, are greatest because we get a much better predictive value or reliability in regard to the test.  That is what the evidence says.  That is what the HIQA report says.  That is the WHO advice so our advice in respect of testing is exactly in line with that.</p></speech>

Has NPHET advised in any way that the testing everyone is demanding be delayed?</p></speech>

The context in which any of these things ever arises is what the ambient risk is in terms of transmission.  If that were to arise right now, right across Europe, including the UK and North America, and North America is not part of the EU arrangements, the vast majority of countries are red and getting redder.  That is the current situation.  That is the reason we are concerned about international travel.  While there are various measures that can be put in place at points in time that enable us to ensure that, inasmuch as possible, we can make every form of activity, including travel, as safe as possible and allow us resume these activities inasmuch as we can, we can only do that by reference to the ambient risks of community transmission.  The whole of Europe is experiencing a very significant resurgence of the disease.  This country, and I will not start concluding on this at this point because we are only two weeks into the set of measures in terms of level 5, has seen a significant reduction in its seven-day and now 14-day incidence consequent on the measures that are in place here.  The experience we have had in this country, in particular looking at seven-day incidence, and looking at it towards the end of last week and comparing our experience to those of Europe is that the level of disease transmission here is improving at a point when the vast majority of countries in Europe are disimproving.  We simply have to take that into account in terms of our public health advice to people who are making plans around travel because many European countries, unfortunately for them, are in a situation where they are facing much higher levels of disease, and deteriorating levels of disease, where, at least in the two weeks so far, we have been experiencing a level of improvement that very few other countries are able to report.  We need to hold on to that.</p></speech>

What is of much more interest to us is the more regionalised and fine level of detail.  As we return to lower levels of transmission in this country - let us be optimistic for a moment that we will get back to that point - it will start to become more important to consider not just regions but counties, and not just counties but localities.  When we get to low levels of transmission of the disease, the objective has to be to pick up cases and outbreaks when they occur as quickly as possible, and to contain them as outbreaks within a locality and to prevent community transmission.  That is the reason we consider much finer detail than the NUTS regions in forming our perspective.</p></speech>

Many countries are experiencing significant resurgences of the disease and have arrangements for their own populations.  They are, effectively, discouraging people from all forms of travel within their countries and between countries.  As we move, hopefully, to make progress in this country, let us hope the rest of Europe will move in the same way and that we can move back to a direction - like in early spring and into summer - where many countries are getting control of the disease at levels that they simply do not have at the moment.</p> <p>  Getting control, as a collection of countries, is the best means of ensuring that travel and any other form of activity within those countries will be as safe as possible.  Everything we do in respect of this disease is a function of how safe it is in the context of its uncontrolled transmission, which is what is happening in Europe.  Europe has uncontrolled transmission of the disease in place at the moment, disrupting every form of social and economic activity within the countries.  The only means for us a community to restore and protect many of those functions and services, as well as the people living in those countries, is to intervene and stop this high level of community transmission.  Our evidence suggests we are making progress on this, whereas many other European countries are not yet in the position to be able to report that.</p></speech>

At this point, the real issue from our point of view - I am not avoiding the Deputy's question - is the high level of domestic community transmission in this country.</p><p>That is where all our attention and focus are right now.  What I said in my opening statement, and I will say it again, is that as we move, I hope, and I am being optimistic about this, to curb, slow and ultimately re-establish full control over this disease, then the question of international travel, which has been on our agenda from the get-go - and the Deputy will, I am sure, be well familiar with the various recommendations we have made over the entire course of the pandemic - will begin to assume, relatively speaking, greater importance.  If the risk of picking up the disease in this country is very low because we have managed to control community transmission, then the obvious additional source of infection is through international travel.</p></speech>

It is the same as with people living here who are not travelling.  Full compliance with all the public health advice, rapid identification of cases when they occur, as well as reliability in that regard and an ability to follow up and then verify it, and quarantine and restriction of movement arrangements are all essential to the arrangements that have to operate.  Many countries have those arrangements in place.</p></speech>

However, 15% of cases are still missed.  In Ireland we are missing 100% of cases, if one likes, so there is significant room for improvement there.</p> <p>  I have a question about the technologies that exist.  I know that HIQA has done a comparative analysis.  It acknowledges that there were severe limitations to its analysis because of the quality of information available.  There is one systematic review of rapid antigen tests, for example.  I have a kit insert here from the test being used in Rome.  The committee heard from representatives from Rome airport last week.  The test meets the WHO criteria in respect of sensitivity and specificity.  Regarding the technologies that exist there, is it feasible that we could introduce a testing regime at our ports and airports in the very near future that was either PCR or an alternative suitable comparator?  It has been done elsewhere.</p></speech>

He is more expert in these matters than I am.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.162" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cillian De Gascun" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020110300002#F00600"><p>Of the three main approaches to testing at this point in time, as Deputy O'Rourke said, the gold standard is PCR.  It is important to highlight that at this point we have the best test available.  It is the most sensitive and the most specific.  There is a lot of interest in antigen testing on the basis of the facts.  PCR, for clarity, identifies the genetic material of the virus, or the viral RNA.  What antigen testing looks for are viral antigens, typically virus proteins.  These proteins tend to be present in people in whom the virus is actively replicating.  They tend to be less sensitive purely because there is not necessarily as much protein there as there might be viral RNA.  The difficulty with the WHO criteria at this point is that they refer to a sensitivity of 80%.  The WHO is speaking to the whole world, not just to developed countries that can afford to have a PCR testing system in place.  The problem with a sensitivity of 80% is that, in essence, one in five cases will be missed, and that is not good enough.  Therefore, in order to compensate for that lack of sensitivity, there are a couple of options.  These tests can potentially be used in an outbreak setting, whereby one tests a large number of people who have symptoms and then the risk of getting lots of false negatives is significantly reduced.  If, however, one does identify somebody who is part of that outbreak or cluster in whom the antigen test does not detect virus antigen, one needs to go on and do a PCR test to facilitate the contact tracing process after that.  The other alternative approach to compensating for the lack of sensitivity is repeated testing, which is another area in which people have expressed an interest.</p><p>The problem is we have no evidence at this point in time that antigens work in that setting.  For example, if I take an antigen test today and it is not detected-----</p></speech>

When will the expert group review of the comparative analysis of the different technologies be completed?  There is a great deal of interest in that review, particularly in the aviation sector, our airports and ports  The review was referenced in Dr. Holohan's opening statement.  When will it be completed?</p></speech>

The validations are ongoing.  It is worth highlighting that the first point of any of this is to demonstrate that the antigen test works in general - in other words, that it works off-the-shelf.  We know from the HIQA report, which the Deputy alluded to, that typically the manufacturers claims have not necessarily been held up by independent verifications.  We want to see large-scale independent assessments of these tests, with the results published in the peer review literature such that we can introduce them.  There is a sense out there that I am against antigen testing; I am not.  I need a good reason to move away from the best test that we have.  The antigen test will need to be evaluated in each setting in which it is proposed to use it.  For example, for it to be used in an airport, a nursing home or a school setting, a validation or a verification, at least, would be required in each of those settings.</p></speech>

The question the public are asking relates to Christmas.  We are in level 5 until 1 December.  People tend to return home from 14 December for Christmas.  Ryanair, Aer Lingus and other airlines have said that they will operate flights to facilitate Christmas travel.  I refer to Dr. Holohan's presentation, in particular page 6, where it states:</p> <blockquote> 	...should testing of asymptomatic passengers be introduced, a 5-7-day period of restricted movement, with a symptom check and test on day 5, is the most efficient method to contain importation of the virus.  This approach can still miss up to 15%... </blockquote> <p>The final paragraph on page 7 states: &quot;It is essential that people who arrive in Ireland or who have returned from travel pay close attention to maintaining two metre distance, hand hygiene, wearing face covering and avoiding crowded situations for a full 14 days...&quot;.  Dr. Holohan also referenced the following:</p> <blockquote> 	...EU level on a common approach to intra-EU travel and that the Government has decided on how these recommendations are to be implemented in Ireland.  Senior Officials from across Government, including from the Department of Health, are engaged in discussions on implementation. </blockquote> <p>This includes the witnesses.  As the virus is being brought under control in Ireland, does Dr. Holohan foresee the introduction of pre-departure PCR testing as distinct from antigen testing in respect of travel from countries in the orange and red zones, such that people can return home by flight for Christmas?  The return of the diaspora at Christmas time is a traditional and important aspect of what it is to be Irish.</p></speech>

I am going to put a few things to our guests that we have heard from others who know more about the aviation sector than I do.  Mr. Eddie Wilson of Ryanair was recently before the committee.  He sought to paint Ireland's approach to the movement of people in a rather dark shadow or cloud.  He suggested that our restrictions on foreign travel are completely out of line with the rest of Europe.  I put that to our guests and ask them to respond, if they would.</p> <p>  Dr. Holohan has talked about the incidence rate in other countries.  Are there ongoing conversations with people of his standing and at his level in Europe?  I know some conversations happen through the ECDC and WHO but is there any specific sharing of data or peer review of actions that are taken, etc.?</p></speech>

We participate and are recipients of the benefit of all the number-crunching analysis and evidence assessment that happens at a European level.  We also have informal engagements that we try to maintain.  On the island, we have close working relations with our counterparts in Northern Ireland for good and obvious reasons.  We have some engagements across these islands from time to time with similar individuals in the UK jurisdictions and Ireland.  It is less formal at a European level but we are trying and we have a process of engagement through our embassies and through some direct contact between our Department and departments in other jurisdictions to try to get more of the soft understanding, if one likes, of exactly where other countries are in relation to the kinds of advice that is provided by people like us within the systems so we can see the impact ultimately in other countries and understand the nature of advice that has been provided.  We do all of those things to try to understand as much as we can.  Perhaps Mr. Morris will speak to that, if I may use the Senator&rsquo;s time.</p></speech>

That meets in a steady pattern of about twice a week at the moment to discuss all these measures.  There were discussions on the responses that countries have introduced combining testing with quarantine.  It was shown that, regarding where Ireland sits in terms of flexibility and openness to travel, compared with other countries we have quite a permissive regime in place.  Other countries have mandatory quarantine requirements and stringent penal provisions.  That came through in the discussions.</p></speech>

The numbers from EUROCONTROL clearly negate those statements so it would be helpful to get that message out there.</p> <p>  Perhaps Dr. Holohan will specifically address the view held in some quarters that testing and tracing is almost a cure for Covid and if we had rapid antigen testing at the airports, we could ultimately have a free-for-all.  The argument is also made on the aviation side that air travel is safe.  That is presented on the basis of evidence of people contracting the virus while in the aircraft with no reference to what happens at either end.  It is no different from the example we have here at the moment, when we are not supposed to be outside a 5 km radius, and some suggest it is safe to drive.  It is okay to travel in the car but what one does on the other end is the issue.  Will Dr. Holohan speak to those two points?</p></speech>

It is not just the intrinsic risks around travel.  In many ways, the travel experience on a plane can be a controlled environment.  In such an environment, one can manage the risks.  We have seen this in schools where we have managed to put control systems in place very well.  These have helped in terms of transmission and allowed us to turn on and maintain an important public service around schools.  As the Senator rightly says, the issue is the movement of people.  People come into contact with each other and the greater the extent of mixing among populations, the greater are the conditions for transmission of the virus.  Unfortunately, the very purpose of international travel is to facilitate the free movement and mixing of people, which is wonderful except it facilitates the spread of this particular disease.</p><p>There is no doubt that in the course of the summer, international travel played a significant role in the re-importation and re-seeding of this infection in this country.  </p><p> There is also an issue in this country around travel.  In Europe, they look at travel, including international travel.  They do not just focus on air travel.  There is sea travel in this country because we are an island.  In many other European countries they look at road, rail, train and air but it is a relatively small proportion whereas we have an enormous dependency on it in this country.  It is true to say, as Mr. Morris has said, that the arrangements that exist in this country would not be as stringent as those that exist at border level in many other European countries.</p></speech>

It is easy for me to say that they will be busy for some time to come.</p> <p>  My first questions concern the summer period.  It has been mentioned that a quarter of outbreaks were imported.  Can I have the details?  Were any learnings made at that stage?</p> <p>  Testing and tracing are a major part in communities, ports and airports.  We will need a framework for same into the future.  We have all heard the story about the guy who was a super spreader and gave the virus to 56 people.  Most people have followed the general restrictions but one must make allowances for those who do not and how that can have a huge impact.  What learnings have been made and where do we go from here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.228" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020110300002#L00600"><p>The principle learning from that is that when we get to low levels of transmission then everything that we do that increases that risk is something we have to look very closely at.  In the context in which we are in at the moment, we hope we will make progress and get us back to low level transmission of the kind that we saw over the course of the summer.  When that happens it allows us to recommend the easing of measures and do a range of other things that are currently not possible.  The extent to which that increases, if we do too much of it, can facilitate transmission but then there are specific risks that arise in this country.  In particular, because this is an island, if we get to those low levels of transmission then international travel becomes a relatively more important potential source of new infection both in absolute and proportional terms.  Particularly then, if we are talking about a situation where we are seeking, perhaps as a European community, to try to facilitate an additional European level of travel, then that would have the effect of increasing the absolute risk as well as the proportional risk of the importation of infection.</p> <p>  The second one is the strength of our public health capacity to respond.  To pick up on the story that has been talked about, that particular case that ultimately was the super spreading event that led to 59 additional cases, we now know, as an international community, the faster we are able to pick these up and intervene at super spreading events, clusters and outbreaks at local level, the greater the chance we have to stop this disease becoming established as widespread community transmission.  In other words, it is wild out in the community but we do not know who has or has not got it, which is the situation we faced in late September and into October that caused us to recommend the  measures that are in place at this point.</p></speech>

We accept that travel at this point in time, for non-essential reasons, does not make any sense given the conditions, particularly across Europe.  However, I accept that the aviation sector requires a framework so that it knows how to operate into the future while accepting that we do not know exactly what the community situation will be at that stage.  People will still travel so I back what was said by my colleague in that we probably need something better than what is happening with the passenger locator form, and some form of operational testing.  I would like Dr. Holohan to go into the ins and outs regarding validations.  I accept that he talked about specific settings.  To a degree, some of these do not seem to be something NPHET would propose from the point of view of air travel.</p></speech>

One of the messages I wanted to give is that it is the testing in the context of all of the other arrangements that might exist at a point in time.  I am not just talking about borders.  Testing just does not sit on its own as a response to the control of the disease.  It has to be part of a set of arrangements that exist, the purpose of which is to limit transmission and increase control.  I might ask Dr. De Gascun to comment further on validation but, essentially, what we are trying to do is show how well the test is actually working in the setting in which we would seek to use it.</p></speech>

However, if we look at it in a European context, if every country could make the same level of progress in terms of disease control at the same time, of course, that is going to make the most important contribution possible to reducing the risks associated with international travel.  The scenario that I am concerned about is one in which we make progress and other colleagues at a European level, unfortunately, are not in a position to make the same level of progress.  Notwithstanding whatever arrangements we put in place to try to limit transmission, if there is a lot of disease in Europe and not very much here, and we have people travelling, that is going to increase the risk of transmission. </p></speech>

If that also suits a framework that will work for aviation into the future, that would be a positive thing.</p></speech>

We have said this on many occasions.  When we have had widespread community transmission in this country, it is a risk to everything that goes on in this country, whether that is education, nursing homes, the operation of the hospitality sector or whatever.  We now have widespread community transmission throughout Europe and it would be very hard for us to protect Ireland from that disease.  If we continue to see widespread transmission around Europe and a low level of transmission in this country, we will not be able to keep the disease out.  This is a small, open economy, with very close cultural, legal, business and economic relationships with the whole of the European Union.  It is not New Zealand, so it is not going to be possible for us to keep the disease out.  That is why we think international travel, particularly around Europe, will have to be a continuing source of tension from our point of view.</p></speech>

Can I get some sort of detail on the validation process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.236" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cillian De Gascun" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020110300002#M00700"><p>First, I do not want to give the impression that there has not been engagement with the DAA in regard to its demands.  The HSE has been heavily involved in trying to identify what that future might look like whereby travel becomes safe again.</p> <p>  In the context of validation, in essence, what we do is to take the gold standard, which at the moment is PCR, and then go into a setting, wherever that setting may be.  For the new test that we want to verify or validate, which might be antigen testing, LAMP testing or a different PCR assay, we would take two samples from a population.  One sample goes through the gold standard test, which we know is PCR, and the other sample goes through the comparator test, whether that is an antigen, LAMP or otherwise.  We would need significant numbers.  In essence, what we are doing with that comparison is trying to identify the sensitivity and specificity and the real-world performance of the new test.</p> <p>  We know PCR works very well.  The HSE and the Department of Health have put a huge amount of infrastructure in place over the last eight months to ensure we can now do somewhere in the region of 120,000 tests a week.  That system is working well.  If we are going to change it or add something new to it, we need to make sure that whatever that is continues to work as effectively, and we need to make sure that all of those data feed into our test and trace system. </p> <p>  The last point to highlight is that testing is just one component.  An Australian virologist has put out a very nice graphic around the Swiss cheese model of pandemic defence against respiratory virus.  Every slice has holes in it, so testing has holes in it and tracing has holes in it, but if we have the physical distancing, the contact tracing, the hand hygiene, the face masks and all of those things, and we put all of those slices together, then we can get through this.</p> <p>  From the validation perspective, there is a logistics component to it and it is not as straightforward as just buying a kit off the shelf and then going out to a local community and validating it.  We need to identify the cohort we want to test it in, and we need to know what the numbers are going to be and how many negatives or positives we want.</p><p>Equally, who is going to do the swabbing?  We have worked with the HSE to identify community sampling hubs within the community, where we can look at the likes of saliva and antigen testing.  From an NVRL perspective, we are not best placed to do antigen testing because antigen testing is typically near-patient; it is done at the point of care.  There are hospitals involved in doing the antigen comparison between PCR and antigen testing.  One of the other elements that is difficult is that the same specimen that goes through the antigen testing cannot go through PCR, so multiple samples are required.  All of those things-----</p></speech>

What is that?  Can he define it in terms of metrics, and what is it that he will be looking for in this regard?  Will we come out of lockdown on 1 December 2020 and if so, what level of restrictions will we move to?  I am of the view that the public are entitled to have an idea of what exactly is happening.  Everyone agrees that the virus has been spreading and we need to bring it under control but there must be a pathway out.  Is the policy one of lockdown, release and containment, or is it that we live with the virus?</p> <p>  I want to link those issues to the aviation sector.  Dr. Holohan made reference to the fact that no matter how well we do here, his decision will also take account of how other countries are doing.  What is the sustainable level that Dr. Holohan wants these other countries to have in place?  There is no testing at airports at the moment.  If pre-departure tests were brought in, that would reduce the risk of travel, the risk to people in Ireland, and the risk to passengers on flights.  The Minister for Health said that the rate of transmission in air travel is 1%, yet Dr. Holohan is saying that last summer it accounted for almost a quarter of all cases.  Everything is relative.  If the rate of transmission is very low domestically, then while the rate of transmission in travel might also be very low, relative to the domestic rate, it might be much higher, so everything is relative.</p> <p>  All those questions are interlinked and I ask Dr. Holohan to respond.  What does he regard as the sustainable low level of domestic transmission?  Will we come out of lockdown on 1 December 2020, and what level will we go to?  What type of policy is the national policy now?  Is it a policy of lockdown, release and containment, living with the virus, or a defer and vaccine policy?  Linking that to international travel, what will be the components of the policy?  Dr. Holohan made reference to us getting to a certain level.  Is he saying that regardless of how well we do here, if the incidence in other countries is not coming down at the same rate, then there should be no international travel?  These are the questions that the public are asking.</p></speech>

We said that at the beginning, in terms of the advice and explaining the advice given to the public, that when we were making recommendations to Government, most recently around level 5 restrictions, we were at something between 1,100 and 1,200 cases per day, on the five-day average.</p><p>We thought at that time of having an R rate - if we could get there - of 0.5.  We do know if we will get there.  At the moment we are down to 1.0 based on our estimate last week.  We will have a new estimate on Thursday of this week and see what progress has been made on that.  If we follow that track we will get down to probably having in the order of fewer than 100 or so cases per day.  There are all the other associated metrics that go with that which express themselves in the 14-day and seven-day incidence rates, hospitalisation rates and all those kinds of things.  We look at all those metrics.  We have seen a significant reduction in some of those already but we still have a long way to go.

That goes in two directions.  One is in respect of the arrangements the Government has implemented by virtue of its implementation of the European arrangements.  That is work that is happening at the moment.  The other is advice we give to people who are intending travellers.  At the moment that advice is that if one is thinking about non-essential travel, do not do it.  That is very clear.  We are advising against non-essential travel on public health grounds.  If we think that can change, we will make that advice available.  If people are travelling - there are people who travel for essential purposes - there is advice and guidance we can give them about how they can minimise their risks and how they should seek to understand and comply with the public health advice that is in place at any point in time in whatever country they find themselves in, whether it is Irish people travelling abroad for essential reasons and then having to come back or  people who are travelling here for essential reasons to provide essential services in this country.  That is happening and people are providing us with essential goods and services that we can only have by means of people continuing to provide those from outside of this country.  We give advice on all those things and we will continue to do so.</p></speech>

I also thank Dr. Glynn for his work in his capacity as acting Chief Medical Officer during the period Dr. Holohan took a step back from the role.</p> <p>  Dr. Holohan mentioned the need for NPHET to make point-in-time assessments.  That is totally understandable and when needing to move between levels such assessments must be made.  As mentioned, we have had representatives of the aviation industry before the committee.  They are seeking to make decisions for spring and summer 2021 which are not point-in-time assessments.</p><p> There is a belief that NPHET has been the barrier to allowing them to put in place the structures for a testing regime that would be part of a multi-layered framework.  It is very understandable that NPHET has to make point-in-time assessments and it is equally understandable that the aviation industry has to make decisions that will involve a time lag.  As the representatives from the DAA mentioned, it will have to make planning applications for testing regimes to local authorities and it will take time to get personnel involved.  All of this will take time.  As difficult as level 5 is, it provides a breathing space to do this.  Is there an appreciation of the two competing decision-making timelines between NPHET and the aviation industry when it comes to this?  How is NPHET negotiating this difference?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.274" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020110300002#P00200"><p>Of course there is an appreciation of it.  Insofar as we can give a longer-range view, it is simply with regard to the extent that we can get through the phase we are in at present as well as we possibly can and hit an R rate of 0.5, although we do not know whether we will do so and there is no absolute number or one magic target, and get down to low levels of transmission of the type we saw in the summer, whereby we think we have capacity and that we have the virus back under control.  We speak about living with the virus.  It means having low levels of transmission, a low risk of transmission and a good chance of picking up instances where the disease starts to spread again and picking up outbreaks as early as possible and controlling them.  These are the basic requirements we have.</p> <p>  We are confident that we can get back to this situation by the beginning of December if, as the Deputy has probably heard me say before, we can maintain the high level of compliance there is on the part of the public with the public health advice.  The vast majority of people are practising much of the public health advice.  Over the course of the summer, our reproductive number was up at approximately 1.4 but that is a very suppressed level of disease transmission in the population.  If we were doing nothing to control the spread in the population, we would have a reproductive number of approximately 4 or 5.  A figure of 1.4 is very good.</p> <p>  Getting the number down to where we need it will not require much more in terms of action on the part of the public, but it would have a big effect.  The reason I stress this is because if, optimistically, when we get to 1 December, we are in a position to make recommendations and the Government mandates a change in the arrangements that are in place, the extent we can from that point forward collectively keep the R number low, ideally at or below 1, will push out as far as possible the chance of any further resurgence.  The greater we all understand, comply with and align ourselves collectively against the ongoing transmission risks and minimise them, including any risk that comes from travel, the more we can push out as much as possible into the future.  The reality for international travel is that the more we have control on an international basis as a shared experience across countries the better position we will be in to see a resumption of this type of activity.</p></speech>

This is very concerning for all of us and we hope it does not happen.  To use the DAA as an example, it has a plan to get testing capacity up and running from its own resources.  There will be natural restrictions on travel because events and concerts are not happening and people are fearful of travelling.  There are also economic reasons because people have lost their jobs and do not have the money to travel.  All of these factors will naturally suppress travel.  Does Dr. Holohan think there could be a window?  To use Dr. De Gascun's phrase, it is still just a slice of Swiss cheese in this whole approach.  Can we do something now and allow the airports to get something off the ground, at least in terms of structures?  We could end up not doing anything now and after December we could be at level 5 again in January.  Suddenly it will be the spring and the airports will have lost all of this time.  Could they even get the basics and the physical infrastructure in place for a testing regime?  Is there no fear about the implications of this for jobs and the economy?</p></speech>

I do not think the Taoiseach was expressing a level 5 lockdown in January as a certainty.</p></speech>

If we can maintain the high level of practice, as I said, then we can push out the risk of that into the future.  To be optimistic for a second - and again we cannot give certainty on this - we are increasingly seeing a sense that the position with vaccines may change in 2021 and offer some level of hope.  We have been dealing with a virus for which we have no vaccine, no natural immunity in the population and no effective drugs targeted against it.  That has been the reality.  Consequently the measures open to us to control the disease are simply to stop spreading it in the first instance.  If a vaccine is added to our armoury that will change things very substantially.  Potentially, if other countries find themselves in a similar situation that may change the picture substantially in 2021.  It is not necessarily inevitable that we will find ourselves in a situation-----</p></speech>

We do have emerging examples though.  Istanbul Airport has a big testing regime.  We spoke to representatives from Rome Airport last week and there are a number of other airports as well.  There is a growing body of examples for us to look at.  I will conclude with this as I have only ten seconds.  My concern is that if we do not have anything in place then restriction fatigue will creep in and as we move into 2021 people will just start making bookings.  They will go onto <i>ryanair.com</i>and <i>aerlingus.com</i>, and demand flights to Europe, America or wherever because they will be saying: &quot;Flip this, I have had a year plus of a tough time and I need to get away.&quot;  If that happens - because the airlines will take the bookings, as will the hotels on the far side - and we do not have a testing regime in place then we are potentially going to be in a really poor situation.</p></speech>

The Department of Transport and a range of other Departments are all engaged in the efforts which have to be made by Government to implement the arrangements that it has decided upon recently about the European arrangements.  Whatever has to be put in place in terms of the DAA will all, I am sure, form part of the Department of Transport's considerations in all of this.  Our preparations - and there will of course be a lot of work happening on this across the health service - will be on all the practical arrangements we have to put in place.

They have an incredibly difficult task.  No elected representative envies the decisions they have made and what is ahead of them and yet to come.</p> <p>  My first question is for both doctors.  It is very relevant to all sectors in transport, particularly aviation, and to people's lives as well.  How long do the NPHET representatives see us being in a situation where we are in this cycle of moving into and out of restrictions?  Dr. Holohan might answer that question first.</p></speech>

I will come back to what I mean by that.  A vaccine would change the situation entirely if we had one that was effective.</p><p>We do not plan, nor are in a position to plan, on the basis of that certainty.  We have to plan for two scenarios right now.  The first is where we have an effective vaccine.  Work is happening in that regard.  The second is where we do not have a vaccine.  We simply cannot fall into the trap of planning based on the certainty of a vaccine.  Therefore, all our work must be to ensure, inasmuch as possible, that we identify cases as early as possible when they occur, put arrangements in place to try to control the spread from any individual, through his or her contracts, into the wider community, and verify as much as we can the establishment of that control.  That is the rationale for the policy.</p></speech>

The vast majority of reasonable people will do so.  We are now at a much more advanced stage regarding the virus.  We have been living with it for almost a year and a number of vaccination trials internationally have been making great progress.  From the witnesses' understanding, could they indicate when a vaccine might be available to the public?  How is the testing going?  The virologist in the room, Dr. De Gascun, might have some information on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.293" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cillian De Gascun" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020110300002#R00700"><p>The short answer is that, from a vaccine perspective, there have been some very positive soundings that data from the phase 3 clinical trials will be available for analysis at the end of November.  Until we see those data, we will not know how well the vaccine performs.  In the context of the virus, we have had four seasonal human coronaviruses in recent decades.  All crossed the species barrier and have become endemic in the human population.  The original severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, of 2002 did not manage to become established and is no longer in circulation.  The Middle East respiratory syndrome, MERS, coronavirus of 2012 still causes occasional cases but it did not manage to adapt sufficiently to acquire the ability to transmit effectively between people.  SARS-CoV-2 has now done that.  Viruses do not just disappear; they tend not to just go away.  The only virus we have managed to eradicate through vaccination was smallpox.  We are getting close with measles, rubella and polio but it is a long way off.  Unfortunately, therefore, we cannot pin our hopes on a vaccine.  The chances of its being 100% effective and taken up by the whole population and of eradicating the virus in the near future are very small.  This virus is likely to become endemic in the population.  The non-pharmaceutical interventions Dr. Holohan has spoken about today will remain incredibly important.  Therefore, we have to get transmission down to a low level and change our behaviour to keep the virus suppressed to a low level in the community.  The virus, over the coming years and decades, may become milder but it is very unlikely to just disappear, even with a vaccine.</p></speech>

On foot of that, he will accept that with regard to adapting to living with the virus, it is important that we continue to investigate actively the possibly of rapid-testing infrastructure and advancing technologies in that area.  I accept that there are still underlying concerns about antigen testing and the lack of a comprehensive study on it.  Have the witnesses knowledge of any concluded or ongoing studies internationally on antigen testing?  The aviation sector wants antigen testing in place because it is rapid but I have some concerns about it.  Are there any ongoing large-scale studies?</p></speech>

We are very fortunate that HIQA has done a huge amount of work in this area and examined what is happening in other countries and in the literature.  Unfortunately, the evidence base is not in the literature regarding the performance of antigen tests in the real-world setting.  We have a very good test in the polymerase chain reaction, PCR, test at this point and we would need a good reason to move away from it.  What we often see as new tests are developed and new pathogens emerge is that the first generation of tests is imperfect but the second and third generation tests evolve, become more refined and get better.</p><p>It is completely possible that the second generation of antigen testing will become more easy to use, sensitive and more specific.  The specificity of antigen testing is not too bad at this point in time which should be acknowledged.  It is really a question of the sensitivity and the concern that we will miss cases.  That is why testing in whatever setting has to be taken in conjunction with restriction of movements in a travel setting and with a period of quarantine, purely because no test is perfect.  A test only gives an indication of a point in time.  For example, I could have had a test outside here this morning where the virus was not detected.  I could well be infectious now regardless of what the test said purely because of the way that the virus replicates over time, the virus load increases, and therefore becomes more easy to detect.  It is a point in time test and we need to be careful about not inferring too much on the basis of a single result.</p></speech>

I know that our witnesses were asked about the infrastructure at airports.  The whole area of working with elected representatives and Ministers on this issue is quite important.  From my engagement with very senior members of the Government there is a degree of hesitation on their part until public health advice is given to them to put in any infrastructure that may be required.  I wish to make the point to both our witnesses that the Ministers are very anxious to ensure that there is advice coming from both, and Dr. Holohan as the CMO, on putting in infrastructure at airports for any style of pre-departure testing or any testing facilities, if that becomes an advisable thing to do in the course of time, and when our witnesses will have more facts and data available to them to back such a decision up.  I encourage the witnesses to ensure that they are reaching out to the Department of Transport.  From what our witnesses have said to the committee, there is a bit of to-ing and fro-ing, in the sense that the Ministers are unsure of the public health advice and that our witnesses are saying that they cannot advise the Ministers but that they would have to go to the experts for advice on this issue.  Do our witnesses have anything to say on that point?</p></speech>

That is the normal part of the implementation of any Government decision.  The work that is happening across Departments involves the Department of Transport, the Department of Health and others and reflects the advice that we have given but also reflects all of the other considerations that Government has to have including the positions and perspectives of all of the other Government Departments.  That is all being worked through in the current process of implementation.  We will continue as a Department to make our advice available in the context of all of that.  Ultimately it will be for the Government to decide based on that advice, having reflected all of the other perspectives that need to be taken into account.  That, to my mind, is a normal part of public administration.</p></speech>

He said that this virus would become endemic within the Irish population.  When does Dr. de Gascun expect the vaccine will be in place?  How effective will it be and when do we reach a point when the coronavirus becomes like the common flu?</p></speech>

SARS Cov-2 has certainly at this point in time achieved its aspiration of becoming readily transmissible from person-to-person.  It establishes itself in a new host, it adapts to that new host and there is no reason to believe, in the absence of a significant intervention, whether that is a vaccine, a treatment or some other event, that it will not manage to become endemic.  From the point of view as to how it will evolve from a severity perspective over the coming years and decades, it would be foolish of me to try to predict that.  We do not know when the other seasonal coronaviruses crossed the species barrier so we do not know what sort of diseases they caused when they first crossed over and whether that has changed over time.  Obviously they now cause a mild illness.</p></speech>

A couple of companies have been quite bullish that they will be going to the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, at the end of November or the start of December to seek emergency use authorisation or early approval.  It is very important for us to see what those data tell us about how the vaccine performs.  Safety is paramount with any new vaccine.  Efficacy is also important.</p></speech>

The drug companies suggest that they are already manufacturing their vaccine.</p><p>They are manufacturing their product on the basis that they believe it will be effective.  This comes back to the importance of the scientific process and the data being published and made available so that we can all review them and see which groups were vaccinated and how well the vaccine worked in those settings.  Again, we believe the data from phase 3 clinical trials will be available towards the end of November and we look forward to seeing what they tell us.</p></speech>

As a country we are part of the joint procurement arrangements that will kick in for the provision of that vaccine to all of the member states of the EU that are part of that joint procurement process.

It is really valued.  I thank them for keeping us safe and informed and working with the population.</p> <p>  We have had a series of meetings on this topic.  We have been very slow to move on it.  Germany, Italy and Austria have moved on international air travel.  As the witnesses will appreciate, aviation is an economic driver in our country.  I am from County Clare and Shannon Airport is very important to business and tourism in the region.  We need to get the balance right.  There are 80 aviation-related companies in the Shannon area, all of which are dependent on aviation.</p> <p>  The EU moved to try to reopen international travel in the summer.  We lost a lot at that point in that we did not introduce rapid testing at our airports.  As the witnesses will be aware, the DAA and Shannon Airport have put a proposal to the Department of Transport on the introduction of a testing regime.  Has NPHET considered that?  If so, what is its view on it?</p></speech>

The testing arrangements in some countries are not isolated arrangements.  The arrangements that exist in Germany are not arrangements in regard to testing alone.  Our advice is still reflective of the evidence that we talked about today and the guidance of the WHO and ECDC, namely, that we do not recommend rapid antigen testing for use as part of broader screening.  If we are to have measures that incorporate testing, it will be in the way we described earlier and will be part of a suite of measures designed to ensure we can minimise the risk of transmission between countries.</p></speech>

A detailed specific proposal from the DAA, through the Department of Transport, has been alluded to but I have not seen the specific details shared by the Department of Health.</p></speech>

What evidence do they have in respect of cases in Ireland?  In their opening statement they said that during the summer up to a quarter of cases were imported.  Is there more recent evidence on international travel in terms of cases?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.311" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020110300002#T00700"><p>We look at transmission status.  The work done by contact tracing and public health teams tries to establish, insofar as they can, where an individual may pick up an infection.  That is where we get this information from.  Over the course of the summer, those teams indicated that, in relative terms, the proportion of cases from travel increased.  That was partly because of the significant progress made by Irish people in driving down the levels of transmission to low numbers.  On some days, fewer than ten cases in total were reported.</p><p>In that context, a small number of imported cases would have a proportionately large effect.  When we got to a point in the summer where we had, for all intents and purposes, eliminated community transmission, the major source of infection was from outside the country.  Therefore, its importance increased.</p><p> Of late, however, it is fair to say that we have not been as focused on international travel as a source because the risk to people in this country is not arising from the numbers coming through Dublin Airport, but through everything that is happening in this country - socialisation, parties, getting together indoors and outdoors and workplaces.  I could go on.  Our concern for the past two months in particular has been consumed, and rightly so, by the risk of transmission in this country.  Correctly, we were much less focused on the immediate risks posed by international travel, given that it was only adding a small proportion to the total amount of activity.  We had a great deal of disease transmission that was Irish, if I could put it that way, and very little international travel in relative terms.  If that set of circumstances changes, our considerations will obviously have to change.  In other words, if we manage to drive down community transmission to where it was in the summer or if we see things happening that lead to a significant increase in the quantity of international travel, we will have to give some consideration to what we believe the risks arising from that will be and give advice based on our assessment.</p></speech>

Recently, a paper has been highlighted - people have probably seen it mentioned in the media - discussing a novel variant of the virus from Spain that has travelled around Europe.  From a virological perspective, it highlights how interconnected we all are.  Fortunately, there is no evidence that the virus is necessarily more transmissible or virulent, but it demonstrates nicely that the virus will spread readily if given the opportunity.  Obviously, travel facilitates that.</p></speech>

Dr. Holohan referred to a risk of 15% of imported cases not being identified, but surely such a system should be welcomed and endorsed by NPHET.  We cannot remain in this situation forever.  We need to move on, especially where an important industry like aviation is concerned.</p></speech>

Our job is to point out the risks and safety issues.  I understand and am sensitive to the implications that it has for others, but our primary responsibility is to make as dispassionately as we can an evidence-based assessment of what works, what does not work and what our experience is or is not, and base our advice on that.</p></speech>

On a purely public health basis, NPHET could tell the Government that the best thing to do would be to close all workplaces, close all airports, close everything.  That would have a substantial effect.  However, we have not made that advice available.  We are constantly balancing what we believe is a proportionate assessment of what is an appropriate risk and a proportionate response to the level of transmission.  Although we now have in place very significant recommendations, ones that are mandated by the Government, they are proportionate.  One need only look across Europe.  Many countries waited until much later than us.  I am not being critical of any individual country.  Based on their assessments-----</p></speech>

Across many of those countries, there are substantial challenges in providing health services.  Countries are literally seeking to buy ICU capacity from other countries.</p><p>Desperate measures are being taken in many developed European countries and capitals.  I will not make a bold statement that we will avoid that here but the trajectory of the disease we have managed to establish over the course of the past couple of weeks, gives us some reason to believe we might get there.</p><p> The reason I am simply disagreeing is that a couple of things happened.  First, we know we have had anticipatory behaviour.  The population has been getting more concerned.  Individuals, and rightly so, and we have been advising it, have taken decisions themselves to avoid risks and to start to cut down their contacts and cut down their socialisation to avoid the kinds of circumstances that would lead to transmission.  That has been going on for some time.  Second, we have evidence in places where level 3 recommendations have been in place for longer than in other parts of the country, in particular, in Dublin, where we have not seen a suppressing effect in disease transmission.  All the evidence we have available gives us the judgment that level 3-type restrictions in this country seem to be able to hold the virus, broadly speaking, at a given level of transmission, in other words, hold what you have as oppose to reducing.  Our analysis, I think, correctly, is we have to absolutely drive down the rate of transmission, and that is why the level 5 measures were recommended by NPHET.  The public in many respects may have gotten ahead of us in many parts of the country and begun that because we are seeing a suppression of the disease even if we still have some way to go.</p></speech>

In the context of the information he has given, we were at low levels during the summer months, with 25% of cases associated with foreign travel, yet people could come in from red zone countries, essentially go about their business freely and there was no testing at our ports or airports.  If every individual since March had a PCR test coming into the country, we would have been in a better position to manage our Covid-19 threat but Dr. Holohan is not saying that today.  I wonder why.</p></speech>

At the same time, we are saying that 25% of cases are associated with foreign travel and that, in the best-case scenario, we would lower the transmission on the island of Ireland but it will be an increasing risk for importing it from abroad and still we will have no testing in place.</p></speech>

It has to be part of a suite of control measures to inform control measures.  It is not the only measure to put in place and placing undue reliance - and I am not suggesting the Deputy is doing that - on the value of testing at the expense of other things will create a false sense of security and actually increase the risks.</p></speech>

That is what one can do.  The incubation period of the virus is 14 days so probably from day four to day five today - day ten to day 12 - they are the people we are stopping travelling.  The problem is that we have got people in the first four days of the four to five days of their infection so we will miss them.  It is not that they will have a false sense of security.

We know that people can transmit before the onset of symptoms and we know that the vast majority of people will become symptomatic.  If people follow the public health guidance we can capture most of those individuals.  We could stop people who have an RNA detected test at the point of testing from getting on the plane.  That is certainly a useful component but the other element of this is that we are using diagnostic tests that are intended to be used in symptomatic people in a way in which they were not originally intended so the performance will be sub-optimal.  We will generate inaccurate results also because we know that, in terms of the sensitivity of the test, no test is perfect.

On the island, we have ended up in circumstances where we are not in control, so those kinds of tracing systems and so on do not work as effectively as they do when there are lower levels of transmission.  There are many examples of good co-operation across the Border where sharing of information has led to proper detection, control and so on.  In fact, the first case that occurred on the island was in Northern Ireland and involved detailed contact tracing and co-operation between transport and other agencies across the Border, and it worked very well.</p></speech>

We have heard that 40% of the air is filtered, while the rest is clean air from the atmosphere outside.  Is it safe to be on an aeroplane if the person has been tested and is Covid free when getting on?  The person may have taken a test at Charles de Gaulle Airport or wherever.  Is an aeroplane a safe environment insofar as Covid transmission is concerned?  Dr. De Gascun might be better placed to respond.  Is it safe to be in that shell of the fuselage of an aeroplane for two hours?</p></speech>

The risk relates to the activities, as discussed earlier, on either side of the journey.  That is where the ultimate risk lies.  Even if people are tested prior to travel, it is not a guarantee that they are not incubating infection.  Having a single point of testing, therefore, has significant limitations.  It is certainly a good way of keeping off the plane people with an RNA-detected result, but the problem is the 30% to 35% of individuals who, in that first few days of their infection, do not believe they are infected and will be assured by the result of the test.  They will then come to whichever country, whether Ireland or another, and will not restrict their movements because they will believe they are not a risk.  That is the concern.  I do not believe an aeroplane to be a high-risk environment at all but, unfortunately, that is not what we are trying to address.  It is about people moving from red or orange countries to what will, hopefully, be lower risk countries by December.</p></speech>

We have been focused on trying to get the message to the groups that give us greatest concern as far as transmission is concerned, who over recent weeks have been the 19 to 24-year-olds.  The incidence among them went up to 450 per 100,000 two weeks ago but has dropped back to fewer than 300 per 100,000.  We also have data on contact behaviour across the age ranges and we have good reason to believe that 19 to 24-year-olds are changing their behaviour and listening to the message.  Young people are taking the message on board, taking responsibility and avoiding the kinds of circumstances that lead to transmission of the virus.  What we are now seeing, unfortunately, is that the age groups in which the incidence is increasing are the older age groups that will be represented among the hospitalisations and deaths.</p></speech>

It is to be hoped it is back on track.  Do we need to do more as far as retrospective contact tracing is concerned, particularly in the context of Dr. Holohan's comment earlier that it would be great to drive the virus back by county, town and local area?  Will the witnesses comment on retrospective tracing and what needs to be done to resource it?</p></speech>

The more we can understand this and the earlier we can intervene on these things at local level the better.  Our contact tracing system has worked well, to be fair to the HSE on this occasion.  The system ran into a challenge when we had very high levels of widespread community transmission.  Show me a country in Europe where that has not happened.  Widespread community transmission challenges every part of the response to this, including contact tracing.</p></speech>

It will be a very important function of an optimised and idealised public health system of the kind the WHO has been recommending, which consists of testing, referral, tracing, investigation and control measures, verification of those control measures and then surveillance around that.  That is the package we must have in place to maximise our chance of keeping control.  As Deputy Smith says, retrospective investigation of contacts is a very important part of all that.</p></speech>
