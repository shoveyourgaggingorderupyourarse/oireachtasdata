We are joined, via Zoom, by representatives from Forest Industries Ireland - IBEC and Woodlands of Ireland.  First we will hear from Forest Industries Ireland - IBEC, represented by Mr. Mark McAuley, director, and Mr. Peter O'Brien, chairman of the forestry group.  We will then hear from Mr. Joe Gowran, chief executive officer of Woodlands of Ireland.</p> <p>  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise the witnesses who are giving evidence from locations outside the parliamentary precincts to note that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before committees may not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, the evidence to be given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regime.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a matter, they must respect that direction.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite the representatives from Forest Industries Ireland to make their submission.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark McAuley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020110300002#B00400"><p>I am the director of Forest Industries Ireland.  Our chairman, Mr. Brian Murphy, sends his apologies as he was called away and was not able to make it this afternoon.  I am joined by Mr. Peter O'Brien, chairman of the forestry group within Forest Industries Ireland.  I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to discuss with them the contribution forestry and timber are making to our economy, society and environment.  We would also like to talk about some of the deep challenges the sector is facing.</p> <p>  Forest Industries Ireland is an all-island body constituted within IBEC.  Our member companies cover the whole supply chain.  There are nurseries that grow the saplings.  We have forestry consultants who work with farmers and landowners to plant and manage their forests.  We have factories that convert the forest crop into construction timber, panel products, fencing materials, packaging, biofuel and other products.</p> <p>  For many decades, the State and our people have invested in increasing afforestation in Ireland.  In return, Ireland has an industry that provides 12,000 jobs throughout our rural communities.  The economic contribution is of the order of &euro;2.3 billion per annum.  Over the coming years, the private forests planted in the 1980s and 1990s will come to maturity and significantly increase the supply to the market.  This is a further opportunity for Ireland.</p> <p>  Today, we work with more than 20,000 farmer forest owners.  Most of them made the decision to plant a portion of their farms.  They get a steady and reliable income, and it delivers a valuable crop when the forest matures.  Increasingly, farmers are interested in the environmental contribution their forests make.</p> <p>  In Ireland, our forests produce timber three times faster than in Scandinavia.  The forests are a major carbon sink.  Forestry in Ireland is therefore already a big part of this island's fight against climate change.  Irish forests are capturing 3.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year.  The total carbon store is in excess of 300 million tonnes.  This is a testament to the policies of successive Governments to plant trees and create a vibrant forest sector.</p><p>All over the world, forests have been identified as the most scalable opportunity to absorb CO<sub>2</sub>.  In Ireland, we have learned a lot.  We are increasing diversity and balance in our forests, providing more leisure and recreational opportunities for our citizens and increasing the provision of one of nature's great renewable raw materials.<br/><br/>We should increasingly seek to use our own timber as a mass-market construction material.  Wood can displace carbon-intensive materials in our built environment and is doing so today throughout the world.  The world&rsquo;s tallest timber building was completed in Norway this year.  It has 18 storeys of apartments.  We should also embrace greater use of timber in Ireland.  This would require changes to our building regulations.  The Government can take a lead by enabling more timber housing and procuring new, greener schools and civic buildings which use cross-laminated timber as the backbone of their structure.<br/><br/>Ireland&rsquo;s forest policy is constantly evolving.  To continue this into the future, we must plant more and continue to improve forest management.  We have done well to climb back from less than 1% forest cover 100 years ago to the 11% of today.  Now is the time to redouble our efforts and build a coalition of farmers, foresters and policymakers to drive continued forest development.  Farmers are the foundation of future forestry.  Industry and the Government must rise to the challenge of rewarding these farmers.  Without enthusiastic participation from all, we cannot maintain the positive growth of forestry.  We need to support our farmers and rural communities.  We want them to feel encouraged to see forestry as a positive option on their farms, both for the sake of the environment and a reliable family income.<br/><br/>We all want to find ways to diversify the forest estate.  Already, over 30% of the trees we plant are broadleaf species.  We want to increase the creation of native woodland.  We can do this in a way that goes hand in hand with the creation of conifer forests and the economic value they contribute.  The greatest driver of broadleaf planting in Ireland right now is the planting of broadleaves alongside sitka spruce.  This sector is calling for a renewed vision for forestry in Ireland based on economic development, climate change goals, biodiversity and social values.  We need stakeholders to come together and agree the way forward, rather than have different groups pulling in different directions.  If we get it right, it will work for everyone.<br/><br/>I have started with a positive vision today, but I must tell the committee that there is a deep crisis in the forestry sector right now.  Tree planting has been decimated and our sawmills have run out of timber.  Jobs have been lost and companies are in danger.  We have a minimal winter planting programme and are having to import timber from as far away as Russia in order to supply the market.  That is akin to Ireland having to import milk because farmers cannot get a licence to milk their cows.  It has been caused by the introduction of a new regime for forestry licensing and a failure of this new process to provide the licences that are needed to plant trees and fell timber.  The sector is completely undermined by this.  There are simply not enough new licences being delivered by the forest service.  There is a huge backlogs in the Department and a further backlog of appealed licences in the forestry appeals committee, FAC.  Farmers cannot plant new forestry or get a licence to fell their crop of trees.  There are 2,000 applications awaiting approval from the Department and the run-rate of licences being issued is far below what the sector needs.  It is absolutely essential that the Department finds a way to quickly deal with the backlog and dramatically increase the supply of licences.<br/><br/>The licensing system needs reform and must be capable of delivering licences within 120 days of application &ndash; this is the core industry requirement.  The Department has not been able to deliver on its licensing targets and the industry believes the system needs complete reform if it is ever going to work.  The industry is 100% reliant on a functioning licensing system without which we are at nothing and no Government ambitions in respect of forestry and timber will ever be delivered.  People have lost their jobs and companies are in danger.<br/><br/>The problem with licensing is exacerbated by a further backlog of<b></b>500<b></b>projects under appeal Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act sets out a path to reform the FAC and deliver much greater output.  I thank Members of the Oireachtas, including those here today, for the overwhelming support that this legislation received on its path through the Houses.  Unfortunately, we are still awaiting proper implementation of the reforms that were enabled by the legislation.  We discussed this issue in detail last week with the Minister of State with responsibility for land use and biodiversity, Senator Hackett, and her officials, and we remain unconvinced that the FAC will be able to deliver if it keeps going the way it is going because we will be waiting for many months for most of these appeals to be decided.  The fact is that 1 million tonnes of timber are stuck and this is where our planting projects have stalled.</p><p>The damage is enormous and is getting worse every time.  The FAC must be reformed in line with the legislation and start dealing with appeals at the rate of 100 plus per month.  Since the start of the year the committee has only processed circa 26 projects per month.  The long delays at the FAC, coupled with inadequate licence approvals in the first instance, have led to our mills now running out of timber and our afforestation programme being on its knees.  Forestry companies, contractors and hauliers have lost their jobs and the machines have been sold off.  Irreparable damage is being caused to the sector.  The system is broken and the Department needs to recognise this.  Urgent action is needed now.  </p><p> I underline three requirements.  The FAC needs to implement the Forestry Act, work in multiple divisions, deal with appeals jointly and be resourced efficiently.  It can be rigorous and fair to all parties and, at the same time, be much more productive.  The Minister needs to stay close to this process and to ensure that it happens.  The FAC holds 1 million tonnes of timber and we need to get it out of there.</p><p> The speed, resources and capability within the Department also needs to improve urgently to increase the rate at which forest licences are being approved to multiples of the current level.  Targets continue to be missed.  The backlog in ecology in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has increased to 2,000 files.  The system is in failure and this must be recognised.  </p><p> In the longer term, the regulatory system must be revised and we should move away from a licensing model to a regulatory model that does not require a fresh licence for every activity.  This is unnecessary and is not replicated in other countries.  We need a more sensible approach that can be both rigorous and efficient.  Again, the Department needs to accept the need for reform and begin the process.  </p><p> In conclusion, we are in a crisis right now and it is one of our own making.  We can, however, recover once the problem is fixed.  Then the forestry section will be in a fantastic position to deliver for our farmers and for rural Ireland.  We will grow and create many more jobs all around the country, all the while delivering for our environment and providing a great recreation for our people.  We can achieve this if the current crisis in licensing is resolved quickly and the industry can return to normal operations.  Failing this we are going over a cliff.  It is a crisis that can still be solved and a disaster that can be avoided.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

Mr. McAuley has raised some serious questions about how the licensing system is operating and I am sure that the committee members may wish to have this further elaborated on.  I call Deputy Kehoe first, then Senators Paul Daly and Boyhan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1619" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020110300002#D00700"><p>I thank Mr. McAuley for his opening presentation and he is very welcome to the meeting.  Everybody in this room will very much agree with the sentiments expressed that the forestry sector is in crisis.  I read with interest today a press release from the IFA.  I do not know if anybody else present has seen it.  The headline is that the forest service is strangling the sector that it has responsibility for promoting.  We will all agree with that because it has been a sentiment of my own for the last while.</p> <p>  I studied horticulture and worked in the forestry sector with None-So-Hardy (Forestry) Limited in Wicklow, with John McCarthy, for quite a number of years and have a little bit of experience of the sector.  One of the most damning things that I have ever seen was millions of trees being dumped on a yearly basis.  It must be most frustrating for the companies and the industry to see this happening.  </p> <p>  I have three questions I wish to put to Mr. O'Brien.  What are the most critical issues facing the sector?  I am aware that Mr. McAuley has mentioned to us a number of these but I would like to know his views on this.  What do the stakeholders in the industry see as tangible solutions?  What is needed right now to get over the difficulties we have?</p><p>The other thing that received great play over the last while is the implementation of the Mackinnon report.  I had an oral parliamentary question on that with the Minister about two months ago.   It is in the programme for Government.  Will this address the licensing delays and delays in the forest service?  Will this report, if fully implemented, address most of the problems?  At the meeting with the Minister last week, what was the Minister's update on the current status of the implementation of the Mackinnon report?  I will come back with further questions later on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020110300002#E00200"><p>I will ask a couple of brief questions and make an observation and whoever feels they are most appropriately positioned to answer them can take them.  Mr. McAuley mentioned in his submission that we can take forestry forward to where we want it to be and achieve the targets set out with "enthusiastic participation".  How will we gain the enthusiasm of farmers going forward based on the rigmarole we have been dealing with over the last two weeks?  They have seen all the issues and their colleagues, relations and neighbours got themselves into 25 or 30 years ago which are only becoming evident now.  A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing.  They are far more informed of the consequences of the investments they are making and that it may not be as easy at the other end.  How do the witnesses propose we recreate that enthusiastic participation?</p> <p>  Can the witnesses give us some idea of where we are at due to the current failings with imports?  Can they put tonnage on it?  Where may we end up if the problem is not solved?</p> <p>  I will make a final observation and perhaps the witnesses will comment on it.  We started out this process in the Seanad with the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  It was probably my naivete but I took it that the core issue here was due to appeals.  However, it has come to light now that there are 2,000 applications sitting in the Department that are not being appealed.  Why did that backlog, in the witnesses' opinion, arise?  Was it due to lack of staffing numbers, inefficiencies or lack of interest?  How did we get to a situation where we have a backlog of 2,000, from the industry's perspective?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1634" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020110300002#E00300"><p>I thank Mr. McAuley for his paper.  I am familiar with IBEC in many forms, particularly in this area.  I thank him for the professional way in which IBEC conducts its business and communicates with Oireachtas Members.  It is very concise in all its documentation that I have received and that is helpful in getting to grips with the issues and the tasks.  IBEC is in the business of promoting business and enterprise and I support all of that.  However, I could not help thinking as Mr. McAuley was reading his statement to the committee that we have heard all this before.  We had the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, in the Seanad and the Seanad unanimously approved the Bill.  I had great reservations about it.  I studied horticulture, I know a lot of people in the forestry sector and I am close with people who own commercial forests.  We said it was not all about the logjam in the appeals process and now, some weeks after this legislation was approved, Mr. McAuley is painting an honest and frank picture, but a very negative one.</p> <p>  What sticks out for me is that, having met the key Minister responsible for this sector in the Government - the Green Minister, Senator Hackett - they remain unconvinced and that is disappointing.  Perhaps the witnesses will share with this committee what happened in that meeting.  What are the main areas of concern?  We were led to believe it was a block caused by serial objectors going up and down this country.  That was the picture painted by this Administration.  These serial objectors were totally opposed to it on spurious environmental grounds and so on.  Now we are told we have 2,000 cases that are not being appealed.  I would like to hear about that engagement.</p> <p>  I am concerned, as members of this committee should be and also as a Member of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, that there were 8,888 public submissions and, as of today, I have not been able to view those because of data issues and so on.</p><p>It does not wash with me.  I am clearly not in a position to read all of those submissions.  I make the call that we need to see all of those submissions because people in the commercial sector made them.  We got broad brush strokes to the effect that this was all about appeals.  I would like to hear the issues of concern that remain and why the witnesses were not convinced by the responses from the Minister in question.</p></speech>

I ask him to please answer them, as well as the questions raised by the two Senators.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020110300002#F00300"><p>The first question was about the critical issues.  The critical issue is the Department's total inability to deal with licensing.  The legislation on the habitats directive has been a place for a number of years.  It started to become an issue in the forest service towards the end of 2018.  The approach to dealing with the problem has been wholly inadequate.</p> <p>  It is important that I give some background to how we have arrived at this logjam.  As Mr. McAuley said, there are 1,800 or 2,000 applications sitting in the ecology department.  They did not arrive in there; a sequence of events caused the build-up of applications.  When it became evident that an appropriate assessment had to be carried out on the application for licensing and a subsequent Natura impact statement may have to have been prepared, the forest service decided it would endeavour to get its people to do that.  My understanding is that no other Department or a licensing authority takes that approach.  It is up to the applicant to submit the appropriate assessment and the subsequent Natura impact statement, if necessary, with the application.  The licensing authority then makes a determination on that information. </p> <p>  It is quite an onerous job to prepare a Natura impact statement and it has to be carried out by an ecologist.  The forest service decided to get its inspectorate to do the screening.  The inspectors are foresters, not ecologists.  This process was taken in hand by the Department in 2019.  It was not fit for purpose.  My understanding is that the inspectorate said it was not fit for purpose, yet management proceeded along the same path.  </p> <p>  The industry was reassured on numerous occasions that this would be sorted out and there would not be a problem.  Through the first four or five months of 2020, practically no licences were being issued for afforestation, felling or roads.  The applications have been referred to the ecology department and it was not possible to deal with them.  I understand at that stage one ecologist, or possibly two, was employed to deal with the continuous increase in the number of applications being referred to the ecology department. </p> <p>  The industry was reassured on a number of occasions that there was a process in place that was fit for purpose and there would not be any issue.  The industry made a recommendation to management in the Department that one of the recommendations in the Mackinnon report, namely, the possibility of introducing a grant or payment towards the cost of the preparation of the appropriate assessments or Natura impact statements, would be made by the Department.  That proposal from the industry was flatly refused by the Department's management.  The industry could see that the problems were not being addressed.</p><p>In July, a project plan was put in place by the Department.  We viewed its targets as being extremely soft.  By the Department's own calculations, it will be the end of 2021 before the 1,800 applications in the system will be cleared out.  That assumes no new applications will be submitted.  This will be the case even with a fully resourced Department with more ecologists and inspectors.  The first three months of the plan have seen the Department achieve 50% of its own soft targets.  This is a crisis.  We need to achieve at least double what the Department has in its soft targets for the private sector to have enough licences to fell the amount of timber outlined in the COFORD supply report, build the number of roads required and reach a target of 8,000 ha per annum.  We will be lucky to achieve a little over 2,000 ha this year.  That is a quarter of what is outlined in the programme for Government.</p><p> This is where the problem lies and it is why we are where we are.  It is a resource issue, but it is also a systems issue, given that the system is not fit for purpose, specifically where licensing is concerned.  In order to achieve 8,000 ha per annum, meet our targets in private sector felling of available timber and construct roads, we will need approximately 3,500 licences.</p><p> That does not even take into account the chalara issue, which the committee discussed with other witnesses two weeks ago.  There are between 4,000 and 5,000 forest owners with ash plantations that are dying or dead.  It must be remembered that chalara did not just appear in Europe five years ago.  Rather, it was in eastern Europe 25 years ago.  The Department was negligent in not preventing it from reaching our shores.  A scheme to deal with chalara was rolled out in June, but it is not fit for purpose.  It is too complicated and, as far as I am aware, no applications to it have been approved.  These are indicators of the levels of catastrophic mismanagement by the Department.</p><p> I will make a further point about roads.  In the Department's October figures, more than 200 felling licences were approved but only 19 roads were approved for construction.  How does the Department expect us to get the timber out of the forests?  Felling licences are very important if we are to get timber to mills, but if we cannot get the timber out of the forests in the first place, we will not get them to the mills.  These are facts.</p><p> I will turn to solutions.  In the short term, by which I do not mean months, but immediately, the solution is the real allocation of resources, not just pushing resources from one area to the next.  The FAC has to be resourced to a point where it can release those felling licences that are ready to go.</p><p>However, there is no point in doing that if resources have to be taken from the licensing area and put into the forestry appeals committee.  New resources must be put in place to get these licences out of the FAC without impinging on the resources available for the issuing of licences in the first place.</p><p> The system is not fit for purpose and does not stand up to scrutiny.  Applications have been in the system for two years or longer.  The uptake in licences issued, from an afforestation point of view, is extraordinarily low, at 60%, because it takes so long to get a licence.  Anyone who has been waiting for two years for a licence will more than likely have done something else with the land.  Either that or the applicant has amazing faith in the forester he or she is dealing with.  If it takes that long to get approval to plant a handful of trees, the system is not fit for purpose. </p><p> These are the endemic problems on the afforestation and felling sides.  It is not just in one area but across the entire industry.  As Mr. McAuley said, the industry is in crisis.  It is not a case of tinkering around the edges next year.  Unless something very serious is done in the short term, the industry will fall off the precipice.  The industry is in absolute crisis and that crisis lands on the management in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p> The Mackinnon report was commissioned by the previous Government to look into how the Department manages applications.  Clearly, therefore, the way in which the Department carried out its business must have been a concern to the Minister at that time.  This was before the appropriate assessment problem brought everything to a head this year with the requirement for the legislation to be changed.</p><p> James Mackinnon is a planner from Scotland who looked at the afforestation sector in Scotland.  At the time, afforestation had fallen to around 3,500 ha or 4,000 ha per annum.  He looked at how the systems worked in Scotland.  He was commissioned to do a report here and examine how the Department did its business.  He issued his report in February of this year.  It is referred to in the programme for Government and the previous Administration identified an individual as the most qualified person to implement the report.  Nothing has happened, however.  Would its implementation help?  Of course, it would but where is the political will to implement it?  We cannot stall or talk about looking at forestry next year.  That will not work because there will be no industry by the middle of next year.</p><p> As a result of the Mackinnon report in Scotland, planting increased from 3,500 ha to 11,000 ha within four years.  We have more than enough interest in this country to achieve a target of 8,000 ha if the Department were to get its business in order.</p><p> The current mechanism requires not just the implementation of the Mackinnon report but also the appointment of somebody who can actually deliver.  I will not call that person a project manager but someone who will look at the system, make the necessary changes and deliver the licences.  That will not happen with the current regime.</p></speech>

I gave latitude to Mr. O'Brien in his answers because I felt he was giving a comprehensive review of the issues in the industry.  Other members are anxious to pose questions.

I thank Mr. O'Brien for that and thank Mr. McAuley for his opening statement.  They will not find much argument in this room that forestry policy is a mess in this State.  We have had several conversations about it.  It takes a special type of incompetence of the highest order to have a policy that pleases absolutely nobody.  From the industry to the communities, to the farmers and to environmentalists, everybody - apart from the Department and the new Ministers who one would hope would come in with a fresh pair of eyes - is in agreement that our forestry policy is a complete mess.  I have listened to a number of D&aacute;il debates in which the Minister of State with responsibility, Senator Hackett, has essentially reiterated and regurgitated what we had been hearing from the Department over the past couple of years and it has been incredibly disappointing.  I wanted to premise my first question with that.  We accept that the system is a mess and we accept that the primary responsibility for that lies in the Department.</p><p>My question is whether the forestry industry accepts any responsibility for the mess that we are in.  We are at this point because of the delays with felling licences.  If we go back to the start, the root of all of these problems, to use a forestry term, lies in the fact that no plans were put in place when the trees were planted in the first place.  We have had several decades of opportunities to get these matters right and we have not had that.</p><p>My second question relates to the point made by Mr. McAuley with regard to the industry's willingness to find ways to diversify the forest estate.  He said:</p> <blockquote> 	Already, over 30% of the trees we plant are broadleaf species.  We want to increase the creation of native woodland. </blockquote> <p>A new forestry policy is due next year, we are told.  What percentage would Mr. McAuley put on it?  What percentage should be broadleaf?  It would be helpful if we could reach a consensus on what the target for that should be.</p><p>Mr. McAuley made an interesting point that the Government can take a lead by enabling more timber housing and construction to take place.  I am sure many people who would not consider building their homes with anything other than concrete would be surprised to learn of the Norwegian example Mr. McAuley cited of an 18-storey building made from wood.  There has to be scope there.  We would look forward to those type of developments taking place in Ireland built with wood produced in Ireland.  That would be the absolute panacea.  In advance of the new forestry policy that we are discussing, what regulations or legislation should be incorporated into that policy to facilitate and encourage those type of developments?</p><p>Mr. McAuley mentioned the carbon sink.  I am familiar with his figures.  I am also aware that others who contact us would argue with those figures but let us assume that they are correct and that they are not in dispute.  What measures can be put in place to ensure that forestry plays an even more valuable role in terms of building a carbon sink?</p><p>Finally, in relation to the backlog of licences, this committee, the D&aacute;il and the Seanad were misled, when we were dealing with the amendment to the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020, by two Ministers, and by the officials in terms of the briefings that they provided us.</p><p>Certainly, the inference I took was that the delay was as a result of the number of appeals.  The number of appeals has had a major impact, of that there is no question, and that is why there was almost unanimous support in both Houses for the legislation.  It appears the Department is largely responsible, which is a very serious issue.  I know this has been touched on.  I would ask Forest Industries Ireland whether further legislative change is required to the Forestry Act to address the deficiencies we have learned of, or whether it is a matter of resourcing and changes in regulations. </p></speech>

They are preaching to the converted on this issue.  In 2017, I went to the Department when I saw this coming.  Unfortunately, it was all bluster and promises, but nothing happened.</p> <p>  With regard to the Mackinnon report, have the witnesses had any contact with the Department or Ministers?  My understanding was that the previous Minister had put it out to tender, whatever system was used.  It is also my understanding that someone was ready to be appointed.  Deputy Sean Sherlock tabled a parliamentary question a couple of weeks ago about the Mackinnon report and its implementation.  The response that came back, although I will not quote it verbatim, basically stated that, where feasible, the Department would implement it.  My understanding is that a person was to be appointed and that person was going to take on the role of implementing a strategy, to which the witnesses have just referred.  Is it of concern to Forest Industries Ireland that this answer came back?  Does it have meetings with representatives of the forestry sector?  Mr. O'Brien talked about the soft figures, some of which were approximately 50% less.  Has that continued since we passed the new legislation?</p> <p>  I will not say I was misled because I said from day one that we have a problem.  We can blame everybody in the whole world, and we can blame people for objecting, and I am no admirer of them.  However, at the end of the day, we have a Department that for the past ten years, and especially the past four years, has never achieved the targets set out.  There is a major problem.  The Mackinnon report states very clearly that the morale of the forestry inspectors within the Department is gone.  We can have all the meetings in the world, and we have dealt with forestry on three or four different days, but unless there is change in the Department, we are not going to solve anything.  We cannot keep playing the same tune and expect a different result.</p> <p>  The committee has to be blunt on this.  If we have spent three years on it and the whole thing is going from bad to worse, which it is, then a Minister has to intervene.  If people are not fit for purpose in their positions, they have to be given an alternative job, and that has to be spelled out clearly. </p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien elaborated on the crisis in the sector and I thank him for his comments.  The statement refers to the longer-term reforms that are required and, if he can, he might elaborate on those.  I know we are here to talk about the current crisis and he has also touched on that.</p><p>We are trying to embark on a very ambitious programme of development of the industry in the coming years and decades and with the current crisis it does not bode well for the future if we cannot solve that.  I ask Mr. McAuley to elaborate on what he sees as the medium-term to longer-term reforms that are required.  In his opening statement he spoke about moving from a licensing model to a regulatory model that would not require a fresh licence for every activity.  He might elaborate on that, the move towards a more close to nature approach and also a broadleaf based forestry model.</p></speech>

I was clear that we were voting on the licensing process.  I knew there were 2,000 applications in the licensing system that were separate from the appeals.  I knew we were voting on a segment of applications that were gone into appeals and to try to speed that up.  I was fully aware that the licensing process is a huge issue and that the legislation we were passing would only deal with a segment of the problem with licence applications.  I just want to make it clear to Deputy Carthy that I was clear on that when we were voting.</p></speech>

They previously gave extremely comprehensive answers but I ask them to be brief this time around.</p></speech>

With Mr. O'Brien's permission I will take this question.  I will try to be brief.  I thank the members for their questions.  In terms of the questions from Deputy Carthy, I agree 100% that the current policy pleases nobody.  It certainly does not work for the industry.  It does not work for various of our NGOs or our farmers on the ground.</p> <p>  In terms of whether the industry accepts any responsibility, there is not a capacity problem in the industry.  The industry has invested literally hundreds of millions of euro in the past number of years to have the capacity to deal with the timber that is available in huge quanta all over the country.  There is no problem with the availability of timber.  As the Deputy pointed out, much of it was planted in the 1980s and 1990s.  It is all there.  We have a great timber boom on our hands if we could only get the system to work.  The industry has put in the investment and it has the expertise.  The industry is very willing to adopt the new environmental regime, albeit that it brings with it new and additional costs and new burdens on the industry, but we are in the 21st century and we need to have rigorous environmental regulation and controls.</p> <p>  In terms of the percentage of broadleaves, that is somewhat of a million dollar question in terms of future policy.  What we have to do is balance the commercial side with the native woodland.  At the moment the vast bulk of broadleaves that are planted in this country are planted alongside commercial productive forests.  In effect, one could say that the commercial pays for the broadleaves.  I believe one would have to take a landscape approach to that.  There are certain places where it is absolutely right to have commercial productive forests and in other places it is absolutely right to have native broadleaf forests, those that are developed principally for nature purposes.  Already, approximately 25% of the Coillte estate is managed primarily for nature purposes and biodiversity.  At the moment we are doing more than 30% broadleaves.  Could we get that to 40% with the right model?  I believe we could.  Once we have the balance everything is achievable.  As an industry we support all types of forestry.  We are absolutely keen to push up the number of broadleaves being planted and the amount of native woodland being done as long as we can continue to supply timber to our sawmills, which in itself has huge environmental benefits in terms of locking up timber in our houses, structures and buildings because it is a long-life timber product.</p><p>That brings me to the scope for timber building.  We need some reform of our building regulations.  There are restrictions on the height to which a residential building can be built with a timber frame.  Those regulations need to be looked at.  There are 18-storey buildings in Norway and a new record is going to be set shortly in Canada.  We need to look at that.<br/><br/>I would also look at things such as schools and community centres that could readily be built using timber technology and displace an awful lot of carbon-intensive materials.  I read a report recently which stated that, with energy efficiency in our heating and lighting and where we get our energy from, much more focus is coming onto the embedded carbon in the building, the amount of carbon that is used in the materials.  The focus is coming back onto that after many years during which we, quite rightly, thought that the energy efficiency of the building after it is built is the important thing.<br/><br/>The level of carbon sink is a function of the size of the forest estate.  This country has an ambition to have 18% forest cover.  It would take us a very long time to get there but if we could do 8,000 ha per annum and grow the forest estate, that would be the principal source of carbon sink.  It must be well managed and looked at over a proper timeline, rather than taking snapshots here or there.  Climate change is a multigenerational crisis that needs to be looked at over hundreds, rather than dozens, of years.  A large forest estate must be managed properly.  Separate parts of the estate should be managed for different reasons and that is how to tackle the carbon sink issue.<br/><br/>A number of the Deputies touched on appeals and licensing delays.  The legislative change was focused on the forestry appeals committee, FAC.  There is no question but that it is a critical piece of legislation.  It is also a good piece of legislation from many perspectives and, if properly implemented, would deliver an enormous amount for us.  On the other hand, there are 2,000 files stuck in the Department that we need to deal with.  That is a question of resources, management and running a good process.<br/><br/>Deputy Fitzmaurice asked about the Mackinnon report.  It is my understanding that a person was identified and is close to being appointed.  That would be a positive development.  If all 22 recommendations of the Mackinnon report could be implemented, it would do a lot for us, although there seems to be some sort of reluctance.  The Minister wrote to the various stakeholders yesterday and today to invite us onto a new committee which will probably look at the Mackinnon report but I do not feel there is a focus on it now.  The Department would say that a lot of those recommendations have been implemented but I am not so sure about that.  There is a need for fundamental change in the process and system.  There is certainly a need to bring in additional management and operational expertise.  We need a group of people who can purely focus on running the process, aside from policy.<br/><br/>In response to Deputy Leddin, the best formulation of the need for long-term reforms was made by Professor John FitzGerald recently in <i>The Irish Times </i>where he wrote about  moving away from a licensing model towards a regulatory model.  That is the way it is done in other countries.  There is no need for every piece of forestry activity to get a new licence and to be inspected many times over, in the same way that we do not need a garda on every street corner with a speed gun.  We do not need forensic examination of every piece of forestry activity.  It can be done on an audit or inspection basis.  That would be a critical piece of work that the Department and Minister should start into straightaway.  They should look to European models to see how forestry in regulated in other places.<br/><br/>Does that deal with most of the questions that were asked?</p></speech>

I thank our contributors for their informative statements.  It is obvious where we are with the forestry sector.  There has been a major lack of progress.</p><p>Part of it has been addressed in terms how the FAC works.  How we can get the Department to work with that legislation is the next matter to be dealt with.  Trying to move things forward and to get the figures and processes through will be a major issue.  I visited Grainger Sawmills in Enniskeane a few months ago and saw the issues faced there.  It needed plant and timber. Without licences, I am very much aware that jobs in west Cork will be affected.</p><p> How can this committee play a role?  Do we need to ask for a monthly update on the figures, how many licences have been granted and how many tenders are coming through?  A continuous flow of information on a monthly basis coming through the committee could put pressure on the Department to deliver.  Should we set goals?  We do not have a public accounts committee that can work on this issue.  Should this committee act as a public accounts committee for the next 12 months to make sure that we get the streamline of timber which is so badly needed to ensure we can keep our mills open and the whole process going?  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses as to whether we should look for a direct line once a month to get figures, data and information what has increased and decreased from the Minister so there can be true accountability.</p></speech>

We are all in agreement that the forestry industry is in trouble and that the system is not delivering and needs complete reform.  All of this means our timber mills are running out of time.  The afforestation programme is close to being on its knees.</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned the backlog in licenses.  Apart from the slow pace in the Department in terms of how it operates, could they outline the issues they see arising?  Is bureaucracy regarding assessments slowing things down?  At the previous meeting of the committee, we heard about licences that cover the overall development of a project plantation and not just the individual parts, something that was mentioned again today.  Do the witnesses see any potential problems with this way of doing things?  They spoke about the need to reform the FAC and said it will take many months for most of the backlog to be dealt with.  What proposals do the witnesses have to allow this to happen more quickly?  Is it a matter of staffing or are there other problems in the system?</p> <p>  The witnesses spoke about the appeals process and how it needs to be rigorous and fair.  Can they tell us about the unfairness in the process?  Are they of the view that there is active discrimination between larger and smaller applicants in the licensing system?</p> <p>  A small forestry group contacted me recently.  It stated that the rate at which licences are being issued makes the aim of 8,000 ha of afforestation annually impossible.  Is that the view of the witnesses?</p></speech>

Forestry policy is a complete and utter mess and an embarrassment.  There are no winners because nothing is working.  Until this issue is resolved, anyone who wants to plant will run a mile.  Over the past number of weeks, I have said in the D&aacute;il that perhaps only 2,000 ha will be planted.  The Government's target is 8,000 ha.  That is proof of how bad things are at present.  An amnesty may be a simple solution for the 2,000 people who are seeking felling licences.  If there is an issue with the Department and it has not been able to deal with it, an amnesty is the way forward.  The board should be cleared and things should start anew.</p> <p>  The forest of a lady in west Cork was knocked down by a storm and is rotting on the ground.  She cannot get a licence.  That is how wrong the system is.</p><p>Obviously, there is concern about the threat to more than 500 jobs in the sector in west Cork, including in sawmills such as GP Wood and Grainger's.  These workers are geographically spread throughout west Cork from Enniskean suppliers in Ballineen all the way to Schull.  Their jobs are in danger.  We must focus on those companies and on those who are supplying the product.  A simple solution would be an amnesty.  It would not please everybody but the people on the ground who are suffering should not be allowed to continue to suffer.  Companies such as GP Wood and others would at least have some solution and then the issue could be tackled moving on from that.  That is my proposal.</p></speech>

I will address my questions specifically to Mr. McAuley.  There was much talk of the Mackinnon report during the deliberations on the forestry Bill.  We did not get very far on Committee Stage of that Bill.  Certainly it was the intention of some of us to speak more comprehensively to the 22 recommendations of the report in the amendments we had tabled to the Bill but, unfortunately, that did not happen.</p> <p>  I am worried about what Mr. McAuley said about the invitation he received to come before the Department as part of a stakeholder group.  If I understood him correctly, he said he was not sure if there would be a focus on the Mackinnon report.  As Deputy Fitzmaurice said, I tabled a parliamentary question some weeks ago in respect of the chair of the implementation group of the recommendations of that report.  Many of us put much stock on that report and its recommendations as a way forward whereby all stakeholders could move with both State interests and stakeholder interests.  Is it Mr. McAuley's impression it is the intention of the Department to lessen the impact of that report in some way or not give it its due regard?  I do not wish to put words in his mouth and forgive me if I have misinterpreted him but is it his view that the report has ended up on shelf and will gather dust?  If that is the case, it would worry me considerably because I would have thought many forestry stakeholders would have actively participated in that process and that it would have provided a template to move forward and progress matters we are discussing here today.</p></speech>

Mr. McAuley stated 1 million tonnes of timber are held up in the forestry aid committee, FAC.  Has he any indication if the recent Bill is having any effect in releasing any of that timber?</p><p>Has Mr. McAuley any knowledge as to how much is involved in total felling licences?  Metaphorically, the house is on fire because there is no timber for the mills.  Has Mr. McAuley any idea of the volume of timber held up in the Department in terms of felling?  I understand the problem here is the ecological assessments.  Has he a proposal as to how they might be speeded up?  Unlike Deputy Collins, I do not think there is any magic wand here.  An amnesty cannot be granted.  We would be brought eventually to the European Court of Justice if we were not to comply completely with European law.  One of the reasons this process has been held up is that there was a court case which directed that extra processes must be followed.  Therefore, there is no shortcut. <b></b>Is &eacute; an b&oacute;thar &aacute;rd an b&oacute;thar gear anseo.  The high road is the short road here.  Would Mr. McAuley agree with me?  </p><p>How dependent are the big sawmills on Sitka spruce or coniferous timber now?  How likely are they to continue to be dependent mainly on Sitka spruce and other coniferous timber as opposed to broadleaf trees? </p><p>To keep the sector going until Christmas what extra timber would need to be cleared through the system?  Allowing for the fact that much of it could be subject to appeal, getting it through the Department would be a help but it would not answer the problem if it was all appealed.</p><p>What net extra timber needs to be put back into the system between 1 January and 30 June next year to keep all the mills open and people employed?</p><p> I would be interested in the witnesses giving more information on how a regulatory system would work and how, as opposed to the licensing system, it could be kept immune from legal challenge.  Anything that would be open to legal challenge would bring us back to where we are now.  Should the current system be improved or should a new system that might be open to legal challenge and spending years in the courts, thereby holding everything up, be started?  I am conscious that EU directives ultimately control everything.  They are superior to the Irish Constitution and laws.</p></speech>

I appreciate the witnesses' participation.  I will tell them directly that there should be nothing in this debate that is us against them or <i>vice versa</i>.  We should all pull together.  When I say &quot;we&quot;, I mean officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and people involved in the forestry sector.  I mean politicians, foresters, farmers, people who cut the timber and people who haul the timber.  We should all be working together to try to ensure that we are not the laughing stock of Europe by allowing timber to be brought in from Scotland, England and Russia.  Our carbon footprint has been mentioned.  We can show others around the world how to grow timber quickly, efficiently and in a financially wise way.  It is good for our landowners who grow the crop.  We should be able to lead and show the rest of the world how to follow.</p><p>The Chairman is a man of great common sense and practicality, and I like to think I am too.  At the end of the day, this is a simple issue.  We have farmers who are growing a crop and who want to thin or clearfell it and make roads for access.  We have great and respectable haulage contractors involved in this operation.  We have excellent mills and millers, many of whom I know.  I was proud to have given years to cutting timber in a forestry.  My employer was Grainger Sawmills and I was grateful for every lorry of timber that I sent out of forestries.  I worked with great people from east Cork and elsewhere who knew how to put down a long and hard day's work.</p><p>What I cannot get my head around is the bureaucracy that seems to be tying up everything.  I am not a person for pointing fingers or taking things apart and asking what is wrong with the Department or inside officialdom, but it is not the farmer or haulier or the person operating the mill who is wrong.  Rather, it is down to the bureaucracy that gives a person permission to thin or clearfell timber legally, make the necessary roads and so on.  The committee could do a great job of work in this regard, which is why I appreciate my few short minutes to contribute.  There is no point in the world in blaming a Minister.  That would be nonsense.  I have nothing but respect for the new Minister and Ministers of State in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and I wish them good luck in their roles.  The permanent government in officialdom is dealing with this issue and I want to know what it will do.  I am not directing this question at any one person but at those people in general.  What I am saying in a nice and polite way is that what has happened in the past will not be tolerated in the future.  I know I can speak on behalf of every politician who is present, as politicians will not put up with or allow officialdom to choke and hold up our farmers, destroy our haulage industry and make us the laughing stock of Europe.  Our mills have spent millions of euro on developing major production capabilities and have excellent sawmills and staff, and we as politicians cannot sit back and allow this situation to continue next year and the year after, and allow forestries to go mad.</p><p>I am saying this in the nicest possible way.  I am not blaming anyone for what happened previously.  At times, any of us might need to be told to up our game.  I am telling that to the people in officialdom.  What happened previously will not be allowed to continue into the future.  It is finishing now.  The witnesses saw what happened when this matter was debated in the D&aacute;il in recent weeks.  Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Independents were excellent and everyone fought their case.  We would have liked it had other amendments been made and for matters to go further, but that is democracy.  We all came together and legislation was introduced.  There is a new impetus now and everyone will have to pull up their socks.</p></speech>

Since our time is restricted due to Covid, I would like brief answers.  Given that many comprehensive questions have been asked, I would like it if the witnesses could send us written answers to some of them.  Detailed and pertinent questions have been asked and, in normal times, I would be able to let the meeting extend beyond two hours, but I will have to stop witnesses in a few minutes' time to let in the next witness.</p></speech>

One of the major problems with the process is the lack of a timeline for anything.  That is why we are looking at one year, two years or two years plus for the issuing of a licence.  There is no accountability and there is no yardstick against which the forest service can be measured.  What the Senator suggested would be very important.  A farmer's charter could also be considered.  It formed part of the Mackinnon report.  The question of timelines and a farmer's charter were raised in the context of the basic payment scheme, BPS, years ago, streamlining that process significantly.</p> <p>  I will make a final comment before Mr. McAuley deals with the rest of the questions.  Deputy Sherlock spoke about the Mackinnon report.  To be perfectly honest, I believe it has been buried.  That may be an inflammatory comment, but this situation has been going on for too long.  The person was identified eight months ago but has not been appointed yet.  That is not good.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.50" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark McAuley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020110300002#Q00300"><p>I echo Mr. O'Brien's comments on Senator Lombard's suggestion.  It is a good one.</p> <p>  Regarding Deputy Browne's questions on increasing the FAC's output, if we could get the FAC's members to implement the legislation on the ground, it would go a very long way towards increasing output and solving the forestry appeals issue.  It is good legislation and is capable of solving the problems.  The Department has told us that resources will not be left wanting and that, if the FAC needs more people, it will have them, but it will have to get the process right in order to make use of them.</p> <p>  The issue of large versus small applicants is a complex one, but I will be brief.  Currently, small applicants to the forestry programme are at a definite disadvantage because a large activity can afford to pay for a Natura impact statement and a small one cannot, given the sums of money involved.  A clear gap in the Department's approach is the question of what to do, particularly for farm forestry.</p><p>In a farm forestry project, neither the farmer nor the forestry company is in a position to pay for this Natura impact statement.  Something has to be done there or farm forestry is dead.</p><p> In respect of the 8,000 ha, it is impossible to do without changing the system.  As Deputy Collins and Senator Daly mentioned earlier, farmer confidence is critical in all of this.  It is a 40-year investment and there have to be reassurances that if, for example, frost, fire or wind damage occur, the Department and the Government have their backs because otherwise the whole thing is too full of risks.  There has to be confidence that there is not going to be a moving of the goalposts, which has happened previously in the context of mapping and all of these sorts of things.  Therefore, farmer confidence is critical.</p><p> On the issue of an amnesty, I am not able to respond because that is really a legal question.  I certainly believe that the Department has grave concerns regarding the idea, but I do not know about that.  My colleague spoke to Deputy Sherlock and, just to clarify, the old forestry programme implementation group has been wound up.  There will be a new group going forward.  As I said, I do not know whether that focus is going to be on MacKinnon or on a range of other things.  I do not know whether MacKinnon is still alive and well.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Mc Auley and Mr. O'Brien for their contributions.  They saw, in light of the extensive number of questions, that there is huge concern among the members about where the forestry industry is at present.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Gowran, CEO of Woodlands of Ireland, to make his opening statement.  Sorry, we cannot hear Mr. Gowran.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.53" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Gowran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2020110300002#R00300"><p>Apologies, I forgot to unmute the microphone.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and the members for inviting Woodlands of Ireland to address the committee.  Woodlands of Ireland is a not-for-profit charity dedicated to native woodlands.  It is an inclusive organisation, whose primary objectives are to generate awareness of native woodlands among policymakers and the general public and to develop projects and sustainable management strategies aimed at ensuring the future viability of native woodlands.</p> <p>  As regards the appropriate assessment and the Natura impact statement appeals backlog, many site applications relating to the native woodland scheme, NWS, afforestation that contain significant sub-compartments with native woodland grant premium category, GPC, plots within larger applications, are being delayed by a very thorough rate of appeals.  We have asked the Forestry Service whether codes could be applied in order to indicate the percentage of NWS GPCs in each application.  We believe that the people lodging appeals will respond to that distinction being made.</p> <p>  The factors that have compounded the appropriate assessment and the Natura impact statement backlog situation are linked to genuine efforts by various Departments and agencies, including the Department for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to significantly improve compliance with the water framework directive, WFD.  Hence the need for appropriate assessment screening and Natura impact statements in respect of a range of sites where previously the cycle of forestry activity and practices, such as clear felling and pesticide use in reafforestation, had predated the State&rsquo;s now focused implementation of the WFD, which is an umbrella encompassing 17 different EU directives, including the habitats and birds directive.</p> <p>  As regards the WFD and the timescale for reform and the implementation of such reform in the forestry sector, the deadline for all EU member states, including Ireland, to comply fully with the WFD, is 2027.</p><p>Many of the points in the written submission, which all members should have, have been made by forestry industry representatives.</p><p> Most conifer stands are designed to be clear-felled or can be too unstable to thin because of soil type and shallow rooting.  Rotation lengths have in some cases been reduced to as low as 27 years.  Clear-felling often creates conditions for surges in pine weevil populations, which in turn present a ring-barking threat to restocked plants.  In most cases, plants are treated with pesticide and may later have top-up spray treatments on site.</p><p> Each individual harvesting and reforestation plan detailed in a felling licence application requires an assessment by the Forest Service which in turn may need to consult local authorities, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, Inland Fisheries Ireland and An Taisce.  The frequently asked questions of all of those organisations and those lodging appeals are as follows.  Can siltation be avoided?  What form does a new or improved water setback take?  Is there run-off or leaching of fertiliser or pesticides into water courses?  Does the plan meet the 15% broadleaf restock requirement of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine?  Is there sufficient enforcement of licence terms following on-site inspections over time? </p><p> What I am suggesting as a part solution to move towards better planning in forestry is to consider developing what we call protective forest zoning.  Many forest sites are in upland areas and will invariably drain into river catchments.  Consequently, they should be regarded as potential components of a network of protective forests within catchments.  This concept originated on the European mainland, for example, in countries such as Switzerland, it dates back to the 14th century.  However, in an island of Ireland context, the function of a protective forest could be the protection of drinking water sources, Natura 2000 sites and fisheries, and the repair of woodlands, which would come into the dairy sector's response in the carbon accounting equation.  Repairing woodlands would also reduce habitat fragmentation along water courses.</p><p> As regards forests that are designed to reduce the risk of flooding and landslide and also, in their own right, to maintain woodland habitats for conserving biological diversity, this concept of protective forests links in with the objectives of the national technical implementation group, NTIG, of the river basin management plan.  Much of this is outlined in two documents published by the Department entitled Woodland for Water: Creating new native woodlands to protect and enhance Ireland&rsquo;s waters and Forests &amp;amp; Water: Achieving Objectives under Ireland's River Basin Management Plan 2018-2021.  The idea in these documents is "to provide the basis for identifying key locations where new native woodland will contribute most to protecting and enhancing water, and for engaging with farmers and other landowners to undertake such planting."</p><p> In Woodlands of Ireland, our technical advisory panel is looking at developing the criteria for a research project on mapping potential protective forest zones in catchments.  Essentially, we are offering a part solution in terms of whether that will go forward into proposed legislation, as mentioned by a previous speaker.</p><p> On the issue of ash dieback, there are two key points.  A reference was made in last week's meeting of the committee to elm having become extinct and ash going the same way.  Elm, although a shadow of its former self, survives in semi-natural woodland and in hedges in a range of localities around the island, as I have observed.  In the 5% survival scenario for ash, it is likely to remain present in mixed species woodland, scrub and hedges.  The natural regeneration of ash and elm needs to be encouraged to keep these species alive.  This can be done in the context of native woodland scheme conservation measures, woodland improvement measures, the neighbourwood scheme, continuous cover forestry schemes and agri-environment measures.</p><p>Second, let us consider supporting those who were under contract with the Department to plant single species or a few species such as ash stands to convert them to multi-species stands of indigenous genetic stock of native species, including Scots pine, using an amended version of the under-utilised native woodland scheme conservation measure.  The target in the native woodland scheme conservation measure was 1,950 ha of funding for the period 2014 to 2020.  By the end of this year it looks as though significantly less than 200 ha of that funding will be allocated.  We suggest an amended version of that to assist those who were in that ash dieback situation.  Those are my key points.</p></speech>

There is much in what we have heard today, both in terms of the forestry industry but also regarding the alternative position.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Gowran for his contribution.  On his position with regard to the mix we have seen, the central proposition put to us from a number of different areas is that we are planting the wrong type of trees in the wrong places.  Does he have a view on that?  Is there something we can do at a holistic level in terms of departmental policy to try to get the balance right so that the right type of tree is planted in the right places?</p> <p>  I asked the previous representatives if they had a view on specific targets we should meet with regard to conifer and broadleaf.  Does Mr. Gowran have a view on what would be the most appropriate percentage that should be set?</p> <p>  Mr. Gowran referenced previously that clear felling requires the use of pesticides to prevent disease.  Does he have a view as to whether we could be better at ensuring that the mix of broadleaf, not just in terms of per plantation because that often means that all the broadleaf are planted in one particular area and then we have extensive conifer plantations, would result in less clear felling?  Would that have a knock-on effect in that there would be less need for pesticides?  I am sure that is an issue that would be of interest to many because it could potentially reduce the cost.</p> <p>  With regard to Mr. Gowran's reference to last week's committee meeting, I note his comments relating to the prospects for the ash plant were a little more optimistic.  They are a world apart from the evidence we heard previously.  I ask him to go into more detail on the types of measures that would be required to save the ash if it is his position that the ash can be saved.  What type of measures are required and what level of success does he believe is possible to attain?  Following on from last week's, it is clear that there will be a massive reduction ash.  Is there scope also to increase the presence that he mentioned is a shadow of its former self?  Is there something we can do in that regard?</p></speech>

We are importing timber.  One organisation has called that a national embarrassment but the entire lot from start to finish is an embarrassment.  We have an opportunity now to get this right.  I will say it straight out, and I said it in the Chamber during the discussion on the legislation, the forestry Bill could have gone much further.  It could have closed a loophole in terms of the relevant person piece that was in the draft legislation but subsequently taken out of the forestry Bill.  I firmly believe that had that been left in we would not have a situation where people who live 200 to 300 miles away from an area can continue to object.  I would like to hear Mr. Gowran's views on that particular point.</p><p> He mentioned the water framework directive and suggested that that is slowing down the screening and assessment process within the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  My understanding, however, from engaging with a number of experts involved in forestry is that there is a lack of expertise in that Department to move on these applications, licences and appeals quickly.  There is a problem in terms of the appeals process and a lack of expertise.  What is Mr. Gowran's view on that?  Does he believe we need to recruit more people with expertise in forestry related matters?  I am hearing that there is a need in that regard.</p><p> We have to act quickly on this.  We have to be pragmatic and ensure we get this right from start to finish.  There is a need for a strong forestry policy because we have not had one but we must ensure that that forestry policy is not aspirational.  We have to ensure that it does justice to the industry and that it protects jobs.  We must also make sure that we are meeting climate action targets but because forestry is in the mess it is in today we will not meet climate action targets and we will see job losses.  We have seen job losses.  I know of sawmills that have been ground to a halt.  I know of timber harvesting companies that are absolutely struggling.  It has been said to me by contractors, hauliers and sawmills, that they cannot see themselves continuing beyond Christmas.  </p><p> We have to take urgent action and that urgent action should start in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure that the right people with the right expertise are put in to do the screening and to ensure that the process moves quickly.  We have to protect this industry.  It is a very important industry in Ireland and we need to do everything in our power to protect those jobs, and the industry.</p></speech>

I will be brief as I know the Chairman is under a time constraint.  I want to get more feedback from Mr. Gowran on a point Deputy Carthy raised.  It relates to ash dieback and how he believes that situation has been handled to date.  What could have been done better?  What should have been done and what needs to be done now?  I asked the previous witnesses, based on their submission, about the damage to farmer enthusiasm or the brand that is the species of ash.  How could any farmer in his or her right mind be encouraged to plant ash based on what he or she has seen, the problems associated with the ash dieback disease and how it was or was not handled?  Deputy Carthy touched on that also but Mr. Gowran might elaborate on it.</p> <p>  To go back to our licensing process, the backlog in licensing is affecting when and if people do their thinning.  What is Mr. Gowran's view of a forestry project, how it is affected, its longevity and its overall quantity and quality if it is not thinned at the right time or not thinned out at all?  I am aware some people are skipping the opportunity to thin.  They are having to deal with so much hassle and bureaucracy to get a licence to get in and do it that they are not thinning when they should do so.  How detrimental is that to the overall output at the end of the project if the forest is not thinned properly and at the correct point in time in its development?</p></speech>

What I propose in the context of the protected forest zone would only solve part of the problem.  It will, however, solve the most sensitive part, namely, in respect of those areas where the forest service seeks Natura impact statements.  That would also eliminate or massively reduce the requirement to treat plants in reafforestation with pesticides, which have appeared in water sampling done by the EPA in recent times.  Also, in order to promote a stronger shift to hardwoods, we need more research in respect of hardwood products.  Training is required.  This links to ash dieback disease.  We need more focus on managing existing woodlands, not just broadleaf species but also in the context of thinning conifer crops.</p> <p>  The main way that ash will survive, apart from producing a plant - testing is being done to find a strain of ash tree that is resistant to dieback, which may happen in time - will be through the management of existing woodlands to create conditions for the natural regeneration of ash trees.  I cannot give the precise proof on this right now but it is likely that natural regeneration will be more resistant to disease over time.  I do not disagree with the 5% survival scenario.  By that I mean that only 5% of the ash trees we have now may survive into the future.  We must make sure that an amount of the species is encouraged to survive in existing woodlands.  That is essentially the point.</p></speech>

Contractors and a range of stakeholders are involved on the panel.  Through that, we form expert committees on different subjects.  We concentrate on the technical aspects of native woodlands and how that relates to the overall forestry and try to provide technical solutions or show ways to make changes to and reform existing schemes.  A range of different people engage with Woodlands of Ireland and then communicate to the funders changes that can happen plus how they might come about.</p></speech>

I ask him to speak to an issue that has not been touched on so far.  If he cannot, that is fair enough. Last August, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Senator Pippa Hackett, announced the woodland creation on public lands scheme.  How does Mr. Gowran view the potential for the scheme?  What are his thoughts on how Departments or other State bodies might be persuaded to avail of the scheme so that there is a significant uptake of the development of broadleaf native forestry on public lands?</p></speech>

Training days will be provided to promote the scheme to owners of public lands.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is enthusiastic and is considering putting a number of sites under the scheme and, as far as I know, have one site up and running.  I hope that there is uptake by local authorities, various public bodies and even some of land banks owned by IDA Ireland, for example.  The new scheme is at a very early stage.  As I am not directly employed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I am not sure what the full degree of uptake is or the full degree of response by the public sector so far.</p><p>Is Mr. Gowran positive about the potential of the scheme, accepting that he is not directly involved?</p></speech>

What kind of acreage is he talking about in that regard?</p> <p>  On ash dieback, we were told at our previous meeting that ash is gone.  It is good to hear somebody else with something different to say to us.  Mr. Gowran mentioned a figure of 5%, which can be built upon.  What solution has he for rebuilding our native ash stock other than opting for a different species?</p></speech>

The logs should be removed, to a diameter of 5 cm, for craft wood or fuel, and the remaining lighter branches and leaf litter should be burned from the following September onwards to allow for the bird and mammal nesting season.</p> <p>  The initial response to ash dieback was to remove the stand entirely and burn or bury all of it on site.  The indications are now that it is better to deal with trees as they become diseased.  From an economic point of view, that will not suit many owners because, in some cases, they have a high percentage of diseased trees.  This is why I suggest examining one of the underutilised schemes such as the native woodland conservation scheme and converting the stands into multispecies stands.  In the long run, funding the landowner to do that would be the best approach.  Within the stands, there is the possibility of a certain amount of ash regenerating.  More mature trees tend to show less dieback, from observation.  We may get seed from them that will regenerate into the new multispecies stands.  In multispecies stands, the spread of disease is slowed down to some extent and there is a greater possibility of creating shelter to protect the ash.  There would still be a high percentage of deaths in ash, however.</p></speech>

With regard to screening and assessments associated with felling licence appeals, Mr. Gowran made the point that the EU water framework directive is slowing things down.  Does he believe, however, that other factors are at play?  With regard to forestry expertise in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, does he believe there is a need for the Department to recruit more staff?</p><p>Mr. Gowran works closely with the Department and knows what it is doing.  He spoke about what is slowing down the appeals process but I understand there are a number of factors at play.  What is Mr. Gowran's view on that?  Is there a need for more staff with more expertise in this area?</p></speech>

There is a need for more expertise.  For example, because of the current backlog there is no processing of native woodland conservation applications.  Yes, it would be good to have greater recruitment of people with environmental science qualifications and more fire service inspectors as well.  They need quite a number of additional staff.</p></speech>

My speech was originally a bit longer, so I will try to skim through some of the elements of it.  I thank the committee for the invitation to speak about my priorities, and I thank my officials for joining me.</p> <p> As the committee will be aware, there is new expanded remit in the Department, encompassing equality matters previously under the remit of the Department of Justice, and subsequently, disability service provision, which is currently under the Department of Health.  The Department will address some of the key social issues that Ireland faces in one single Department.  A common strand across all the areas that we will address is vulnerability, and people who, historically, have been marginalised from the political process.  My intention as Minister is to act as much as I can as a voice for those people at the Cabinet table.</p> <p>  I will begin with the early years sector.  This year has been one of significant pressure and challenge for the sector.  The entire sector was closed at short notice in March 2020, but it was one of the first to reopen in the summer.  I pay tribute all those in this sector for their work in supporting the reopening, and particularly for their work in continuing to remain open during the current level 5 restrictions.  It is the work of providers and childcare professionals that has allowed this to be possible.</p> <p>  Throughout this time, my Department and the Government have put in place a range of supports for the sector, most extensively, through the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  The early years sector was the only one to receive an automatic inclusion to the EWSS up until 31 March, in recognition of the vital role played by the sector.  Originally, on average, the EWSS was covering 65% of wage costs for service providers.  Since the enhanced EWSS has been announced to coincide with level 5, that has increased to 81%, on average, of the wage costs of providers.  The State will provide the early years sector with an additional &euro;200 million in 2020 and an additional &euro;70 million in support up to March 31 2021.</p><p>The State will provide the early years sector with an additional &euro;200 million support in 2020, and up to 31 March 2021, an additional &euro;70 million in support.</p><p> Nevertheless, we all acknowledge that despite the significant support, pay and conditions in the sector do not reflect the significant burdens on childcare professionals.  This impacts on staff but also on children because high turnover rates mean the quality and continuity of care is not being delivered.  The 2019 data, which are the most recent available, show that the average wage is &euro;12.55 per hour, which we all know is insufficient.</p><p> The programme for Government commits us to creating a joint labour committee, JLC, in the sector that would lead to the drawing up of an employment regulation order, ERO, to determine minimum rates of pay, as well as terms and conditions.  I am working with SIPTU, and look forward to continuing to do so, and the new provider group, Early Childhood Ireland, as it works to advance a wage agreement on behalf of staff and providers.  I have also engaged with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation on the issue of sick pay for childcare staff, particularly in the context of the national sick pay scheme that is being actively discussed.  My Department will also consider the funding model and the workforce development plan - two ongoing pieces of work - to support and deliver better pay and conditions for childcare professionals in the sector.</p><p> We all also recognise that the costs of childcare for parents are too high.  The Government will take action to reduce costs substantially in a way that will impact and benefit all parents.  The proposals the expert group working on the funding model brings forward to address this issue will be important.  All options, including the capping of fees, are on the table for consideration as part of the resolution of that issue.  Targeting supports to the most disadvantaged children is fundamental to what my Department seeks to achieve.  There are a number of schemes in that regard, such as the early childhood and care and education, ECCE, scheme, which is universal; the access and inclusion model, AIM, which makes ECCE available to children with disabilities; and the national childcare scheme, NCS, which is designed in such a way to combat the poverty traps that have sometimes impacted long term on parents.</p><p> As members will be aware, we have discussed this issue in the House on a number of occasions, and there are sponsorship arrangements to provide for especially vulnerable children to allow them to access free early learning and care and school-age childcare.  Again, the expert group on the funding model is specifically examining how to target additional funding at the most disadvantaged, and I look forward to continue working to broaden that targeted funding further.</p><p> The area of equality has transferred to my Department from the Department of Justice, and much of this work focuses on the implementation of Government strategies dealing with equality in a range of specific vulnerable communities.  These strategies include the national strategy for women and girls, the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, the migrant integration strategy and the LGBTI+ inclusion strategy.  All these strategies work together to support sustainable development goal 10 by reducing inequality.  I will chair the meetings of each strategy and look forward to doing so.  I will be engaged with their oversight groups to ensure delivery of the goals set out in each strategy.  As some of the strategies near their conclusion, I will work on developing the successor strategy, considering in particular how we can achieve more substantive outcomes.  Key legislation in this area that I hope to continue to advance is the Gender Pay Gap Information Bill 2019.  I hope we can ensure this will be passed by next year at the latest and that it will be fully operational by 2022.  We are also considering the area of socio-economic discrimination as a new ground for discrimination under the Employment Equality Acts and the Equal Status Acts.  One of the main changes my Department will experience is the transfer of the issue of disability from both the Department of Health and the Department of Justice.  As a result, disability policy and disability service provision will be considered together in the same Department for the first time.  This gives us an opportunity to move from considering disability specifically as a health issue to a wider view encompassing all parts of people's lives.</p><p>One of the Department's key priorities will be to advance the implementation of the UNCRPD.  Our approach to meeting the terms of the convention is one of progressive realisation.  What this means in effect is that work is continuing apace on the reforms needed for an optimum level of compliance with the convention's requirements.  As we continue to advance the implementation of the convention, it is vital the Government hears the voices of persons who have lived experience of disability.  The experiences and perspectives of people with disabilities are paramount in developing policies and programmes that directly address the real needs in their lives.  We are establishing the disability participation and consultation network for this reason.  This is part of meeting our obligations under the convention.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, announced the establishment of this network in August and recently announced the successful applicants for both the organising member and the grant-funded members.  One of the body's first tasks will be to organise consultations for Ireland's first state report to the UN on our progress in implementing the convention.</p><p> The transfer of functions from the Department of Health in the field of disability involves a range of significant and complex transfer of function orders.  It envisages the transfer of responsibility for policy development and for oversight of the provision of health and personal social services for people with a disability, with the associated staff from the Department of Health, taking &euro;2 billion from the health Vote.  There will have to be new governance arrangements, particularly in respect of the relationship between my Department and the HSE, and this will require amendments to the health Acts.  Work is ongoing between officials in my Department and the Department of Health and we are looking to have a final transfer date in quarter 1 of 2021.  In the interim, the Minister for Health retains statutory responsibility for disability matters.</p><p> As the committee will be aware, the programme for Government commits to ending direct provision within the lifetime of the Government and replacing it with a new system of international protection accommodation centred on a not-for-profit approach.  Dr. Catherine Day's advisory group has reported in recent weeks, and the Minister for Justice and I presented that report to the Government and subsequently published it.  The report was very clear in agreeing with the Government's position that direct provision is not fit for purpose and needs to be replaced.  This will be done through a White Paper, which is being worked on currently, led by my Department but with engagement from a range of Departments, with a view to bringing forward the White Paper by the end of this year.  I have always acknowledged that this would be a complex and difficult piece of work, but it is absolutely essential we have a system of accommodation rooted in human rights that respects the dignity of people awaiting assessments here.  We also announced a number of short-term measures, including bringing HIQA in to carry out inspections of existing direct provision centres and introducing vulnerability assessments for new applicants as they arrive.  We will work with civil society as well as Government agencies to make sure we bring everyone on board on this very significant and necessary change.</p><p> When I started as Minister one of the priorities I identified - I think it is one shared by every member of this committee - is tackling child poverty.  We all recognise that growing up in a marginalised and disadvantaged community, experiencing intergenerational cycles of poverty, educational disadvantage and unemployment, seriously hinders the life prospects and opportunities of a child or young person.  In the programme for Government we commit to implementing a successor to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  A focus on child poverty will be a key component of the successor strategy.  I recently outlined in the D&aacute;il that I am committed to establishing a new, ambitious target of child poverty reduction, and this will form a central element of the successor to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.  However, the target in itself is not enough; we need the means, the structure and the will to deliver on this.  As part of the strategy, therefore, we will set out new infrastructure not only within my Department but also across government for the delivery of our child poverty reduction goals.  We will have mid-term targets as well as the final target and we will have monitoring mechanisms put in place so we are able not only to monitor progress but also to address any slippage that occurs in achieving our targets.  As I said, we will set this ambitious target in the successor strategy to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures.</p><p>When I attended a meeting of the select committee a number of weeks ago, every member highlighted the issue of youth work, the great work done by these services during the pandemic and the need to support the sector.  I listened closely to what was being said.  We have committed to an additional &euro;5 million investment in youth work next year, which was even more than the sector itself sought.  This is to recognise the importance of the work the sector has done to support young people in recent months and years.  This year, we have provided a number of small grants for current and capital ICT spending so youth groups can manage and obtain infrastructure for themselves to deal with Covid.  We are always looking at youth work targeted services, which help those young people in areas of greatest disadvantage, and universal services, to ensure every child and young person who wants to be involved in youth work has an opportunity to do so.</p><p> Tusla is the largest single area of expenditure for the Department and, in recent years, it is well-known that its budget has been under pressure due to various demand-led pressures.  This year, I have prioritised resourcing for the agency to ensure it can fulfil its statutory responsibilities and support some of the most vulnerable children and families in our society.  I increased its allocation by &euro;61 million this year to &euro;878 million for 2021.  This is a 7% increase in Tusla's budget and it is the largest budget increase it has ever received.  This is to underline the Government's commitment to supporting the agency to meet that obligation to the most vulnerable in society.  It will allow us to do a range of things but key is tackling the demand-led cost pressures regarding the provision of children's residential care, increasing staff allocations to front door referrals and safety planning in order that we can reduce the number of unallocated cases and provide care and protection through quality services for the victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  It will also allow us to fulfil our international commitments with regard to taking unaccompanied minors from Greece and other places as quickly as possible, and will also allow Tusla to undertake its new role as the custodian of the database of the mother and baby homes commission.  I am very proud to support Tusla in supporting the most vulnerable in our society in the midst of the pandemic.</p><p> The legislation to protect the database created by the commission of investigation of women and children who were in mother and baby homes has now become law.  We are all very aware of the significant issues raised during the debate about how we as a society and a Government respond to the legacy issues and the issues of institutional abuse that took place in Ireland.  Last Wednesday, the Cabinet had a very detailed meeting on these issues and set out a statement outlining a range of issues specifically on the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes and the Government's plan for a wider range of legacy issues.  I hope these measures, and the follow-up measures the Government will take, will start to rebuild trust between the Government and survivors' groups.</p><p> I have acknowledged in the D&aacute;il, and the Government recognises, that there is a need for more openness and transparency and for greater understanding and acknowledgement of the wishes of survivors.  I am engaged in meeting individuals and groups to start to rebuild that trust.  The Government made significant announcements indicating a willingness to progress with the national archive of records related to institutional abuse.  Such an archive could become a site of openness and truth telling for survivors and for the Irish people in general to understand what happened in these institutions and understand it in its wider context.</p><p> I am committed to bringing forward legislation in the near future on the exhumation and, as far as possible, the identification of the remains buried in Tuam and provide for their respectful reburial.  I am also committed to bringing forward legislation to address the issue of information and tracing, particularly for adopted people, in a way that puts the rights of adopted people at the centre of any legislation.</p><p>All of these legislative measures will require extensive scrutiny.  I look forward to working with members of this committee on how we develop that legislation.</p><p> As members will be aware, on Friday last my Department received the final report of the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes. The Government is committed to publishing it as soon as possible.  The report is currently under review by my Department and the Office of the Attorney General.  Additional resources were provided to the Office of the Attorney General to allow this review to be undertaken as quickly as possible.  I am determined, in light of the events of the last few weeks, to ensure that the State does right by the survivors of mother and baby homes, their families and anybody who has suffered as a result of institutional abuse that took place in this country.</p><p> I hope I have given the committee an indication of some of the priorities of my Department.  Given the wide remit of my Department, I cannot speak to every area in the time available.  I look forward to discussing these issues further with colleagues now and to working on advancing all of these issues over the next months and years.</p></speech>

I welcome his words in respect of rebuilding trust, particularly on the mother and baby homes issue.  I note his remarks during the passage of the legislation in respect of requesting this committee to have regard to this issue.  However, we are unclear what the Minister means by that.  It would be useful to have his perspective in that regard.  Underpinning all of that is the commitment by the Minister in regard to the information and tracing Bill.  When will that Bill come before us?  The GDPR issues are matters on which we also need to have the Minister's perspective.  We have received correspondence from Dr. Maeve O'Rourke on rights of access to information.  I am sure the Minister will be in possession of that same information.  </p> <p>  The Minister told us that he had met with survivors and groups.  I am sure they notified him of some legislative changes they seek in respect of the Civil Registration Act 2004, which would provide people with their birth certificate.  In the case of the Clann project and the data protection issues, I understand a Bill on access to historical care-related archives is being drafted.  </p> <p>  I am raising many issues to which I do not expect the Minister to respond fully today but I want to put them on the record.  On the issue of the interpretation of the GDPR, which we understand provides for access to information, and the information and tracing Bill, what are the timelines in that regard?  How important will the information and tracing Bill be in dealing with the mother and baby homes issue?  If it is to deal with the issues, the committee must see the Minister show good faith in respect of a throughput of work from a legislative point of view to ensure we do not end up hearing from stakeholders and then nothing happening after the fact.  We need to work with the Minister, the stakeholders and everybody else involved in this matter.  From a legislative point of view, we need to work in a process of partnership with all of the stakeholders to ensure the voices of the Maeve O'Rourke's and Claire McGettricks of this world are heard and that what they say is dealt with in a meaningful way so that we work through all of the issues.  I am sure other members will make similar points on this issue.  </p> <p>  Has the Minister given consideration to amending the Civil Registration Act 2004 to provide all adopted people with a birth certificate?  When will the commission's report be published?  I do not wish to deal with any of these issues until the committee has had sight of that report and read through its recommendations.</p><p>I also want to give more time to the GDPR considerations and the information and tracing Bill considerations because they are all vital if we, as a committee, are going to deal with this issue in a sympathetic and meaningful way.</p><p> These are general points.  I realise that the clock is ticking down.  I do not expect the Minister to reply completely in the one minute that is left but I am sure he will have an opportunity to do so in the course of proceedings.</p></speech>

He raised many valid points that we will tease out across this discussion.  As regards that legislative process, I believe the Deputy is right.  We need to see the commission's report.  That is why we have committed and put the resources in place to get it published as quickly as possible and every legislative step we take will be influenced by that.  I agree with him on that matter.  I would think the first legislation will be that relating to Tuam and the burials there.  I hope to be in a position to bring a memo to Government in November in that regard to get the heads of Bill agreed.  As soon as I get the heads of Bill agreed by Government, I will immediately write to the Chair of this committee and ask that she seek to allocate time for pre-legislative scrutiny.  That is the first piece of the legislative jigsaw I see coming to this committee.</p> <p>  I conceptualised the information and tracing legislation as a distinct item of legislation.  Last Friday, I met with the Adoption Rights Alliance.  I met with Dr. Katherine O'Donnell, Ms Claire McGettrick and Dr. Maeve O'Rourke to discuss this particular issue.  They see information and tracing as being linked to the issue of the archive and being dealt with in the form of an omnibus Bill.  I had envisioned it like that before.  Their draft Bill has been sent to my Department and we are reviewing it to see if that would be the best way to go or whether it is better to divide it into discrete areas as well.  That is being actively considered.  Either way, however, I want to see work on this being done in 2021.  I am absolutely determined to ensure that the issue of providing early birth information for adopted people and wider survivors of institutional abuse will be a key priority for my Department next year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.100" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020110300002#F00400"><p>I congratulate the Minister on the work plan.  It is a broad church of work and I look forward to working with him on it.  I particularly lobbied for the employment regulation order for the early years sector and I was delighted when it made the programme for Government.  I am particularly looking forward to the recognition of early years professionals.</p> <p>  Time is short so I want to address the recent mother and baby home legislation, which I willingly supported.  Survivors and their families have had a long time of hurt and they deserve that anything to do with them is treated with the utmost of care, consideration and respect.  I need to put on record that I am deeply disappointed and uncomfortable with the entirety of how the matter was handled, both in terms of the lack of consultation with survivors and the rushing of the legislation through the Houses.  I would like to establish what the Minister has learned from that experience and how we will work together and he will ensure that it does not happen again.  I want him to make sure that survivors' needs will be put front and centre from now on in any discussion he has regarding the mother and baby homes and those who survived them.</p> <p>  I respectfully submit that there are a number of priorities in this regard.  Will the Minister furnish us with a timeline for the publication of a report?  He equipped the Attorney General's office with additional personnel so its publication should be done without delay.  I have no doubt the content of the report will be distressing for survivors and, indeed, all who read and hear about it.  However, that phase of our history needs to be embraced in order for us to heal.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's commitment regarding the permanent archive.  I will welcome a timeline in the selection of a site so that survivors can have their names known, where they wish to, and their stories told in an officially sponsored capacity as soon as possible.  In my view, the Sean MacDermott Street plans look particularly exceptional.</p> <p>  The most important aspect of the rights of survivors is the right to their personal information and personal data.  The pain of a lack of access to the entirety of their past is the pain I heard in the last few weeks and the one that most came out to me.</p><p>The experience of knowing that information about oneself is locked away in a box that one cannot get access to must be excruciating.  I appreciate that there are competing rights and that there are needs in the public good, however, we also have an absolute need for transparency in that regard.</p><p> Last week, I called for the publication of the data protection impact assessments, DPIAs, carried out by both the Department and Tusla.  The most important message now is that survivors must be at the centre of all decision-making, including the application of the GDPR.  The Minister confirmed to me in the Seanad that Tusla and the Department are undertaking DPIAs in anticipation of receipt of the commission's documents.  I am urging Tusla and the Minister to publish these assessments for absolute transparency and to ensure survivors, their representatives and advocates know, in advance of submitting data subject access requests, how the necessary balance of all rights are engaged when such a request is being administered.  While the publication of DPIAs is not necessary under the GDPR, publishing them in this instance will strongly demonstrate the Government's commitment to ensuring that survivors are empowered to obtain the information if they so wish.  That should be done swiftly in order to bring people some comfort.  It is my firm belief that the application of GDPR may well arrest some of the issues in the here and now and may narrow down the issues in the creation of the information and tracing Bill and will bring about a swift resolution to some of the pain and hurt that is out there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.102" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020110300002#G00200"><p>I thank the Senator for those remarks.  Regarding the rush on the legislative side of things, from day one I acknowledged that this was not the way I wanted to proceed.  The sole reason for the rush was the need to get this legislation passed by the 30 October deadline to ensure we could protect the database.  That was the sole reason for the rush.  In all the items of legislation I have outlined, both orally and in the table provided to the committee, I see no need for rush.  I look forward to engaging with the committee in pre-legislative scrutiny, further scrutiny and strengthening future legislation through that process, which I believe the process does.</p> <p>  On the consultation, I have acknowledged and apologised for my failure to consult adequately with survivors' groups.  I am engaging, as I said already this week, to meet survivors' groups - both individual survivors and groups as well.  This will be an ongoing process which will inform how I address all of the legacy issues in future.</p> <p>  On the data protection issues, this ties in with what Deputy Sherlock was asking earlier.  The advice of the Attorney General on the application of the GDPR to the archive when it comes to my Department is significant.  I have committed that my Department will engage with the Data Protection Commissioner to flesh out the implications of that for my Department.  This will include how we will treat each individual data access request.  In the context of the DPIA which we had already done on the original Bill, now the Act, we will now need to broaden that DPIA out to consider this element of the application of the GDPR to the archive and the implications of the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004.  We will happily make that available; it is a living document, as I understand it.  I think we made a version of the DPIA available to Senators earlier in the process.  I am happy to engage with Tusla so that it might take a similar position as well.  I have already spoken to the chief executive of Tusla setting out some of the issues around the application of GDPR to this area.  We are very aware that in light of the Attorney General's advice, we need to go back to the Data Protection Commissioner and discuss the real-world implications of that advice for my Department, particularly when survivors are coming with their subject access requests, to ensure that we treat them in a dignified manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1469" speakername="Mark Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020110300002#H00100"><p>I thank the Minister.  I will allow him time to revert to me at the end of my couple of minutes.  I thank him for outlining his priorities and I look forward to discussing them over time, but, probably like everybody else here, I want to discuss the issue of the mother and baby homes that arose in the past couple of weeks.  I acknowledge all the people who contacted me and, I am sure, other members of the committee over recent weeks.  I took the time to get back to each and every one of them personally.  Many were from my constituency, Dublin Mid-West.  It was important to get back to the people personally because a lot of the faith and trust in public representation needed to be restored after the events of recent weeks.</p> <p>  I also acknowledge the Minister's statement that he needs more openness, transparency and understanding of the wishes of the survivors of the mother and baby homes.  That is fair enough but if the Government really wants to start rebuilding trust, it has to start examining the final report of the Mother and Baby Homes Commission of Investigation and the question of when it is to be published.  The Minister stated that the Department received the report on 30 October.  That is almost five days ago.  Survivors need to know when the report will be published.  Having to wait so long for it to be compiled and published only adds to the pain of survivors.  Survivors have to be central to the process and the Minister must ensure they have confidence in the report when it is published.  They have been waiting for decades for the full account of what happened in the institutions to be made public and for the abuse they suffered to be formally acknowledged.  Any undue delay is unacceptable.  I want to know the publication date of the report.  If there is to be a delay, how long will it be?</p> <p>  I am aware that others have asked some of my questions but it is important that I ask them on behalf of the people who got in touch with me.  What was the legal basis for proceeding with the Bill originally?  What advice did the Data Commissioner give the Minister, and when was it given?  What advice did the Attorney General give the Minister, and when was it given?  What were the exact dates on which the Minister met the Attorney General on this matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.104" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020110300002#H00200"><p>I thank Deputy Ward.  The entire Government is absolutely committed to publishing the report as soon as possible.  There is no desire to keep survivors of mother and baby homes and the county homes that were investigated waiting for the information one moment longer than is necessary.  What is necessary is that my Department and the Attorney General carefully scrutinise the report and make sure it does not have any consequences for ongoing Garda investigations.  It is necessary that there be nothing in it that would warrant its not being published or the redaction of any of it.  We want to publish the report in full as soon as possible.  It runs to 4,000 pages.  The report is an incredibly extensive and detailed piece of work so we want to scrutinise it.  We have, however, made extra resources available to make sure this can be done as quickly as possible.  The unanimous view of the members of the Government is that they want to provide this as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Ward and Senator Seery Keanery, I cannot give an exact publication date but everybody across Government is working to get this report published as quickly as possible.  Deputy Ward is right that doing so will be part of the process of rebuilding trust.  That is a process that is needed.</p> <p>  As regards the legal basis for the Bill, the need for the Bill emerged from the sixth interim report and queries raised by the commission of investigation itself.  It brought to the attention of the then Government the existence of the database, an incredibly valuable database linking thousands of women who had gone into mother and baby homes and their children who subsequently came out of them.  The commission highlighted its view that, under existing legislation, it would be forced to redact the personal information in the database - all the names - which would basically render the database useless.  The commission saw that the database would have genuine benefits in respect of the information and tracing purposes we discussed and advised that we needed legislation on that matter.</p><p>I have met the Attorney General about this Bill on a number of occasions since I became Minister and my officials have met with officials in the Attorney General's office.  I do not have the dates of those meetings to hand but I and my officials have met him on a number of occasions.</p><p> We engaged extensively with the Data Protection Commissioner on this particular issue.  We sent the draft data protection impact assessment to the commissioner in late September.  I think my officials had a meeting with the commissioner in early October at which she asked for one change to the impact assessment.  We made that change and the commissioner subsequently indicated that the commission was broadly satisfied with the data protection impact assessment.</p><p> On 19 October, the Data Protection Commissioner came back with a query.  It did not relate to the Bill that was passed.  It was about the interpretation of the Commission of Investigation Act 2004, whether it required an absolute sealing of the archive and that the general data protection regulations, GDPR, did not apply to the archive once it transferred to my Department.  As soon as we got that query from the commissioner, we referred it to the Office of the Attorney General.  The Attorney General gave oral advice to the Cabinet on 28 October, last Wednesday, and subsequently gave written advice to me.  We announced that written advice that evening to the effect that the Attorney General advised that GDPR did apply to the archive once it transferred to my Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.106" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1681" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020110300002#J00200"><p>The written statement that we have is slightly different to the statement that the Minister made at the outset.  In that written statement, he stated that he planned to examine the possibility of including a new discrimination ground of socioeconomic status in equality legislation.  I have advocated on this issue for many years and am concerned by the weakness of that commitment, in light of all the work and advocacy that has been conducted, particularly by the Minister's Department.  The issue has been the subject of reports from the Department of Justice since as far back as 2004 under the then Minister, Michael McDowell.  Deputy Jim O'Callaghan introduced a Private Members' Bill on the issue in 2017, in response to which the then Minister of State with responsibility for equality, immigration and integration, Deputy David Stanton, committed to undertaking extensive research that was scheduled to conclude this year.  At some point, we need to move from examining the possibilities to acting on the inclusion of socioeconomic status in our equality legislation.  Will the Minister give me some sort of a timeline for when he intends to bring a memo to the Cabinet on the issue and when he will be submitting legislation to this committee for pre-legislative scrutiny?</p> <p>  Many questions have already been asked and answered about the mother and baby home legislation and the role that this committee will play.  I have two questions about that, the first of which relates to the application of GDPR and whether the Minister will be engaging an independent legal expert to advise on its application, in light of the problems with his Department's legal advice so far.  He has stated several times that the report will be published as soon as possible but we need to come up with some less vague terms for people who are texting me every day.  For some people "as soon as possible" would mean a week and to others it would mean six months.  The Department needs to look at expressing a maximum amount of time that people can expect to be waiting.  Some people are worried that it will not happen until early next year.  Giving a minimum and maximum timescale might be advisable, rather than a particular date which I know is impossible to give now.  A suggestion as to how long it will take would be a help to people who are anxious.</p> <p>  I wish also to ask about the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture, OPCAT, which requires the State to allow for independent inspections of all deprivation of liberty settings.  As the Minister knows, Ireland is preparing to ratify the protocol.  Can he provide an update on when he expects that ratification to be completed?  Is it his intention to have direct provision centres included in the inspection regime under OPCAT?</p> <p>  Will the Minister comment on the many concerns that have recently been raised about the role of Ruhama in a direct provision centre?  People are obviously concerned about the history of Ruhama and the fact that it stemmed from a religious order that was involved in the Magdalen laundries.  It would be great if the Minister would also comment on that matter.</p></speech>

On socioeconomic status, the programme for Government did not make an absolute commitment to legislate on this issue but makes a commitment to examine it.  I am strongly in favour of doing this but we need to bring forward the evidence.  The Senator spoke about research done in this area in the past.  This will add to the body of evidence supporting this change.  Research commissioned by the equality section of my Department earlier in the year is expected shortly.  My plan is to use that research to start a wider public consultation on what this measure would look like and, following on from that, to bring proposals to Government to amend the legislation.  I feel very strongly that this needs to be done but we need up-to-date research so that I can make the argument for it convincingly.  That is what I am proceeding to do.</p> <p>  On the application of GDPR, the first port of call for the Department is the Data Protection Commission, DPC, because it is the arbiter of the appropriateness of how any State agency applies GDPR.  The idea of the Department engaging with independent experts is one I am completely open to.  A number of names were mentioned when we engaged with the Adoption Rights Alliance with regard to people who could assist and provide advice and I am fully open to that suggestion.  It is one we are examining.  We will engage with the Office of the Attorney General on the application of GDPR and the Data Protection Commission.  I am also open to bringing in expert advice to give some guidance to the Department.</p> <p>  My understanding of the optional protocol referred to by Senator Ruane is that it does not apply in the case of direct provision centres because they are not considered to be places of detention.  I can come back to the Senator on that particular point.  As to the involvement of any specific organisation in the running of direct provision centres, I will also revert to the Senator on that point.</p></speech>

I am very wary of doing that.  What I can say is that we want to get this report out to survivors as quickly as possible.  I have already indicated that all of the legislation that I have spoken about and that I want to start working on needs to be influenced by the report.  The report is needed to put that legislation in context.  There is no desire among anyone in government to delay this matter for one moment longer than is necessary.  We need to undertake due diligence through the Office of the Attorney General to ensure the publication of the report will not compromise or endanger anything else.  We want to get this done as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

It has been a very difficult few weeks in this regard, particularly for the survivors who wanted us all to work together and come up with a good solution for them.  That, unfortunately, did not happen in the way it should have happened.  There was a lack of consultation and an expedited process resulted in significant confusion on the issue.  It is a very complex issue both legally and technically.</p> <p>  I have questions on the GDPR as this is an issue that we will have to keep revisiting and it will underpin much of the work that we do as we go forward.  On 16 October, the Minister stated in the Seanad that he had been advised by the Attorney General that the right to access personal data in Article 15 of the general data protection regulation is expressly restricted by section 35 of the Commissions of Investigations Act 2004.  The Minister repeated that point on 22 October in the D&aacute;il.  I find this confusing.  How did we get from that point to the statement by the Attorney General on 28 October that the 2004 Act does not preclude consideration of requests under GDPR?</p><p>I have written to the Minister's office to ask for a timeline of the advice from the Attorney General and that from the Data Protection Commission, DPC.  I have not received that yet but it is important to establish when that advice was given to the Minister.  Will he confirm that it was the Attorney General who gave him the advice on the points he made on 16 October in the Seanad and 22 October in the D&aacute;il regarding GDPR?  It is important we ascertain what advice was given when and, as it will continue to come up for us as a committee and in respect of the legislation, will the Minister furnish us with the information and advice he was given on GDPR?  This committee will have to deal with a lot of that as we go forward.  I ask the Minister to answer those questions and then I wish to raise an issue relating to the survivors' groups.</p></speech>

That is as frustrating for Opposition Members as it would have been for my colleagues when they were in opposition.</p> <p>  When the commission of investigation submitted its sixth interim report in January, it outlined that the database had been created.  Subsequent to that, my Department had an engagement with the then Attorney General on the specific point.  The advice we received at that stage was that any access to the records would be prohibited by law and any disclosure of the records would be an offence.  Subsequently, on receipt of parliamentary questions later this year, probably in September, asking specifically about the applicability of GDPR to the archives when it came to my Department, officials in my Department engaged with staff from the Attorney General's office who were seconded to my office on that point and they concurred with the previous advice regarding prohibition of access to the archives.</p> <p>  When the Data Protection Commissioner came in with the specific point on the application of section 39 of the 2004 Act, as amended by the 2018 Act, on 19 October, we immediately went back to the Attorney General's office and asked for advice on that point.  That advice was provided to us on 28 October.  I am delighted to see that advice.  It is an important statement on the applicability of GDPR.  We all know that will not answer all the problems and we still need information-----</p></speech>

All Deputies received a letter from the collaborative forum where they outlined their frustration and anger at the fact they were not consulted and were directed to Twitter to get some understanding of what was happening on this legislation.  They have asked for the forum to be reconvened and listed recommendations they would like the Minister to consider.  Will the Minister consider reconvening the forum?  It is important to do it at this time if he is trying to rebuild trust.  That was an important group for the Department to engage with on this matter.</p></speech>

I have also received the document that has circulated to Deputies and Senators and, as I have said, I acknowledge that I should have engaged immediately with members of that forum and with representatives of the wider groups on this issue.  My initial step is to talk individually with members of the collaborative forum.</p><p>I hope I will then be in a position to meet the entire collaborate forum as a group as part of our response to the commission's report and to outline to it, and engage with it on, the Government's wider strategy on the legacy issues following on from the statements following the Cabinet meeting last Wednesday.</p></speech>

I congratulate him on his appointment to his Ministry.</p> <p>  Like others, I will start out with the mother and baby homes and the commission of investigation because these have rightly dominated in the past couple of weeks.  The commission was working for five years.  That the Oireachtas collectively dealt with such a sensitive and important issue in such a ham-fisted way was always going to be a recipe for distrust and distress.  It caused an enormous amount of both.  I welcome the Minister's acknowledgement that the matter was mishandled and his commitment to having us work more constructively and responsibly in the future.</p> <p>  I voted for the legislation.  I voted to protect the database so survivors could have access to their own information and so the report for which they have all waited so long can be published.  I did so very deliberately.  I heard all the arguments but, for me, the survivors are paramount.  It is paramount that their voices be heard and that their needs be met.  That must be the Government's priority and the priority of us all.</p> <p>  The protection of the database is the route by which survivors can reclaim their own identities.  There has been a lot of debate about various legislative measures, including those on GDPR, but we need to keep this simple.  Every individual should have access to her or his own information.  I want that to be the Government's first priority.  This committee needs a copy of the report early.  It will be asked to do work so it needs a copy early.  The survivors need a copy as early as possible.  I am looking for confirmation from the Minister that everybody who contributed to the report, including every survivor, will get a copy as soon as it is available for release.  It should be available online and a copy should be put into every library in the country so it will be widely available and so there will be no secrecy or concealing of the facts contained in it.</p> <p>  With regard to the personal data and GDPR, there have been requests to have the data impact statement.  Could members have that as early as possible?  Giving adopted people access to their own birth certificates should not be an impossible task, and it should be prioritised by the Government.</p> <p>  I welcome the Government's commitment to create a national archive.  I have been pushing for the designation of the Sean MacDermott Street site.  Members of this committee should visit the site at an early stage so they can appreciate how suitable it is.</p> <p>  With regard to the rest of the Minister's portfolio, there are three points on which I want to touch.  He mentioned childcare.  The childcare sector was in crisis before the Covid-19 pandemic hit.  Childcare workers were the first to go back to work.  They have allowed parents to go back to work.  I welcome the Government's commitment to championing better childcare solutions but it has to be a priority.  I would welcome it if the Minister could advise us when he will be reverting to the committee with proposals on childcare.</p> <p>  I am a founding director of a youth service in Cabra, Cabra for Youth.  It has been in operation for about 11 years.  Since 2013, it has suffered cuts of 20%.  I welcome the funding that the Government has recently made available but it is capital funding.  We need our operational funding to be restored so our service can be returned to a full service.  We are operating on the basis of a four-day week and we are targeting youth at risk.  We are the only dedicated youth service in the area.  There are many others in the city operating in a similar fashion.  I would like the Minister to revert to the committee members and work with us on sustainable funding for the provision of youth services.</p><p>I would like the Minister to come back to the committee and work with us on sustainable funding for the provision of youth services.</p><p> I welcome the commitment of the Minister and the Government to end direct provision and have it as a human rights-centred service.  I would appreciate if the Minister worked with the Minister with responsibility for housing because the Government has committed to a referendum on the right to housing.  It is very important in making a commitment to end direct provision that in parallel we ensure there will be sufficient supply of housing for people.  There is no point in speaking about one without the other.  They have to be done in tandem.  I thank the Minister.</p></speech>

I note there is a lot in it.</p></speech>

I agree with her that five years of work has gone into the commission's report and a lot of it was put into creating the database.  This is why the legislation was put forward, solely to have a database that will be of use to survivors.  It is the only reason the legislation was ever put through.  I am glad the legislation was passed because the database is there and will be valuable for future information and tracing legislation.  We are committed to widespread publication and dissemination of the report once it is published.  I am very happy we will engage with the committee on it.  The Senator is right with regard to stakeholders.  We have a stakeholder group with which the Department communicates.  It includes representatives of survivor groups and individual survivors and they will be the people who are engaged with first.</p> <p>  On the issue of youth funding, the &euro;5 million extra announced for next year is current funding and it will help to bridge the funding difficulties which I know many youth services throughout the country face.  We were asked for &euro;4.7 million by the youth sector and we gave &euro;5 million.  I was struck by the very strong contributions of a number of committee members when we met about a month ago.</p> <p>  On childcare there are three big pieces of work, which are the funding model, the operating model and the workforce plan.  I hope they all will have either final or close to final reports by the middle of next year and I hope that in budget 2021 we can start to take steps to continue to support our childcare services with greater investment and more targeted investment.</p> <p>  I take on board the Senator's point on direct provision.  Human rights will be absolutely central to the provision of a new model of accommodation.  I agree that the solution to accommodating people in international protection will be found in the wider commitment of the Government to address the housing crisis.  There is a commitment to 30,000 social housing units throughout the lifetime of the Government, for which significant funding was provided in this year's budget, and a commitment to new models of tenure, including a cost rental model.  There is a wide range of commitments.  The Government is committed to addressing homelessness crisis and ending direct provision.  They are not in any way contradictory.</p></speech>

We have a huge body of work to get through.  The Department and the committee has a huge and diverse range of issues in our work programme.  I welcome what the Minister has said about the childcare sector.  It is a huge priority.  As someone who did not get to work because of a lack of childcare when my children were younger it is a very important issue and it hits most families in the country.</p> <p>  I reiterate what Senator Ruane said about socioeconomic discrimination being added to the list.  It is very important that we do not rush but make it a priority.  It is very clear that socioeconomic discrimination is happening and it is a very sad indictment of modern Ireland that the incidence continues to rise.</p> <p>  What are the timelines for all of the strategies the Minister mentioned in his speech, including women and girls, the Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, the migrant integration strategy and the LGBTI inclusion strategy?</p><p>I have a few questions on the mother and baby homes.  I want a guarantee from the Minister that all groups, big and small, and individuals, will all be included in this and that it will not just be those who have the most access to meet him but that he will reach out and make a public call to women who are not part of a group and who want to have a say on their history and life and on how the legislation will impact them.  I have had discussions with many survivors' groups and they are afraid of the balance of rights.  They are concerned that the rights of adoptees and mothers might be conflicted or jeopardised.  I want a guarantee from the Minister that we have-----</p><p> Has the Minister gone?  I have frightened him.</p></speech>

From listening to survivors and mothers I know they are very afraid their personal details will be handed out when they do not want them to be.  This will be very difficult for some adoptees.  It is the situation we are in and we as a State have delivered this atrocity.  It will not be an easy balance of rights.</p> <p>  When the recommendations in the report are given to us, I want to make sure that we work on them without haste.  These women and children need supports, counselling and help.  They have been abused by the State and institutions, and their faith in institutions in this country, whether church, State or societal institutions, is very low.  The law is not caring but the Department needs to care for these women because they are vulnerable and hurting.  They have had a lifetime of hurt.</p> <p>  There has been talk of burial grounds in Bessborough House and I have not heard much about this.  Has the Department looked into marking the graves of the babies and perhaps the women who may be buried in Bessborough House in Cork?  There is a lot of talk from survivors about the possibility of their friends who were in those homes and their babies being buried in the grounds of the house.</p></speech>

With regard to Bessborough House, perhaps it is best that we wait for the report to come out.  It will have a detailed chapter on Bessborough.  It would be best to look at it then and we will be in a position to address queries about the next steps.</p><p>The Senator has raised an important issue about adoption.  The reason information and tracing legislation has not come to pass until now is this balance.  The I O'T <i>v</i>. B case of 1998 suggested it was needed because of the privacy rights of the natural mother and the rights of the adopted person.  There is a range of rights and views.  It is worth saying the case was decided before the GDPR was introduced, and looking at personal information such as names and birth certificates will have to be examined in the context of the GDPR.  However, the reality of life has jumped past this situation.  Earlier, I spoke to a friend who did an online DNA test and is identifying family members or distant relatives throughout the country and in other countries.</p><p>I refer to the ability of these things to skip past the legalities of whatever is in the legislation.  People can be linked with somebody on Facebook who might end up being their second cousin.  They may ask the person was there an aunt who was away from the family for a number of months 40 years ago and suddenly the story comes out.  Technology and modern life has moved on a long way from when the I.O'T case was decided.  Whereas constitutional rights and the need to balance rights are always there and do not change with technology, we have to understand that people will do whatever they can to find out who they are because it is such an innate need in all of us.  We have to draft and conceptualise the legislation in this area to meet the reality of how technology today allows adopted people find out a considerable amount of information that maybe statute does not provide for now.  We have to ask ourselves if there is a point in statute continuing to block that.</p><p> Finally, as I say, I will reach out and talk to many groups.  I am trying to talk to individuals as well and hear their stories and I have been doing that already this week.  I will continue to do that in the forthcoming weeks.  I need to build this sort of listening in as part of my ongoing work as Minister in this Department.  I thank the Senator.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1570" speakername="Patrick Costello" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2020110300002#P00200"><p>I will start where the Minister finished.  The Minister says people will do whatever they can to find out who they are.  We have seen that through the strength and resilience of many of these survivors.  While they are doing whatever they can, I hope that we are not trying to put roadblocks in their way.  For many, it feels like they are pushing a stone uphill.  Hopefully, we can try and remove some of those hills for them and, as the Minister says, look at the legislation and ensure that it is supporting them in doing whatever they can to find out who they are instead of putting the roadblocks in place.</p> <p>  I echo the points raised by Senator McGreehan in that there are stakeholder groups who feel annoyed at present because they have not been consulted with.  They have not been part of any conversations and they have concerns that they are not part of the public debate up to this point.  I will talk to the Minister on another occasion about some of those groups, but that consultation needs to be conducted far and wide.  Perhaps we need to explore innovative routes to ensure that we are bringing everyone into that consultation because we need to put the survivors at the centre of this once again.  That point of view and that support needs to be at the centre of this.  It has drifted away from that and that needs to be the centrepiece.</p> <p>  The Minister talks about the increased funding for youth work.  That is, of course, welcome.  I am involved with a Garda youth diversion project in Crumlin which has been doing good outreach work in relation to anti-social behaviour in the areas it covers.  The outreach work is good.  It can happen late at night.  It can happen in areas where the young people are getting into trouble.  It reaches people where they are instead of waiting for them to come to the centre, which might not always happen.  While it is shown to work, the reality is that it takes from the work that happens in the centre because it is staff intensive.  One is looking at a situation where projects are choosing between effective outreach and more general centre-based work.  It should not be a choice.  It needs to be both.  If we can look for funding lines that would specifically fund outreach services on top of existing youthreach services, even on a short-term basis, the outreach services can be targeted to pull people who are not already engaging in to the centre-based programmes to improve the ultimate centre-based programmes.</p> <p>  The other matter I want to pick up on is Tusla.  The Minister says correctly that he has made a significant budget available for Tusla to meet its statutory function.  I have raised with the Minister on numerous occasions my concern about fostering recruitment and the dangers there of Tusla not being able to fulfil its statutory function because it is not recruiting enough foster carers.</p><p>I note also the Minister is still wearing his fostering button and I assume he is alive to these concerns.  What are we doing to ensure that Tusla will spend that money on fostering recruitment?</p><p> The other issue I want to raise is in-house therapeutic supports in Tusla for children in care.  In parliamentary questions, the therapeutic hub in Dublin North-Central has been highlighted as an exemplar of excellent work done to support foster carers and children in care.  It is an excellent service.  I encourage the Minister to engage with Tusla to ensure this money is being routed towards funding more such services.  I also ask him to visit this service and meet the people who deliver it, the social workers who rely on it to support young people and, if possible given the nature of the service and the privacy required, some of the foster carers or perhaps even the children who have benefited from it to hear directly from them how such a service could be transformative in Tusla's ability to fulfil its statutory function.</p><p> I am conscious that the clock is ticking.  It has been suggested that there are unmarked graves not only in Bessborough but in plenty of other places.  Will the legislation the Minister is talking about in relation to the Tuam site be sufficient to cover all potential exhumations that are required or will we need to more legislation for other specific sites?  The Minister may only have time to answer my last question.  If so, I can respond to the others in writing.</p></speech>

Fostering awareness week is coming up and my Department is doing one or two discrete campaigns.  As well as the wider fostering campaign, we are also looking to target fostering parents within the Travelling community.  We are also looking at a programme to encourage foster parents for unaccompanied minors such as those coming from Greece as a specific new category of foster parents, and provide the relevant supports.  I take on board the Deputy's point on the importance of supporting the Tusla foster parents.</p> <p>  On the issue of the exhumations, the idea is that we create legislation that allows for the creation of an agency for a defined period of time, which would undertake the excavations, exhumations, identification and reburial for a specific site.  Initially, it will be Tuam.  However, if a range of determined factors were met in another site, the same legislation could be used to create a new agency, also established for a specific period of time, to undertake similar work on another site.  We will not need to legislate again as this legislation will address any subsequent need, beyond Tuam, to undertake this sort of work.</p></speech>

It is right that there would be exhumation of the remains of babies who did not receive a Christian burial and were buried wrongly and inappropriately on the sites of some of these mother and baby homes.  As we approach the centenary of the State, we will only be able to move forward with maturity and with our heads held high as a people when we have brought about justice and redress for those babies who were voiceless and the survivors of those homes.</p> <p>  This committee will deal with some heavy and emotive issues in the coming months.  Specifically, in regard to mother and baby homes, survivors and their children must be front and centre of our work.  As politicians, it is vital that we deal always in the realm of facts and communicate always in the realm of truths.  While the Government communication on the mother and baby home legislation may have been clumsy at best, and it was wrong and unfortunate that there was not more engagement and interaction with survivor groups, it is nonetheless important that the committee state clearly and double down on the fact that the legislation passed by both the D&aacute;il and Seanad a fortnight ago did not lock up or seal away highly sensitive records and testimonies for 30 years.  The legislation ensured that the records were saved and for politicians to say otherwise is inaccurate.</p><p>I have a number of questions to put to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, this afternoon.  The first is what everyone in the country is waiting to hear.  What is the expected timeline by which the legislative pieces required to set up tracing databases and access to records will be introduced?</p><p> Can he give assurances to adoptees that they will be granted the rightful access to birth certificates?  Currently, one in five are having their applications denied.  I am dealing with one case in the constituency where a lady has tracked down her mother.  Her mother has consented to her birth certificate being released and made available and the red tape of the State still does not allow it.  That is fundamentally wrong.  This is emotional and should guide much of the work we do.  She told me her birthday each year is the worst day of the year.  It is a day most of us look forward to where one has a few drinks and celebrates with friends.  For her, it is a day she knows she does not have an identity, as such, going back to her birthday.  She cannot account for nine months of her life and that is devastating for her.  That needs to be moved and corrected in legislation.</p><p> Third, in terms of supporting adoptees we have all had many conversations over the past week.  Another constituent contacted me last week and said she successfully traced her birth mother in England and felt she was well-supported by the instruments of the state in Britain.  As someone who has gone through this process already, she fears the Irish State may be under-resourced in terms of social workers.  It is much more than a person finding out his or her birth name and surname and going home with a letter then crying in the car park after reading that letter.  There is much more to it than that.  There is a need for social worker support during the research stage but, more importantly, in the stages that follow.  Some might be extremely supported by family and may not want that support but for those who do, it needs to be there in abundance.  It is a raw situation.</p><p> I wish to speak about direct provision.  I am glad it has come up in the discussion today.  I grew up adjacent to Knockalisheen Accommodation Centre in Meelick so I have friends from childhood and now friends in adulthood who are there.  I taught in the local school.  I have legally gone guarantor for some of the families in their fight to remain in the country.  Their stories are absolutely fabulous.  What we have seen in the last 12 months in town halls, where certain right-wing groups hijack an agenda and go out with horrible vitriol, is not the type of direct provision I have experienced.  I experience people who have come from the most genuine situations.  They crave and thirst and hunger for the thing all of us want, that is, stability in their lives and a decent place to bring up their kids.  They are still quite concerned and one of the biggest frustrations is that they still cannot get meaningful employment despite legislation being updated in 2018.</p><p> I will also join in what other speakers have said.  I do not want to bury this idea but the suggestion that Ruhama would have a role in terms of sex-traffic workers should also be considered and, perhaps, reconsidered given its foundations are rooted in two religious orders that we have discussed already here today.  It needs more in-depth thinking.  I will leave it there.</p></speech>

It is a dignity we will probably see was not afforded to them in life or immediately on their passing.</p> <p>  As regards the timeline for information and tracing, I hope this legislation will be before the D&aacute;il and, initially, before this committee for pre-legislative scrutiny next year.  That is my intention.  As I said earlier, there are various views as to whether it is done in conjunction with the issue of the wider archives in an omnibus Bill that will cover a range of Departments or whether it is treated as a discrete issue.  I had intended to treat it as a discrete issue but alternative views have been put to me by the Adoption Rights Alliance and I want to examine them before making any determination.  I believe that access to the birth certificates should be central in that.  We flagged other issues in earlier discussions with Deputies and Senators but when one considers the GDPR is now applicable in this context, those issues need to be looked at again.</p> <p>  The Deputy has outlined some stories of the real difficulties adopted people have experienced in getting access to information.  I have heard similar stories in my engagements in recent days.  We must take away those roadblocks that Deputy Costello spoke about.  While GDPR applicability to the database and to the archive is a step forward, the information and tracing legislation that provides clear legislative pathways to addressing these problems is absolutely essential.</p><p>I welcome the Deputy's comments on direct provision.  I acknowledge the work he and teachers all over the country do in supporting young people in direct provision by going to local schools and helping the elements of integration.  From my engagement I know that in most centres around the country there are significant friends of the local direct provision facility who give that very real Irish welcome to the people in those centres.</p><p> We acknowledge many of the centres are not fit for purpose and we need to change the model.  That is what we will do in the White Paper. One of the things that I and the Minister for Justice announced three weeks ago as regards the issue of employment is to reduce the time period within which an individual can seek employment from nine months originally to six months.  A person can apply for employment, therefore, within six months and that employment permit will last for 12 months rather than just nine months.  That makes it much more attractive to employers as well.  That is one step of many to make life in the system better and afford people more dignity.</p></speech>

It is certainly a matter of fact that the legislation was badly handled when it was dealt with in the Convention Centre.  I appreciate that the Minister has acceded in respect of this point.  It is probably regrettable that we did not have the subsequent advice from the Attorney General's office and, indeed, the Minister's statement on foot of that advice a week earlier because it would have been hugely helpful and informative.</p> <p>  We must acknowledge the importance of the work of the commission.  It is truly vital that we deliver on what is a hugely important piece of historical work.  That process, however, will count for nothing if, on publication of the report, the survivors cannot access the records so many of them desperately seek and absolutely deserve to access.  Between now and the publication of the report, the survivors and their wishes must be front and centre.  I am glad to hear the Minister acknowledge that today.  It is vital that the survivors be engaged with and I appreciate that the Minister has already done significant work in that regard over the past week.</p> <p>  GDPR and other technical and legal terms can often cloud the process.  We need, however, to see a clear road map put in place which will allow the survivors the knowledge that they have absolute certainty as to how and when they will be able to access their information.  Anything less and the hurt of decades that justifiably manifested itself so forcefully in recent weeks will fester further.</p> <p>  Since the legislation was introduced almost two weeks ago, I have met with a number of the survivors locally.  They are hurt and angry, and rightly so.  As I said, I acknowledge that the Minister has had significant consultation with the survivors in recent days.  I know this will doubtlessly positively inform his decisions and actions in the months ahead.  We must look to the families and the survivors but, more importantly, we must look to those relationships.  We need to ensure a framework is put in place that will assure the survivors, their families and siblings have full access to their records prior to publication of the report.</p> <p>  Everybody in the room can appreciate the quickest lesson one learns in politics is that one makes mistakes and makes them often.  We must acknowledge the Minister's admission of infallibility over recent weeks.  It speaks volumes to him as an individual but also to his capacity as a legislator and it reinforces my belief in him that he will get this right.  I appreciate that he has an extensive brief and programme of works.  What I really want from the Minister today is an assurance that there will be full and absolute disclosure for the survivors of the mother and baby homes and that this is foremost in the minds of not only the Minister but also the Department and his fellow members of Government.</p></speech>

I agree with everything he said and thank him for his comments.</p><p>We can give a full assurance that there will be absolute disclosure of everything in this report.  It is incredibly detailed.  It contains 4,000 pages.  It includes chapters on each of the mother and baby homes and a social history chapter that tries to give the context of Ireland in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, looking at D&aacute;il debates and what was happening in wider society and also looking at specific themes across the times, including adoptions and deaths in the mother and baby homes.  It deals with a range of matters.  There will be very detailed information for society in general.  There is a chapter on the confidential committee, which we have spoken about a number of times in the debates.  It consists of the contributions made by 550 individuals who spoke to the commission and gave their experiences in the mother and baby homes.  Having read some of that, it is very difficult reading but we need this.  We need to understand what happens.  As members of different generations to whom this is completely alien, we need to understand what happened and put it in the context of supporting victims and survivors.  Putting that central in everything we do, as the Deputy said, is essential.  If Deputies are meeting any survivors groups that would like to engage with me, I would be happy if they put them in touch with me.  I will arrange for that in my Department.</p></speech>

I would like a copy of the data protection impact assessment statement and all records that the Minister is holding and is the data controller of, if that is possible.  The Minister says the final report is under review by the Department.  Why is it under review?  What will be published and what will be amended in that report before publication?</p> <p>  While I welcome the programme for Government statement on ending direct provision, has the Government just put a fancy new name on it with "international protection accommodation"?  There are currently 7,000 people in direct provision accommodation and 30% of those are children.  We need about 3,000 homes just to deal with the people in direct provision at this time.  I do not want this to be renamed "international protection accommodation", if that is what the Minister calls ending direct provision. </p> <p>  Has the Minister left?</p></speech>

Fostering in a family home environment, whether it is by single parents or another type of fostering, is much better for any child than residential care where the children have social workers coming in to look after them 24-7.  I do not want to see the Minister promoting that model.  I want to see him promoting the fostering family model, if it is possible, whatever the family make-up might be.  Having a child brought up in a family environment is much better than having a child brought up in residential care.</p> <p>  We have spoken about the mother and baby homes of yesteryear but what about today's mother and baby homes?  Will the Minister provide the committee with details of these?   Believe it or not, there are still mother and baby units in this country for young girls.  What step-down facilities are available for those young girls and their babies?  Who runs these homes?  I am not sure whether they are run by Tusla or private operators but if the Minister will provide details on that, I would appreciate it.  The Minister is looking quite confused now, but they do exist.</p><p> I want the Minister to be a fantastic champion for children.  I am a foster parent.  I know the trials and suffering experienced by the kids that come in my door.  I want the Minister to champion them and I have not seen that being done yet.  Working men and women were given an allowance of &euro;250 under the stay and spend scheme.  The students of Ireland were given &euro;250.  Why does the Minister not give the teenagers of this country a leisure or well-being voucher they could use for their health and well-being?  We need to do something for the teenagers in this country, something individual and unique to them which they can use for health and well-being, going to the gym or whatever they choose.  I have in mind some sort of leisure, recreational or well-being voucher that makes these kids feel valued and important in society.  If we can help them at that age, problems may not manifest down the line.</p><p> Alcohol Action Ireland today stated that 200,000 children are affected by parental alcohol abuse, while 400,000 adult children live with its consequences.  That means 12% of our population is affected by alcohol abuse.  How will we address that?  We need to address those issues.</p><p> I wish the Minister well.  He has a huge body of work to do.  The mother and baby issue is sensitive for everybody.  At this time, if I am a victim of a mother and baby home, I cannot access my data.  The Minister has created a database and I can get at it but I cannot get the testimony I gave to the commission at the time.  Those are the facts and I want people to know that.  Other parties, who have left the room, came out with fake news saying people could access their data but they cannot.  They can access their name but not their own testimony given to the commission at the time.  Thank God we have GDPR to protect those individuals' data and a European law that supersedes any law we have in this country.</p><p> I wish the Minister well and hope he does the right thing always by the children.  The children of this nation are not just the children we have today but the children we did not serve as the State developed over the past 100 years.  We have made many mistakes.  Let us not continue to make them with residential care homes for our teenagers.  Let us not continue to make them with our mother and baby homes.  They are only small mother and baby homes.  There could be only two or three mothers and babies in these homes.  Let us learn from the mistakes and be the best society we can be for all our children.</p></speech>

On the issue of residential care and the preference for fostering, I absolutely agree.  Fostering is always the preference.  Of all children in care in the State, 91% are in foster care and 7% are in residential care.  That shows the extent to which Tusla focuses on residential care but there are situations where a child or, often, a young person has needs.  There may be behavioural needs or needs related to family circumstances or wider societal circumstances related to where the young person is coming from such that the traditional foster model that has worked so well and is so good for the vast majority of young people in care is not suitable.  It is necessary to have a range of specialists looking after that child or young person around the clock and, unfortunately, the number of those cases has grown significantly in recent years.</p><p>That is why we have seen the increase in residential care.  It is not through choice but necessity.</p></speech>

We could not do otherwise.  If there is a situation involving a young person whose needs far outstrip the capacity of a foster family, we have to put in place that level of care.</p> <p>  The Senator referred to direct provision.  This cannot, and will not, be simply a name change.  It is a complete approach to how we treat people in the international protection process while they are waiting for a decision.  It is about accommodation and the wider supports provided to them.  It is about allowing them independence in terms of work and the ability to get a driving licence and engage with society as a whole.  It is also about protection in the context of education.  It is about integration and ensuring that the direct provision centre is not somewhere miles from town that is not accessible.  There has to be integration as well.  It is far more than simply a name.  The Senator has my assurance that we will deliver on that.</p> <p>  She made a strong point on the well-being of young people.  Since the pandemic began, my Department has undertaken research to ascertain specifically how it is impacting on young people.  This research was important in making the case that the reopening of schools was important from the point of view of general mental health, to support children from disadvantaged areas and to support those with special educational needs.  It also serves as a window into the lives of those children whose families may be dysfunctional or where there is some element of abuse taking place.  When a child is in front of a teacher for six or seven hours in a day, that teacher can spot issues quickly and notify the relevant authorities.  The research we did in conjunction with SpunOut examining teenage experience was important in the context of the roadmap for resilience and recovery that we are all operating under at the moment.  It was important in convincing me to put additional financial supports into youth services.  One thing the research spotted was that young people who had engaged with youth services during the lockdown or pandemic had far better outcomes than those who had not.  That is one of the issues that convinced me of the importance of supporting the youth sector in this period.  The data and research are also informing me in other ways.  I attended a Cabinet sub-committee meeting last night to discuss mental health.  I brought forward the need to concentrate on the mental health of everyone now that we are back at level 5, but especially the mental health of young people.</p></speech>

An apprentice in that category cannot get any payment whatsoever.  Can the Minister talk to the Minister for Social Protection?  It does not matter what we give these teenagers.  If they are aged between 16 and 18 years, they cannot get anything.  They did not get anything during the first lockdown.  Can the Minister address that with his colleague?</p></speech>

I look forward to working with him through the committee.</p> <p>  I welcome the commitment contained within the programme for Government and on his priority list to the reform of the pay and conditions for the childcare sector.  It is crucial.  We urgently need to advance wage agreements on behalf of the staff and providers in this sector.  We also need to look to reform childcare costs.</p><p>These are a significant burden on working families at present.  The establishment of the expert group, which will be working on the new funding model, is crucial.  I am keen to hear exactly when in 2021 that report will be published.  It is crucially important and it will set the direction for this committee in respect of the sector.</p><p> I want to touch on the mother and baby homes legislation that was passed almost a fortnight ago.  We received considerable correspondence at our constituency offices in Mayo.  There was major anxiety and stress among members of the public.  I draw the Minister's attention to the petition that 196,000 people have signed.  What are his thoughts around the phrase "Repeal the seal, Open the archive"?  It is probably bringing considerable anxiety to the women and children who are survivors and who came through mother and baby homes.  They believe they are being denied access to their own testimony, files and records.  I am keen to get legislation involves and where we need to go to in the coming months in terms of further legislation to ensure they have access?  Can we ensure that Tusla is on board and that the Department will be to the forefront on this?</p></speech>

The treatment of the archive of the commission of investigation comes from the original 2004 Act.  The mother and baby homes commission was established in 2015 on the basis of the 2004 Act and the requirements of that Act with regard to the archive.  My legislation, which is now an Act, was designed to take part of the archive and give it to Tusla.</p></speech>

The treatment of the archive is a result of the 2004 Act and the decision to establish the commission on the basis of its provision.  The decision of the Attorney General that the GDPR applies to the archive in my Department is significant.  It means that rather than a blanket "No" to access requests, we have to consider each on its individual merits.  That is a good step.  We will be engaging with the Attorney General and especially the Data Protection Commissioner to enable us to understand how we do that best.  That will be a new thing for us.  We were not expecting that but we have to address it.  As I said, I welcome it and believe it is positive.</p> <p>  It will not be a solution to the wider issues of access to information in this archive and in the archives of other commissions into other institutional abuse that took place in this country.  That solution will be through the information and tracing legislation as well as through legislation to give legal effect to a new archive of institutional abuse.  This is the CoLab model that the Adoption Rights Alliance, Justice for Magdalenes and CLANN have brought forward.  My engagement with this is still in its infancy but I met representatives of the Adoption Rights Alliance and I am committed to looking at it.  This will involve other Departments as well.  The Department of the Taoiseach will have an important role in co-ordinating the idea of an archive.  That may involve a physical location for all of this information as well as a legal basis to access it.</p> <p>  I will comment on what Deputy Dillon was saying about early years and the importance of pay and conditions.  I have identified sick pay - there is a need to provide it now that significant efforts are being made to address sick pay on a national basis.  That is a really good step by the Government.  I will be ensuring that childcare professionals are involved in that.  There are wider issues in the context of pay.  We have been making significant strides, even in recent weeks, towards the direction of a joint labour committee.  I welcome the work of Childhood Services Ireland and SIPTU and their engagement with this process so far.</p><p>We are not there yet but we are working towards that.  That committee can put in the basic steps of a proper pay scale so that we can adequately reward the work that childcare professionals do in this country.<br/><br/>The issue of fees is also significant.  As I said, there are three big pieces of work, namely, the review of the operating model, the expert funding group and the workforce development plan.  Two of those were established by my predecessor, Katherine Zappone, and I established the operating model review.  I have made this point a number of times and I know that people get a little tired of hearing that another review is ongoing but one of the problems in the early years sector is that too many things happened on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis and models were created in response to an immediate need.  That dates from ten years ago, a time when the State was putting no money at all into the early years sector.  It was wholly privately run and only those who could afford it could engage with it.  I want to gather research in those three key areas to put a good structure on a new model of childcare in this country.  We must make sure that the significant State investment about which we spoke earlier - &euro;638 million next year, even before any of the additional Covid-19 supports are counted - is going to the right places, keeping providers viable, ensuring that childcare professionals are adequately remunerated and that we can support parents so that their out-of-pocket costs are not too great.  We also must ensure that children in areas of disadvantage are getting the strongest supports.</p></speech>

The mother and baby home legislation has dominated this discussion.  The committee debated the matter earlier.  Everybody here is anxious to be a part of the solution and to ensure that survivors' voices are heard.  We are a little confused because various people have referred to the committee and the work we are going to do but we have not been given a specific timeline or information from the Department about what is expected of us.  As I say, we want to be a part of the solution and to ensure that survivors' voices are heard and put at the heart of everything.  We ask the Minister and Department to come back to us with a written timeline setting out when the report will be published, how the Minister envisages consultation with survivors, their representative groups and families, and what will be the specific role asked of this committee.  We want very much to be involved but we must know in which parts we are to be involved.  As the Minister knows, this is a very wide topic.  We obviously need to wait for the report to be published but we are anxious to have a written document from the Minister and the Department setting out the specific requests of this committee so that we can engage properly with the survivors, the Minister and the Department.</p> <p>  I have a question about the Tuam burials which have been touched on by a number of speakers.  Is there a possibility of extending that to look at other sites where there might also have been burials?  Will that specifically relate to Tuam?  That might be something for pre-legislative scrutiny but I put that point to the Minister nonetheless.</p> <p>  Deputy Whitmore touched on the point I wished to make about the council and the supports and additional resources to be made available.</p> <p>  The Minister may now make some concluding remarks.</p></speech>

I did not get all the specific questions that she asked, so she might put them in a letter or ask the clerk to the committee to put them together and we will get back to her.  As I said in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, I want to work with this committee.</p><p>Many of the items of legislation we will address, which are very technical and require pre-legislative scrutiny, require engagement with survivors' groups and experts to get them as close to right as possible before we put them into the full legislative process.  Mental health supports and other supports will be provided for survivors in advance of the publication of the report.  My Department is currently engaging with the Department of Health and the HSE on that point, which is important.   </p><p> Regarding the advices of the Attorney General, the query submitted to him on 19 October was specifically on the query brought forward by the Data Protection Commissioner that had been sent to our Department.  That was the query that went to the commissioner.  I do not think it was identical to the original query about the legal status of the archive that was put forward in January of this year because the context was different.</p><p> I do not have any specific concluding remarks.

We are joined, in person, by Mr. Wayne Stanley, Chair, Home for Good Coalition, and Ms Rebecca Keatinge, Mercy Law Research Centre.  We are joined, via video link, by Professor Gerry Whyte, Trinity College Dublin, and Ms Rosemary Hennigan, Focus Ireland.  I thank them for their attendance and for the submissions they made in advance.</p> <p>  Members have been circulated with the opening statement as well as a more detailed briefing note.  I shall first ask the representative of the Home for Good Coalition to make an opening statement and members will then be invited to address their questions.  I urge people to limit their questions and answers to five minutes so that we can get around the room for a second round of questions, and follow-up questions.</p> <p>  The witnesses attending in the committee room are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation that they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege.  It is my duty, as Chair, to ensure that such privilege is not abused and, therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as enjoyed by a witness who is physically present.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  The opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  </p> <p>  I invite Mr. Stanley or Ms Keatinge to make an opening statement on behalf of the Home for Good Coalition.  On conclusion we will proceed to questions.</p></speech>

As chairperson of the Home for Good Coalition, I extend our thanks to the Oireachtas committee for the invitation to present on this issue of bringing forward the referendum on a right to housing.</p> <p>  Home for Good is a coalition of housing non-governmental organisations or NGOs.  They include the F&oacute;rsa trade union, academics, activists and lawyers.  As a group, we believe that constitutional change is urgently required to rebalance our Constitution, and ensure that enabling the provision of secure and adequate housing be recognised as a central role of the State.  We call for a referendum to provide a constitutional amendment that would insert a stand-alone right to housing in our Constitution.</p> <p>  As advocates and experts, we understand how important a right to housing will be for those experiencing homelessness, and for those in inadequate, unaffordable, unsafe, insecure or overcrowded accommodation.  A constitutional right to housing will recognise that a balance must be struck between the right to private property, on the one hand, and the right to housing, on the other hand.</p> <p>  The period of the Covid-19 pandemic has starkly demonstrated the importance of an adequate home to keep a person safe.  As a group we are more certain than ever of the need to amend the Constitution to ensure that the necessary policies can be implemented to work towards ending the housing exclusion and homelessness that has marred our society for too long, and in the pandemic has left too many vulnerable.</p> <p>  The Home for Good Coalition welcomes the inclusion of a referendum on housing in the programme for Government.  We have monitored the discussions of the committee so welcome, within the committee, what appears to us to be a very strong cross-party consensus that this will be a referendum on a right to housing.  We now wish to work closely with the committee to get the process under way of determining the wording and aims of this amendment.  To that end, we began working with a group of legal experts to develop an amendment that will meet the objectives I have briefly outlined.</p> <p>  Professor Gerry Whyte has joined the meeting via Zoom technology and is professor of law at Trinity College Dublin.  He is one of the experts who have given generously of their time.</p><p>We are also joined by Rosemary Hennigan, who is part of that legal group and who is a colleague from Focus Ireland.  I will hand over to Rebecca Keatinge, who will outline why this referendum should be proposed with a view to having a stand-alone right to housing, and the wording which Home For Good has endorsed and believes best achieves this right.</p></speech>

I am managing solicitor at Mercy Law Resource Centre, which is one of the founding members of Home For Good, and we chair the legal subgroup of which Ms Hennigan and Professor Whyte are members.  I refer to the existing protections of private property rights in the Constitution and why a referendum specifically on a stand-alone right to housing is needed, in our view, and I will also to set out the wording that Home For Good is proposing to progress this important discussion.<br/><br/>The Constitution currently provides protection of private property rights in Article 43 and Article 40.3 but there is no equivalent right to housing protected in the Constitution.  This means that the starting point of every legal analysis in respect of the regulation of land begins from the perspective of the property owner&rsquo;s right.  While this right may be restricted in the interests of the common good, the starting point for analysis remains the private interest, with the common good only relevant insofar as it justifies the State in limiting this right to private property.  As a result, the Constitution perceives property as a private interest held by a rights holder, though this interest is capable of being restricted by the State in appropriate circumstances in the interest of the common good.  A difficulty, however, is that it may not be easy in advance to predict when the common good would justify a restriction on the right to private property.  Furthermore, it is a complex task to identify in what circumstances such considerations may justify an interference in private property rights.<br/><br/>A more effective and proactive constitutional approach, which we propose, would be to continue the existing protection for private property rights but weigh these against the protection of a right to housing.  In this recast scenario, the Legislature and the courts would be tasked with balancing two rights against each other, subject to the usual restrictions around proportionality and rationality.  This, in our view, would remove the current overly narrow interpretation of private property rights in the Constitution and enable the Government to respond to the current housing and homelessness crisis in a manner that properly and fairly balances competing interests.  Not only does this create a fairer balance, it will better frame the State&rsquo;s role in housing, not only as a protector of private property rights but as a protector of our human right to safe and secure housing.  Thus, the State would have an obligation to provide for the realisation of this right within available resources, analogous to the existing constitutional obligation to provide for free primary education.<br/><br/>Our proposal, therefore, is for a stand-alone right, one that is directly enforceable and that includes a separate statement of the State's obligation to realise that right within available resources.  Home For Good proposes the insertion of a new Article 43A, which states:</p> <blockquote> 	Housing<br /><br />Article 43A<br /><br />1. The State recognises, and shall vindicate, the right of all persons to have access to adequate housing.<br /><br />2. The State shall, through legislative and other measures, provide for the realisation of this right within its available resources. </blockquote> <p>In conclusion, we very much welcome this session.  It is an occasion to both consult and discuss the formulation of this amendment in public session.  The committee's scrutiny is an important preparatory step towards any referendum.  We hope the committee's engagement and consideration will progress this important issue and give impetus and a clear timeline within which the referendum can be held.  We look forward to engaging with the committee and thank members for their time. </p></speech>

As the other speakers in my group will indicate, Fianna F&aacute;il is very supportive of this proposal.  I come from Dublin Central and I have been a city councillor for 15 years.  I come at the housing crisis, therefore, from the lived experience of my constituents over those 15-odd years.</p><p>I firmly believe in a couple of things, one of which is that the housing crisis will only be solved if there is the political will to do so.  The inclusion of such a commitment in the Constitution would take it away from the transience of day-to-day politics and would make it a State commitment to provide adequate housing to citizens, which is really important.  It is only with that strong commitment that it will become something that is perpetuated, which is what we need it to be.  As I am not a constitutional lawyer by any stretch of the imagination, I will defer to those with much greater knowledge but I strongly believe that traditionally and historically, everything has been weighted towards the rights of private property, which is understandable.  Not to take away from that, we should use this as an opportunity to assert the State's commitment to people's human rights and their rights as individuals to achieve their full potential.  Mr. Stanley mentioned the Covid-19 pandemic.  Through the housing crisis, I have seen how not having a home or a place that is secure and to which one can go, close the door and have a bit of quiet time and peace of mind - without necessarily owning it - deprives people of their ability to go to school, do their homework, go to college, progress in life or contribute to our society.  </p><p> As we approach this issue, we should look at asserting that right, namely, the provision of housing and secure homes, as contributing to each individual's right to achieve his or her full potential.  I am interested to hear from the lawyers how that can be captured in any amendment.  From my understanding, there are very limited examples internationally of such a right being included in constitutions but the witnesses should talk a little about how or if it has worked and how that can be demonstrated.  I thank the witnesses for their engagement with the committee and look forward to working with them to deliver this referendum as part of the work in the next four years of the Government.</p></speech>

It is really valuable to us to know that we are building the sort of cross-party consensus around the need for this referendum.  On the question the Senator raised on its full potential and the examples from other countries, I will defer to Professor Whyte and Ms Keatinge, as the lawyers present, to provide the legal examples.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.186" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rebecca Keatinge" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110300002#D00300"><p>In respect of Covid-19, we have seen that both our individual and our collective well-being depend on people having secure and safe homes, so it has brought this issue into a sharp focus.  We see the referendum as being future-looking.  It is to provide that floor of protection against recurring crises looking forward, as the Senator commented.</p> <p>  In other jurisdictions, there are 83 constitutions that protect the right to housing across the world.  This is constituted in a whole range of different wordings, and as a sub-group, we have looked at many of those wordings.  As an organisation, the Mercy Law Resource Centre produced a report on the protection of the right in other jurisdictions in Europe, including Finland, and the statutory protections that exist in France and Scotland.  That details how, in those legal frameworks, the protections exist and the impact they have had.  The overall conclusions I would draw from that report and from our own research is that to introduce the protection we would not be an outlier.  It is a common protection that exists in modern, well-functioning democracies.  The other comment I would make is a bit of a caveat and while Ms Hennigan and Professor Whyte will be able to speak to some of the specific examples, we have a very specific legal framework.  It is difficult to import how some things operate in other jurisdictions.  For example, Finland has a protection in relation to housing but its laws operate and are formed through a very different process.  There is pre-legislative scrutiny to make sure that things are constitution-proofed, and there are other interventions, but we have quite a unique system.  We have looked at the South African example, which is obviously a very different context, but that does have some comparators with our own legal system.  The committee will see in our note that we have commented on how that example can be used.  I will defer now to Professor Whyte and Ms Hennigan might add some further comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.187" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerard Whyte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110300002#E00100"><p>If I may, I will comment briefly on the South African experience.  When we were drawing up our formula, we looked at the experience in South Africa.  The first clause of our proposal is based on section 26 of the South African Constitution.  The important point to make is that when it came to judicial enforcement of the right of access to adequate housing, the South African constitutional court used a standard of reasonableness which leaves considerable room to the legislative and executive powers in South Africa to protect or vindicate this particular right.</p> <p>  In one particular instance, the Grootboom case, the South African Supreme Court, using this standard, highlighted an omission from the then policy.  It did not address the position of people who are in crisis situations as a result of eviction and who needed emergency accommodation.  It stated that the absence of this provision made the existing policy unreasonable or failed to comply with the constitution.  The ball was then passed back to the legislature and executive and within a period of four years both at state and provincial level they had adopted policies which addressed this problem.  That is how we would see a constitutional guarantee of right of access to adequate housing operating in this jurisdiction as well.</p></speech>

I commend the work of Home for Good.  It is a really good alliance and initiative to try to bring this issue to the next level.  I acknowledge the good campaigning work of other networks, such as Raise the Roof, which has been strongly arguing for such a constitutional referendum.  As committee members will know, Sinn F&eacute;in has long supported such a referendum.  It is important to acknowledge that this is probably the fifth time we have discussed this issue in this room and in this format.  We did it on four separate occasions, twice when Mercy Law Resource Centre had published two very good reports and at two other hearings.  At some point, we have to stop discussing it in this room, we must have a referendum campaign and try to change the Constitution.  Perhaps this will be the D&aacute;il and the committee that pushes it on to the next level.</p> <p>  Three arguments are often used against such a referendum.  I will put them to the witnesses because I would like to hear their responses.  The first is that such a constitutional right would guarantee everybody in the State the right to a free home and there would be a big queue outside Government Buildings where everybody would looking to get their keys.  It is a counter-argument often used by critics.  I would like the witnesses to respond specifically to it.  Another counter-argument we hear is that a constitutional right to housing will not build any homes and there are many jurisdictions that have such rights and their housing crises are as bad if not worse than ours.  I would interested to hear the witnesses' response to that argument.  A third argument, which was used heavily by opponents of economic, social and cultural rights in the Constitutional Convention, is that this would be an interference in the role of the Legislature and Government to set policy and it would give the courts undue influence in that area.  I will give the witnesses an opportunity to respond to those points.</p> <p>  The witnesses might outline, for those members who do not know, what the outcomes of the Ninth Report of the Convention on the Constitution 2014 were, specifically with respect to this right.  More than 80% of people at that convention voted strongly in favour of such a right.  I would like to hear the witnesses' thoughts on that.  Will they explain, in plain English to those of us who are not lawyers or constitutional experts, why this is valuable, what use this would be to those members of this committee who are genuinely concerned about the state of our housing crisis and would like additional tools to try to resolve those problems?</p></speech>

Constantly in Oireachtas discussions, when more far-reaching proposals were put forward to address the crisis, the Constitution was held up as the barrier.  When the Covid crisis - an almost existential crisis for the State - arose, this barrier was got over.  I do not believe the public needs us to be at this level of crisis to be able to address what everyone acknowledges is a housing and homelessness crisis but it seems the Constitution does, or certainly the political system engaging with the Constitution does.  This was a watershed moment in my thinking but I would have supported the referendum prior to the onset of Covid-19.</p> <p>  As for the constitutional convention on this issue, the important and interesting aspect of this for me was that when citizens entered an iterative discursive unpacking of all of the issues in the three arguments outlined, which always have had a lot of force and effect, more than 80% of people said we should put it in our Constitution.  When citizens enter into this discussion, I believe a referendum on it will be passed because people will see the true value of it.</p> <p>  I have answers for the Deputy's three questions but the lawyers would be much better placed to speak about them, particularly on the right to a free home and interfering with the role of the State.  I will hand over to Ms Keatinge and then we might go to all of my colleagues.</p></speech>

With regard to whether this gives people the right to a free home, it is certainly not the position.  Criticism levelled against such a protection in other countries is that it has not provided people with homes.  In this, we are looking at generalised access to housing for people who are not able to provide for their own housing, as well as providing that to an appropriate standard.  The second section of our proposed wording refers to available resources.  As for this not leading to the building of any homes, it is an enabling provision designed to influence and enable the Government to bring forward progressive policy measures and a legal framework that can develop the housing infrastructure we need to meet the need that is not being met at present.</p> <p>  With regard to interference in the separation of powers, Professor Whyte will pick up on the reasonableness point.  He mentioned the South African example.  This is an assessment of whether the measures being taken by the State are reasonable.  We see cases that would get to the court as being very egregious.  In these situations, the courts will simply pass it over to the Legislature or the State to determine what policy responses are required.</p></speech>

This would give rise to a dialogue whereby the courts would indicate whether there was a problem with a particular policy that needed to be addressed and the matter would be passed back to the other two organs of government.  We have had experience of this in our Constitution in a different context.  If we look at the guarantee of the right to free primary education, in the mid-1990s the High Court in the O'Donoghue case drew attention to the fact that existing educational policy at the time was falling short of the constitutional guarantee because it did not provide properly for children with severe or profound learning difficulties.  Mr. Justice O'Hanlon granted a declaration in the High Court to this effect and ultimately it led to the adoption of State policies providing appropriate support for children at the more severe end of the learning difficulty spectrum.</p><p>That is a good example, which we have in our constitutional order, of how the courts, the Legislature and the Executive would dialogue about the problem, leaving it ultimately to the Legislature and the Executive to come up with a particular solution.</p></speech>

I respect their bona fides.  As a politician of 11 years and a former member of Waterford City and County Council who has dealt with many housing projects, I share their goal that everybody should have secure and adequate housing.  However, as a committee it is our job to interrogate that and to ask the hard questions.  I preface my questions with those remarks.</p> <p>  I would like to know a little more about the potential impact of such a move and a referendum, assuming it is passed.  For example, I would like to know what the witnesses consider to be secure and adequate accommodation.  Is it accommodation leased for one year, two years, five years, ten years or on a lifelong basis?  Is it a small, cramped apartment or a house that is suitable for a person's current or future needs?  If I am an 18-year old who cannot afford to purchase a house, which any young person I know would not be able to do, can I potentially take a case against the State for breaching my constitutional rights in terms of it not being able to provide me with a home, presuming that this referendum is passed?  </p> <p>  I have read the opening statements and I note the reference therein to "within available resources" being stated in the proposed amendment.  Would the witnesses agree that is very subjective?  One could argue, if taking a case against the State on these grounds, that there were plenty of resources available to the State or the Government of the day but, perhaps, they chose not to apply them in the area of housing.  Government must make these very difficult decisions at budget time and all of the time, and it may choose to put additional resources into health over housing or into community over another area.  As somebody taking a case against the State, I could argue that the resources were plenty but the State chose not to use them in that manner.  Are we opening up the State to potential significant legal costs into the future?  I would welcome the witnesses' opinions on those matters.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Cummins for his question.  The first point to make in regard to the definition of "adequate" is that primarily it is for the Oireachtas and policymakers to decide what it means.  This constitutional provision would require the State to make that decision and to have that debate in a substantive way.  If the State fell short on that, it would be open to an individual to challenge that.  At that point, the Judiciary would step in with a form of oversight.  This is common across many different rights areas which already exist in our Constitution.  We would be coming out of the current housing crisis having learned a lot of lessons the hard way.  We want to build on that now by having this constitutional amendment such that the State is committed to investing in housing.  Professor Whyte may be able to expand further on that.</p></speech>

If this constitutional referendum is adopted, we will have a right to private property and a right of access to adequate housing.  In that scenario the Oireachtas would be required to balance two competing rights, for example, to regulate property rights and the rights of landlords to vindicate the right of access to adequate housing.  The Supreme Court indicated a number of years ago that it takes a very deferential approach to any judgment the Oireachtas would make.</p><p>It would only be if the Oireachtas struck a balance which was contrary to reason and fairness that the courts would intervene.  Again, it gets back to this point that having a Constitutional provision would require the Oireachtas and the executive to address housing issues and housing crises but they retain considerable room for manoeuvre.  The courts would only intervene if there were serious or egregious neglect of the rights of somebody to adequate housing.</p></speech>

It sets out seven different characteristics, which include security of tenure, accessibility, cultural adequacy and location.  It is about measuring those factual circumstances the Senator drew out against those characteristics.  There is a whole body of opinion that will guide the Government's consideration around what is adequate, so I do not think it is about specifying the size of an apartment.</p></speech>

We do not believe it is constructive to define an exact form of accommodation that is adequate because every factual situation is different and diverse.  I know this from my own practice.

Those housing needs would be different so I refer the Senator to the characteristics.</p></speech>

It is a very positive movement and I am very familiar with it.  I do not need to be convinced because this is critically important.  I thank the representatives for their papers and the documents they have submitted, which we have all had an opportunity to read.  I want to share some of my observations and comments on this.  I have only one question, which I will ask at the end.</p> <p>  All citizens should have a constitutional right to adequate, secure and affordable housing.  We know that 80% of the participants in the Convention on the Constitution on this issue said as much and that the right should be enshrined in our Constitution.  That is fact and it is worth every member of this committee taking time out to look at the recommendations and the findings.  Some 80% of the people who sat on Convention on the Constitution came out strongly in favour of this referendum.  Providing for the constitutional right to a home will be challenging.  As people identified earlier, it will oblige the State to make reasonable provision to vindicate that right through its policies and its actions.  That is reasonable and fair and would be a natural follow-on from if there were a successful outcome in such a referendum.</p><p>As has been alluded to, more than 80 countries around the world provide a right to housing in their constitutions.  Home for Good identified and considered the issue of providing a constitutional right to housing.  Having read some documentation, we acknowledge that this would not be an instant solution and would not provide homes for everyone.  However, it lays down a marker and it is a good aspiration.  The United Nations special rapporteur on the issue also spoke in favour of it.</p><p> We are in the middle of an unprecedented housing and homelessness crisis.  That sentence has been rolled out often but it is true.  In recent weeks, a number of people who were homeless died.  I am not saying they died because they were homeless but they were homeless when they died.  There are a number of questions around that and we need to ask them of ourselves.</p><p> Thousands of low and middle income families which would once have been able to secure local authority or social and affordable homes are now languishing on never-ending lists.  As someone who spent many years in local government and who was involved with the housing sector generally, I know that we have thousands of people with no hope of a home.  I am not talking about owning a home.  I am not in the business of owning a home.  I do not really care who builds a home, be it public, private, social or in a partnership.  I am talking about having a place to call home in which people feel safe and secure.</p><p> Behind all the homelessness figures, there are lives and real people.  For many years now, this committee has spent most of its time discussing housing and homelessness.  Too many children have nowhere to sleep at night.  A few years ago, the then Government stated that no person would be in a hotel within six months.  That never happened.  People are in emergency accommodation and bed and breakfast and other inappropriate accommodation.  People slept under hedges last night.  That is the reality and the crisis we have.</p><p>We can bring this crisis under control.  We need to believe in ourselves as members of this committee, politicians and advocates for housing.  We need to believe we can bring about and effect real change.  It can be done.  We have land banks of public and private land.  I do not want to get hung up on public versus private because I believe the way forward lies in having synergy and co-operation between the private and public sectors to address this issue.  We have the capacity to build homes.  We have the vision and the land.  We need collaboration and we need to change the direction of policy.  The most important phrase I am hearing today is that housing is a "human right".  It is a human right that people have a place to call home.</p><p> On the formulation of the wording, Ms Keatinge indicated there are two aspects to the recommendation, namely, the recognition of directly enforceable rights because that is important and the separate statement about the State's obligation to realise that right within available resources.  The latter could be used as a bit of a get-out but that is the reality.  How did the witnesses arrive at the formula of words they are recommending?  Will they tease that out for me?</p><p> To be clear, I fundamentally support citizens having a constitutional right to adequate and reasonable housing.  For far too long, we have talked about this crisis across all parties and none.  We can now do something about it.  I am highly impressed when people such as the witnesses, with their strong credentials in housing and advocacy, come to the table.  I thank them for sticking with this issue, pursuing it and, more important, making it simple for people to grasp because that is the real key.  I ask Ms Keatinge to respond on the wording.</p></speech>

It came in the context of Mercy Law Resource Centre's discussion and examination of other jurisdictions, to which I referred.  Home For Good came together and formed a legal subgroup.  A specific objective was to examine what wording might work in an Irish context.  We examined wording from other constitutions and put together a document featuring the wording from all 81 constitutions.  We looked at the Irish legal framework.  We brought in legal experts, including Professor Whyte and others, to examine different formulations.</p><p>Then we examined our constitutional framework, where it would be best positioned and the best wording.  We examined the international guidance I referred to and then arrived at the formulation.</p><p> We are putting our formulation out for discussion and for engagement with the committee.  We have legal experts engaged but we would be interested in hearing everybody's comments on the formulation so we can arrive at the right wording for this referendum.  That is crucial.</p></speech>

The Green Party argued for this referendum to be included in the programme for Government and therefore welcomes the discourse today to make progress on this human right.  As the witnesses mentioned, the Government has an obligation to provide free primary education through the Constitution.  This being the case, could the witnesses state why, according to their understanding, a right to housing has never been part of our Constitution?  Given the strong political support for a referendum, what could hold up the proposed legislation?  How would obstacles be overcome?</p></speech>

The right to free primary education was an outlier.  The Irish Constitution does not specifically recognise any socioeconomic right other than the right to free primary education.  At the turn of this century, the Supreme Court indicated it was not appropriate for the courts to identify implied socioeconomic rights.  That is why we are in the current circumstances, in which we have to argue for referring the matter to the people to allow them to vote on including a right to adequate housing in the Constitution.</p></speech>

If the Oireachtas decides to have a referendum, we will go to the people and we will state our case.  When the matter was brought to the Convention on the Constitution, these arguments were all played out.  Some very authoritative people on both sides of the argument spoke to the members and there were significant conversations.  It was felt that some of the decisions that emerged from that process were far too radical and would never be accepted by the public but they were fully endorsed by the public so I do not believe there is an issue.</p> <p>  To go back to the first question, it seems there is an historical context.  When the Constitution was written, food was much more expensive than housing.  There was an abundance of housing.  We had a very different country and context.  For me, part of this process is modernising the Constitution to reflect the world and country we are in now.</p></speech>

I appreciate all the work that has been done on this issue to date.  The Social Democrats have been very supportive of a constitutional right to housing.  It is good to see near cross-party consensus on this.</p><p>According to research carried out by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, approximately 13 different Bills could not go through the Oireachtas and proceed on the basis of the Constitution, which is certainly one of the reasons we need this referendum.  As has been referenced, the Constitutional Convention in 2014 recommended a constitutional amendment to include the right to housing.  This has been knocking about and has been before other Oireachtas committees.  It is now in the programme for Government and there is a proposed wording for a referendum on the right to housing.  What sort of timeframe do our guests think we are looking at?  What sort of preparatory work would be needed on the wording and building political consensus?  What sort of timeframe are we looking at?  We do not know when we can have a referendum because of Covid-19 but if we park that consideration and assume it would not be a factor, how soon could we have a referendum?  How soon do our guests think we need to have a referendum on this matter?  There is a strong argument from a housing rights perspective.  We also know from previous cycles that if commitments included in a programme for Government do not happen within the first couple of years, they will not always be delivered on in the final year, or whatever.  What would be our guests' views about the timing of a referendum?</p></speech>

Getting agreement to a date for the referendum would be fantastic because it would give us a framework within which to engage the public and agree a form of wording.  A referendum within a year would be our preference but we are bearing in mind difficulties around that.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked if we feel the referendum is urgent; we absolutely do.  A good example of why we think it is urgent is the recent legislation banning evictions that came to an end in July.  There is now a much narrower restriction in place as long as level 5 is activated.  It is only at the highest level of lockdown that there are protections in place to protect people from homelessness.  That is the case because of constitutional concerns.  It just shows that not only have there been historical Bills and the Deputy mentioned the Oireachtas research briefing, but there is an ongoing issue even in the midst of a public health crisis.  There is a real urgency to this and we would like to see it advanced as soon as possible.</p></speech>

If this is brought in, we would have clarity as to how far the Oireachtas wants to go or not when it comes to housing initiatives.  It would remove the constitutional argument as a barrier and something that is used to delay progress.  It would be useful because it then becomes purely a matter of what the Oireachtas or the Government want to do or do not want to do.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses from Home for Good.  The committee and I firmly believe that everybody needs a home.  It is a human right and, as previous speakers said, we are in a different world now.  I have been a councillor, Senator and Deputy for more than 20 years and have seen the need and criteria for housing over the years.  This referendum has to happen.  The policy measure to meet the need is the biggest issue we will have, going forward.  That needs to be addressed, whether we are considering people living with disabilities or older people.  People are living longer and the housing systems within the 31 local authorities are not catering for that fact.  All of us here know people who suffer from mental health problems.  Local authorities are not equipped to deal with people who are looking for housing.  We must implement policies to meet the needs and criteria of how people are living now.</p><p>Families and single people are coming to me now.  We have no housing for single people.  This needs to happen.  We cannot leave it any longer.  All of us have a duty to the people of Ireland to meet and to give them this referendum so that we can change policy because we are falling down on policy.  We cannot blame our local authorities but we, as a Government, have to do this.  One of the speakers said that, hopefully, this should be done within a year.  As we know, in 2014 this was spoken about and we said it would happen but we need to make it happen now.  </p><p> The Government is paying out so much money on rented properties to local authorities through HAPs for people who are looking for housing and we now need a policy to build.  To do this we need proper legislation and policies in each local authority.  We need to look at a different road and to build more rather than having rented properties.</p><p> We also need to look at the eviction ban.  I do not want to see anybody facing homelessness or families living in hotels which is a very emotional issue.  I am dealing with cases in Carlow where I have particular people who are in homeless situation and are in this position for over a year now.  That is unacceptable.  I am aware that we cannot solve everything overnight with a referendum but by putting this into the Constitution we can make significant changes.  We need a proper referendum and a Constitution in which we can deal with everyday living.  </p><p> We have lost that.  Everybody is doing their best and I am not here to criticise anyone.  Due to our situation and the way in which everybody&rsquo;s livelihood has changed, people who are working and are looking for mortgages cannot get them anymore.  These people are working and paying such high rents and we have no proper policy in place for them.  We cannot say that they do not have to go on the local authority list because we can now help them to get a mortgage.  That is what is happening.  This policy with a referendum will play a significant part in people&rsquo;s lives and will give people a different outlook on what we can do as a Government to give them that better quality of life which people need.  Children need to know that they have a home and if we cannot deliver on this, as a Government, we are failing our country.  </p><p> My questions are as follows.  The timescale is of great importance.  Speaking on the housing committee is fine but have our Home for Good Coalition guest witnesses been meeting with other organisations?  In order for us to move forward and more quickly on this, what do our witnesses believe we need to do now, besides our meeting today?  What do they believe we can deliver upon to ensure that we get this referendum and can bring in proper policies to meet the criteria of the changing times that we are living in now?  That is the biggest issue here as we are in a completely different world now.  </p><p> I welcome this proposal and I will give it my full support.  I see it in my own constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny where I am dealing with families every day.  It is getting harder.  It is just one case after another.  People are getting angry and think that they are forgotten.  We cannot allow this to continue any longer.  What do we need to do in order that we are not sitting here again in another six years with no referendum or change in the Constitution, or do not have the proper policies that need to be brought into our local authorities, through the Government?  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

Ultimately, it is the Oireachtas that will decide this.  I know that this committee engages regularly with the Minister who has oversight of housing.  I hope that we can move very quickly to a process where a wording is agreed.  Deputy O'Callaghan noted the fact that we are in the middle of a pandemic so there is fluidity around that issue.  We could, however, within the next six months decide on a wording and be ready to go with a constitutional referendum.  It is then a case of when we schedule it to ensure that we keep everybody safe, which is the priority.  I do not see any bar to us deciding this in the next six months.  The Department will obviously have its own opinion on that.  Do Professor Whyte or Ms Hennigan wish to come in on this point?</p></speech>

I have a couple of questions on how the wording was arrived at and what is included in it.  Did the group consider including &quot;security of tenure&quot; in the wording?  &quot;Security&quot; and &quot;adequacy&quot; can be two separate things.  Did the group give consideration to that?  If so, what were the reasons it was decided to go with the more general wording?  Did the group consider things such as proportionality to income?  One can have adequate housing that is not proportionate to income and one can then be left with income inadequacy in other areas.</p><p>Of the 83 constitutions that protect the right to housing, could Ms Keatinge provide a couple of examples of court-directed interventions?  What has been the effect of those constitutional protections?  There is a good mini-series that came out last year called &quot;Show Me a Hero&quot;.  There was a federal court-directed construction of public housing in that.  This happened in Yonkers, New York in the 1980s.  I would be interested in that type of example.  In terms of protection of housing in a constitution, what has the outcome of that been?  Have there been court directions to build public housing or just to facilitate an environment in which housing is built?  Is there an over-reliance on the private sector in that, as sometimes happens in Ireland? </p><p>In more general terms, what actions do the witnesses think could have been taken in this country over the last number of years that have not been taken because of what the witnesses consider overly restrictive interpretation of the legal advice?  I am particularly interested in the area of a more general eviction ban, not in the context of a pandemic, and also in the area of rent caps and rent freezes.  Many people will argue that Blake <i>v</i>. Attorney General was not about rent freezes and that it was a particular judgment which does not mean there is a blanket ban on rent increases.</p><p>I am also interested in the area of legislation to back up the amendment because that has worked successfully in other referendums we have had in terms of killing the more vexatious arguments that can come out.  We have even heard such arguments in this room today relating to an 18-year-old demanding a house to buy for themselves.  I have concerns that some arguments could be made that this could become a developer's charter.  A developer could take the State to court saying he or she should be able to build 30 storeys because this will provide housing.  We have heard developers use the housing crisis in their arguments to create developers' charters.  They said strategic housing development, SHD, would give us many housing units and we have not seen that happen.</p><p>Like Deputy O'Callaghan, I would like to hear about the next steps.  What would the witnesses like to happen following this meeting?  As Deputy &Oacute; Broin said, previous committees have discussed this issue.  How do the witnesses think we should proceed?</p></speech>

I will refer almost all of them to my colleagues, starting with Professor Whyte.</p> <p>  On the politics of the situation and what the committee can do, we have started a process here today.  The quality of the questioning has been useful.  In terms of developing wording, this could well be the committee to do that.  If this committee could decide on the wording within six months that would be incredibly welcome.  I will pass the other substantive questions to Professor Whyte.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.243" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerard Whyte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110300002#O00300"><p>On some of the questions posed by Senator Moynihan, the first point related to security of tenure and whether that is separate and distinct from adequacy.  Our reliance on the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights addresses that point.  Security of tenure under that covenant is seen as an aspect of access to adequate housing.  We consciously used language from that covenant so that these sorts of issues would be encompassed in the wording we have proposed.<br/><br/>In terms of examples of court-directed interventions, I do not want to repeat myself but the South African example is probably the most obvious place to go to.  It adopted its Constitution in 1996 and made explicit provision for the right of access to adequate housing.  That was done while being conscious of the fact that Irish people, judges, lawyers and politicians could look to the South African experience with that wording and see how it panned out there. <br/><br/>As I said earlier, the court engages in a dialogue with the Legislature and Executive.  It holds up the policies of the State and tests them against the principle of reasonableness.  It is only where the State falls short when there is some sort of egregious neglect of the housing needs of a group of people that the courts will require the authorities to take some steps.  It will leave it to the authorities to decide what those steps are, as long as they are reasonable.<br/><br/>On what actions could be taken now that might have been seen as being precluded in the past because of the emphasis on the right to private property, rent freezes were mentioned.  The Senator is right.  The Blake case was quite a peculiar and specific case in the 1980s.  The issue in that case was not so much the concept of a rent freeze <i>per se</i>.  Rather, it was the fact that the legislation was old and anachronistic which led to situations where the ability of landlords to charge rent was being restricted when the landlord was more economically needy than the tenant.  It was that element of arbitrariness that was the problem with the rent restriction legislation struck down in that case, not the concept of regulating rents <i>per se</i>.  If a constitutional referendum was introduced it would set a balance against the right to private property that featured in the Blake case and would enhance the room for manoeuvre that the Oireachtas would have for regulating property rights.</p></speech>

If a provision in the Constitution is very specific there is a risk that we are essentially stuck with that wording and an understanding of that wording which is very much rooted in a time and place.  The Constitution, we hope, extends over the decades.</p><p>Consequently, there is much to be said for leaving some scope for developing that language, in particular through legislation where making changes is much easier.  Along with what Professor Whyte mentioned, that is why we went with this general wording.</p><p> Regarding what actions could have been taken that have not been so far, I do not need to tell the housing committee about the chilling effect of Article 43 on many measures that might have been introduced, for example, rent freezes, rent caps and anti-eviction measures for families that would otherwise be homeless.  A number of policy and legislative proposals over the past few years from Private Members and the Government have stalled, usually on Second Stage, over constitutional concerns.  There are two problems with that.  First, we do not always see that constitutional advice.  Second, we never get into a discussion on the substantive policy itself and whether it would make a difference to the housing crisis and the people affected.  Moving us past that point will have a significant benefit in terms of getting to grips with the issues and asking ourselves whether rent freezes would make a difference and do they constitute a substantive policy that we should pursue instead of stopping short at the initial point of it being unconstitutional due to Article 43.</p></speech>

This is a major issue.  In my maiden speech after I was first elected to Cork City Council in 2009, I spoke on the homelessness and housing crisis.  I was actually challenged on that and told that there was no crisis but anyone who was on the ground could see it.  Here we are 11 years later in the midst of the worst housing crisis in the history of the State.  It is why we support a referendum.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, has been a fierce advocate and has led the charge on housing and homelessness.</p> <p>  I wish to ask a few questions.  For the people we represent, the housing crisis does not just affect people who are sleeping on the streets or in shelters or emergency accommodation.  There can be three generations of the same family in one house.  People are sleeping on couches.  There are families who have broken up, with the mother and kids in one house and the father on his own or with some of the kids in his parents' house.  It is a tragedy that needs to be resolved, which is why this referendum is key.  I understand that it will not solve the housing crisis by itself but it will be a tool to help us down the road of putting policies in place whereby we can tackle the crisis in a constructive way.</p> <p>  Due to the D&aacute;il's extension of the eviction ban the week before last, people who had been facing eviction can now stay on into the new year.  However, we will still face the issue of notices to quit and evictions in January and February.  This major issue needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  Whose job do the witnesses believe it is to define social and affordable housing?  The programme for Government states there will be a referendum on housing.  Have the witnesses met the Minister to discuss what he considers to be in the programme for Government?  Is it a referendum on housing or a referendum on the right to housing?  Is it a referendum on housing as a human right?  Have the witnesses asked the Minister these questions?</p> <p>  A question was asked about how far the Government wanted to go.  We need to move on a referendum as quickly as possible.  We want to support the witnesses.  I have met them already on this matter.  I listened with great interest about the wording and how the witnesses were trying to bring everyone together and progress this.  I want to be constructive and we want complete cross-party support in that regard.  I would like to hear the witnesses' thoughts on my questions.</p></speech>

Ms Hennigan may have some remarks to make as well.</p> <p>  We have seen that a right to housing has been included in the programme for Government.  We are encouraged by the public statements by the Minister and, most recently, the T&aacute;naiste indicating that this has been interpreted to mean a right to housing.  That is our understanding.  We very much hope to meet with Minister and we have written to him to seek a meeting.  We hope to have a constructive engagement with him and his officials.  We are here to present wording and to engage with members of the committee today and we also want to engage with the Minister and his Department so that we can arrive at something that will bring everyone along in what we hope will be an inclusive and constructive process.</p> <p>  In terms of defining social and affordable housing, and to speak to the points raised by Senator Moynihan, the wording we propose is quite stark.  It is not detailed because we do not see the Constitution as a place to include a detailed description of a form of housing.  We believe that housing should be adequate, a matter to which Professor Whyte spoke, and that is what is defined and explored in General Comment No. 4, the document to which I referred the committee earlier.  I refer to words such as "affordable" and "secure".  These are all things that we are on board with but we do not feel that the Constitution is the appropriate place to include them.  We also think that there are interpretative difficulties with those two words as well.  That is my comment on how we have arrived at the wording.  Ms Hennigan may have something to add.</p></speech>

We will be led by the committee in terms of what happens next but, as Mr. Stanley has mentioned, there is a need to have some kind of agreement on a form of wording.  We are conscious that it does not have to be our wording, as presented.  Members might like to engage with our wording a little further and make their own amendments.  Having a form of wording that involves a consensus, particularly on the part of a cross-party committee like this one, would be helpful to us when we meet the Minister and engage with him on a referendum on the right to housing.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Keatinge and Mr. Stanley for their presentation.  I thank Ms Hennigan and Professor Whyte for their responses.  I thank everybody who works in this crucial area for us on the front line.</p> <p>  I am in the same position as everyone else in this room.  I want to be part of a society where everybody has access to safe, secure and appropriate accommodation.  I do not want to live in a society where families are being raised in hotels or tents are erected in parks and along canals.  I want to make sure that we change that and I want to play my part in changing that.</p> <p>  I agree that we, not just as a Government but also as a nation, need a strong statement in respect of housing, not just now but also in the form of a continuing commitment that will tie in successive Governments to policy commitments on the right to adequate housing.  The witnesses have clearly explained that a constitutional right to a home does not mean that everybody becomes entitled to a free house.  I would love if they could explain a little bit more the additional legal obligations a constitutional right to housing would put on the State.  The witnesses have likened it to a right to education.  My understanding is that the right to education places an obligation on the State to provide enough schools and sufficient school places.  If a right to housing is introduced, would it then be up to the State to provide enough houses and accommodation at all times for our expanding population?  Would the responsibility be divided between the private sector developers, whose business it is to build homes, and the State?  Would it be a legal position that the buck stops with the State because local authorities are responsible for the zoning of land and the granting of planning permission?</p><p>I am also wondering if additional legal obligations would be put on banks to allow people to access mortgages and what impact that would have on people's household budgets.  I am interested to hear how "adequate accommodation" would be defined and what legal questions arise in specific circumstances.  I have two examples.  If a situation arises where a homeless person for whatever reason prefers not to enter accommodation, does that homeless person waive his or her right or can a third party bring a case on his or her behalf?  My second example is in the case of family separations and relationship breakdowns.  For example, in a situation where a couple or a family were self-sufficient in terms of their housing need but now, unexpectedly, their housing need doubles because they need two homes instead of one, and often two quite large homes in the case of shared custody, what role, if any, would the State be expected to play in intervening in such circumstances?</p><p> My questions relate to the impact and implications of a constitutional right to housing.  I would like to understand better the witnesses' perspective on that and I thank them.</p></speech>

I pointed out those characteristics of the right, which include security of tenure, accessibility, affordability, availability of infrastructure and cultural adequacy, habitability and location.  Those characteristics are the touchstone in terms of what adequate provision would look like.</p> <p>  As for those two examples, the situation of the homeless person who has refused an offer of accommodation is quite familiar to me in my own day-to-day practice.  This constitutional protection operates rationally and proportionally, and in circumstances where an offer has been made, I cannot see that it will come to the assistance of that individual in circumstances where that offer was made of adequate housing.</p> <p>  As for the separated family, in the current architecture such a family would be able to register their housing need with the local authority and I am not sure it will recast that in any great sense.  I suppose our overarching aim with this is that it influences the broader housing infrastructure and essentially enables more progressive policies that increase housing supply that ultimately mean that those two families will not be waiting for a considerable period in perhaps insecure private rented accommodation and they may be able to get more secure accommodation, be that through greater security of tenure or State housing.</p> <p>  I might pass over to Professor Whyte on the analogy with primary education.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.260" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerard Whyte" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110300002#R00300"><p>In relation to primary education, the wording used in the Constitution is that "The State shall provide for free primary education".  We do not use that exact formula.  We talk about the State recognising and vindicating this right to access adequate housing.  What that means is that the State cannot be passive in relation to a housing crisis.  It cannot sit on its hands and just decide that it will abdicate its responsibility to the markets.  The State has to take some action to ensure everyone has access to adequate housing.</p> <p>  The State can do that, under our wording, in one or both of two ways.  Clearly, the State could get involved directly in providing housing.  The State did this historically in the past and continues to do it to some level, but the State could ramp up its efforts in that regard in directly providing.  Equally, and here one has the analogy with the education clause, the State could support others, perhaps financially, in addressing the need for adequate housing.  The obligation, though, is imposed only on the State, at least, directly.  This referendum would not impose any direct constitutional obligations, in my opinion anyway, on third parties such as banks.  As to whether the State would wish to see fit to legislate for such obligations, if the State saw fit to legislate for such obligations, this clause would protect that legislation but that would be a step beyond the referendum itself or beyond this constitutional clause.</p></speech>

I would welcome a constitutional right to housing.  I have been in construction all my life and I have listened to people in the room talking about building houses and giving people the right to live.  When co-living was brought up recently in the D&aacute;il, I voted against it because there should not be any co-living.  When we consider the Covid virus today, I do not believe we should have 20 people sharing accommodation and sharing one kitchen and one sitting room.  I do not believe in one-bed units and there should be no units that have fewer than two bedrooms.  If somebody gets sick, they will need someone to cater for them.  In addition, the building cost to build a two-bed unit is only 10% more than that of a one-bed unit.</p> <p>  From a rural point of view and in the context of giving everyone the right to a house, under the Project Ireland 2040 plan, an environmental impact study has to be done for any project that requires planning.  I am thinking of rural parts of County Limerick outside the city.  If people are looking for the right to housing and the right to live, rural Ireland has no infrastructure and has had no investment in infrastructure over the past ten years, when it has been looking for it.  If people want a right to live in Oola, therefore, they cannot live there because there is no infrastructure.  Askeaton has been 30 years looking for a sewerage plant and, again, people cannot have a right to live there either.  All I am hearing with regard to the right to live is about people within a city area where there is infrastructure.  However, for people living in an area that has no public transport, or very little, and no infrastructure, where do they get a right to live if they want to live in their own area?  That is my question.  Once people leave a large town or city, there is no infrastructure for them to have a right to live in their own area.</p> <p>  If there are estates to be built in certain areas, who will the rights be given to?  For example, the local authority might get a parcel of land, although people might have bought land in a certain area or bought a house in the boom times because they wanted a location.  We will want to provide housing for everyone, so they can work together in areas.  If people have a right to live, do they have a right to live in County Limerick?  Do they have a right to live in an area which does not have infrastructure or investment?  Is the right to live only where there is infrastructure at the moment? </p></speech>

This is something that needs to be engaged with and needs to be acceptable to everybody.  This is not about people who live in cities, although I appreciate the discussion seems to be focused on that.</p> <p>  In terms of "adequacy", we have gone for that word because adequacy does not encompass just simply the physical dimensions of where people are living but also encompasses a range of aspects of the type of housing, including infrastructure.  All of those elements would require planning, legislation, resources and political will, so there is a whole element to that which is not within the scope of this proposal.  However, I point to the general comments that I highlighted.  It is not proposed that this would simply protect a structure; this is designed to promote housing and living in the broad sense of the word.  I will pass over to Ms Hennigan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.263" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rosemary Hennigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110300002#S00300"><p>One interesting way to look at this is to take the example of how the right to housing works in Finland.  It is not so much a right to a house in a place of a person's choice but more about building into our laws and planning, and our decisions on budget and infrastructure, a thought and a consideration for housing and for the impact on people of housing.</p><p>That is one of the very important effects of the right to housing.  In that specific case, when it comes to decisions on investment in Limerick, infrastructure such as roads and all of those kinds of issues, one would ask how that will have an impact on the right to housing locally in Limerick or anywhere in the country.  It works more in that sense.  Finland, for example, which Ms Keatinge mentioned briefly earlier, has a pre-legislative rights committee, which it set up as a way to vindicate the right to housing in a way that works best for it.  An Oireachtas committee such as this one would sit down and consider, when dealing with planning legislation, how it impacts on the right to housing and what needs to be considered to vindicate that right.  That is probably the way that we would see the right to housing working in that sort of case.</p></speech>

They are already involved in our infrastructure but I am looking at this from a planning law point of view.  We have many buildings that are derelict and many under conservation orders.  Under the current planning regulations, those buildings cannot be done up.  They cannot afford to do up those properties even though they are enrolled within our current infrastructure.  It is about getting people into areas where such buildings are already listed in the infrastructure within our areas.  We have buildings under conservation orders across the county that cannot be done up because that has to be done in accordance with the conservation laws but it is not affordable to do that under the laws.  I believe that conservation buildings in towns and villages that are not iconic should be allowed keep the front facade and the roof structure and then be modernised.  We should get people back into villages and living in such buildings, which are already included in our infrastructure.  When this is being handed down to our local authorities the investment needs to go back out into the counties.  As we can see in this pandemic, people are trying to move out of the cities to areas where they can have more space.  The buildings are available.  The infrastructure is there, in parts, but it is not in the entire county.  I want this to cover everyone.</p></speech>

I have a question on other jurisdictions.  Ms Hennigan mentioned Finland.  Did it start from the same position as Ireland in having a private property right enshrined in its constitution?  Are we starting from the same place as Finland or the other international examples she gave?</p> <p>  I do not have the wording in front of me but I refer to available resources.  We need more clarity on what Ms Hennigan means by "available resources".</p> <p>  Following on from Deputy O'Donoghue's point, in terms of our land activation or housing provision policy and our objectives in regard to cost rental or land being subject to CPO, what policies have been stymied by the lack of balance in the Constitution, which is tipped more towards private property rights than the right to housing?  What type of policies does she believe would be more successful if there was such a balance in the Constitution?</p></speech>

It is a different constitutional system.  Whenever we look at those international comparators, there are limits to them.  We raised them because in creating this sort of a right we have options open to us in terms of how we as a state will go about vindicating that right, especially in terms of economic and social rights.  They are different so it does not have to be business as usual in terms of how we interact with them.  We can develop our own way of doing that in the best way for Ireland, bearing in mind our own constitutional system.  It is worth looking to other jurisdictions in that sense but my colleagues might have more on that for the Chairman.</p> <p>  In terms of the policies that might have been brought forward were it not for this protection of private property rights, Article 43 does have regard for the common good.  What we are seeing in many cases is that Bills do not even get past Second Stage.</p><p>I have not seen the courts look at Article 43 and determine what the content of it might be, as regards private property rights.  That means that we are very much stuck with case law from decades ago which is tied up in different contexts, and that is very important to think about when we are looking at this issue.  However, at the same time, there is a very deep political chilling effect from Article 43, which we have seen in a range of different areas, the most recent one being the eviction ban which came to an end in July 2020.  As I said, we do not know what the reason was for that, but it is on the record that it was constitutional concerns.  I do not want to repeat myself, but in circumstances where there is an ongoing public health threat to the extent that we can close restaurants, pubs, caf&eacute;s, shops, yet we can only protect the interests of tenants in the private rental market in a very narrow way, then we really have to ask ourselves if Article 43 can have a outside influence on our political culture when it comes to housing policy and law.</p></speech>

I know that in the context of the conversations that were had around it, we wanted to emphasise that ultimately, somebody who is a homeowner currently has the protection of the sanctity of their personal life, and the protection of their private property.  Following a change to the Constitution, they would also have the protection of their home and housing in the Constitution, so it would be another addition to the homeowner in that way.  Perhaps Professor Whyte wants to build on that comment.</p></speech>

Therefore, this right to housing does not threaten homeowners - if anything, it enhances the protection available to them under the Constitution.</p></speech>

Our primary concern here is homelessness and the provision of housing.  If this right is put into the Constitution, could it go further in terms of adequate housing, in areas such as universal housing design, adaptability, future use etc.?  Could it be called on that it is in the Constitution that we provide adequate housing and housing of an adequate size where we are looking at the average occupancy rates of houses now dropping, so that going forward, planning permissions or applications have to meet adequate design standards?</p></speech>

I will defer to Professor Whyte or Ms Keatinge on the legal impact of those kind of changes in terms of the long-term viability of different housing options and how we might look at it.  I would imagine that certainly constitutional change would increase the capacity for the necessary conversations.  I will hand over to Professor Whyte on the legal force and effect of such change.</p></speech>

First, I wish to state my clear commitment to the right to housing and I am appreciative that it is included in the programme for Government.  I am a little disappointed that we have had arguments perhaps being rehearsed here that were made by the previous Government about why this would not happen.  This is a Government commitment and I believe all parties to the Government should be committed to championing it, and I hope that we can continue to do that in this committee.</p><p>My fear is this will pass but make no practical difference, so let us ensure that when it passes, it will have teeth.</p><p> I looked back at the document published by Mercy Law Resource Centre and the Trinity free legal advice centre in 2014, which is a really good synopsis for any members who wish to read about international examples.  One of the biggest issues seems to be that of judicial activism.  There is a fear that even if this referendum passed and a case was brought to court, and if the State pointed to the homeless assistance payment, HAP, homelessness hubs and emergency accommodation, the case would be lost and there would be no additional obligation.  That would be a greatly missed opportunity.  Given the State's failure to interpret the terms "public good" or "social justice" in the Constitution in an ambitious way, I am sceptical that it would do differently in this case.  That is something we need to think about.</p><p> In the environmental area, we talked about moving away from individual change to systems change.  Again, the proposed wording leans too heavily on individual change rather than systems change.  Local authority members have said the real reason for many difficulties is private property rights.  There cannot be a complete ban on evictions or rent increases because of property rights.  None of the proposed wording would necessarily allow the Government to do that.  We would put the obligation on the Government to provide housing but not give it the tools to balance that against private property rights.  I am very concerned about the phrase "within its resources".  I would like to remove that and to see how it could be teased out.  Why was consideration not given to defining the common good in the context of a right to housing?  Even if there is a balance and we still have to pay full market value to developers or property owners, which does not provide any affordability or enable us to deliver housing, that will not achieve what we want either.</p><p> We are leaning too strongly towards individual change.  I think we should focus a little more on the interpretation of the common good in the context of providing housing, although I greatly appreciate our guests' work.</p></speech>

This was considered through the Home for Good Coalition and the legal subgroup.  Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that a stand-alone right would provide much greater protection and have greater force and impact.  That is because two stand-alone rights would be competing against each other, rather than the internal tweaking and balance that happens, which has been the block that has been identified and discussed to such an extent during the meeting.</p></speech>

In other forums, such as the Finnish example, there is similar phrasing but it has led to legislation being examined in a broader way and not just in respect of the individual rights.  For example, in our report on Finland, the constitutional committee that Ms Hennigan mentioned considered legislation that would give subsidy to entities providing social housing and whether they could sell the properties.  It was ultimately decided that would not be consistent with the constitutional protection to the right to housing because it would reduce the stock.  That is looking at the broader, more systemic impact it could have.  Professor Whyte will speak to the broader constitutional architecture.  It is fitting that within the architecture, it is phrased as "all persons", and that it states that all policies and legislative measures will have an impact on persons.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's query about judicial activism, we at Mercy Law Resource Centre have been working very much at the sharp end of the housing crisis.  We work with homeless families, many of whom are constituents whom members will have met.  The 1988 Act is a discretionary provision.  At the moment, we rely on rights around the edges, such as the rights to fair procedure and to family life, but this measure would enable us to tell local authorities they need to act in a manner compatible with the Constitution, which protects access to adequate housing.  It would recast how that assessment would be done.  As Professor Whyte has highlighted, we do not foresee matters coming before the courts.  This is not designed to create legal cases.

It goes back to the point we made earlier that where there are two competing constitutional rights, and where the Oireachtas attempts to balance those rights, the court will only upset that legislative balance if the balance is completely contrary to reason, rationality or fairness.  Currently, with regard to property rights, there is a guarantee of private property qualified by the concept of the common good.  That is a different situation, and we do not really have enough detail as to what the common good requires in this specific situation to predict confidently that legislation restricting private property rights would pass.  However, in a scenario in which we are told legislation will be sustained by the courts unless it is unreasonable and contrary to common sense, that gives a lot of room for the Oireachtas to legislate on security of tenure, rent freezes and the like.  Therefore, from a technical point of view, I think that inserting in the Constitution this specific right to access to adequate housing would address the issue of the perceived limits on the ability of the Oireachtas to legislate in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.284" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2020110300002#W00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation and all the background documentation, which I have read.  I completely support the objective of prioritising housing and security of tenure.  Everyone should have the right to a secure home.  I have been involved in the provision of social housing, worked with the homeless and, as a public representative, advocated on behalf of families in need.  I therefore support absolutely the spirit of the witnesses' presentation and the work they are doing.  Over recent years, as we have emerged from an economic crisis, and it is the economic element I wish to address, we have seen a rise year on year in the provision of housing, with this year seeing the largest ever commitment in that regard.</p><p>My question arises from the witnesses' positioning of the proposed amendment under Article 43 and the use of its placement within that article.  I hear them in that this is a qualifying right to the interpretation of the right to private property and how that would be applied.  I hear them also on the chilling effect it has and respect that contention.  To be fair, as a lawyer who has worked in a <i>pro bono</i>capacity trying to keep people in their homes as a consequence of sub-prime lending and so on, I could see it being a really useful tool for me arguing in court.  The wording of it does raise concern, however.  There is a lack of precision in the term &quot;adequate housing&quot;.  I understand why at a constitutional level one would want as broad a church as possible.  Then, however, we get into what is adequate.  How does any Government start legislating as to what is adequate?  Does it mean that children have to have a bedroom each?  I think we could get into that, and that concerns me.</p><p>The greater concern I have with the amendment, however, are the words &quot;within the available resources&quot;.  That means we will have competing rights within a budget or within the context of a pandemic or an economic crisis arising from an exuberance of policy.  One of my judicial heroes is Mr. Justice Peter Kelly.  He got himself into a lot of hot water back in 2000 by attempting to injunct Ministers in the application of policy on care packages for young people.</p><p>Did the witnesses consider perhaps addressing Article 45 instead and looking at invigorating that?</p><p>Any Government putting forward a budget must look at competing spends.  My concern is this could go in, and its aspiration is fantastic and the right is fantastic, but it could end up being non-justiciable because we will have a budget competition.  If we were addressing the idea of social policy, and Article 45 specifically speaks to the directive of social policy, why not then include housing or a roof over people's head?  I assume the amendment would not propose that no one would ever rent again and that we would arrive at such nirvana.  There will always be different types of tenure, whether that is home ownership or rental.  Was any consideration given to the possibility of ensuring that in the competing budgetary rights we could move the right to a roof over people's heads higher, with the Government being directive on social policy in this respect?  Consequently, flowing from this we could have the administration of budget happening on a particular hierarchy, such as homes always being above law and order.  We could look at it in this way, whereby a radical overhaul of Article 45 would be a consideration.  I am interested to hear what the witnesses have to say on this.</p></speech>

They cannot be relied on by the courts when the courts are scrutinising the laws the Oireachtas has made.  If this clause were to go into Article 45 and if, at some point, there was a concern that some piece of legislation did not adequately vindicate the right to access adequate housing, its location in Article 45 would mean the courts could not entertain that argument.  This is why we consciously decided it should be a stand-alone right.  We propose it would have its own clause in the Constitution.  The numeration simply reflects the fact that it comes between the existing Article 43 on private property and Article 44 on the completely unrelated issue of religion.  Saying it is Article 43A does not mean it is a subordinate part of the guarantee of private property.  If this were to go through they would be two separate provisions, in the same way that children's rights are protected in a separate provision in Article 42A of the Constitution.</p></speech>

It comes back to the fact that the right is being attached to individuals and not to the Oireachtas.  I would have thought putting the impetus and obligation on the Oireachtas would be a more secure means of ensuring it would be more effective in budgetary allocation.  If we are always going to have the qualification of available resources it does not secure the right.</p></speech>

The reason we included the availability of resources was more to safeguard the role of the Oireachtas within it.  It is also to draw out the reality that a court will not overstep these bounds.  It is not usually what our courts do.  We have made this explicit within the clause but, in any event, it is not something the courts generally do as I am sure the Senator is aware.  A constitutional amendment can only do so much.  It can lead and create a political culture, and this is what we hope to do, but it very much will depend on the political will in the Oireachtas to act on it.  When it comes to budgetary decisions and how allocations are made the Constitution is not the best place to do it.</p><p>All it can do is set out a value, a principle and a framework for what we, the people, think should be done.  We then hand over those decisions to the Oireachtas.  I understand what the Senator means about it positioning the right in terms of individuals' access to courts.  We see it as doing both.  It both empowers the Oireachtas to better legislate in this area and, in the extreme cases which Ms Keatinge mentioned, it gives an individual the ability to step forward and declare that he or she has fallen through the gaps and has a right to housing that has not been vindicated. </p></speech>

Something very significant has happened in this meeting today.  This is the first time in my five years in the Oireachtas that a clear majority of the housing committee has spoken in favour of the holding of a referendum to enshrine the right to housing in the Constitution.  That is really significant.  I say that while not in any way questioning the motives of other members who have different views or are still teasing out the issue because that is the purpose of this committee.  We tried very hard to get that commitment into the 2016 report of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness but we did not succeed.  We also tried to get into subsequent documents of the committee but we could not do that either.  This is a really positive moment. </p> <p>  I suggest that on foot of this meeting, the Chairman write to the Minister setting out a flavour of the different views of the committee, because all of the views of the committee are valid, but also urging him to meet the Home for Good Coalition at the earliest available opportunity to take this dialogue to the next step.  I do not think the committee should commit to a position one way or another because there are differing views but the Chairman could set out a cross-section of our views and ask the Minister to meet the Home for Good Coalition.  I think that would be a positive outcome from what has been a very good discussion today.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that this has been a very worthwhile meeting and that there is consensus but it is important that we tease out the issue further.  The Constitution is very precious and important.  Any proposed changes to it must be well-thought out and well balanced.  I agree there is broad consensus and that the committee should write to the Minister.  My colleagues and I will take up the matter with the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy O'Brien.  We should be ambitious.  Once Cover is over, let us be ready and make this happen.  Let us give people the opportunity to amend our Constitution to reflect our societal values.  There will obviously be a great deal of work for politicians to do, not just in this Oireachtas but in future Oireachtais, to deliver on the constitutional commitment that I believe the people of Ireland will approve.

NPHET met last Thursday, October 29, and reviewed the latest epidemiological data.  In the interests of time, I will just refer to the data rather than going through the details, given that they will have changed ever so slightly over the course of recent days.  The data are set out in the first two pages of my submission.</p> <p>  Internationally speaking, our national epidemiological profile is occurring in the context of a widespread resurgence of this disease across Europe.  We have seen reports and have shared concerns at the deteriorating situation globally, particularly in Europe and North America where governments are facing common challenges, which have required many countries to reintroduce restrictions of the kind we have in place.  Some of the worst affected places at present are capitals and major cities in Europe and there is pressure on ICU capacity in several cities.  The average seven-day incidence across EU and UK countries is 241 per 100,000 population, which compares with 169 in the previous seven-day period, indicating the deteriorating situation across Europe.  Data reported by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, on 28 October rank Ireland 17th out of 31 countries in terms of 14-day incidence rates.  In terms of the seven-day incidence rate, the epidemiological situation in Ireland compares more favourably with European counterparts.  According to NPHET&rsquo;s figures from last week, there had been a 20% decline in the seven-day incidence rate in Ireland.  Indeed, it has declined further in the intervening time.  This at a time the majority of countries are experiencing an upward trend.</p> <p>  The most recent rapid risk assessment, which is the ECDC&rsquo;s instrument for setting out its assessment of the disease on an approximately monthly basis, is dated 23 October.  It highlights that all EU-EEA countries and the UK have implemented various &ldquo;non-pharmaceutical interventions&rdquo;, which is its term for social restrictions, but that these have not been fully successful in controlling transmission and the epidemiological situation is now rapidly deteriorating.  Implementing stricter non-pharmaceutical interventions, which proved to be effective in controlling the epidemic in all EU-EEA countries and the UK during spring 2020, appears to be the only available strategy that may have a moderate, as opposed to high, impact on the disease for individuals and healthcare provision.  This results in an overall assessment of the general population across Europe as being at high risk.</p> <p>  The landscape in respect of restrictive measures is rapidly evolving, with significantly more restrictive measures having been introduced or proposed in a number of European countries over the past week.  This includes stay-at-home recommendations and overnight curfews, limits on numbers of individuals that may gather in indoor and outdoor settings as well as mixing of households, and restrictions or closure of the hospitality sector and other non-essential services.</p><p>The WHO, for its part, in its weekly epidemiological update from 27 October stated that the number of new cases in Europe is increasing exponentially, with over 1.3 million new cases recorded during the most recent seven-day reporting period.  Against this backdrop, there is a substantial risk associated with international travel at the current time.</p><p> Our focus, as a country, is now very much on suppressing the spread of the disease domestically.  We have moved early in our efforts to break the transmission cycle.  Many European counterparts are now following a similar path and we have seen daily reports on the reintroduction of restrictions by European governments, in some cases quite stringent measures such as curfews.  Once we bring the disease back under control in this country, it will be necessary to manage very carefully the risks of importation, among other risks to that status.  In circumstances of sustained low levels of domestic transmission, the relative impact of imported cases is all the greater, as was seen in this country at times during the summer when travel-related cases increased and accounted for up to approximately a quarter of cases on occasion.</p><p> International travel will represent a prominent area of risk as the disease comes under control nationally and we subsequently aim to maintain suppressed disease activity and low incidence rates.  I am aware that agreement has been reached at EU level on a common approach to intra-EU travel and that the Government has decided on how these recommendations are to be implemented in Ireland.  Senior officials from across Government, including from the Department of Health, are engaged actively in discussions on its implementation.  Acknowledging the likely duration of the pandemic, countries are transitioning from emergency management of Covid to more sustainable strategies such as the EU agreement, and it represents an important step for that reason.</p><p> It is important that countries adopt approaches that facilitate travel, especially essential travel, while ensuring that those who need to travel are not posing an additional risk to wider populations.  I stress that countries which have adopted PCR testing as part of their travel policies in those circumstances have tended to do so as part of a suite of measures applying to international travel, often including more restrictive measures than apply here such as travel bans, mandatory quarantines and border closures.  Our experts and many of their counterparts internationally consider that, should testing of asymptomatic passengers be introduced, a five- to seven-day period of restricted movement, with a symptom check and test on day five, is the most efficient means of containing importation of the virus.  This approach can still miss up to 15% of potentially imported cases.</p><p> At the request of NPHET, HIQA recently undertook a rapid health technology assessment on the use of alternatives to laboratory-based PCR testing.  HIQA found that these tests offer possibilities to enhance prevention and control, including expanding of testing capacity, reduced test turnaround times and improved access.  These tests work best where there is high prevalence and incidence of the disease, particularly amongst symptomatic patients.  HIQA's findings confirm the WHO advice which shows that the currently available rapid antigen detection tests are not suitable for use in screening asymptomatic populations with unknown levels of disease, such as would be the case with arriving passengers.</p><p> The HSE recently established an expert group to review the antigen tests currently available and how they might be deployed in clinical and non-clinical settings.  Validation studies in respect of these with two rapid antigen tests are already under way in Ireland in connection with their potential use in vulnerable populations.  I emphasise that, over the course of the pandemic, NPHET's advice to the Government has been informed by the latest scientific evidence.  As evidence accrues and our understanding of the disease develops, our advice to Government develops alongside the evidence base.</p><p> It is essential that people who arrive in this country or who have returned from travel pay close attention to maintaining the basic public health measures of 2 m distancing, hand hygiene, wearing face coverings and avoiding crowded situations for a full 14 days, even if they are not asked to restrict their movements for that period.</p><p> In returning to the risks associated with international travel, while we recognise that long-term travel restrictions are, of course, difficult, we need only look to the travel policies of countries that have achieved sustained low rates of transmission, particularly countries in Asia, to see the importance that this has in helping to control importations.  Our core national objectives are to maintain the safe reopening our education and health sectors, and to protect our vulnerable people in particular.  Achieving these goals is predicated on maintaining low rates of community transmission and avoiding an ongoing reseeding of cases through whatever means, including travel.</p></speech>

I know Liam from a former life in University of Limerick, although I have not seen him for quite a while.  It is good to see the three witnesses here and I thank them for all the work they have been doing over many difficult months.</p> <p>  I have a number of brief questions.  I may interject when the witnesses are replying so I apologise in advance to Dr. Holohan but there are a few answers I would like to get .  First, as Ireland's Chief Medical Officer, does Dr. Holohan see international travel as being safe and possible between now and Christmas and from Christmas to springtime?  The aviation sector sees its season reopening around March, which is what it calls the summer season.  Does Dr. Holohan believe international air travel could be considered safe and possible between now and then?</p></speech>

The situation at the moment is that international travel of a non-essential nature is not safe.  Movement of populations around areas with a high experience of this disease, particularly in Europe and North America, in and out of this country is not safe.</p></speech>

I have in mind that this Sunday evening at a political level, and Dr. Holohan is dealing in the realm of health policy, the EU traffic light system comes into force.  There will be green regions but for orange and red regions it becomes quite unworkable in that people will have to quarantine if they come here from those regions.  What advice has NPHET been giving to the Government in the lead-up to Sunday evening?</p></speech>

We believe that testing is most appropriate for people and for populations where the risks, and the likelihood of disease, are greatest because we get a much better predictive value or reliability in regard to the test.  That is what the evidence says.  That is what the HIQA report says.  That is the WHO advice so our advice in respect of testing is exactly in line with that.</p></speech>

Has NPHET advised in any way that the testing everyone is demanding be delayed?</p></speech>

The context in which any of these things ever arises is what the ambient risk is in terms of transmission.  If that were to arise right now, right across Europe, including the UK and North America, and North America is not part of the EU arrangements, the vast majority of countries are red and getting redder.  That is the current situation.  That is the reason we are concerned about international travel.  While there are various measures that can be put in place at points in time that enable us to ensure that, inasmuch as possible, we can make every form of activity, including travel, as safe as possible and allow us resume these activities inasmuch as we can, we can only do that by reference to the ambient risks of community transmission.  The whole of Europe is experiencing a very significant resurgence of the disease.  This country, and I will not start concluding on this at this point because we are only two weeks into the set of measures in terms of level 5, has seen a significant reduction in its seven-day and now 14-day incidence consequent on the measures that are in place here.  The experience we have had in this country, in particular looking at seven-day incidence, and looking at it towards the end of last week and comparing our experience to those of Europe is that the level of disease transmission here is improving at a point when the vast majority of countries in Europe are disimproving.  We simply have to take that into account in terms of our public health advice to people who are making plans around travel because many European countries, unfortunately for them, are in a situation where they are facing much higher levels of disease, and deteriorating levels of disease, where, at least in the two weeks so far, we have been experiencing a level of improvement that very few other countries are able to report.  We need to hold on to that.</p></speech>

What is of much more interest to us is the more regionalised and fine level of detail.  As we return to lower levels of transmission in this country - let us be optimistic for a moment that we will get back to that point - it will start to become more important to consider not just regions but counties, and not just counties but localities.  When we get to low levels of transmission of the disease, the objective has to be to pick up cases and outbreaks when they occur as quickly as possible, and to contain them as outbreaks within a locality and to prevent community transmission.  That is the reason we consider much finer detail than the NUTS regions in forming our perspective.</p></speech>

Many countries are experiencing significant resurgences of the disease and have arrangements for their own populations.  They are, effectively, discouraging people from all forms of travel within their countries and between countries.  As we move, hopefully, to make progress in this country, let us hope the rest of Europe will move in the same way and that we can move back to a direction - like in early spring and into summer - where many countries are getting control of the disease at levels that they simply do not have at the moment.</p> <p>  Getting control, as a collection of countries, is the best means of ensuring that travel and any other form of activity within those countries will be as safe as possible.  Everything we do in respect of this disease is a function of how safe it is in the context of its uncontrolled transmission, which is what is happening in Europe.  Europe has uncontrolled transmission of the disease in place at the moment, disrupting every form of social and economic activity within the countries.  The only means for us a community to restore and protect many of those functions and services, as well as the people living in those countries, is to intervene and stop this high level of community transmission.  Our evidence suggests we are making progress on this, whereas many other European countries are not yet in the position to be able to report that.</p></speech>

What I said in my opening statement, and I will say it again, is that as we move, I hope, and I am being optimistic about this, to curb, slow and ultimately re-establish full control over this disease, then the question of international travel, which has been on our agenda from the get-go - and the Deputy will, I am sure, be well familiar with the various recommendations we have made over the entire course of the pandemic - will begin to assume, relatively speaking, greater importance.  If the risk of picking up the disease in this country is very low because we have managed to control community transmission, then the obvious additional source of infection is through international travel.</p></speech>

It is the same as with people living here who are not travelling.  Full compliance with all the public health advice, rapid identification of cases when they occur, as well as reliability in that regard and an ability to follow up and then verify it, and quarantine and restriction of movement arrangements are all essential to the arrangements that have to operate.  Many countries have those arrangements in place.</p></speech>

However, 15% of cases are still missed.  In Ireland we are missing 100% of cases, if one likes, so there is significant room for improvement there.</p> <p>  I have a question about the technologies that exist.  I know that HIQA has done a comparative analysis.  It acknowledges that there were severe limitations to its analysis because of the quality of information available.  There is one systematic review of rapid antigen tests, for example.  I have a kit insert here from the test being used in Rome.  The committee heard from representatives from Rome airport last week.  The test meets the WHO criteria in respect of sensitivity and specificity.  Regarding the technologies that exist there, is it feasible that we could introduce a testing regime at our ports and airports in the very near future that was either PCR or an alternative suitable comparator?  It has been done elsewhere.</p></speech>

It is important to highlight that at this point we have the best test available.  It is the most sensitive and the most specific.  There is a lot of interest in antigen testing on the basis of the facts.  PCR, for clarity, identifies the genetic material of the virus, or the viral RNA.  What antigen testing looks for are viral antigens, typically virus proteins.  These proteins tend to be present in people in whom the virus is actively replicating.  They tend to be less sensitive purely because there is not necessarily as much protein there as there might be viral RNA.  The difficulty with the WHO criteria at this point is that they refer to a sensitivity of 80%.  The WHO is speaking to the whole world, not just to developed countries that can afford to have a PCR testing system in place.  The problem with a sensitivity of 80% is that, in essence, one in five cases will be missed, and that is not good enough.  Therefore, in order to compensate for that lack of sensitivity, there are a couple of options.  These tests can potentially be used in an outbreak setting, whereby one tests a large number of people who have symptoms and then the risk of getting lots of false negatives is significantly reduced.  If, however, one does identify somebody who is part of that outbreak or cluster in whom the antigen test does not detect virus antigen, one needs to go on and do a PCR test to facilitate the contact tracing process after that.  The other alternative approach to compensating for the lack of sensitivity is repeated testing, which is another area in which people have expressed an interest.</p><p>The problem is we have no evidence at this point in time that antigens work in that setting.  For example, if I take an antigen test today and it is not detected-----</p></speech>

When will the expert group review of the comparative analysis of the different technologies be completed?  There is a great deal of interest in that review, particularly in the aviation sector, our airports and ports  The review was referenced in Dr. Holohan's opening statement.  When will it be completed?</p></speech>

The validations are ongoing.  It is worth highlighting that the first point of any of this is to demonstrate that the antigen test works in general - in other words, that it works off-the-shelf.  We know from the HIQA report, which the Deputy alluded to, that typically the manufacturers claims have not necessarily been held up by independent verifications.  We want to see large-scale independent assessments of these tests, with the results published in the peer review literature such that we can introduce them.  There is a sense out there that I am against antigen testing; I am not.  I need a good reason to move away from the best test that we have.  The antigen test will need to be evaluated in each setting in which it is proposed to use it.  For example, for it to be used in an airport, a nursing home or a school setting, a validation or a verification, at least, would be required in each of those settings.</p></speech>

The question the public are asking relates to Christmas.  We are in level 5 until 1 December.  People tend to return home from 14 December for Christmas.  Ryanair, Aer Lingus and other airlines have said that they will operate flights to facilitate Christmas travel.  I refer to Dr. Holohan's presentation, in particular page 6, where it states:</p> <blockquote> 	...should testing of asymptomatic passengers be introduced, a 5-7-day period of restricted movement, with a symptom check and test on day 5, is the most efficient method to contain importation of the virus.  This approach can still miss up to 15%... </blockquote> <p>The final paragraph on page 7 states: &quot;It is essential that people who arrive in Ireland or who have returned from travel pay close attention to maintaining two metre distance, hand hygiene, wearing face covering and avoiding crowded situations for a full 14 days...&quot;.  Dr. Holohan also referenced the following:</p> <blockquote> 	...EU level on a common approach to intra-EU travel and that the Government has decided on how these recommendations are to be implemented in Ireland.  Senior Officials from across Government, including from the Department of Health, are engaged in discussions on implementation. </blockquote> <p>This includes the witnesses.  As the virus is being brought under control in Ireland, does Dr. Holohan foresee the introduction of pre-departure PCR testing as distinct from antigen testing in respect of travel from countries in the orange and red zones, such that people can return home by flight for Christmas?  The return of the diaspora at Christmas time is a traditional and important aspect of what it is to be Irish.</p></speech>

I am seeking Dr. Holohan's views on pre-departure testing in respect of travel from orange and red zones, in particular red zones in respect of which people would be required to undergo a pre-departure test, quarantine for five days and then undergo a further test.  Is there support for this?  Will we reach a point whereby people can return home at Christmas?</p></speech>

I hope we are on a trajectory we can maintain.  The Chairman is asking me to look forward a period of six weeks and it is simply not possible to do that.  I do not say this in any critical sense, but it is a hypothetical situation.  We can only make that assessment at a point in time and then make our advice available for whatever period we think is reasonable.  We are talking about travel over a two-week period.</p> <p>  I completely understand the sensitivities that will exist for families and people who are thinking about these kinds of arrangements and wishing to come back together, probably family members who have not seen each other for many months.  I understand all the implications for the airline industry.  We are simply trying to, in as dispassionate and as evidence-based a way as possible, advise on what we think the risks are and how best to ameliorate and address them.  We are seeking assurance that if we make the progress that we think we can make over the course of the coming weeks, we will not inadvertently put that at risk through the arrangements we put in place over the course of December that may lead to significant importation of the disease that we are unable to detect and prevent.</p></speech>

I am going to put a few things to our guests that we have heard from others who know more about the aviation sector than I do.  Mr. Eddie Wilson of Ryanair was recently before the committee.  He sought to paint Ireland's approach to the movement of people in a rather dark shadow or cloud.  He suggested that our restrictions on foreign travel are completely out of line with the rest of Europe.  I put that to our guests and ask them to respond, if they would.</p> <p>  Dr. Holohan has talked about the incidence rate in other countries.  Are there ongoing conversations with people of his standing and at his level in Europe?  I know some conversations happen through the ECDC and WHO but is there any specific sharing of data or peer review of actions that are taken, etc.?</p></speech>

The arrangements in place in this country are not as stringent as many that have existed in other European countries over the period and I might ask Mr. Morris to comment on that.</p><p>Work has been done at the European level to survey countries in comparison with one another in relation to the measures that are in place, the extent to which countries are running testing regimes, the nature of such regimes, the nature of quarantine arrangements, the nature of oversight of those arrangements and so on.

We participate and are recipients of the benefit of all the number-crunching analysis and evidence assessment that happens at a European level.  We also have informal engagements that we try to maintain.  On the island, we have close working relations with our counterparts in Northern Ireland for good and obvious reasons.  We have some engagements across these islands from time to time with similar individuals in the UK jurisdictions and Ireland.  It is less formal at a European level but we are trying and we have a process of engagement through our embassies and through some direct contact between our Department and departments in other jurisdictions to try to get more of the soft understanding, if one likes, of exactly where other countries are in relation to the kinds of advice that is provided by people like us within the systems so we can see the impact ultimately in other countries and understand the nature of advice that has been provided.

That meets in a steady pattern of about twice a week at the moment to discuss all these measures.  There were discussions on the responses that countries have introduced combining testing with quarantine.  It was shown that, regarding where Ireland sits in terms of flexibility and openness to travel, compared with other countries we have quite a permissive regime in place.  Other countries have mandatory quarantine requirements and stringent penal provisions.  That came through in the discussions.</p></speech>

The numbers from EUROCONTROL clearly negate those statements so it would be helpful to get that message out there.</p> <p>  Perhaps Dr. Holohan will specifically address the view held in some quarters that testing and tracing is almost a cure for Covid and if we had rapid antigen testing at the airports, we could ultimately have a free-for-all.  The argument is also made on the aviation side that air travel is safe.  That is presented on the basis of evidence of people contracting the virus while in the aircraft with no reference to what happens at either end.  It is no different from the example we have here at the moment, when we are not supposed to be outside a 5 km radius, and some suggest it is safe to drive.  It is okay to travel in the car but what one does on the other end is the issue.  Will Dr. Holohan speak to those two points?</p></speech>

It is not just the intrinsic risks around travel.  In many ways, the travel experience on a plane can be a controlled environment.  In such an environment, one can manage the risks.  We have seen this in schools where we have managed to put control systems in place very well.  These have helped in terms of transmission and allowed us to turn on and maintain an important public service around schools.  As the Senator rightly says, the issue is the movement of people.  People come into contact with each other and the greater the extent of mixing among populations, the greater are the conditions for transmission of the virus.  Unfortunately, the very purpose of international travel is to facilitate the free movement and mixing of people, which is wonderful except it facilitates the spread of this particular disease.</p><p>There is no doubt that in the course of the summer, international travel played a significant role in the re-importation and re-seeding of this infection in this country.  </p><p> There is also an issue in this country around travel.  In Europe, they look at travel, including international travel.  They do not just focus on air travel.  There is sea travel in this country because we are an island.  In many other European countries they look at road, rail, train and air but it is a relatively small proportion whereas we have an enormous dependency on it in this country.  It is true to say, as Mr. Morris has said, that the arrangements that exist in this country would not be as stringent as those that exist at border level in many other European countries.</p></speech>

It is easy for me to say that they will be busy for some time to come.</p> <p>  My first questions concern the summer period.  It has been mentioned that a quarter of outbreaks were imported.  Can I have the details?  Were any learnings made at that stage?</p> <p>  Testing and tracing are a major part in communities, ports and airports.  We will need a framework for same into the future.  We have all heard the story about the guy who was a super spreader and gave the virus to 56 people.  Most people have followed the general restrictions but one must make allowances for those who do not and how that can have a huge impact.  What learnings have been made and where do we go from here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.415" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020110300002#L00600"><p>The principle learning from that is that when we get to low levels of transmission then everything that we do that increases that risk is something we have to look very closely at.  In the context in which we are in at the moment, we hope we will make progress and get us back to low level transmission of the kind that we saw over the course of the summer.  When that happens it allows us to recommend the easing of measures and do a range of other things that are currently not possible.  The extent to which that increases, if we do too much of it, can facilitate transmission but then there are specific risks that arise in this country.  In particular, because this is an island, if we get to those low levels of transmission then international travel becomes a relatively more important potential source of new infection both in absolute and proportional terms.  Particularly then, if we are talking about a situation where we are seeking, perhaps as a European community, to try to facilitate an additional European level of travel, then that would have the effect of increasing the absolute risk as well as the proportional risk of the importation of infection.</p> <p>  The second one is the strength of our public health capacity to respond.  To pick up on the story that has been talked about, that particular case that ultimately was the super spreading event that led to 59 additional cases, we now know, as an international community, the faster we are able to pick these up and intervene at super spreading events, clusters and outbreaks at local level, the greater the chance we have to stop this disease becoming established as widespread community transmission.  In other words, it is wild out in the community but we do not know who has or has not got it, which is the situation we faced in late September and into October that caused us to recommend the  measures that are in place at this point.</p></speech>

We accept that travel at this point in time, for non-essential reasons, does not make any sense given the conditions, particularly across Europe.  However, I accept that the aviation sector requires a framework so that it knows how to operate into the future while accepting that we do not know exactly what the community situation will be at that stage.  People will still travel so I back what was said by my colleague in that we probably need something better than what is happening with the passenger locator form, and some form of operational testing.  I would like Dr. Holohan to go into the ins and outs regarding validations.  I accept that he talked about specific settings.  To a degree, some of these do not seem to be something NPHET would propose from the point of view of air travel.</p></speech>

One of the messages I wanted to give is that it is the testing in the context of all of the other arrangements that might exist at a point in time.  I am not just talking about borders.  Testing just does not sit on its own as a response to the control of the disease.  It has to be part of a set of arrangements that exist, the purpose of which is to limit transmission and increase control.  I might ask Dr. De Gascun to comment further on validation but, essentially, what we are trying to do is show how well the test is actually working in the setting in which we would seek to use it.</p></speech>

However, if we look at it in a European context, if every country could make the same level of progress in terms of disease control at the same time, of course, that is going to make the most important contribution possible to reducing the risks associated with international travel.  The scenario that I am concerned about is one in which we make progress and other colleagues at a European level, unfortunately, are not in a position to make the same level of progress.  Notwithstanding whatever arrangements we put in place to try to limit transmission, if there is a lot of disease in Europe and not very much here, and we have people travelling, that is going to increase the risk of transmission. </p></speech>

We have said this on many occasions.  When we have had widespread community transmission in this country, it is a risk to everything that goes on in this country, whether that is education, nursing homes, the operation of the hospitality sector or whatever.  We now have widespread community transmission throughout Europe and it would be very hard for us to protect Ireland from that disease.  If we continue to see widespread transmission around Europe and a low level of transmission in this country, we will not be able to keep the disease out.  This is a small, open economy, with very close cultural, legal, business and economic relationships with the whole of the European Union.  It is not New Zealand, so it is not going to be possible for us to keep the disease out.  That is why we think international travel, particularly around Europe, will have to be a continuing source of tension from our point of view.</p></speech>

The HSE has been heavily involved in trying to identify what that future might look like whereby travel becomes safe again.</p> <p>  In the context of validation, in essence, what we do is to take the gold standard, which at the moment is PCR, and then go into a setting, wherever that setting may be.  For the new test that we want to verify or validate, which might be antigen testing, LAMP testing or a different PCR assay, we would take two samples from a population.  One sample goes through the gold standard test, which we know is PCR, and the other sample goes through the comparator test, whether that is an antigen, LAMP or otherwise.  We would need significant numbers.  In essence, what we are doing with that comparison is trying to identify the sensitivity and specificity and the real-world performance of the new test.</p> <p>  We know PCR works very well.  The HSE and the Department of Health have put a huge amount of infrastructure in place over the last eight months to ensure we can now do somewhere in the region of 120,000 tests a week.  That system is working well.  If we are going to change it or add something new to it, we need to make sure that whatever that is continues to work as effectively, and we need to make sure that all of those data feed into our test and trace system. </p> <p>  The last point to highlight is that testing is just one component.  An Australian virologist has put out a very nice graphic around the Swiss cheese model of pandemic defence against respiratory virus.  Every slice has holes in it, so testing has holes in it and tracing has holes in it, but if we have the physical distancing, the contact tracing, the hand hygiene, the face masks and all of those things, and we put all of those slices together, then we can get through this.</p> <p>  From the validation perspective, there is a logistics component to it and it is not as straightforward as just buying a kit off the shelf and then going out to a local community and validating it.  We need to identify the cohort we want to test it in, and we need to know what the numbers are going to be and how many negatives or positives we want.</p><p>Equally, who is going to do the swabbing?  We have worked with the HSE to identify community sampling hubs within the community, where we can look at the likes of saliva and antigen testing.  From an NVRL perspective, we are not best placed to do antigen testing because antigen testing is typically near-patient; it is done at the point of care.  There are hospitals involved in doing the antigen comparison between PCR and antigen testing.  One of the other elements that is difficult is that the same specimen that goes through the antigen testing cannot go through PCR, so multiple samples are required.

What is that?  Can he define it in terms of metrics, and what is it that he will be looking for in this regard?  Will we come out of lockdown on 1 December 2020 and if so, what level of restrictions will we move to?  I am of the view that the public are entitled to have an idea of what exactly is happening.  Everyone agrees that the virus has been spreading and we need to bring it under control but there must be a pathway out.  Is the policy one of lockdown, release and containment, or is it that we live with the virus?</p> <p>  I want to link those issues to the aviation sector.  Dr. Holohan made reference to the fact that no matter how well we do here, his decision will also take account of how other countries are doing.  What is the sustainable level that Dr. Holohan wants these other countries to have in place?  There is no testing at airports at the moment.  If pre-departure tests were brought in, that would reduce the risk of travel, the risk to people in Ireland, and the risk to passengers on flights.  The Minister for Health said that the rate of transmission in air travel is 1%, yet Dr. Holohan is saying that last summer it accounted for almost a quarter of all cases.  Everything is relative.  If the rate of transmission is very low domestically, then while the rate of transmission in travel might also be very low, relative to the domestic rate, it might be much higher, so everything is relative.</p> <p>  All those questions are interlinked and I ask Dr. Holohan to respond.  What does he regard as the sustainable low level of domestic transmission?  Will we come out of lockdown on 1 December 2020, and what level will we go to?  What type of policy is the national policy now?  Is it a policy of lockdown, release and containment, living with the virus, or a defer and vaccine policy?  Linking that to international travel, what will be the components of the policy?  Dr. Holohan made reference to us getting to a certain level.  Is he saying that regardless of how well we do here, if the incidence in other countries is not coming down at the same rate, then there should be no international travel?  These are the questions that the public are asking.</p></speech>

We said that at the beginning, in terms of the advice and explaining the advice given to the public, that when we were making recommendations to Government, most recently around level 5 restrictions, we were at something between 1,100 and 1,200 cases per day, on the five-day average.</p><p>We thought at that time of having an R rate - if we could get there - of 0.5.  We do know if we will get there.  At the moment we are down to 1.0 based on our estimate last week.  We will have a new estimate on Thursday of this week and see what progress has been made on that.  If we follow that track we will get down to probably having in the order of fewer than 100 or so cases per day.  There are all the other associated metrics that go with that which express themselves in the 14-day and seven-day incidence rates, hospitalisation rates and all those kinds of things.  We look at all those metrics.  We have seen a significant reduction in some of those already but we still have a long way to go.  The Chairman has heard us say that and we reiterated that this morning.</p></speech>

That is work that is happening at the moment.  The other is advice we give to people who are intending travellers.  At the moment that advice is that if one is thinking about non-essential travel, do not do it.  That is very clear.  We are advising against non-essential travel on public health grounds.  If we think that can change, we will make that advice available.  If people are travelling - there are people who travel for essential purposes - there is advice and guidance we can give them about how they can minimise their risks and how they should seek to understand and comply with the public health advice that is in place at any point in time in whatever country they find themselves in, whether it is Irish people travelling abroad for essential reasons and then having to come back or  people who are travelling here for essential reasons to provide essential services in this country.  That is happening and people are providing us with essential goods and services that we can only have by means of people continuing to provide those from outside of this country.

I also thank Dr. Glynn for his work in his capacity as acting Chief Medical Officer during the period Dr. Holohan took a step back from the role.</p> <p>  Dr. Holohan mentioned the need for NPHET to make point-in-time assessments.  That is totally understandable and when needing to move between levels such assessments must be made.  As mentioned, we have had representatives of the aviation industry before the committee.  They are seeking to make decisions for spring and summer 2021 which are not point-in-time assessments.</p><p> There is a belief that NPHET has been the barrier to allowing them to put in place the structures for a testing regime that would be part of a multi-layered framework.  It is very understandable that NPHET has to make point-in-time assessments and it is equally understandable that the aviation industry has to make decisions that will involve a time lag.  As the representatives from the DAA mentioned, it will have to make planning applications for testing regimes to local authorities and it will take time to get personnel involved.  All of this will take time.  As difficult as level 5 is, it provides a breathing space to do this.  Is there an appreciation of the two competing decision-making timelines between NPHET and the aviation industry when it comes to this?  How is NPHET negotiating this difference?</p></speech>

Insofar as we can give a longer-range view, it is simply with regard to the extent that we can get through the phase we are in at present as well as we possibly can and hit an R rate of 0.5, although we do not know whether we will do so and there is no absolute number or one magic target, and get down to low levels of transmission of the type we saw in the summer, whereby we think we have capacity and that we have the virus back under control.  We speak about living with the virus.  It means having low levels of transmission, a low risk of transmission and a good chance of picking up instances where the disease starts to spread again and picking up outbreaks as early as possible and controlling them.  These are the basic requirements we have.</p> <p>  We are confident that we can get back to this situation by the beginning of December if, as the Deputy has probably heard me say before, we can maintain the high level of compliance there is on the part of the public with the public health advice.  The vast majority of people are practising much of the public health advice.  Over the course of the summer, our reproductive number was up at approximately 1.4 but that is a very suppressed level of disease transmission in the population.  If we were doing nothing to control the spread in the population, we would have a reproductive number of approximately 4 or 5.  A figure of 1.4 is very good.</p> <p>  Getting the number down to where we need it will not require much more in terms of action on the part of the public, but it would have a big effect.  The reason I stress this is because if, optimistically, when we get to 1 December, we are in a position to make recommendations and the Government mandates a change in the arrangements that are in place, the extent we can from that point forward collectively keep the R number low, ideally at or below 1, will push out as far as possible the chance of any further resurgence.  The greater we all understand, comply with and align ourselves collectively against the ongoing transmission risks and minimise them, including any risk that comes from travel, the more we can push out as much as possible into the future.  The reality for international travel is that the more we have control on an international basis as a shared experience across countries the better position we will be in to see a resumption of this type of activity.</p></speech>

This is very concerning for all of us and we hope it does not happen.  To use the DAA as an example, it has a plan to get testing capacity up and running from its own resources.  There will be natural restrictions on travel because events and concerts are not happening and people are fearful of travelling.  There are also economic reasons because people have lost their jobs and do not have the money to travel.  All of these factors will naturally suppress travel.  Does Dr. Holohan think there could be a window?  To use Dr. De Gascun's phrase, it is still just a slice of Swiss cheese in this whole approach.  Can we do something now and allow the airports to get something off the ground, at least in terms of structures?  We could end up not doing anything now and after December we could be at level 5 again in January.  Suddenly it will be the spring and the airports will have lost all of this time.  Could they even get the basics and the physical infrastructure in place for a testing regime?  Is there no fear about the implications of this for jobs and the economy?</p></speech>

If we can maintain the high level of practice, as I said, then we can push out the risk of that into the future.  To be optimistic for a second - and again we cannot give certainty on this - we are increasingly seeing a sense that the position with vaccines may change in 2021 and offer some level of hope.  We have been dealing with a virus for which we have no vaccine, no natural immunity in the population and no effective drugs targeted against it.  That has been the reality.  Consequently the measures open to us to control the disease are simply to stop spreading it in the first instance.  If a vaccine is added to our armoury that will change things very substantially.  Potentially, if other countries find themselves in a similar situation that may change the picture substantially in 2021.  It is not necessarily inevitable that we will find ourselves in a situation-----</p></speech>

We do have emerging examples though.  Istanbul Airport has a big testing regime.  We spoke to representatives from Rome Airport last week and there are a number of other airports as well.  There is a growing body of examples for us to look at.  I will conclude with this as I have only ten seconds.  My concern is that if we do not have anything in place then restriction fatigue will creep in and as we move into 2021 people will just start making bookings.  They will go onto <i>ryanair.com</i>and <i>aerlingus.com</i>, and demand flights to Europe, America or wherever because they will be saying: &quot;Flip this, I have had a year plus of a tough time and I need to get away.&quot;  If that happens - because the airlines will take the bookings, as will the hotels on the far side - and we do not have a testing regime in place then we are potentially going to be in a really poor situation.</p></speech>

Whatever has to be put in place in terms of the DAA will all, I am sure, form part of the Department of Transport's considerations in all of this.  Our preparations - and there will of course be a lot of work happening on this across the health service - will be on all the practical arrangements we have to put in place.

They have an incredibly difficult task.  No elected representative envies the decisions they have made and what is ahead of them and yet to come.</p> <p>  My first question is for both doctors.  It is very relevant to all sectors in transport, particularly aviation, and to people's lives as well.  How long do the NPHET representatives see us being in a situation where we are in this cycle of moving into and out of restrictions?  Dr. Holohan might answer that question first.</p></speech>

I will come back to what I mean by that.  A vaccine would change the situation entirely if we had one that was effective.</p><p>We do not plan, nor are in a position to plan, on the basis of that certainty.  We have to plan for two scenarios right now.  The first is where we have an effective vaccine.  Work is happening in that regard.  The second is where we do not have a vaccine.  We simply cannot fall into the trap of planning based on the certainty of a vaccine.  Therefore, all our work must be to ensure, inasmuch as possible, that we identify cases as early as possible when they occur, put arrangements in place to try to control the spread from any individual, through his or her contracts, into the wider community, and verify as much as we can the establishment of that control.  That is the rationale for the policy.</p></speech>

The vast majority of reasonable people will do so.  We are now at a much more advanced stage regarding the virus.  We have been living with it for almost a year and a number of vaccination trials internationally have been making great progress.  From the witnesses' understanding, could they indicate when a vaccine might be available to the public?  How is the testing going?  The virologist in the room, Dr. De Gascun, might have some information on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-11-03a.480" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cillian De Gascun" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2020110300002#R00700"><p>The short answer is that, from a vaccine perspective, there have been some very positive soundings that data from the phase 3 clinical trials will be available for analysis at the end of November.  Until we see those data, we will not know how well the vaccine performs.  In the context of the virus, we have had four seasonal human coronaviruses in recent decades.  All crossed the species barrier and have become endemic in the human population.  The original severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, of 2002 did not manage to become established and is no longer in circulation.  The Middle East respiratory syndrome, MERS, coronavirus of 2012 still causes occasional cases but it did not manage to adapt sufficiently to acquire the ability to transmit effectively between people.  SARS-CoV-2 has now done that.  Viruses do not just disappear; they tend not to just go away.  The only virus we have managed to eradicate through vaccination was smallpox.  We are getting close with measles, rubella and polio but it is a long way off.  Unfortunately, therefore, we cannot pin our hopes on a vaccine.  The chances of its being 100% effective and taken up by the whole population and of eradicating the virus in the near future are very small.  This virus is likely to become endemic in the population.  The non-pharmaceutical interventions Dr. Holohan has spoken about today will remain incredibly important.  Therefore, we have to get transmission down to a low level and change our behaviour to keep the virus suppressed to a low level in the community.  The virus, over the coming years and decades, may become milder but it is very unlikely to just disappear, even with a vaccine.</p></speech>

On foot of that, he will accept that with regard to adapting to living with the virus, it is important that we continue to investigate actively the possibly of rapid-testing infrastructure and advancing technologies in that area.  I accept that there are still underlying concerns about antigen testing and the lack of a comprehensive study on it.  Have the witnesses knowledge of any concluded or ongoing studies internationally on antigen testing?  The aviation sector wants antigen testing in place because it is rapid but I have some concerns about it.  Are there any ongoing large-scale studies?</p></speech>

We are very fortunate that HIQA has done a huge amount of work in this area and examined what is happening in other countries and in the literature.  Unfortunately, the evidence base is not in the literature regarding the performance of antigen tests in the real-world setting.  We have a very good test in the polymerase chain reaction, PCR, test at this point and we would need a good reason to move away from it.  What we often see as new tests are developed and new pathogens emerge is that the first generation of tests is imperfect but the second and third generation tests evolve, become more refined and get better.</p><p>It is completely possible that the second generation of antigen testing will become more easy to use, sensitive and more specific.  The specificity of antigen testing is not too bad at this point in time which should be acknowledged.  It is really a question of the sensitivity and the concern that we will miss cases.  That is why testing in whatever setting has to be taken in conjunction with restriction of movements in a travel setting and with a period of quarantine, purely because no test is perfect.  A test only gives an indication of a point in time.  For example, I could have had a test outside here this morning where the virus was not detected.  I could well be infectious now regardless of what the test said purely because of the way that the virus replicates over time, the virus load increases, and therefore becomes more easy to detect.  It is a point in time test and we need to be careful about not inferring too much on the basis of a single result.</p></speech>

I know that our witnesses were asked about the infrastructure at airports.  The whole area of working with elected representatives and Ministers on this issue is quite important.  From my engagement with very senior members of the Government there is a degree of hesitation on their part until public health advice is given to them to put in any infrastructure that may be required.  I wish to make the point to both our witnesses that the Ministers are very anxious to ensure that there is advice coming from both, and Dr. Holohan as the CMO, on putting in infrastructure at airports for any style of pre-departure testing or any testing facilities, if that becomes an advisable thing to do in the course of time, and when our witnesses will have more facts and data available to them to back such a decision up.  I encourage the witnesses to ensure that they are reaching out to the Department of Transport.  From what our witnesses have said to the committee, there is a bit of to-ing and fro-ing, in the sense that the Ministers are unsure of the public health advice and that our witnesses are saying that they cannot advise the Ministers but that they would have to go to the experts for advice on this issue.  Do our witnesses have anything to say on that point?</p></speech>

That is the normal part of the implementation of any Government decision.  The work that is happening across Departments involves the Department of Transport, the Department of Health and others and reflects the advice that we have given but also reflects all of the other considerations that Government has to have including the positions and perspectives of all of the other Government Departments.  That is all being worked through in the current process of implementation.  We will continue as a Department to make our advice available in the context of all of that.  Ultimately it will be for the Government to decide based on that advice, having reflected all of the other perspectives that need to be taken into account.  That, to my mind, is a normal part of public administration.</p></speech>

He said that this virus would become endemic within the Irish population.  When does Dr. de Gascun expect the vaccine will be in place?  How effective will it be and when do we reach a point when the coronavirus becomes like the common flu?</p></speech>

SARS Cov-2 has certainly at this point in time achieved its aspiration of becoming readily transmissible from person-to-person.  It establishes itself in a new host, it adapts to that new host and there is no reason to believe, in the absence of a significant intervention, whether that is a vaccine, a treatment or some other event, that it will not manage to become endemic.  From the point of view as to how it will evolve from a severity perspective over the coming years and decades, it would be foolish of me to try to predict that.  We do not know when the other seasonal coronaviruses crossed the species barrier so we do not know what sort of diseases they caused when they first crossed over and whether that has changed over time.  Obviously they now cause a mild illness.</p></speech>

It is really valued.  I thank them for keeping us safe and informed and working with the population.</p> <p>  We have had a series of meetings on this topic.  We have been very slow to move on it.  Germany, Italy and Austria have moved on international air travel.  As the witnesses will appreciate, aviation is an economic driver in our country.  I am from County Clare and Shannon Airport is very important to business and tourism in the region.  We need to get the balance right.  There are 80 aviation-related companies in the Shannon area, all of which are dependent on aviation.</p> <p>  The EU moved to try to reopen international travel in the summer.  We lost a lot at that point in that we did not introduce rapid testing at our airports.  As the witnesses will be aware, the DAA and Shannon Airport have put a proposal to the Department of Transport on the introduction of a testing regime.  Has NPHET considered that?

The testing arrangements in some countries are not isolated arrangements.  The arrangements that exist in Germany are not arrangements in regard to testing alone.  Our advice is still reflective of the evidence that we talked about today and the guidance of the WHO and ECDC, namely, that we do not recommend rapid antigen testing for use as part of broader screening.  If we are to have measures that incorporate testing, it will be in the way we described earlier and will be part of a suite of measures designed to ensure we can minimise the risk of transmission between countries.</p></speech>

The work done by contact tracing and public health teams tries to establish, insofar as they can, where an individual may pick up an infection.  That is where we get this information from.  Over the course of the summer, those teams indicated that, in relative terms, the proportion of cases from travel increased.  That was partly because of the significant progress made by Irish people in driving down the levels of transmission to low numbers.  On some days, fewer than ten cases in total were reported.</p><p>In that context, a small number of imported cases would have a proportionately large effect.  When we got to a point in the summer where we had, for all intents and purposes, eliminated community transmission, the major source of infection was from outside the country.  Therefore, its importance increased.</p><p> Of late, however, it is fair to say that we have not been as focused on international travel as a source because the risk to people in this country is not arising from the numbers coming through Dublin Airport, but through everything that is happening in this country - socialisation, parties, getting together indoors and outdoors and workplaces.  I could go on.  Our concern for the past two months in particular has been consumed, and rightly so, by the risk of transmission in this country.  Correctly, we were much less focused on the immediate risks posed by international travel, given that it was only adding a small proportion to the total amount of activity.  We had a great deal of disease transmission that was Irish, if I could put it that way, and very little international travel in relative terms.  If that set of circumstances changes, our considerations will obviously have to change.  In other words, if we manage to drive down community transmission to where it was in the summer or if we see things happening that lead to a significant increase in the quantity of international travel, we will have to give some consideration to what we believe the risks arising from that will be and give advice based on our assessment.</p></speech>

Recently, a paper has been highlighted - people have probably seen it mentioned in the media - discussing a novel variant of the virus from Spain that has travelled around Europe.  From a virological perspective, it highlights how interconnected we all are.  Fortunately, there is no evidence that the virus is necessarily more transmissible or virulent, but it demonstrates nicely that the virus will spread readily if given the opportunity.  Obviously, travel facilitates that.</p></speech>

Dr. Holohan referred to a risk of 15% of imported cases not being identified, but surely such a system should be welcomed and endorsed by NPHET.  We cannot remain in this situation forever.  We need to move on, especially where an important industry like aviation is concerned.</p></speech>

Our job is to point out the risks and safety issues.

On a purely public health basis, NPHET could tell the Government that the best thing to do would be to close all workplaces, close all airports, close everything.  That would have a substantial effect.  However, we have not made that advice available.  We are constantly balancing what we believe is a proportionate assessment of what is an appropriate risk and a proportionate response to the level of transmission.  Although we now have in place very significant recommendations, ones that are mandated by the Government, they are proportionate.  One need only look across Europe.  Many countries waited until much later than us.  I am not being critical of any individual country.  Based on their assessments-----</p></speech>

Across many of those countries, there are substantial challenges in providing health services.  Countries are literally seeking to buy ICU capacity from other countries.</p><p>Desperate measures are being taken in many developed European countries and capitals.  I will not make a bold statement that we will avoid that here but the trajectory of the disease we have managed to establish over the course of the past couple of weeks, gives us some reason to believe we might get there.</p><p> The reason I am simply disagreeing is that a couple of things happened.  First, we know we have had anticipatory behaviour.  The population has been getting more concerned.  Individuals, and rightly so, and we have been advising it, have taken decisions themselves to avoid risks and to start to cut down their contacts and cut down their socialisation to avoid the kinds of circumstances that would lead to transmission.  That has been going on for some time.  Second, we have evidence in places where level 3 recommendations have been in place for longer than in other parts of the country, in particular, in Dublin, where we have not seen a suppressing effect in disease transmission.  All the evidence we have available gives us the judgment that level 3-type restrictions in this country seem to be able to hold the virus, broadly speaking, at a given level of transmission, in other words, hold what you have as oppose to reducing.  Our analysis, I think, correctly, is we have to absolutely drive down the rate of transmission, and that is why the level 5 measures were recommended by NPHET.  The public in many respects may have gotten ahead of us in many parts of the country and begun that because we are seeing a suppression of the disease even if we still have some way to go.</p></speech>

In the context of the information he has given, we were at low levels during the summer months, with 25% of cases associated with foreign travel, yet people could come in from red zone countries, essentially go about their business freely and there was no testing at our ports or airports.  If every individual since March had a PCR test coming into the country, we would have been in a better position to manage our Covid-19 threat but Dr. Holohan is not saying that today.  I wonder why.</p></speech>

We know that people can transmit before the onset of symptoms and we know that the vast majority of people will become symptomatic.  If people follow the public health guidance we can capture most of those individuals.  We could stop people who have an RNA detected test at the point of testing from getting on the plane.  That is certainly a useful component but the other element of this is that we are using diagnostic tests that are intended to be used in symptomatic people in a way in which they were not originally intended so the performance will be sub-optimal.  We will generate inaccurate results also because we know that, in terms of the sensitivity of the test, no test is perfect.  Depending on where the people involved are in their illness and on where the virus is in their respiratory tract, and we have heard of cases in hospital where the first couple of tests-----</p></speech>

All of us can work out what the witnesses are not going to propose but at this point, the Department should be putting together something that can fit into a framework and part of that would need to be testing.  The witnesses have had those discussions.  At this stage, I imagine that any proposal they are talking about is PCR, probably double testing and a couple of scenarios like that.</p><p>Is Dr. Holohan willing to go into any detail about this?

On the island, we have ended up in circumstances where we are not in control, so those kinds of tracing systems and so on do not work as effectively as they do when there are lower levels of transmission.  There are many examples of good co-operation across the Border where sharing of information has led to proper detection, control and so on.  In fact, the first case that occurred on the island was in Northern Ireland and involved detailed contact tracing and co-operation between transport and other agencies across the Border, and it worked very well.</p></speech>

Even if we move past 1 December and get to the level we hope to get to, we will still be dealing with restrictions in this country in the same way as every other country.  In that sense, circumstances will not be normal.  We are sensitive to the particular challenge that exists in the context of Christmas, with people getting together, socialisation and so on.  Our general view is that to the extent that we can make progress and reduce transmission as much as possible, we will be able to manage through that season and beyond for as long as possible.  We will give ongoing consideration to these issues as we get closer to the time, and I spoke earlier about-----</p></speech>

We have heard that 40% of the air is filtered, while the rest is clean air from the atmosphere outside.  Is it safe to be on an aeroplane if the person has been tested and is Covid free when getting on?  The person may have taken a test at Charles de Gaulle Airport or wherever.  Is an aeroplane a safe environment insofar as Covid transmission is concerned?  Dr. De Gascun might be better placed to respond.  Is it safe to be in that shell of the fuselage of an aeroplane for two hours?</p></speech>

The risk relates to the activities, as discussed earlier, on either side of the journey.  That is where the ultimate risk lies.  Even if people are tested prior to travel, it is not a guarantee that they are not incubating infection.  Having a single point of testing, therefore, has significant limitations.  It is certainly a good way of keeping off the plane people with an RNA-detected result, but the problem is the 30% to 35% of individuals who, in that first few days of their infection, do not believe they are infected and will be assured by the result of the test.  They will then come to whichever country, whether Ireland or another, and will not restrict their movements because they will believe they are not a risk.  That is the concern.  I do not believe an aeroplane to be a high-risk environment at all but, unfortunately, that is not what we are trying to address.  It is about people moving from red or orange countries to what will, hopefully, be lower risk countries by December.</p></speech>

We have been focused on trying to get the message to the groups that give us greatest concern as far as transmission is concerned, who over recent weeks have been the 19 to 24-year-olds.  The incidence among them went up to 450 per 100,000 two weeks ago but has dropped back to fewer than 300 per 100,000.  We also have data on contact behaviour across the age ranges and we have good reason to believe that 19 to 24-year-olds are changing their behaviour and listening to the message.  Young people are taking the message on board, taking responsibility and avoiding the kinds of circumstances that lead to transmission of the virus.  What we are now seeing, unfortunately, is that the age groups in which the incidence is increasing are the older age groups that will be represented among the hospitalisations and deaths.</p></speech>

It is to be hoped it is back on track.  Do we need to do more as far as retrospective contact tracing is concerned, particularly in the context of Dr. Holohan's comment earlier that it would be great to drive the virus back by county, town and local area?

The more we can understand this and the earlier we can intervene on these things at local level the better.  Our contact tracing system has worked well, to be fair to the HSE on this occasion.  The system ran into a challenge when we had very high levels of widespread community transmission.  Show me a country in Europe where that has not happened.  Widespread community transmission challenges every part of the response to this, including contact tracing.</p></speech>

It will be a very important function of an optimised and idealised public health system of the kind the WHO has been recommending, which consists of testing, referral, tracing, investigation and control measures, verification of those control measures and then surveillance around that.  That is the package we must have in place to maximise our chance of keeping control.  As Deputy Smith says, retrospective investigation of contacts is a very important part of all that.</p></speech>
