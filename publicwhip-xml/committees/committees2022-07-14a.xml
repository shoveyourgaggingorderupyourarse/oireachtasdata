No apologies have been received.</p> <p>  Please note that in order to limit the risk of the spread of Covid-19, the Houses of the Oireachtas Service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear a face mask when moving about the campus or within close proximity to others, to be respectful of other people's physical space and to adhere to all public health advice.  </p> <p>  Members of the committee who are attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of the Parliament.  This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings members must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House. </p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.  He is accompanied by Ms Mary Henry, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  This morning we engage with officials from An Bord Plean&aacute;la to examine its 2020 financial statements.  At the committee&rsquo;s request, the board has included briefing material on the following matters which may be examined during the course of the meeting: the status of the implementation of recommendations made in the report, entitled the organisational review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la by the independent review group, dated February 2016; judicial reviews of the board&rsquo;s decision, including the overall number; and how many are decided, how many were successful and the status of live cases.</p> <p>  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has provided a briefing note in relation to details of arrangements for the appointment of the chairperson and other members of An Bord Plean&aacute;la. </p> <p>  We are joined this morning by the following officials from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, Mr. Dave Walsh, cathaoirleach, Mr. Gerard Egan, director of corporate affairs and Ms Anne Killian, finance officer.  We are also joined by the following officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Mr. Graham Doyle, secretary general, and Ms Maria Graham, assistant secretary, planning division. </p> <p>  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent or switched off.  Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices regarding references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  As they are within the precincts of Leinster House they are protected by absolute privilege in respect to the presentations they make to the committee.  This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they may say at the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege.  It is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused.  Therefore, if witnesses&rsquo; statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such directions.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision of Standing Order 218 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the longstanding parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p> <p>  Before we move to the opening statements, and in the context of the reminder that I just read out, it is important that members are aware there are number of ongoing inquiries that focus on alleged conflict of interest and governance issues at An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  To avoid the risk of prejudicing these investigations, as well as other potential proceedings that may follow from their conclusion, members must respect the fact that the review of decisions of the board is a matter for the courts.  Because members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against person outside the House either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable, I will not permit members to question or comment upon specific matters that are subject to the inquiries.  </p> <p>  While we have requested information in relation to judicial reviews on the board&rsquo;s decision and details of arrangements for the appointment of the chairperson and other members of the boards, discussions on these matters should focus on systems, processes and should avoid discussion of specific cases or individuals.  </p> <p>  To begin I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-14a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022071400002#A00700"><p>As members are aware, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is responsible under the Planning and Development Acts for the determination of appeals of local authority planning decisions and for the determination of direct planning applications for strategic housing and infrastructure development.  The board also has responsibility for dealing with proposals for the compulsory acquisition of land by public authorities and with determining appeals under the Water Pollution and Building Control Acts.</p> <p>  The board's income in 2020 totalled &euro;28.9 million.  Some &euro;19.2 million, or almost two thirds of the income, came from Exchequer cash grants via the Vote for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Just over &euro;6.7 million, or 23% was received in application fees.  Expenditure in 2020 amounted to &euro;31.5 million.  Salaries and related costs amounted to &euro;17.4 million, representing around 55% of the board's expenditure in 2020.  Expenditure related to premises and other operating expenses totalled &euro;5.8 million.  The board&rsquo;s expenditure and legal fees in 2020 amounted to &euro;8.3 million.  This was significantly up on the figure of &euro;3.4 million, which was incurred in 2019.</p><p>This was significantly up on the &euro;3.4 million incurred in 2019.  About half of the expenditure in 2020 was accounted for by the board's legal fees in defending cases, with the other half representing payment of the costs of persons taking cases against the board following the settlement of cases.  Following audit, the 2020 financial statements were certified on 30 June 2021 and a clear audit opinion was issued.  The audit of the 2021 financial statements is ongoing.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Walsh back to the committee.  He was here in May of last year.  As detailed in the letter of invitation, he has five minutes for his opening statement.  I know the statement is a bit longer than that, and I want to grant him that time.  I read the statement yesterday.  I invite Mr. Walsh to proceed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-14a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dave Walsh" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022071400002#B00300"><p>I appreciate that.  I am grateful for the opportunity to appear before the committee to assist in its examination of An Bord Plean&aacute;la&rsquo;s financial statements for 2020, and to discuss the board&rsquo;s important work as well as recent progress in delivering on our statutory mandate.  We will endeavour to address all queries as best we can, but, with the committee's indulgence, I may ask my colleagues to come in on some more technical matters that may be raised during the session because they may be more familiar with such matters.</p> <p>  As the Chairman outlined, it important to remind the committee that it would not be appropriate to discuss individual cases.  To do so could compromise decisions or, indeed, various judicial review cases before the courts.  However, where we can discuss generalities of case types and broad issues emerging, we will aim to be as helpful as we can.  While not strictly relating to the 2020 financial statements, I might take the opportunity to briefly outline to the committee the nature and status of a number of ongoing reviews, although, unfortunately, I am not in a position to elaborate much more on these matters and processes while they are ongoing.</p> <p>  In recent months, a number of issues and allegations have arisen in respect of potential conflicts of interest and the effectiveness of board systems and procedures.  I fully recognise the seriousness of these issues and the potential damage that these allegations have done to the board&rsquo;s reputation for integrity, independence and impartiality.  I have commissioned a team of senior managers to examine any issues arising, with a view to identifying areas which may require improvements in relation to the suitability and effectiveness of existing controls, procedures and systems which are designed to manage potential conflicts of interest and related matters.  I will take whatever actions and implement whatever reforms may be necessary and appropriate to strengthen our systems and procedures in order to ensure that they are as legally robust and fit for purpose as possible and practicable, and with a view to maintaining public confidence in the impartiality of the board&rsquo;s decision-making processes.  In the same context, I will also take account of any outcomes and proposed recommendations from the ongoing review being undertaken on behalf of the Minister, as well as the targeted review of the board&rsquo;s systems and procedures proposed to be undertaken by the Office of the Planning Regulator later this year.</p> <p>  As committed to as part of its five-year strategy, the board is currently reviewing its code of conduct and any outcomes or recommendations arising from these reviews will be integrated into the code review process, which is expected to be completed by the end of quarter 3 this year.  The board is well aware of its critical role within the planning system, in considering and determining planning appeals and major housing and infrastructure proposals and we remain committed to delivering robust decisions as quickly and effectively as possible.  We are also very cognisant of our corporate governance responsibilities and I can confirm that the board considers itself generally in full compliance with all applicable provisions of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.  We have developed and use a framework of assurances, including an audit and risk committee, internal audits as well as undertaking regular updates at management committee and board levels of our risks and mitigation actions.  The committee will have noted from our annual report and accounts that, in financial terms, the board had a total income of just over &euro;26 million in 2020, primarily comprising an Exchequer grant of &euro;19.25 million and fees revenue of just under &euro;6.8 million.  This represented an increase from 2019, when we received &euro;18.6 million in Exchequer grants and took in just over &euro;5.4 million in fee revenue.</p> <p>  To give the committee a little background on the organisation, the board currently has just over 191 whole-time equivalent staff and nine board members.  The Minister and Department have been very supportive in approving resource requests, in recognition of the increasing demands and complexity of the cases coming before the board, including in relation to strategic housing developments, SHDs, and major infrastructure projects.  The board is currently engaging with the Department in respect of an updated workforce plan for the period 2022-23 to meet its evolving needs and current and future work demands.  The board's primary role is to make planning decisions in a timely manner, in accordance with the legislative framework under which we operate and having regard to the overarching planning policy framework as determined by the Government and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as well as considering local planning policies and the observations from the public and prescribed bodies.</p> <p>  While I appreciate that we are discussing the 2020 annual report and accounts, I would like to give the committee a more up-to-date picture of our casework levels using more current statistics that we have to hand.  These last couple of years have been very challenging for An Bord Plean&aacute;la as they have been for many other organisations and for society generally, with major disruptions to normal life and work practices due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which we are still experiencing and managing with the latest wave.  However, despite these disruptions, the board has been able to keep our public office open in a safe manner through the pandemic phases and was also able to maintain a consistent throughput of case decisions.  We adapted our practices to enable online services and virtual meetings, including the holding of remote oral hearings,and facilitated hybrid office and home working patterns for all staff to ensure that we fully adhered to all health and safety requirements and advices for both staff and the public.</p> <p>  In 2021 the board saw a substantial increase in the overall number of cases lodged, with a total of 3,251 received, up 18% on the previous year.  The number of cases decided by the board in 2021 was up just under 6% on the previous year&rsquo;s total, with 2,775 cases decided.  While some of these increases maybe attributed to the return to normal business following the extensive Covid-related disruptions during 2020, there has also been a marked increase in activity in the planning sector, reflecting the increased residential development activity, as well as wider economic activity across a range of sectors.</p> <p>  On normal planning appeals, the compliance rate with our statutory objective period, SOP, for 2021 fell back to 58% from the 76% recorded in 2020.  This was due to a confluence of factors including the significant rise in case numbers received, reduced staffing capacity arising from the impact of Covid with isolation periods, absences, changes in work practices with ongoing restrictions and managing staff capacity including filling vacancies and covering sick leave in a very challenging environment.  With the significant volume of cases on hand at the end of 2021 and ongoing disruptions from the latest Covid waves, it is proving a significant challenge to reverse this downward trend and return to more acceptable levels of compliance this year.</p> <p>  In the first six months of this year, there has been continued strong case intake with almost 1,600 new applications and appeal cases lodged and some 1,350 cases disposed.  With the significant backlog of cases and prioritisation given to housing and strategic infrastructure cases, the SOP compliance for normal appeals has dipped further to 44%, but we are exploring all options to improve our performance and are working hard to get back to higher compliance levels with the SOP as soon as possible.</p> <p>  In respect of SHDs, the board has continued to prioritise these and just over 100 cases were decided in 2021, with all but one of these determined within the 16-week statutory timeline.  Of these, the board granted permission in 76 cases and refused permission in 25.  There is still a significant volume of applications within the system that will continue to be determined over the coming months, while the new large-scale residential development, LRD, process is already up and running with the local planning authorities.</p> <p>  Similarly, the board saw a jump in strategic infrastructure applications received in 2021, with 30 applications lodged, up from 24 in 2020, and 30 cases decided, up from 19 in 2020.  The total of 74 pre-application consultation requests during 2021, 24 more than were lodged in 2020, indicates a significant ramping up of major complex applications being considered and proposed.</p> <p>  Amid all the Covid-related disruptions, the pandemic provided us with a valuable opportunity to facilitate a greater online and digital offering to staff and the general public.  The board&rsquo;s case management system enabled remote working for all staff, and the ongoing development of the board&rsquo;s online capability was extended during the year to enable observations on planning appeals and strategic infrastructure cases, as well as SHD cases, to be made through our web portal.  The online submission option is a key step in the board&rsquo;s plans to provide more online services such as virtual oral hearings and ultimately the online receipt of applications and appeals over time.  I also welcome the launch of the board&rsquo;s new website which is another step in providing more user-friendly and accessible information to all who avail of our services.  Working closely with the local authorities&rsquo; e-planning initiative,I am hopeful that we will see further phased roll-out of online services over the coming months and into 2023.</p> <p>  The significant increase in the volume of legal challenges to board decisions during 2020 has continued in 2021, with 83 new cases in 2020 and 95 in 2021.  These applications for judicial review of the legality of decisions involve significant detailed legal scrutiny of complex matters of procedure and interpretation relating to European Union environmental directives and other issues arising from the strategic housing development application process.</p><p>All of those cases are dealt with by the superior courts, that is, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, and questions relating to the EU law elements can be referred from those courts to the Court of Justice of the European Union for adjudication.</p><p> Legal costs for representation before the courts are substantial, and there has been a significant escalation of such costs in both 2020 and 2021.  Our gross legal costs were &euro;8.4 million in 2020 and are currently accounted for at &euro;7.7 million in our draft unaudited financial statements for 2021.  These legal costs are split between our costs for solicitor and barrister representation and payments for undersigned costs in instances where the case is lost or conceded.  In respect of the latter, it is accepted that in 2020 and 2021, legal case outcomes revealed a significant number of losses and concessions, amounting to 32 in 2020 and 40 in 2021.  The board is conscious that it needs to continuously review its procedures and approaches to certain matters, having regard to legal judgments and ongoing advice from its legal advisers, with a view to ensuring its decisions are as legally robust as possible.  This process is ongoing but it is still the case that certain areas of planning law remain open to various legal interpretations and are, therefore, still contentious and complex.</p><p> When considered appropriate, the board has, in a small number of selected cases, sought to appeal certain decisions to the relevant appellant courts.  In terms of costs, the prevailing statutory context around planning judicial reviews is that the board is made liable for applicant costs where it loses or concedes a case but generally does not have its own costs awarded against judicial review applicants where it successfully defends the legality of its planning decisions.</p><p> I will leave it there instead of taking up more of members' time.  I am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

There is a combination of court judgments against the board in some of those cases.  To set the context, the difficulty and challenge for the board is that where we get a ruling from the court, which may be nine or 12 months after the judicial review papers are lodged, the board will, in the meantime, have made a substantial number of decisions, given the volume of cases we are dealing with, particularly in the context of SHD cases.  If the court ultimately decides a particular issue or a particular interpretation of law is incorrect, that has knock-on consequences for cases that are still in the system.</p></speech>

The board's job is to make decisions on the basis of the information it has.  If we subsequently find out that a judicial review of a case that was lodged the previous year has identified a particular issue, why would the board continue to defend a similar issue in a case when it can instead concede and not tie up the court's time?  It can cut its losses and the case can be remitted.</p></speech>

In the Committee of Public Accounts we are used to senior management in an organisation having a State board or a board and they are not in the organisation full time.  They are given a small stipend, hold a quarterly meeting and there is oversight of the board.  They have the power to remove senior staff or senior appointees if that is required.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la does not have that kind of facility in the legislation.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I point out to Mr. Walsh the use of that word "emolument", because it is not necessarily salary.  Obviously, it also includes networking, professional profile and any kind of benefit to oneself.  If, again, there is a deviation from that code of conduct, written permission from Mr. Walsh is required.

To be fair, the court is trying to expedite most of the court cases.  The proposals around a planning and environmental court would possibly assist in expediting it.

It is important to understand that it is a report that has fed in a lot to the board's work.  All the 36 actions relate to the actions on which the board is leading.  The board has partially implemented another 21 of the remaining actions but we have not completed them all.  Taking those two together, that is 57 of the 70 actions. Some 31 of the actions that remain are legislative issues that are being considered as part of the planning review and the Department can address those.  The board has not been sitting on its hands doing nothing on these issues.  When we were preparing our five-year strategic plan in 2018, we incorporated all of what we saw were the pragmatic and reasonable steps and actions that were recommended within the report.  We have built them into our five-year strategy.  That strategy is live until 2023.  As part of that process, every year the board adopts what it calls an annual delivery plan, with clear actions and outcomes to be taken.</p></speech>

A good example would be a recommendation that the board should use local offices when it has oral hearings in regional locations.  A lot of the oral hearings the board conducts in regional locations are compulsory purchase order, CPO, related cases that often involve the local authority so it would inappropriate for the board to be organising a meeting where people are challenging a compulsory purchase, possibly an application that a planning authority either brought or supported.  That is an action which in some respects, where there is no local authority involvement, one could say is reasonable to save money for the taxpayer and use available space within a local authority office but it cannot be done in all cases.  That is the subtlety around how the board has looked at each of the 70 actions on which we are leading.</p></speech>

On the one hand there is a report recommending changes, and on the other, the board is saying legislative change is required.  Why do we not have that change six years later?</p></speech>

Certainly, there has been active engagement.  We have an implementation group that comprises officials from the Department and from the board to look at all the actions and how they are being addressed.  Some of them may well ultimately not be implemented.  That is not to say that the recommendations were not made in good faith but they probably do not fit the statutory or the structural aspects of the board.  It is an external review that provided observations.  The Department has been looking at a range of legislative reforms.  Since the report was issued in 2016 we have had major changes through strategic housing and we have had many other disruptions and new functions being taken on by the board.  I do not know if the Department's representative would like to comment.</p></speech>

If a local authority wants to carry out any development, it is tied by Irish Water as regards whether Irish Water can provide a service.  Does Mr. Walsh not think that we have a particular problem in that we have so many players in the field now?  There is the local authority, Irish Water, the Planning Regulator, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and judicial review.  There are quite a lot of people in the field now with regard to planning.

Greater dialogue at the start of the process, which was of use in the SHD process, can stand to address issues before a point is reached where a decision has to be appealed to the board.</p></speech>

I said:</p> <blockquote> 	There will then be a meeting with three representatives, two of whom - who will remain unnamed - may decide to overturn the recommendation of their own inspector and the local authority's decision, while providing minimal information as to how they came to that decision.  It is quite possible that these representatives will never have set foot in the county, never mind having looked at the site in question.  I do not aim to cast aspersions on any members of the board, current or past, but does Mr. Walsh see how there is the potential for corruption in such a system? </blockquote> <p>Mr. Walsh responded:</p> <blockquote> 	I completely reject any allegations of corruption.  Sorry Deputy, I think it is unfair to make any claims like that. </blockquote> <p>He said this even though I had been very clear that I was not making any claims.  As Deputy Munster has noted, Mr. Walsh also said:</p> <blockquote> 	I would challenge anybody to say that there is anything other than proper consideration given to all applications and appeals that come before us. </blockquote> <p>Given that there are now three separate reviews, investigations, audits or whatever you want to call them under way, does Mr. Walsh now accept that there was, in fact, scope for corruption in the way in which the board is structured?</p></speech>

In the meantime, a significant number - probably eight - SHD applications are decided by the board every month because that is the statutory timeline we have to make those decisions.

Nobody has confidence in An Bord Plean&aacute;la as it stands, and that happened under Mr. Walsh's leadership.

We get legal advice on all the actions, and comments from the board.  We integrate those into our learnings for the inspectorate's analysis and the board in terms of the decisions it can and cannot take.  On average, because of the judicial reviews and the lessons we have built in, the inspectorate reports have probably increased in length by 50% to 70% purely to cover off many issues of which the courts have said there is insufficient analysis.  To say we are not taking any actions arising from the judicial reviews is incorrect.  In the last two weeks, the Supreme Court made rulings on two similar cases decided by different judges with different outcomes.  Even the courts are struggling to identify the issues.</p></speech>

It is good to have them before us again and it is certainly timely.  I will take up from what Deputy Carthy touched on regarding the 2020 expenditure of &euro;8.3 million in legal fees.  That was significantly up on the 2019 figure of &euro;3.4 million.  However, the number of cases is down 12% on the 2019 figure.  What is the difference?

The longer a case requires to be defended and continues through the courts, the greater the cost.  We deal with very expensive litigation in the higher courts.  That adds to the overall cost of the board.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General has outlined, roughly half of the costs we incurred were our costs and half were incurred by third parties where we lost.  We do not defend cases where we feel there are significant weaknesses or flaws.  In cases where our legal advice is that this is a difficult one, rather than delay, incur further costs and tie up the courts, we would take concessions so the case can be remitted.  Cases that were lodged in 2018 were only coming to court in 2020 and 2021.  Some of those new JRs are being deferred into the court system at that point.</p></speech>

On the basis of that advice, if we feel it would be more expedient for the board and taxpayer to say there may have been an error, we hold up our hands.  When we are dealing with 3,000 cases per year, sometimes errors are made, there are omissions or insufficient justification is provided in relation to a decision.  Rather than pursuing those and incurring huge costs, we concede those cases.  If any advice comes back from those kinds of cases or cases that have rulings at the end of the process, we build those back in.  We have an inspectorate-----</p></speech>

The last figures I have seen were in late 2019 or thereabouts.  It can go up and down but generally it falls between one in six or seven cases is overturned.  Apologies, I have an update here, in 2020 some 90% of the recommendations made by inspectors were generally accepted by the board.  That was 89%, so it is 10% or 11%.</p></speech>

When we have two quorums of three we can actually have two meetings running concurrently.  Because we are dealing with 3,000-odd cases a year the board would probably convene between 700 and 800 meetings a year.  That requires meetings in the morning, in the afternoon and obviously if we have a full available board as in nine or ten people we can actually have three quorums at the same time.</p></speech>

To my mind to operate on a minimum and have several meetings running concurrently would not be satisfactory given the outcome and certainly the position Mr. Walsh is in today.

In regard to large-scale cases some fairly large infrastructure cases would mean bringing all available board members in.  As things stand at the moment I have eight board members available to me.  There are two divisions, strategic housing which has four members and strategic infrastructure has five members.  Three would be the norm.  I am satisfied that provides enough variety of views and context.</p></speech>

It started in July 2015 and was published in 2016.  I am quoting from the senior counsel's own statement that says "The Review Group was set a tight timeframe set by the Minister for carrying out its tasks.  Sometimes that is the best way."  Obviously only 36 of the 101 recommendations have been implemented.  Why is that?</p></speech>

There are 31 of those included.  Of the 70 that remain for the board to deal with 36 have been fully completed, about 21 of them are in train and partially completed, and there are others that we may not implement at all because some of them are not, as I mentioned to others, pragmatic in the context of how the board operates and indeed what is appropriate.  We have integrated many of these actions into our five-year strategy.  The fact that the record shows only 36 complete does not necessarily reflect the fact of broader implementation.</p></speech>

There were obviously illegal actions, unlawful actions, either by board members or inspectors that warranted him to concede 40 cases this year and 32 last year.

It is a very simple issue.  One might say "where is the justification to enable us to satisfy ourselves on that issue?"  That actually affected a number of cases.  The board conceded those cases but since then - and back to the issue I mentioned to both Deputies Carthy and Devlin - the board has integrated those learnings into the reports so that now every single report that comes through on any file like that covers fully all of those aspects.  The simple question is "How have we learned from those lessons?"</p></speech>

It has been an interesting and informative debate.  I will take a slightly different approach or angle to the discussion because I will focus on housing delivery.  Up and down my constituency I have people, and young people in particular, who would like to live in or remain in areas in which they have grown up.  As a councillor and Deputy, I have felt long-term frustration in dealing with strategic housing applications and other types of housing applications but not seeing that turn into places for such young people to live.  That is what I wanted to follow up and I suggest there is a strong role for the Department in that.</p> <p>  In respect of the strategic housing developments, what is the total number of units that have been applied for?  How many of those have been granted permission and how many were commenced or built?</p></speech>

We will be monitoring the number of strategic housing developments granted by the board and not quashed, as well as the timeline to delivery.  Normally speaking, one would expect to see a development start within two years but we were concerned at the beginning of Housing for All that many of the permissions are not turning into housing.  That is why there are a number of actions in Housing for All dealing with issues around viability, such as the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe cities scheme, with the provision for the first homes launched during the week.  There are also broader issues regarding cost of construction because many of the strategic housing developments are very large and they tend to be apartments.</p><p>We know that the costs of building them are quite high.  From a policy perspective, we look at the outcome of the board, which gives us the data.  We then look at the data in terms of what has started.  We can pass that on to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-14a.494" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022071400002#M00200"><p>From a public representation perspective, it is very frustrating to see what I suggest are aggressive applications being made relative to the neighbourhood.  People wonder whether the developer is doing it deliberately in order to be constrained.  It deeply upsets the local community.  If an even slightly softer approach were taken, people would be on board because they want to see the development of housing.  It is just a little pushy and aggressive.  If there are nine storeys instead of seven in an old, established residential area, people become very upset.  Councillors make all these observations at local level and the application goes to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Mr. Walsh might respond as to how many times applications of that nature have been varied by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to be more consistent with the local environment.  My major concern, having gone through that process and with people being very clearly upset, is that we still need houses but I do not see them getting built.</p> <p>  I investigated some of this in my area.  Ms Graham is right about cost and that is one issue, but why are we spending time on applications without being sure these things can in fact be built?  Is there any measure of consideration given on that side?  The significant amount of State time, energy and cost to assess the applications, including local energy and investment and the role of the local council, is one thing.  Difficulties with Irish Water come up again and again.  There is then the matter of judicial reviews.  I have spoken to developers to try to weed out what the specific issues are, either with the council or Irish Water.  Why are they not developing in the area I represent where I know people need housing?  Judicial review comes up again and again.  I have no difficulty with residents associations, or people directly affected who have been involved in a process or are adjacent to it, taking judicial reviews, but my question relates to judicial reviews being taken where the applicant had not been previously engaged or involved in any sense.  Does Mr. Walsh have any sense of the proportion of judicial review applications where an applicant had not been involved in any way prior to taking such an application? </p></speech>

We do not track whether a floor has disappeared or a block is amended.  Sometimes they are subtle and sometimes not, but each case is assessed on the basis of its particular location and its proximity to other developments.  It is very difficult to say that a five-, three- or seven-storey building here will not have the same impact as a seven-storey building somewhere else.  Judgments and assessments are made on the basis of a building's impact on daylight and sunlight, including in respect of its future occupants.  We often think about what is happening for properties and people who are living in the area already, but one of the key considerations is what the quality of life and space and size are.  Do they meet the minimum requirements?  Do people get enough sunlight and daylight into their amenity space or balcony?  I am aware and have sat in meetings where there have been instances where not only have we removed some floors, as recommended either by the planning authority or the inspector, but in some respects we have removed some blocks, particularly on a larger scale, where we feel open space is at more of a premium.  The board has the scope to make those amendments and to look at it, but our job is not to redesign the thing to make it right.  Where we feel those additional measures can address the key concerns and requirements around standards, that is an option open to the board.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's other question on parties who may not have participated in the process, judicial reviews are generally taken by people who have engaged, either as an observer in the local authority or as an observer and submitter in the board's direct applications.  That is a requirement for someone to then take a judicial review.  It is irrelevant to the board whether they are raising major or minor issues.  If somebody makes a valid submission and observation on an application or appeal, that person is party to the decision and will get the due consideration that everybody else will get.  Obviously, if the individual only identifies one issue or talks about compliance with EU law, that is as much a consideration as whether it has an impact on amenities in a residential neighbourhood.  That is the practical approach.  I am not sure if that addresses the Deputy's question.  I do not have numbers on it but that is the reviews.</p></speech>

It is probably best not to go into individual instances.  What does the Department estimate the additional cost of judicial reviews to be?  A judicial review can of course be taken but when it comes to delivery, I am concerned about people who actually want to buy places to live in.  What is the cost inflation implication of the duration of a judicial review on delivery of the end product?  If the project has been costed at the outset, what is the cost implication of a standard judicial review?</p></speech>

It builds in a risk factor.  Figures vary of course but I have heard, in some cases, figures of &euro;2 million on a big development, where somebody puts judicial review in as a contingency.</p></speech>

A figure of &euro;2 million does not mean anything on a big development but, for example, if a young person in my constituency wants to buy an apartment that is being priced at &euro;400,000 because it has gone through a judicial review and all sorts of different things, what cost is being built in to anticipate judicial review?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-14a.500" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022071400002#M00800"><p>It is very important to know that.  At the end of the day, the cost is being passed on, whether a judicial review is taken or not.  If a risk premium is being built into the financing of a project in anticipation of such a review, which I again say people are entitled to take, that is a meaningful effect on cost.  People are telling us that.  It is important the Department be aware of that, particularly at a time of such acute cost inflation.  Will the officials come back to us with some analysis of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-14a.501" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Graham Doyle" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022071400002#M00900"><p>We could try to do some analysis on that.  It is one of the reasons for the move away from SHD for large-scale developments back to that two-stage process to try to have fewer scenarios that result in judicial review.  The hope is that will bring down those numbers and, therefore, those costs the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

From a transparency and public confidence perspective generally, however, if we go back to the people who live beside applications, and this will persist in respect of the new system also, it is important people see that the board can vary and has varied, and that they see the way in which that can and does happen.  Is there any analysis that can be done on the 2020 figures, for example, of the number of occasions where something was varied relative to the application?  For example, there was a very significant application to site a co-living space in my constituency, which is the subject of significant discontent.  The board varied it very considerably but that never really fed through in the same way.  It is important from a public confidence perspective to know whether, where and how that is actually happening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-14a.503" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dave Walsh" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022071400002#M01100"><p>We can look at it to see if we can get some information.  The Deputy mentioned public confidence and the understanding of the system.  It is important that over the past three or four years, the challenge and complexity around what the board has been dealing with in relation to SHDs primarily relates to the fact that national policy, that is, the national planning framework, NPF, and national guidelines have moved far more quickly than some of the local plans.  The board is looking at national as well as local policies.  It has to try to balance and assess whether the local plans, which predate the national planning framework or the apartment guidelines, fit in with those.  We are now at a point where because most of the planning authorities' new development plans are being updated to take account of the NPF, the regional spatial and economic strategies, RSESs, and all the new updated guidelines, there will be far less need for the board to materially contravene many local plans because they are not in line with national policy.  Many of the issues to date, and much of the controversy or concern, arise from the fact we have someone looking for something that is outside the density or height levels.  When the new plans come through, that will make it clearer.  As the Secretary General said, it will certainly be relevant when it comes to the LRD processes that are coming through.</p></speech>

The officials all know because they were there, but for clarity Mr. Walsh was assistant secretary when I was Minister, though in a totally different area, to be fair.</p><p> I commissioned the organisational review under Gregory Jones in 2016 because I believed it was necessary as it had never been done before.  We had never had a review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and I had concerns.  All the actions have been listed as either "complete", "ongoing" or "to be determined".  What is the breakdown?  There is also a note saying a number of issues cannot be dealt with until the review of Housing for All is complete because there is a legislative capacity on that, which I understand because I have asked about it in the D&aacute;il.  However, there have been six years in between.  There are so many issues here that have never been dealt with.  For instance, recommendations Nos. 8 to 12, inclusive, on the appointment of members to the board, have never been implemented, and it is pretty obvious that they have to be.  One of them is basically that it said the nominating bodies were completely out of date, which seems a pretty obvious one.  Why then have they not been implemented and what is the breakdown regarding the three areas under which the board is claiming status on all the recommendations, six years after it was completed?</p></speech>

I will come back to the Deputy on that.  There is obviously an implementation group that was set up.  I think that was something the Deputy mandated himself at the time, as I understand it.  I am more recent to the organisation.  In the context of the recommendations around appointments and open processes, I think there was a recommendation in the review that two members be appointed by an external process.  What we are now moving to will of course require a legislative update as part of the review of the planning legislation.  I think this was the first recommendation in the review in 2016.  This has been worked through over the last 12 months.  There has been intense engagement across a number of forums, particularly with the Attorney General's office, around that.  The Minister is very much in favour of moving to open recruitment across the board.</p></speech>

A number of these matters will require debate, policy decision and ultimately legislation by the Oireachtas.

From a time and efficiency point of view, the best way for us to deal with this is by looking at the breakdown of the actions requiring legislative change that fall within the Department's remit.  Will Mr. Doyle provide for us, from MINMAC minutes, any references to any of those actions?  Then we will see if any progress was being made on any of them.  If they were being pursued, surely they would be referenced.  I have a concern that nothing happened on many of them until the review of planning legislation, which I welcome.  I would like to get to the bottom of that.</p></speech>

Of those, as we outlined, 36 have been actioned and completed.  Of the remaining 34 actions, 21 have partial implementation.  Again, maybe it is not detailed in this.  As an example, we undertook some reviews of oral hearings.  We undertook a review of our oral hearing processes.  One of the recommendations set out in the report talked about treating the oral hearing process very much like the court, so you have grounds and legal papers.</p></speech>

It relates to competency in EU law.  There are five planning cases from Ireland at the Court of Justice at the moment and another three on the way.  They all relate to the interpretation of the environmental impact assessment directive or the habitats directive.  That is eight cases.  It is quite an expensive situation for us.  Why is the board's decision-making not able to give proper effect to EU law to avoid these scenarios?  Has the board enough competency?  Is there a deficiency in knowledge of EU law?  Is there a requirement for training internally?  This is seismic and is going to cost a lot of money.  Dare I say it, many of these cases could be lost.  Why is it happening so often?  Is there a deficiency in capacity within the board?  Why are these not being intercepted so the actual directives are being interpreted directly?</p></speech>

It is something that was very much in the mind of the Attorney General in the context of the planning review.  Obviously, the board is working in the legislative frame that binds it.  We were before the Oireachtas joint committee recently on the question of environmental assessment.  One of the aspects we are looking at is that the new legislation would have all of the environmental piece in one part with clear signposting.  That would be to ensure we are transposing things correctly, it has the constitutional public participation requirements and it is clear for future-proofing with regard to anything that comes from the court.  From a skills perspective, we have obviously had a lot of legislation, including new functions in the marine area, going to the board so the nature of the skills required on an ongoing basis is something we have discussed with it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-14a.542" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022071400002#O00200"><p>I ask the Deputy to be careful.

It is on the record anyway.  One of the submissions turned out to be fictitious, if the witnesses remember that.  It got all the way up to the end of the planning process.  This was acknowledged.  In fairness, An Bord Plean&aacute;la responded to the issue at the time.  To me, that means the decision-making process is not correct, because a component of that decision was something that should never have got through.  As a result, the hotel ended up not being built in south Kerry and many people did not end up with jobs.  It had a dramatic impact on a small community.  This has been well reported on.  What has happened since then to make sure that can never happen again?  What changes have been made?</p></speech>

We send correspondence back to them to acknowledge it.  If the correspondence is returned, it is a sign that it may be the wrong address or that there may be another issue.  We would pursue it.  We often send three or four letters as reminders, sometimes in registered post.  If there are no responses and nothing can be delivered, we have to make a call about whether that is a valid observation.  That is the normal practice generally.  In the case the Deputy is referring to, without going into details, that was not the only observation on that particular case.</p></speech>

I want to come back to a few points that others have raised.  I sought the terms of reference and An Bord Plean&aacute;la sent them to me.  The first paragraph states that recent media reports have raised a number of matters relating to conflicts of interest which have potentially arisen in decisions on particular case types, certain other matters relating to the operation of two-person boards, and general procedures relating to the allocation of case files and amendments to inspectors' reports.  Will the witnesses clarify what case types are concerned?  I know it includes mobile phone masts.  Does it include SHDs or other particular case types?</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh described a case of a mobile phone mast where he had set the procedures.  My understand was that once that decision has been made, it is open-ended about that particular type of development.  Section 108(1B) of the Planning and Development Act states:</p> <blockquote> 	The resolution referred to in subsection (1A) shall specify the functions of the Board or division of the Board which may be performed in a meeting with a quorum of 2 and the period of time during which the specified functions may be performed. </blockquote> <p>That certainly does not indicate to me that it is open-ended, but that it is time-limited.

Mr. Walsh described where he grew up.  I know what he is saying.  It is not really open to interpretation when a person lives somewhere.  Mr. Walsh said it is up to the individual board member to declare that conflict.  What oversight is there to make sure that happens and there is quality control?</p></speech>

The code of conduct, under section 15.6, states that where there is any doubt about whether there might be a conflict of interest, the matter shall be resolved by the chairperson.</p></speech>

That does not address the Deputy's particular question.  Board members are probably involved in 500 to 700 cases each over the course of the years.  Cases might involve someone who is not a direct family member, who a board member worked with, or who lived in a house 5 miles away.  It requires trust and responsibility.  This is where the code comes in.</p></speech>

I asked Mr. Walsh whether he saw a flaw in that system, or something to that effect, but he did not see that was the case when he was last in with us.</p> <p>  SHDs are being phased out.  We saw a new one the other day because we had some interaction, which surprised me because I thought there was a hard deadline, but obviously not.  If we look at the profile of SHDs and judicial reviews, we can see that it escalated once the opportunity for people to appeal was taken away.  Does Mr. Walsh not see in retrospect that that changed the dynamic completely and that it was a major flaw?  Would he not have alerted Government to that being a major problem?</p></speech>

The Department is well aware of the number of judicial reviews with which we are dealing and the costs associated with those, because they feature in our annual reports and budgets.  With regard to the Deputy's fundamental question about whether SHDs have been shown to be flawed, it is not question for the board because the board implements whatever Government and Oireachtas policy is.  We had the same issue when SID came in back in 2007.  There were many judicial reviews as the legislation was being tested.  The difference is that there might have been one or two cases per year that would have been impacted by those decisions.  In the intervening period of making judicial reviews and having judgments, we are seeing 50 or 60 cases, which reflects the fact there are multiple judicial reviews and concessions.</p></speech>

I believe 70,000 units were given permission and 13,000 have been completed.  SHDs are a minor part of adding to the costs of delivery of houses.

That is fine.  Up to 20% would seem grand, but this is 90%.  There is an average of 10% and, in certain cases dealing with a certain type of infrastructure and certain individuals making decisions, a situation is reached where it is 90%.  That would not just be a red flag.  There would be a red light flashing all over the room.  No one in the board saw it.</p></speech>

In 2018, the legal fees were &euro;1.2 million.  In 2021, they are &euro;8.4 million.  That is exceptional.  Much of that relates to the strategic housing developments, which are now history and which, I believe, were an awful imposition altogether and were put together on a false basis that somehow the planning process could not be speeded up at local authority level.  Does the board envisage an increase in legal fees as a result of the multiplicity of examinations and investigations I mentioned and the potential outworkings of that?  Does Mr. Walsh envisage an increase in legal fees over the next year or two?  As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am interested in this.</p></speech>

If people take a judicial review, the board, obviously, has to seek its own advice.  That is not directly within the board's control.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh has said that An Bord Plean&aacute;la does not have an internal legal person and that it must go outside.

We were talking about the issues of the challenges and the areas that have been points of concern.  I want to give an example of a case.  As this case has concluded, there is no issue.  It is in relation to a telecommunications mast in my own constituency that I am aware of in a small village called Glaslough.  Monaghan County Council refused planning permission for that.  I have the 12-page report, which is available in the public domain, as to the rationale for that.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la sent its inspector - no doubt an eminently qualified inspector - to adjudicate on that decision when that decision was appealed by the telecommunications company.  The inspector produced a detailed 34-page report upholding the decision of Monaghan County Council.  Then An Bord Plean&aacute;la - I am not sure whether it was one person, two people or three people made this decision - compiled what could be generously described as a four-page report - there are lots of blanks.</p> <p>  I can tell Mr. Walsh, having read both of these others, there is no way that anybody could understand what rationale the board had for overturning that.  It cites Acts but does not indicate which aspects of those Acts are responsible.  It states in this-----</p></speech>

At a previous meeting with the committee, Mr. Walsh acknowledged that board members will most likely never have set foot in the general area about which they are making a decision.  Mr. Walsh has said anyone can write to the board.  I am not making a judgment one way or another in respect of the application but could anyone who might have a concern about that decision know there was a potential that the people who made this decision also happened to have been a part of 75% of decisions where the inspector's report was overturned?  How would anyone know there may be allegations in respect of the connections of some of those board member with telecommunications companies?

I have never seen anything like how scant it is and yet Mr. Walsh says all the information is publicly available.  The names of the inspector and the board member are included.  There is a description of the case type, which might state "normal planning".  There is a bare sentence for everything.  There are references to split votes, with an option for "Yes" and "No".  If there was a split vote, there is an opportunity to include the relevant ratio.  There are other sections that include "Discussion" and "Refusal for oral hearing".  There is nothing else.  The website does not state why there was a refusal for an oral hearing.  I ask Mr. Walsh not to clap himself on the back.  He has a body of work to do and he would want to start doing it because as far as I am concerned, there is no trust and confidence in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There is absolutely none.  There is nothing transparent about what the board is doing, I am afraid to say.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Walsh.

I spent 20 minutes on a Zoom call with the Planning Regulator who insisted there were such minimum densities but was unable to point me towards them anywhere.</p> <p>  The Wexford county development plan has been framed and minimum densities have been inserted.  We are talking about saving the public and getting value for money for the taxpayer.  We have two arms of the State, that is, the two main statutory bodies dealing with planning.  One states there are minimum density requirements and the other states there are not.

When an organisation of the scale of the board, which is not a large organisation but deals with a significant volume of cases and large complex cases, there must be a certain level of trust within the system, but the system must then back it up in asking what spot checks and controls are in place.  Where we can identify weaknesses in those, and we will not be shy in taking action on foot of any reviews by us or through the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, we can strengthen and provide that level of confidence.</p></speech>

The OPR announced in March or early April that it was undertaking a review of the board's systems and procedures as part of its second wave of local authority reviews.  The OPR has done five or six of them.  It has scheduled the review for the latter half of next year.  That would have looked at the board's systems and procedures and given us a review of best practice.  Because of what has happened, it has front-loaded some elements of that relating to certain aspects.  I expect that this review will probably kick off some time in the next couple of months.</p></speech>

I would have thought that, as a matter of course, if I was up before the Committee of Public Accounts and I made a declaration on several occasions in respect of an issue - in this instance that cases are assigned on a randomised basis - the first thing I would have done when I went back to the office would be to ask somebody to make sure that was actually the case.  Mr. Walsh did not do that.  Is that not his evidence?  He has not at any point up until this current review carried out an assessment as to whether the assertions he is making to the Committee of Public Accounts are factual.</p></speech>

In one instance, there was a situation, as the Chairman correctly outlined, where inspectors' reports were increasingly being disallowed or overturned by a board in respect of a particular type of development at a huge scale.  This was unprecedented, as far as I can make, out in terms of the board previously having made decisions.  Mr. Walsh had a couple of reasons.  He was making the assertion to the Committee of Public Accounts very strongly.  All of a sudden, his inspectors' reports were being rejected on a massive scale.  There were communities the length and breadth of the country stating that the decisions were unfair and were not based on proper, adequate rationale.  There was all of the rationale to carry out even a paper assessment as to whether what he was asserting to the Committee of Public Accounts was true and Mr. Walsh did not do that.  Is that not correct?</p></speech>

That explains the breakdown of it.  I have another question to ask in my remaining minute.  With all of the changes between the strategic housing developments, SHDs, that were brought in and the strategic infrastructure developments, SIDs, there was a requirement - of which I was critical at the time - that An Bord Plean&aacute;la was not equipped IT-wise for those changes.  The interface between the public and An Bord Plean&aacute;la lacked a lot of improvement.  It is good to see the changes on the website, which I have witnessed and which are important.  The cost, however, is quite eye watering from my perspective.  Yes, there is some consultancy in that but I ask that An Bord Plean&aacute;la would be conscious of that going into the next year.</p> <p>  I would like a breakdown of the oral hearings.  Earlier I asked about the inspectors' reports and how often these are overturned and overlooked.  It seems to me that it is a shot in the dark whether or not an application goes to an oral hearing.  What are the criteria for the board making a decision about an oral hearing?  Is the quorum for that decision equally two or three members?  I believe this would have ramifications if an oral hearing is granted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-14a.892" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dave Walsh" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022071400002#U03500"><p>If an appellant seeks a request for an oral hearing an inspector will examine the file and make a recommendation to the board as to whether she or he considers there is sufficient information on the file to enable her or him to make an assessment.  Then that goes to the board for a decision.  In the vast majority of cases the inspector's recommendation is carried through.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's last question, for oral planning appeals an oral hearing request can be considered by a two-person meeting.  As I said earlier to the Cathaoirleach, if there are any cases that relate to strategic infrastructure that require an environmental impact assessment, they cannot be dealt with by a two-person quorum.</p></speech>

Obviously, there are oral hearings that, while not considered mandatory, are considered part of the process in relation to strategic infrastructure.  They can still be dispensed with.  There is an option to do that under SHD and we have held a few oral hearings.  With regard to other elements, I can come back to the Deputy with that.</p></speech>

Yesterday, the Planning and Development, Maritime and Valuation (Amendment) Bill 2022 went through D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  An amendment was proposed to be put in by the Government to allow An Bord Plean&aacute;la to change a decision after it was challenged by a judicial review.  Is that correct?  Was this the intention of the amendment?  I was not following it exactly myself because I was tied up with work around this committee and various other things.  Will Ms Graham clarify if this is correct?</p></speech>

I understand there are two amendments to the judicial review process being progressed through the D&aacute;il at the moment.  One is leave that the court would decide that all administrative processes have been complete, so that leave to appeal would depend on other factors too.  For example, some cases for judicial review before the board may have gone for judicial review during the course, or maybe a couple of times during the course.  This provision would be as envisaged in the Aarhus Convention, that the court is used after the local authority and the other appeals' routes have been exhausted.</p></speech>

We will consider minutes, accounts, financial statements, correspondence, work programme and any other business.</p> <p>  The minutes of the meeting of 7 July have been circulated to members.  Do they wish to raise any matters arising from the minutes?  If not, are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee's web page.</p> <p>  Moving to accounts and financial statements, we will consider a good few of these today.  There were 13 sets of financial statements laid before the Houses between 30 June and 8 July.  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to address these before opening to comments from the floor.</p></speech>

That is for 2021.</p> <p>  The second set is from the Mental Health Commission, again for 2021, and this received a qualified audit opinion.  The accounts, in my view, give a true and fair view, except that they account for the costs of retirement benefit entitlements only as they become payable, and that is standard for many health bodies.  It is in the nature of a technical qualification there and it is only qualified in regard to that point.</p> <p>  There are nine sets of financial statements that come from the National Treasury Management Agency stable, if you like, and it has a very broad remit.</p><p>The first one is the accounts of the national debt of Ireland for 2021.  That received a clear audit opinion.  The next one is the administration account for the National Treasury Management Agency.  These are the expenses of the organisation.  There is a clear audit opinion for 2021.  Next is the Post Office Savings Bank Fund for 2021.  It is a clear audit opinion.</p><p> The State Claims Agency received a clear audit opinion for 2021, but I do draw attention to the disclosure in the statement on internal control that there were a number of erroneous payments made in 2021 to service providers due to the agency's manual payment processing.  The service providers returned the payment so there was no net loss, but still it was a control failing.</p><p> Next is the Dormant Accounts Fund for 2021.  It received a clear audit opinion.  The National Surplus (Reserve Fund for Exceptional Contingencies) for 2021 received a clear audit opinion, but that is a nil account where there is no balance in the account at the moment.  No. 9 is the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund for 2021, which received a clear audit opinion.  No. 10 is the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  This is a fund that is now dissolved, and these are the final accounts for 2021.  It received a clear audit opinion.  The Ireland Apple Escrow Fund for 2021 received a clear audit opinion.</p><p> Moving on from the NTMA accounts, No. 12 is the Child and Family Agency, also known as Tusla.  For 2021 it received a clear audit opinion, but I drew attention to the disclosures that are made in the accounts on material non-compliant procurement and the implications for Tusla of the cyberattack on the HSE's ICT system.  Tusla relies on support from the HSE for its ICT system.</p><p> The next one is the Cork Education and Training Board.  These are the financial statements for 2020.  It received a clear audit opinion, but I drew attention to disclosures about material non-compliant procurement, which occurs in other ETBs.  I also drew attention to significant delay and additional costs incurred by the board on a capital project for the building of an extension to one of its schools, due to the failure of the first appointed contractor in December 2017.  Last week, when the Department of Education was here, Deputy Murphy drew attention to that kind of situation.  There is another ETB coming forward where I draw attention to a similar problem.  Undoubtedly, there is or has been an issue there.</p><p> The final one for noting this week is the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission for 2021, which received a clear audit opinion.</p></speech>

They relate to service unit staff etc.  It states in the reply that the State Claims Agency does not disclose its contingent liability figures for reasons of litigation sensitivity for a particular series or cohort of similar claims.  However, it does presumably have a contingent liability.  I am slightly confused about the issue.  Does each Department hand over responsibility to the State Claims Agency?</p></speech>

It has a note in the accounts, but it does not make a provision for it.  I cannot recall the figure offhand but if, let us say, the value of claims is &euro;4 billion, what we might see is that &euro;3.6 billion of that is reflected as a contingent liability in the HSE financial statements, because ultimately it will be passed back to it.</p></speech>

Could we agree to note the listings of financial statements?  Agreed.  As usual, the listing of the accounts of the financial statements will be published as part of our minutes.</p> <p>  I will move on to correspondence.  As previously agreed, items that are not flagged for discussion at this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated.  Decisions taken by the committee in regard to correspondence are published on the committee's web page and recorded in the minutes.</p> <p>  The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is B &ndash; correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers, and follow-up from committee meetings.  The first is No. 1335.  It is from Ms Rhonda Evans, communications manager, National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.  It is dated 29 June 2022.  It is an update on the previous recommendations made by the committee.  At our meeting last week, we agreed to note and publish this item of correspondence.  Deputy Carthy requested that we hold it over for consideration today.  Does he want to comment?</p></speech>

Their refusal to provide us with the documentation we have requested is equally not acceptable.  I ask that we put this item on the cl&aacute;r when we return after the recess to assess whether there are other options available to the committee to get forthright answers, particularly from the Department of Health, which has overall responsibility.  I do not know how we can have a long-term plan for our health services in the financial sense without knowing how much the biggest infrastructure project within that sector is going to cost us in the long run.  This is something the committee is going to have to remain vigilant on.</p></speech>

Clearly, lessons have to be learned from this.  We cannot have another open-ended situation like this where the State and the taxpayer are left exposed.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  We move on to item No. 1342 B, which is from Mr. David Gunning, chief executive officer of the National Children's Hospital.  It came as a cover letter.  Does Deputy Murphy wish to comment?</p></speech>

I specifically asked a question on whether there were other triggers.  This goes to whether there can be counterclaims, at what point one would trigger a counterclaim and whether it is just at the end of the contract.  They went through in some detail that they had to wait until all of it was completed before they could decide whether there was a counterclaim.  We are being told something different here.  On the day when they were before the committee, I asked them whether there were any other triggers and it was an immediate &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  This is going back on that.  The Comptroller and Auditor General can tell me if I am wrong, but my interpretation is there are opportunities to make counterclaims and there are other triggers.  There is this moratorium where they have all started to be nice to each other to try to limit claims and, for that reason, they backed off putting in counterclaims.  There are other triggers.  Am I right in my interpretation of that?</p></speech>

I was surprised by the answer the Deputy was given at the meeting.  I think there was a piece of correspondence which No. 1342 is correcting.  I was surprised by that as well.  We made some inquiries after last week's meeting and I think that is what prompted this week's letter, No. 1342.  It reverses completely what was stated previously and does acknowledge there are potential triggers for claims by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, against the contractor.</p></speech>

I would have pursued that line and that is what I had intended to try to pursue.  In contracts, there are often a range of different things and it is not just all the eggs in one basket at the end.</p></speech>

It is for the NPHDB to provide the information.  I recall that, on an earlier occasion, the committee wrote quite a detailed letter to the NPHDB and one of the things it asked for was a copy of the clauses of the contract that deal with claims and counterclaims.  My recollection is that when it responded to that, it gave other information but it did not give the committee the clauses.</p></speech>

During the engagement on 16 June, during Deputy Carthy's contribution, the chief officer stated that claims continue to come in during the moratorium.  It would appear from the correspondence before us that while the contractor continues to make claims, even though they cannot be progressed through dispute resolution, the board has not done so.  I propose we request clarity from the board on this.</p> <p>  Witnesses are generally invited to assist us in examining their accounts.  Although I could not be present at the meeting, I understand there was a poor level of engagement by the board with the committee and that was brought to the chief officer's attention.  He committed to: &ldquo;take it away and take note of it to consider how we can do better to fulfil these particular requirements.&rdquo;  The correspondence does not, to my mind, represent improvement in that regard.</p> <p>  Members might also recall that we requested information from the board in regard to certain contractual provisions in advance of the engagement on 16 June, and that was not provided and no explanation was given on its omission.  I suggest we reiterate that request, as well as seeking an explanation for the failure to provide the information to the committee.  I would also suggest we afford the chief officer the opportunity to review the transcript of the meeting on 16 June to ensure he is satisfied that the information he has provided to the committee is entirely accurate.</p> <p>  I want to make that point because I was not at the meeting, which was chaired by Deputy Murphy.</p></speech>

The ultimate cost of this hospital will be determined by a number of things.  It will also be determined by the number of counterclaims that can be made where they have not abided by their side of the contract.  We have both been pursuing this particular line.  I do not want a general letter like this.  I want the specifics in regard to what those triggers are and there should be some detail in that.  It is obviously things that are already gone.  I would have pursued this in much more detail.  It is very frustrating they can just send in a letter a couple of weeks later, yet we do not have the opportunity to expand on something when they are here and we are just writing to them to try to drag more information out of them.  It is utterly unsatisfactory.</p></speech>

It is crystal clear to me that we are going to have to consider whether our work plan in the autumn includes another hearing with the board and the Department.  It is not technical.  This is a substantial issue.  If there is a situation where, as I mentioned previously, the board and the Department are refusing to give an estimated final cost, then it is imperative that every other question is clarified, especially in regard to claims, because we know those claims are going to be a substantial part of whatever the final overrun is.  Looking at the construction inflation costs announced today and where we are heading with this, the mind boggles as to where this project could finally end up, considering again the geniuses who signed off on this contract agreed the State would take the full hit for everything over and above 4%.  We have a legitimate interest in pursuing these issues and I would consider that the board and the Department have an obligation to respond in a frank and forthright manner.</p></speech>

One is that we may need to bring the members of the board in before us in the not too distant future.  My opinion is that given the nature of what we have witnessed in the past two years and the responses we are getting from the board, we should certainly keep that proposal under active consideration.  We need to include it in the work programme with a question mark as to timing.  It is not a question of whether we bring them back; it is a question of when we do so.  It would crystallise the issues somewhat in terms of-----</p></speech>

This correspondence is very short and does not give us the kind of detail we need and that we would have got from the members of the board had they been in front of us.  They need to give us the detail of what the other triggers are, apart from the completion date.  I want that information in detail, including how many triggers there are, examples of them and that kind of thing, highlighting where this is set out as part of the contract.  We probably have some of that information but they should be asked to provide it.  Their role in coming in here was for us to hold them to account.  If they do not give candid replies on issues as basic as this, it is very difficult to do that.  Let us see what information we can get from them.  There is no doubt that we must have them back in before us.</p></speech>

The next correspondence is 1341B from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General of the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, dated 4 July 2022, providing information requested by the committee regarding inflation in respect of the national home retrofit scheme.  It is proposed to note the correspondence and publish it to the website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Carthy flagged this correspondence.</p></speech>

This is an issue that will become more prevalent in our work because the budget for retrofitting is going to increase as the climate action plan takes hold.  It would be useful if we could get clarification from the Department on a number of issues, including the reallocation of &euro;40 million of the carbon tax fund from retrofitting to the purchase of gas and diesel generators this winter.  An update from the Department as to what impact that will have on the roll-out of the retrofitting programme would be helpful.</p> <p>  I hope the Chairman can provide some clarification on a second matter.  It would be useful if the committee could get a sense of how much of each local authority's housing stock continues to be serviced by solid fuel heating systems.  There has been much debate about the regulations that are coming in this week.  We have a situation where some publicly owned homes have stoves as the only means of heating the water and the home.  This is the low-hanging fruit in terms of what needs to be done if we are serious about reducing the use of solid fuels.  I know the local authorities are not accountable to us but can we write to each of them asking for that information?  The Department responds to parliamentary questions saying the information is in the hands of the local authorities.</p></speech>

There are some census figures as well, although that information might not be included in the latest data.  Many people with stoves are looking to hold on to them because of the price of electricity and gas.  However, I take the Deputy's point and we will seek that information from the Department.</p></speech>

However, if it is done as part of a full retrofit, people will take the opportunity.  If their stove is taken out to put in a gas boiler, they will naturally be wary.</p></speech>

We will request that information.</p> <p>  The next correspondence is 1345B from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Health, dated 6 July 2022, providing information requested by the committee regarding the overall expenditure to date on the national maternity hospital project.  It is proposed to note the correspondence and publish it to the website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  It caught my eye that from 2014 to 2022, there was a sum total of &euro;95.3 million spent on the national maternity hospital.  I do not know  whether there is a plan for construction and what the situation is regarding the site, the legalities and so on.  There was a deal signed off recently.  I do not know whether any of the members or the Comptroller and Auditor General can help me out on this.  I can understand why there would be survey costs and that various different consultants had to be brought in to do different pieces of work, but nearly &euro;100 million has been spent and I have not even seen a drawing.  How does one spend &euro;100 million and not even have the JCBs on site, as I often say?  In fact, this amount was spent before we even had the deal for the site signed.  It is an incredible sum of money.  Can Mr. McCarthy shed any light on it?</p></speech>

The letter indicates that a new pharmacy was built.  I understand the pharmacy for the hospital is on the site where the new hospital is to be built.  That had to be removed first and a new pharmacy built to serve the whole campus.  That was one aspect of it.  The second issue, I understand, was that some of the car park space is being used to enable the building.  That was being made ready and the car park had to be extended.  Those are things that had to be done before the hospital could be built.</p></speech>

This means that if there is &euro;95 million spent in total, there is about &euro;40 million on planning and design.  It seems like a lot for a project that did not have a site.</p></speech>

We certainly need to query the difference between the cost of the pharmacy and the car parking and what else has been spent.  We need to get more detail on that.</p><p>Another thing jumps out at me from the letter.  We have just been talking about something very similar.  It states:</p><blockquote>	As the construction contracts for a number of these works are ongoing, the individual contract costs are commercially sensitive and therefore are not broken out separately. </blockquote><p>Somebody will be back here again talking about this.  I am always very nervous about round figures.  The &euro;1 billion cost has been chucked around the place.  It started off being &euro;300 million.  We have not seen any designs.  We do not know what the budget is.  The figure escalated from &euro;300 million to &euro;800 million and the figure being talked about at the moment is &euro;1 billion.  This is not on a difficult site like the children's hospital.</p></speech>

If the work is done, where is the commercial sensitivity?  It is the same with the car park.  If that was a separate budget for those enabling works in the car park, and there is roughly &euro;50 million for the two of those, I cannot see any reason they cannot provide us with the cost of both of those projects if they were separate or even a separate annex to the main contract.  The main contract is not even signed so they had to be stand-alone contracts.  Why would they not be able to give us that?  Why would that be commercially sensitive?</p></speech>

There was a little bit of other work like road realignment, diversion of utilities and treatment for aspergillus, which is a site-specific issue.  Certainly, it is open to the committee to ask why it cannot have details of the costs of individual projects.</p></speech>

It is not that long ago that we had a piece of correspondence that talked about learning lessons from previous projects.  I cannot remember where it came from but it jumped out at me.  Would we have the benefit of learning lessons for this hospital from the children's hospital?  It is not obvious how we learn lessons if the process is opaque, which this appears to be.</p></speech>

I want to link it to the ongoing conversations we have been having regarding the national paediatric hospital.  Up to this point, it appears that no lessons have been learned, even from the debates we had around the signing of the contracts, which many people continue to feel will have long-term repercussions in itself.  Even the fact that works were carried out on the site before the State actually signed those contracts appears dubious.  It reminds me of the time when I was on the council and the majority was voting to privatise the bin services.  It turned out that before a decision had even been made, the private companies had already left the bins everywhere; a decision had been made.  I was struck by something when Mr. McCarthy cited the &euro;50 million cost of a pharmacy.  I imagine that the-----</p></speech>

I imagine it will probably compare fairly favourably with the pharmacy we have in Dublin.</p> <p>  This committee has a role to play and this follows on from Deputy Catherine Murphy's point.  We need to get clarification in the here and now, from both the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, as to what measures and provisions they are putting in pre-contract and pre-tender to ensure we can say, in the same way almost anybody else in the world can, that when a contract is signed, this is how much the project will cost.  It does not need to be kept secret if it is defined in the contract, or if there are provisions that say it will potentially go to this cost if X, Y and Z happen or it could be less if A, B and C happen.  That is the way contracts are supposed to work when we are talking about construction.  We did not have that in respect of the national paediatric hospital.  That is why we are still figuring out three quarters of the way through building it how much it will actually cost.  It has not happened in far too many other areas so it must happen here.  If it does not, and we end up in a situation where the Committee of Public Accounts in ten or 15 years is having the same conversations about this hospital as we are about the national paediatric hospital, one will have to say it is time to bloody take down the whole system and start again.</p></speech>

In light of the saga of the paediatric hospital, however, it is totally valid for us to ask what the clauses are in the tender, how that tender process is working and what we can do in that regard.  When it comes to the numbers that are being bandied around, and I put this to the Minister at the time at the Joint Committee on Health, the proposed building is 55,000 sq. m.  Health buildings at the moment cost approximately &euro;5,000 per sq. m.  Even with massive inflation, we are talking about a base cost of approximately &euro;275 million.  If we add in, let us say, one third for commissioning and one third for fees, we are still nowhere near &euro;800 million, which is what we were talking about at the time of the decision-making.  I do not know where we got to &euro;1 billion, but even &euro;800 million was a huge inflation.  I do not know how we got there.  When I put that to the Minister, I really got no answer to that.  It was said that is what had been reported in the media.  I would really like to understand this.</p> <p>  I know the decision has been made now.  I believe it has all been signed off from a project quality index point of view.  At the time of the decision, however, the business case had not been signed off by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It had been set out but the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform refused it and sent it back.  I would love to understand and it would be really important for the Committee of Public Accounts to understand where the business case is right now.  Has it been signed off by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?  What is that situation?</p> <p>  There is an issue around spending when there has been no agreement.  That is terrible in terms of public money and governance.  I do not think we should ever accept that.  To spend &euro;50 million or &euro;90 million - we are not even taking the number seriously now because it is all just a figure in taxpayers' money - when we do not have an agreement in place is atrocious.</p> <p>  Finally, if we are going back to the Department of Health to ask for information, particularly now that we are talking about Spanish hospitals and stuff, as I did at the time I would like to flag the fact that a scoping exercise for the maternity hospital was done on the Elm Park site in 2012.  There is a fully built hospital that has been empty for ten years sitting on the Elm Park site.  My understanding is that the scoping exercise found it was suitable for a maternity hospital.  The National Maternity Hospital did that scoping exercise and it found that it was suitable for a maternity hospital and for its needs.  I would love to see that report and for the Department of Health to release that report in order that we could see that scoping exercise.  My understanding is that the building is still empty.</p></speech>

A number of issues have been raised, which, in no particular order, are the business case for the maternity hospital and the report published on the hospital that was built at Elm Park that is still completely vacant.  There is also the breakdown of the figures regarding the pharmacy, car park and ancillary works that are being carried out.  The question was also raised as to whether ancillary works were carried out on the car park prior to the final signing of the legal agreement this year.</p></speech>

I will add to that the status of the tender at the moment and the clauses in it.  I thank everybody for that very comprehensive discussion.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is 1350B, from Mr. Brendan Gleeson, Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>It is dated 7 July.  It provides information requested by this committee regarding the digitisation of the Land Commission records, including information concerning turf plots etc.  Those are all contained there.  It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Catherine Murphy flagged this item.  </p></speech>

I thank the Secretary General for the comprehensive reply.  I can see some of the issues involved, including the sheer scale of the information which exists.  This is precisely the issue I was trying to draw attention to.  If we compare our approach in the Republic to that taken in Northern Ireland, it is possible to walk into the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland, PRONI, which is in a lovely new building constructed in the Titanic Quarter, and to look at the Land Commission records there.  They are not digitised, but it is possible to go in and to look at them.</p> <p>  We have a 100-year rule on records but these documents seem to be an exception to this rule.  The Department has said that these are working records and fragile.  This is all the more reason, though, for why they would be digitised.  This is a useful item of correspondence but I still think we should respond in turn and ask why we do not have a similar approach to these records, in the context of the 100-year rule not applying, and why there is a different approach in Northern Ireland to making the Land Commission's records there available.  I ask this question because this information is a treasure trove.  These are working documents for some people but they are also an important genealogical set of records.</p></speech>

We will note and publish the item of correspondence.</p><p>No. 1353 B is from Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, dated 11 July, providing information requested by the committee arising from a meeting with representatives of the Department on 19 May 2022.  Information across a range of areas is included.  Also included is a review of the business case for the Department&rsquo;s funding of Benefacts.  I suggest we deal with this item in conjunction with further correspondence we have received from Benefacts itself, which is R1346 C.  These two items then are No. 1353 B and R1346 C.  I will introduce this correspondence before opening it to the floor.</p><p>At our meeting of 30 June, we agreed to request the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to clarify, among other things, whether it is aware of the extent to which other Departments use Benefacts data.  In its correspondence, Benefacts set out 94 instances of data provision to public, private and non-profit bodies between 2016 and 2021.  Regarding its funding, the organisation has stated that it proposed that it be funded under the Teckal procurement exemption.  The committee has been provided with a copy of the advice regarding the feasibility of instituting these arrangements from the professional firm that prepared it.  Benefacts states that its board received no response to its proposal from the Department, nor was there any other opportunity to discuss alternative institutional, financial and governance arrangements.  It goes on to state that:</p> <blockquote> 	Senior officials in the Department of Rural &amp;amp; Community Development advised Benefacts that they would not consider taking over responsibility for funding the company because they regarded Benefacts as a source of &ldquo;massive procurement risk&rdquo; [...] Notwithstanding this, the Department appears to have asked Pobal to explore the feasibility of providing a service that is on the face of it very similar to one of those already developed, tested and launched by Benefacts [...] even though of course Pobal is a provider to the State of what are by definition public goods under the Teckal exemption </blockquote> <p>It is proposed to note and publish this correspondence and to request the consent of Benefacts to also publish its correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I call Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

There is a difference between a public good and a market good.  Looking at the organisations that have used these data, including the Central Statistics Office, CSO, I would have thought there is a strong argument that this endeavour is a public good.  Therefore, we should seek the response that Benefacts could not get from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  Regarding the last paragraph of the correspondence in question, it relates to the same aspect of a market good.  We should ask the Department of Rural and Community Development how it determined that work of Benefacts was a market good as opposed to a public good.  We should undertake these two actions.</p> <p>  It was useful to get the information from Benefacts concerning the range of possible uses in this regard.  They are comprehensive.  We should also send the Greenville report that Benefacts commissioned to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and ask for its comments on it.</p></speech>

If that is preferable I will ask the secretariat to put together a proposal for consideration.  It is up to members how we proceed with this.  My feeling is that the HSE is very big, as are each of these areas.  Dealing with ambulance services and emergency services on the same day will be a lot.  If we try to broaden it out any further we will get lost and we will not have an opportunity to deal with it properly.  What are the views of the members on this?</p></speech>

I hope we will not need to raise it and that there will be clarity by way of correspondence before then.</p> <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board has been mentioned.  We could include it between the two health engagements.  We had three meetings on justice in a row, with the Department, the Prison Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  I thought that worked very well.  It is the choice of the committee.  We will have meetings on mental health services, the ambulance service and emergency services.

It goes back to the fact that, unfortunately, the committee ran foul of the work it was doing.  It is with regard to the amount of money being paid out by the HSE to the various section 38 and 39 organisations.  New procedures were put in place in this regard.  Since the issue arose a number of years ago have we gone back and looked over these organisations?  Between &euro;4.5 billion and &euro;5 billion is paid out to approximately 2,500 organisations.  Is it worth looking at it again at some stage?  I am not saying immediately but at some stage over the coming six months.</p></speech>

It is difficult because there are 2,500 organisations receiving funding.  In fairness, the Committee of Public Accounts identified an issue previously.  Perhaps it did not come out of the courts on the right side but at the same time this does not mean it is an issue we should park.</p></speech>

It provides an update every year on how it refines its systems.  If the committee wanted additional information on aspects, or perhaps a clearer update on recommendations made by the committee previously, it could request that of the HSE and it would be available when its representatives come before it.</p></speech>

We will continue with the practice of trying to schedule matters well ahead of people coming before us because it allows the secretariat to be able to line up people.  Sometimes witnesses say they are not available or it does not suit them.  Body A might not be able to come in on a certain day but we could move to body B.  It is useful to try to plan a bit of a distance out.  I will speak to the new clerk about that and trying to get those kinds of procedures in place.  We want to ensure we deal with what the committee members want, along with dealing with the reports that might be scheduled throughout the autumn.</p></speech>

I wish to highlight to members that we will have a short private session following the public session.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and their officials to the meeting to discuss the summer economic statement.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the House as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence by witnesses who are physically present or by those who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses giving evidence remotely from a place outside the parliamentary precincts may not benefit from that level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present might.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the parliamentary precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  I invite the Ministers to make their opening statements.  </p></speech>

I will begin by briefly outlining the economic and budgetary backdrop against which the budget is being prepared.</p><p>Budget 2023 is clearly coming at a challenging time for Ireland.  A little over two years ago, a pandemic without precedent upended our economy and society.  I know we all want to move on from the pandemic and to leave it in the rearview mirror, but we cannot forget the toll it has taken on lives, livelihoods and our national finances.  The Government responded, quickly and decisively, to protect households and businesses and to support our healthcare sector.  We employed the full range of the resources we had carefully built up to prevent a deep and disastrous recession.  This approach worked.  At an enormous cost, we protected our economy from long-term damage and set the stage for a robust and broad-based economic recovery, particularly with regard to employment, when the pandemic had been brought under control.  Today, there are more people at work in Ireland than ever before in our history.  In the depths of the pandemic, when unemployment was at record levels, few could have thought that possible.  It is a testament to the success of our budgetary policy that the link between employer and employee was maintained, and that people were able to return to work in such numbers as the recovery took hold.</p><p>However, as we are all well aware, the challenges did not end when the pandemic receded.  The invasion of Ukraine, and the necessary sanctions that have been imposed, have triggered a further global economic shock.  This is most evident in energy and commodity prices.  Along with lingering after-effects from the pandemic, headline inflation in Ireland, like most advanced economies, is now running at highs not seen in many decades.  In June, inflation rose to 9.6%, the highest level in nearly four decades.  People clearly feel the pain, with prices rising in the supermarket, at the petrol pump and elsewhere.  Once again, the Government has acted in response to an external economic shock.  While it is beyond the ability of any Government to fully offset the impact of inflation that is driven by global pressures, we have provided &euro;2.4 billion in direct relief to help ease the burden.  I note that measures have been particularly focused on assisting the most vulnerable.  Analysis of the distributional impact of these measures show that they are progressive, with the gains in disposable income most keenly felt by those in the lower income deciles.  For example, the Economic Insights - Spring 2022<i></i>document published by the Department of Finance in April 2022 shows that all households are expected to see increases in their weekly equivalised disposable income, with those in the lowest three income deciles gaining the most.  Coming on top of the response to Covid, the Government has made available more than &euro;50 billion in fiscal support over the past two and a half years.</p><p>This has taken a further toll on our public finances.  The strength of the economic recovery, supported by Government action, has enabled us to make significant progress in restoring our national finances to a healthier position than a year ago, but much remains to be done.  At over &euro;230 billion, our level of public debt on a <i>per capita</i>basis is among the highest in the developed world.  The economic context is now changing rapidly.  As a result of the jump in inflation, the extraordinary monetary support that has been made available over the last few years is now being withdrawn.  The cost of borrowing is now rising.  The era of low-cost borrowing is, clearly coming to an end.  There are now clear indications that momentum in the global economy is slowing and this is the case in Ireland too.  Furthermore, it is fair to say that the risks to the economy which we recognised in the stability programme update, have now begun to show signs of materialising.  A chief further risk is the potential for a withdrawal of natural gas supplies from Russia to mainland Europe.  While we do not, at present, view this as the most likely development, it clearly constitutes a very real risk nonetheless.  It would result in major economic disruption in export markets with severe second-round effects in Ireland. <br/><br/>In these highly uncertain times, with heightened vulnerabilities, managing the public finances in a careful and responsible way is a matter of urgency.  The committee will recall that the Government set out its medium-term budgetary strategy in last year's economic statement.  In brief, this strategy was aimed at putting our public finances on a sustainable trajectory by limiting core current expenditure growth to the trend growth of the economy.  This, of course, was framed in far more benign inflationary circumstances.In recognition of the changed circumstances, we have temporarily amended the expenditure rule for next year only.  To protect public services and incomes, core current expenditure will now increase by 6.5% in 2023.  For later years, the 5% rule will remain unchanged.  I would point out that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has endorsed this aggregate fiscal approach.  Accordingly therefore, the budget package for next year will be &euro;6.7 billion, comprised of &euro;5.65 billion in additional public expenditure and a tax package of &euro;1.05 billion.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, will provide the committee with more detail on the expenditure package shortly.  On the tax package, I note that this is now double the amount allowed for in the original budgetary strategy set out last year.  This is in recognition of the need to adjust the parameters for budget 2023 in view of the altered economic context.  A focus of the tax package in the budget will be to ensure workers do not move into higher tax bands purely due to inflation.  Inappropriately or poorly designed fiscal policy runs the risk of backfiring.  It can lead to an increase in inflationary pressures, with budgetary policy itself becoming part of the very problem that we are trying to address.  <br/><br/>This leads on to some concluding comments on corporate tax.  Taking into account the positive developments in tax revenue to date, an overall budget package of &euro;6.7 billion is consistent with a very modest budgetary surplus for next year.  There will of course be those who say we should spend this surplus.  What I find remarkable, is that those who call for higher spending, on housing for example, will at the same time object to those same homes being built.  <br/><br/>I want to stress that the headline taxation figures present an overly benign picture.  Much of the recovery in our public finances is due to the continuing surge in corporate tax receipts &ndash; up 53% in the year.  To be clear, we welcome these receipts.  They reflect well on Ireland as an attractive location for highly profitable multinational firms.  As I have warned many times however, these receipts are potentially extremely volatile and cannot be guaranteed at current levels into the future.  More than half of our corporate tax yield is now paid by ten large companies.  This means a very significant portion of our tax take is subject to the businesses decisions of a small number of taxpayers.  The buoyant corporate tax receipts we have experienced over the past several years could be transient, and they do not form a sound basis for building permanent commitments.  We cannot repeat other mistakes when temporary revenues were used to finance permanent spending because we know what happens when those revenues disappear.  I have therefore asked my officials to examine how much of the current corporation tax yield may be &quot;excess&quot;,  above what should be expected from the economic fundamentals, and this will be reported in advance of the budget.  Identifying this excess will enable us to avoid basing expenditure on unreliable revenues while ensuring Ireland remains a top-tier destination for foreign direct investment. <br/><br/>I will conclude on that point.  The Government has no money of its own.  It is public money that is hard-earned by the taxpayers of Ireland.  We have a duty to be responsible with that money, to make what at times can be difficult choices, to do what we can but to be honest with people that we cannot do everything.  The budgetary strategy set out in the summer economic statement meets these objectives.  It helps to strike the appropriate balance between supporting those who need help, such as individuals, families, farmers and business owners, while not adding to inflation. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-14a.1084" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022071400002#B00200"><p>Good morning.  I thank the Chair and members of the committee for the invitation to be here today alongside the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  The summer economic statement is a key milestone in our annual budgetary timetable.  It sets out the Government&rsquo;s fiscal and expenditure strategy for the year ahead and provides an outline of the resources that will be available in the context of budget 2023.  The economy has emerged from the pandemic in a strong position.  The budgetary measures taken by the Government during the pandemic have made an enormous difference to the economy we see today.  Unemployment stands at 4.8% and over 2.5 million people are in employment, more than immediately prior to the pandemic.  Businesses too have displayed remarkable resilience as critical business supports such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, have been unwound.  As the Minister, Deputy Donohoe has highlighted however, the backdrop to next year&rsquo;s budget is an increasingly challenging one.  While the economic recovery from the pandemic has been rapid, as can be seen in the labour market, it has also led to a mismatch between demand and supply dynamics.  This is putting upward pressure on prices of goods and services.  Exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, increased consumer prices mean many households, particularly those on lower incomes, are experiencing difficulties with the rising cost of living.  The Government is acutely conscious of the burden this places on the Irish people. The challenging context has added further complexity to the formulation of our fiscal strategy for 2023.  In finalising the fiscal and budgetary parameters for the budget, we have sought to strike a balance between helping to mitigate cost-of-living pressures and ensuring sustainability of the public finances.  Overall policy must be responsive.  We are aiming to design a budgetary package to protect the most vulnerable in society and those on middle incomes while also ensuring measures do not add to pre-existing inflationary pressures.  In recognition of cost-of-living pressures, budget 2022 set out a &euro;1.2 billion package of expenditure measures to support citizens across a range of sectors.  Some headline measures included increases in weekly social protection payments as well as the fuel allowance and working family payment; health affordability measures; social and affordable housing funding; and enhanced student and childcare supports.  On the taxation side, which the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has referred to, budget 2022 had a substantial almost &euro;600 million income tax package that increased the standard rate band and income tax credits.  In response to the evolving situation during the first half of this year, more than &euro;0.5 billion in additional expenditure measures have been introduced so far this year.  This included the &euro;200 electricity credit, further lump-sum fuel allowance payments and the back-to-school package announced just last week.  In addition, a number of exceptional taxation interventions were made.</p> <p>  While public expenditure responses cannot be deployed at the scale that would be needed to fully compensate for all cost increases, the Government has committed and will continue to provide significant resources to mitigate cost-of-living pressures by assisting those most impacted by energy price inflation and those most vulnerable to price increases.  This commitment has framed our preparations for the summer economic statement.  Last year, the medium-term expenditure strategy set out the dual objective of delivering sustainable expenditure over the medium-term through setting core expenditure growth rate at sustainable levels and providing ongoing improvements in public services.  Our strategy must be responsive to the emerging economic landscape and take account of the exceptional and externally driven nature of the economic shocks we have endured.</p><p>It is clear that in order to protect the real value of public services, a short-term adjustment to the strategy is required.</p><p>   In framing the summer economic statement, SES,  and budget 2023 parameters, we are seeking to balance the need to protect public services without feeding further inflationary pressures.  While Government cannot absorb the full impact of the current inflationary shock, we can and will take concrete action to support households, protect public services and invest in our critical public infrastructure. </p><p>As set out by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, this upward adjustment will result in an increased overall budgetary package of &euro;6.7 billion, of which almost &euro;5.7 billion will be in the form of additional expenditure and just over &euro;1 billion for taxation measures.  This package will see core spending increase by 6% this year and 6.5% next year.  It reflects the availability of an additional &euro;1.7 billion in resources compared with the level set out in the stability programme update last April.</p><p> In terms of expenditure, a total expenditure ceiling of &euro;90.3 billion will be set for next year to accommodate a range of different priorities, through core and non-core expenditure.  In 2023, &euro;85.8 billion of core expenditure will be available to provide for both ongoing costs of current service provision and additional public investment.  Approximately 3% of the core current expenditure base will be available to meet existing levels of service costs in 2023 compared with the current year.  This includes continued investment in the public sector workforce as the delivery mechanism for a wide range of critical services, as set out in Building Momentum; funding for demographic developments, including supporting a growing population and its changing profile; and the full year impact of measures from budget 2022, which are being implemented on a phased basis.</p><p>  There will be a &euro;0.8 billion increase in capital expenditure.  Overall core capital investment will reach some &euro;11.7 billion in 2023, with an additional &euro;0.2 billion as part of the national recovery and resilience plan.  This represents an increase of 7%, which is in line with the National Development Plan 2021-2030.  This funding will provide for key investment across sectors, including housing, healthcare, education and transport while investing in our climate goals.  There is also likely to be a carryover from any unspent element of the capital budget this year.</p><p> A sum of &euro;2.7 billion will be available for new expenditure measures of which approximately &euro;400 million will take effect in the current year.  This overall envelope of funding must accommodate priorities across a wide range of policy areas including: the public service pay bill, which is a significant driver of current expenditure and amounts to close to a third of core current spending each year; spending on social protection, which accounts for around another third of core current spending; and Government commitments regarding housing, climate action and healthcare.  I would also note that separately a number of one-off measures for implementation in 2022 are being developed by my Department in partnership with colleagues across Government.  An announcement on this will be made on budget day.</p><p> While the resources that are being made available are significant and will have a considerable impact, prioritisation will be required given the significant level of competing demands on public expenditure.  As is always the case, resources are limited and we must prioritise.</p><p> In 2023, Government will provide &euro;4.5 billion in non-core expenditure for temporary measures.  This follows on from the &euro;7.5 billion in non-core expenditure provided for in the current year.  This approach to expenditure management has proved critical in recent years to helping Government respond to the numerous external shocks.  The 2023 funding will provide for the continuation of key Covid supports in certain sectors, the provision of supports to help counter the negative impacts of Brexit through the Brexit adjustment reserve fund, and key humanitarian supports for refugees arriving from Ukraine.</p><p> As I noted earlier, the 6.5% increase in core expenditure for next years must accommodate a range of priorities . It also means ensuring that spending delivers sustainable improvements in public services and infrastructure.  This will require decisions to be made across Government and prioritisation of demands.  A range of expenditure reforms have a role to play in supporting this process and ensure spending delivers efficiency, effectiveness and value for money.  These reforms include the spending review process; performance budgeting; and the use of Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, resources across the system to provide important information and critical insights to inform decisions.  In that context, my Department will publish the mid-year expenditure report later this month.  This is an important document that sets out a clear and detailed view of the baseline expenditure position in advance of the upcoming Estimates process.  I hope that it will be of benefit to the committee as well as part of its whole-of-year engagement on budgetary issues.</p><p> To conclude, while we are undoubtedly in a very challenging situation we have seen considerable improvements in the State's overall fiscal position.  This allowed us and will continue to allow us to respond to these challenges in a fiscally sustainable manner thus protecting public services, improving outcomes and investing in our future.  I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to address the committee and I look forward to answering questions. </p></speech>

That meant that we had to put in place extraordinary measures at different points to help us protect our economic and society.  The core spending plans that we announced, particularly in last year's budget, were consistent with the expenditure benchmark that the Government had announced.</p></speech>

On the existing levels of service, ELS, costs, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has been critical of the amounts that have been identified in the stability programme update, SPU, and again in the summer economic statement.  IFAC has said that they are not realistic given the levels of inflation that we are seeing.  So there is a &euro;2.2 billion allocation or a crude 3% of core expenditure, which would have probably satisfied in previous years as inflation was quite linear.  Given what we are seeing now surely that number needs to be revised upwards?</p></speech>

Last year, the actual requirement, when the numbers were finally run, ended up being less than that and was closer to 2.5% so amounted to &euro;1.6 billion.  The Deputy is correct to say that the current inflationary environment will have an impact.  That is why the assessment by my officials, and certainly at this point, is that the 3% we are providing and &euro;2.2 billion will be needed.

As we have said, we are seeking to agree a new public service pay deal and I have been clear in reply to parliamentary questions, announcements, etc. that the cost of a new deal and any additional commitments beyond Building Momentum will have to come out of the overall package of around &euro;2.7 billion.  So that point is accepted.  Obviously one must consider, as the Deputy will do on budget day, what we are going to do about the core budget for 2023, and what we will decide to do in September regarding one-off measures.  To answer the Deputy's question directly, it is certainly our assessment at this time that 3% and &euro;2.2 billion is about right but we will validate all of that in the coming weeks as we go into the details.</p></speech>

I just wanted to get the ministerial assessment and that of the Department as to where we are at this point in time, and that is a wee bit at odds with the stance of IFAC.  Obviously we will know better as we get closer to budget day.</p> <p>  I wish to pick up on the point made about a new public pay deal.  We know that under the existing ELS the existing pay deals and increments that have been agreed will come out of that package.</p><p>The discussions that are under way on a new pay deal will have to come out of the &euro;2.7 billion unallocated resources that the public is now familiar with.  The unions have rejected what has been put on the table until now and that is their right.  Hypothetically if that package and offer were to be agreed what would be the impact in 2022, if any, and, more important, in 2023?  How much of the &euro;2.7 billion would it erode?</p></speech>

We hope to re-engage and there are ongoing contacts with the Workplace Relations Commission.  It will advise us of its opinion as to whether there is a basis to re-engage formally.  This is certainly our objective.  Securing an agreement would help to bring industrial peace and give certainty about approximately one third of our current expenditure pay bill.  It is the case that whatever is agreed, and I hope an agreement can be reached, will come out of the overall envelope of approximately &euro;2.7 billion.  As I have said in recent weeks, we have identified approximately &euro;400 million for early implementation measures in the current year.  This could be a combination of changes in public service pay in the current year and any decision the Government might make to implement immediately changes on the core permanent side of expenditure, such as happened with the fuel allowance last year.  The envelope is the envelope and I want to be clear on that.  The cost of any public service pay bill and all of the other Government priorities in the budget will have to be met from within that overall amount.</p></speech>

We know it is likely that a pay deal will be struck.  Will the Minister give us an indication of how much of the pie will be taken up by the pay deal?  Is it not the case that the rejected pay deal on offer had a total value of &euro;1.1 billion?  Was this not the overall package on offer?  The 2023 figure was less than that because some of the increments were later in the year.  Do the officials have the figure of how much the 2.5% increase would have amounted to?  It would allow the committee to say that if a pay deal is in excess of this it would cost more than the figure that was on offer.</p></speech>

The unions have spoken publicly about figures.  I have responded to this in broad terms but not in specific terms on the overall cost.  The Deputy can work out the maths.  In broad terms a 1% increase in public service pay is approximately &euro;250 million.  If we add in the knock-on costs for pension entitlements it is an additional &euro;20 million to &euro;30 million.  Of course this is based on a full year impact of 1%.  As always, when it comes to negotiating a pay deal there is a certain phasing in.  Various increases kick in at various times of the year.  It all depends on the formula and where it lands in the end.  The Deputy can work out what is the fiscal impact of a deal.</p></speech>

We may well see a carryover from the housing budget into next year as we did from 2021 to 2022.  That was because of Covid and the shutdown of the industry for a number of months in 2020 and 2021.  There is a knock-on effect, which has significantly enhanced the budget in the current year.  It may be able to spend it all.  It is behind profile at present.  It is heavily back-ended because of the way the payment mechanisms work with local authorities throughout the country.  I expect there may well be a carryover into next year.  Certainly we do not hear concerns from the Department of Housing, Heritage and Local Government about its ability from a funding perspective to deliver on the commitments in Housing For All in terms of outputs and the number of units.</p></speech>

That is almost 22% below profile, reflecting the fewer than anticipated claims received due to various issues that impact on delivery and getting schemes off the ground.  We are only halfway through the year and the Department may well catch up.  That remains to be seen.  There is a situation where the profiles are back-ended significantly towards later in the year.  It may well be the case that there will be a carryover into next year.  My expectation is that there will be a carryover, but we will remain in close contact with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which expects that it will have sufficient funding from the central Exchequer to deliver the NDP.</p></speech>

We started with an unallocated contingency of just under &euro;4 billion.  There has been a significant drawdown and allocation of that in recent months.  We had a difficult start to the year with Covid and the Omicron variant and now there is a resurgence of Covid.  Much depends on the direction that will take in the months ahead in terms of healthcare and the implementation of further rounds of vaccination and so on.  There will be definitely be significant additional demand in health for Covid-related spend in the current year.</p> <p>  We also incurred a lot of additional expenditure earlier in the year with social protection because of the extension of different measures there, and we had to fund a range of cost-of-living measures, of which at least &euro;500 million would have been on the direct expenditure side.</p> <p>  On the cost of looking after the Ukrainian refugees, we are in ongoing contact, as one would expect, with the line Departments that carry these costs, especially the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Department of Social Protection.  We have an estimate, which is a range, that the costs could be between &euro;900 million and &euro;1.2 billion this year.  We expect the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration will give an updated forecast shortly to us and the Government on the anticipated accommodation costs that will need to be met across this year.  Of course, it depends on the continuing flow of people.  We all recognise the acute pressures it places on the accommodation system at this time.  We also had a Supplementary Estimate on the acquisition by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and his Department of temporary electricity generation capacity, which must be funded.</p> <p>  At this point, our assessment is that in excess of &euro;500 million of that &euro;3.9 billion may well be unallocated or uncommitted.  That could change as the year goes on, particularly in the context of Covid.</p></speech>

I have a number of other questions.  I have raised for many years that there is no legal impediment to the earlier publication of the White Paper that comes out at midnight on the Friday before the budget.  The argument has always been that it is crucial to feed the September fiscal monitor into the White Paper.  That September fiscal monitor will not be available this year given that the budget will be brought forward by 14 days.  Therefore, will the Department commit to publishing the White Paper early, in September at the latest?</p></speech>

When we published them and fulfilled our legal requirement - as opposed to legal impediment - we said that their level of accuracy was in some way short of what it normally would be.  In fact, as part of the medium-term budgetary strategy, which the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, and I published last year, it had to include the expenditure ceiling.  It was done but when they were published, we acknowledged that their accuracy would be very different from normal years.</p></speech>

There were brought to Government, laid before the House and published in each of the past two years.  There is a legal requirement but it is not a legal requirement that it is done on budget day.  It was done at the end of the year in each the past two years.  As the Minister, Deputy Donohoe said, we were faced with exceptional circumstances and it was difficult to forecast with any degree of accuracy.  We did fulfil the legal commitment.</p></speech>

There were not.  I take the Minister's point now and I took it at the time in 2020, but will they be published this year in the mid-year expenditure report?</p> <p>  This is the last sitting day of the D&aacute;il, after which the House will go into recess for more than eight weeks and the budget will not be published for a number of weeks after that.  The inflation rate will be published today.  I predict it will be close to 10%, the highest in 40 years.  Does the Minister have any regrets about not introducing an emergency budget instead of leaving many thousands of families high and dry over the summer months, when the D&aacute;il will be in recess?</p></speech>

Of course, I am absolutely aware of the costs and difficulties many people are facing throughout the summer period.  However, the Deputy is aware of all the measures we brought in as the year has progressed and the additional measures brought in by the Ministers, Deputy Humphreys and Foley, to help with the cost of going back to school.  That is a large amount of help, but we know that many people need more and we will do our best to provide more when we come back and do our budget in September.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-14a.1165" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022071400002#E03200"><p>I thank the Ministers for their contributions.  One of the issues that I am particularly exercised about is eligibility for social housing and social housing support.  We have been repeatedly given commitments on publishing the outcome of a review that has been running for at least five years, which it was reported was concluded in December 2021.  It still has not been published or announced despite repeated promises that it would be before the summer recess.  There is absolutely no justification for the fact that the review has gone on for that long.</p><p>There is certainly no justification for the fact that the Minister has sat on it from December.  The ESRI quantified the number of people in need of housing support who were cut off their entitlement to social housing or social housing support in the form of HAP, RAS or whatever.  That was pretty stark.  We knew it anecdotally from the people coming in week after week saying they were on the housing list for ten years, that they cannot afford market rent and now they are off the list.  The ESRI said in its recent report that the number of people eligible for social housing support has dropped from 46% about a decade ago to 33%.  This is a massive stealth cut in housing support, affecting tens of thousands of working people who previously would have received some support to deal with extortionate rents or who might have gotten a social house at some point, who now do not get it and go over a cliff once their income goes over &euro;35,000 net or perhaps a bit more depending on the family size.  They are now left completely in the wilderness and have to pay rents that are completely unaffordable.</p><p> My question for the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, is whether he has discussed this with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, because I suspect that the reason this review has not been published is that the Government is terrified of the costs that could ensue if the income eligibility threshold is increased by whatever amount.  If it was restored in real terms to the level it was at ten years ago, which to my mind is the absolute minimum that should be done, given that the number of people in need of the support has grown exponentially with high rents, I imagine the bill for that would be pretty high.  I cannot conceive of the idea that the Minister has not discussed this and that it is not at the back of the delay in publishing the outcome of the review.  Has the Minister discussed it?  Is he aware of the cost?  Is that the reason we have not seen the outcome of the review?  What is going to happen to it?  If that is not the case, when will we hear about what is going to happen with the income threshold, which is a very pressing matter now for huge numbers of people?  I would like to hear the answer to that question first.</p></speech>

I cannot give the Deputy a specific date as I do not know when the Minister intends to bring forward a proposal on that, but a proposal has not been made to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett's question about whether the fiscal implications are the reason there has not been an outcome to date, I do not believe that is the reason.  Of course, we always have to assess the expenditure implications of any decision, but that has not been the main issue in the discussions to which I have been a party in the committee.  We are awaiting the outcome of that review and it is a matter for the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to bring that forward.  In the meantime, as the Deputy is aware, we are expending very substantial Exchequer resources through the HAP, RAS, rent supplement and social leasing.  All of those supports are being provided.  I cannot give Deputy Boyd Barrett a specific date as I do not have it, but I am satisfied that his inference, that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been blocking bringing forward the outcome of the review, is not the case.</p></speech>

Has the Minister quantified the cost, because it would have budgetary implications?  I believe the thresholds should be raised substantially.  That group of people whose income is in excess of &euro;35,000 or perhaps up to &euro;40,000 is still eligible depending on family size, but they are pushed over a cliff.  Some of those people are in homeless accommodation as we speak and are now not even entitled to that.  They are being threatened with eviction from homeless accommodation because they have gone over a threshold, having been on a housing list for ten years.  To be honest, you could not make this stuff up in terms of what is going on.  This is life and death stuff for some of them due to the situation they are in.  On that level of income, they have no chance of paying the rents in Dublin and they have no chance of purchasing.  The Government says the affordable housing schemes are coming and all the rest of it, but we are quite a few years away from them having any impact - even if they work - and there are question marks in that regard for that cohort.  I refer to people earning above &euro;35,000, and even up to &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000.  This is urgent.</p> <p>  In his discussions, has the Minister even quantified what it might cost?  For example, if we push the threshold up to &euro;40,000, it will cost this much.  If we push it up to &euro;45,000, it will cost this much.  If we push it up to &euro;50,000, it will cost this much.  If the Minister has not quantified it - I take his word that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is not blocking this - and if that is what he tells me, I believe it, but is it even part of the Minister's budgetary considerations?  If it is not, that tells me we are not going to have the thresholds moved before the budget, which is a very serious breach of promise, because we were told by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage - and I have been told by the Taoiseach on a number of occasions - that the outcome of that review was going to be made public before the summer recess.  That promise has already been broken.  The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, is saying it is not him blocking it, but he is not quite sure when all this is happening.  He has just told me he does not have figures on that.  If we do not know how it is going to impact on the budget then that tells me we are not going to hear about this any time soon.</p></speech>

I have not seen a report from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the issue, so I have not seen a quantification of what the cost would be of increasing the eligibility threshold by different amounts.</p> <p>  I have acknowledged that in making any decision on policy, there is a need to consider what the implications are from an expenditure point of view, but that has not been the reason the outcome of the review has not been brought forward.  I assume the work is not completed.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is best placed to give the Deputy a direct answer to that.  We should also acknowledge that an equally important issue is the lack of accommodation opportunities.  Even people who currently meet the existing qualification criteria for HAP and rental support cannot get the properties in some instances.  Extending the bands is not going to resolve that issue.  We have to increase supply and make sure there are more rental accommodation opportunities available for people.  I will ask the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to come back to Deputy Boyd Barrett directly because I do not have a date as to when the outcome of the review will be brought forward.  We are ready to engage on it in my Department.</p></speech>

Is that fair to say?  It does not figure in how we are going to spend that &euro;2.7 billion, quite a bit of which will go on whatever public sector pay deal is reached.

This is not made up of individual decisions across various Departments.  That process is only now getting under way.  That is the Estimates process.  This is the framework.  What we are saying is that the total of all of the collective decisions that we will make in the coming weeks has to be consistent with this framework.  Today is about the framework.  It is not about the priorities in housing or the relative priorities of housing, health, and welfare.  That is what we will be discussing in the weeks ahead.</p></speech>

To be honest, I cannot believe that we are not at least beginning to estimate that cost.  If the Minister is not doing it, I strongly suggest that he does because he should know it if there is going to be any move or announcement on those thresholds.</p><p>I repeat, that announcement has been promised.  </p></speech>

That process is now getting under way.  Every Minister and Department will set out their priorities and I will go through all of them.  To be fair to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, in the last two budgets he has significantly increased the number of HAP places, and he has secured a lot of additional funding on both the current and the capital expenditure sides.  I know it is a priority area for him.  It will be discussed in the coming weeks as part of the Estimates process.  I will discuss the issue with him.</p></speech>

Despite the debates we may have about whether Housing for All is fit for purpose and can actually deliver, does the Minister accept that since Housing for All was published, the situation has deteriorated and that he may need to reconsider the envelope, as it were, of planned expenditure on housing to meet the crisis that we are now facing?  I am not just referring to the fact that there are refugees coming into the country.  According to every sort of measure, the situation has got worse.  House prices have reached astronomical proportions.  At the epicentre of the housing crisis, the rent situation is going from bad to worse on a weekly basis.  On top of that, there is inflation, which is in effect an income cut for the very same people who have to pay those rents or consider taking out a mortgage with less income for higher cost accommodation.  Is any consideration being given to the idea that that envelope of spending and investment in the area of housing is just going to have to increase?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-14a.1176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022071400002#G00400"><p>To be honest, I think the priority is delivery.  In the past two years, the construction industry was shut down for several months each year because of Covid.  That had an impact on delivery.  We ended up delivering about 20,000 units each year in 2020 and 2021.  We know that we need far more than that.  It is estimated that we need to deliver at least 33,000 units each year.  I think the forecast for this year is around 24,600 units.  Hopefully, that will be achieved and even exceeded.  The funding is in place.  It is really about delivery.  Looking at Housing for All and the targets it sets across cost rental, local authority affordable housing, the First Home affordable purchase and shared equity scheme and the work that the Land Development Agency, LDA, is doing in Project Tosaigh, if we can achieve those targets, we will make a real difference.  The funding is there to back that up.  From where I am sitting, I do not currently see funding as the constraint.  There were underspends in each of the past two years.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has underspent so far this year on capital.  It remains to be seen how the second half of the year pans out.  The funding is certainly there to deliver the units.  That is the priority.  We are seeing progress, as the Deputy well knows, in terms of commencements and new planning permissions being granted.  The pipeline appears to be strong.  However, I acknowledge that there are headwinds in the sector too.  Construction inflation is running at a very high rate.  The cost of certain materials went up by 40% and 60% in the last year, which is having a direct impact on delivery. There are also labour shortages in the sector.  There are headwinds and challenges in delivering the targets.  However, on the social housing side, the direct build forecast for the current year is over 8,000, as against a target of 9,000 direct build units.  Despite the challenges, a lot of progress has been made in delivering social housing.  We are seeing that all over the country.  The performance does vary from local authority to local authority.  Approved housing bodies, AHBs, are playing an increasingly important role, but the funding is there.  We need all the partners involved to deliver and to build the homes that we need.</p></speech>

To my mind, it is the most pressing issue and the one that the Government has indicated is its top priority.  If the housing delivery plan for my local authority - which has been signed off by the Department - is anything to go by, after applying a little bit of pressure in trying to extract the figures I know that the local authority's plan for the duration of Housing for All will mean that there will be more people on the housing list at the end of the five-year period than there are now, given the additional numbers that the local authority estimates will join it.  Currently, there is a 20-year waiting list.  If that is as far we are going to go, we will still be in trouble on this issue in five years' time.  Added to that, the Minister has rightly identified the issue of rising costs in the construction sector, which has already scuppered one co-operative project in my area that was due to start.  The co-op developer said it could not deliver the project at the cost previously estimated.</p></speech>

It includes the LDA pipeline.  In fact, the first LDA delivery is due to take place in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  It is rather telling that four years after the LDA came into existence, it has not delivered one house on that site.  That is due to be the first LDA-delivered site and it is not going to be delivered until 2024.  It is pretty shocking stuff.  I can tell the Minister that there is nobody blocking the development.  We are actively campaigning to get the sods on the ground turned, but nothing is happening.</p></speech>

As he is aware, in People Before Profit we are very prudential in our budgeting so that when we argue for substantially increasing expenditure beyond what the Minister is proposing, as we do, we always propose revenue-raising measures such as wealth taxes, increases in employer PRSI rates and increases in corporate tax and financial transaction taxes.  The Government always pooh-poohs our figures as to what we could raise through the introduction of such measures.  Recently, Oxfam estimated that a 2% wealth tax on those with over &euro;4 million in assets would raise &euro;4 billion.  I am sure the Minister will say that is just not true.  I personally think it is.  Even if a quarter of that estimated amount could be raised by a wealth tax on the wealthiest people in this country, it would be a lot of money.  Given the huge challenges and demands we face, is any consideration being given to the introduction of some additional revenue-raising measures in the form of taxes on those who have not done too badly or have done very well over the last period, including the very wealthy and some areas of big business?  For example, we could introduce a windfall tax on the energy companies or the big investment funds in housing and property that have done very well over the last period.  Is any consideration being given to the idea that such companies and funds should be asked to cough up a bit of extra tax from the gains that they have made while other people have been suffering, to help fund the big challenges we have and to shield others who are being hammered by the cost-of-living crisis?</p> <p>  I am out of time, so I will throw in one last question.  On the issue of public sector pay, our view is that pay, pensions and income should at least keep pace with inflation.  Otherwise, we are reducing the spending power of people, which means human suffering for them, and it also potentially has a negative knock-on effect for the rest of the economy.  People have less purchasing power, which then hits the economy.  We think it is an economic, social and moral imperative to ensure that public sector pay, pensions and income at least keep pace with the rate of inflation so that people are not losing real income or purchasing power.  What does the Minister say to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-14a.1186" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022071400002#G01600"><p>I will deal with the question on revenue-raising measures first.  Every budget that we introduce brings in additional measures that raise revenue.</p><p>I would expect budget 2023 would be no different.  There are always measures that allow the Government to raise additional revenue to fund changes in expenditure or taxation elsewhere.  </p><p> We have to get the balance right.  I have always recognised that the Deputy's figures have a coherence to them.  He came out and said how much more he wants to spend and put in place measures that, in an abstract way, would allow him to fund that additional expenditure.  Where he and I have differed for many years is that he sees the world as being static and assumes that if we increase taxes on workers and companies investing in our country that there will be no consequence.  I strongly believe there will be a consequence.  Putting in place measures that increase the level of taxation that large employers pay would, over time, lead to those large employers employing fewer people in Ireland.</p><p> I refer to windfall charges and taxes.  We should bear in mind that some of the companies involved are owned by the State.  Any change in how much money we want to recoup from those companies at a point in the future can be achieved by revision and dividend policy.  I guarantee the Deputy that even if the State makes such a change, that will have an impact.  It will, for example, impact on the investment plans that we need many semi-State companies to deliver in order for Ireland to have a higher share of energy through the renewable sources that we have the ability to generate in our jurisdiction.  </p><p> We only have to consider the reaction in the UK to its proposal to bring forward a large windfall tax, even with investment reduction.  Many larger companies are now saying that could affect their investment plans.  We need to bear in mind that we have seven auctions for our offshore wind energy.  Does the Deputy think those auctions will be unaffected if, while they are under way, we decided we would arbitrarily increase the taxes companies would pay for supplying our country with energy?  That is the difference.</p><p> As always, we will consider other measures to determine whether they will raise revenue.  While I will respect the budget secrecy process, and will not say anything today that would be inappropriate given that the budget is so far away, it is fair to say that many of the measures the Deputy wants me to introduce will not be announced on budget day.</p></speech>

I have always made the point that in agreeing a pay deal with the public sector there will also be a need to take account of what the Government has done to date on other cost of living measures and what it plans to do in the budget.  All of the advice we have received from reputable bodies, domestically and internationally, has been not to chase inflation.  Pay alone should not chase inflation.  If we did that, we would drive it higher and it would become more embedded with second and third round effects.  We need to manage it carefully.</p> <p>  We will need a deal that is fair for public sector workers and acknowledges that their living standards have been impacted and there will need to be pay improvement beyond the existing terms of building momentum.  However, a balance has to be struck between that and ensuring that the deal is affordable overall and we do not end up chasing inflation and driving it higher, which would cause all sorts of problems for the economy.</p></speech>

I had an opportunity to listen to part of the contributions and read them.</p> <p>  I would like to ask the Ministers about two areas.  The first relates to people who do not qualify for social welfare because they are just over the threshold, such as working people in receipt of ordinary incomes.  I understand the Ministers recognise that cohort as being the middle four deciles.  They are under increasing pressure every day in terms of household finances.  What kind of measures, or range of measures, have the Ministers considered to support this group of people?  They are under increasing pressure.  Reference has been made to childcare.  </p> <p>  I refer in particular to social welfare.  Has consideration been given to the qualifying thresholds for those in employment, such as the working family payment, lone parent allowance, income disregards for means tested pensions and so on to determine whether those areas can support people who are in employment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-14a.1190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022071400002#H00400"><p>I am happy to take those questions.  I thank the Deputy.  In the measures we have introduced in recent months, we have tried to strike a balance between ensuring that most of the measures are targeted and generally involve using the social welfare system, such as the fuel allowance scheme, back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance and so on.  We have also had measures with a broader application that benefit people who are above the social welfare qualifying threshold.  The electricity credit is an obvious example, as well as the abolition last week of school transport fees, a reduction in public transport fares for younger people and the population generally and changes to the drug payment threshold scheme.</p> <p>  In framing a set of one-off measures, we will have to strike a balance.  Our principle is that many of the measures will need to be targeted because this is, in the main, but not exclusively, an energy price crisis.  We are seeing broader inflation in food and across a range of other materials and goods that people purchase.  We recognise that people who are earning above the upper limits are also struggling and feeling the pressure.  There will need to be measures that go beyond the eligibility cohort, as defined by the social protection code.</p> <p>  The other issue raised by the Deputy comes down to the interaction between the social welfare system and work.  We often hear examples of people who can only take on so many hours because they will lose certain benefits or feel it is not worth their while to work.  The principle that we as a Government subscribe to is that it should always pay to work.  If people have the opportunity to take on more hours, that should also pay.  We are examining the interaction between the welfare system and work, in particular, to determine whether there are any issues we can address which would allow people to participate to a greater extent in the labour market, be that taking up employment or doing more work if they are currently in employment.  We are considering options in that regard in the context of the budget.</p></speech>

That is why there is complete agreement in government regarding the role of indexation in our personal code.</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy McGrath, and I recognise that people who receive a wage increase from their employer to help with the cost of living receive it because of how hard they have worked and the ability of employers to pay an increase in recognition of their efforts.  We believe, therefore, it is appropriate that we try to avoid someone paying a higher level of tax on a wage increase he or she has earned.  This is why, since day one, we have focused the programme for Government on the role of indexation in our tax code at a time at which wages are growing to try to deal with the consequences of inflation.  </p> <p>  If wages grow at a sustainable rate, which is why the work the Minister, Deputy McGrath, is leading on public sector wage negotiations is so important, we want to do our best to help workers keep their fair share of the wages they earn.  That will form an important part of the package we announced on budget day.  It is why the Government agreed to a change in the resources available for the taxation element of the budget.</p></speech>

We are at the early stages of the Estimates process.  It is helpful for me as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to have the framework in place.  That puts a certain shape on the discussions that are taking place now and through September.  The Government will have to identify core priorities and we know what they are in the context of this budget.  It is about the cost of living.  It is about helping people manage through this difficult and challenging inflationary spiral.  We have acknowledged that it is not just impacting on people on social welfare, though it is most acutely impacting them because they have fixed incomes and, by definition, are on quite low levels of income.  People who are above those thresholds are feeling the pressure too.  Many of them have significant day-to-day costs, including childcare, transport to and from work, mortgages, rents and so on.  These measures need to have a broader application.</p> <p>  As to the core budget for next year and changes to the social welfare system, we are at the early stages of working through all the different options in that regard.  We have clearly acknowledged that there will be a need for a social welfare package and, as the Minister for Finance has said, a taxation package as well.  It will all be focused on trying to help people at what is a tough time.  We recognise that as a Government.  We have done a lot to date.  It is perhaps not as much as others would like but we have made significant interventions.  As the public finances are in a reasonably healthy position, we have resources for the autumn that we think will make a real difference.  The work being done between now and then is about getting that balance right between one-off measures in the core budget for next year, measures that target those most in need and measures that have a broader application.  There is a lot of work going into that and it is well under way at this point. </p></speech>

For the first time, the summer economic statement referred to the well-being framework and a swathe of other aspects that measure quality of life and what is important to us, such as education, physical and mental health, biodiversity and a range of different aspects.  While the framework is not fully in place, having it as part of the summer economic statement was a huge benchmark.  That says to people that there are other yardsticks for prioritising funding.  How do the Ministers see the framework influencing this budget and others beyond that?</p></speech>

He will elaborate on the framework in a moment.  I welcome the Deputy's recognition in this regard.  It also formed part of the national economic dialogue, where we tried to broaden the evaluation of how we are doing beyond the very traditional economic measures of GDP and inflation, although that matters from a standard of living point of view, and the level of employment within our economy.  This is vitally important to how we make progress in our society.  I anticipate that when we do budget 2023, we will try to give a perspective of how that budget stacks up against those kinds of indicators.  As I said, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and his officials have done a lot of work on what that will look like, as has the Department of Finance.</p></speech>

We all got a renewed sense of appreciation for the environment, local amenities, walkways, greenways, biodiversity and all the issues the Deputy touched on.  The adoption of the well-being framework now is particularly timely.  It includes 11 overall dimensions from which the well-being dashboard of 35 indicators flows.  Those are wide-ranging, as the Deputy has acknowledged.  We have examined the experience of other countries, including New Zealand, which is seen as a world leader in this regard.  We have also looked at the work of the OECD and my Department has established a well-being public policy unit.  It is a work in progress and we are going to continue to develop it.  There are future phases for the development of the well-being framework.  Well-being issues very often come down to the fundamental things people need in their lives, which is a roof over their head, accommodation, access to healthcare when they need it and a basic level of income to give them a decent quality of life.  Particularly at a time of high inflation, that is where our focus lies.</p> <p>  While we have a well-being framework, it is not something we look at as separate to the budget.  We do not consider all the other issues and then look at the well-being framework and see how that influences us.  It has to be a thread running through all our considerations in the budgetary process.  We have to think about what things contribute to well-being that really matter to people in their day-to-day lives.  In the Deputy's question and in our responses we have acknowledged what we believe those things are, namely, the basic supports and services people rely on.  It is a very welcome departure in Irish politics and in our budgetary process to include well-being and equality budgeting.  In recent years, we have increasingly published more and more material on equality budgeting and we will continue with that in the context of the budget, as well as later in the year as part of the Revised Estimates when more and more Departments and budget-holders will bring forward metrics and evidence on how they are accounting for equality budgeting.  It is a very welcome change.  It takes the focus away from the hard numbers in isolation.  It is about what they mean for people in their day-to-day lives.  That is what really matters.  We are elected public representatives and we know from talking to people every day in our constituencies what the issues that really matter to them are.  We have to make sure those are our priorities in the budget. </p></speech>

There are a few items I wanted to get their thoughts on.  I listened to their earlier contributions.  Are there any circumstances where they would be required to change the parameters before the budget because of what might happen with external factors or other factors?  They have said there will be no changes.  I refer to the Brexit adjustment reserve fund.  Many of the factors impacting us are external, such as the impact of Ukraine on oil prices and so forth.  Are there any further supports coming from Europe?  Is this something being looked at at a European level?  I ask the Ministers to comment on our level of national debt.  We are now into a period where the ECB's involvement in the bond market is dissipating.  What impact is that having for us in terms of interest rates, our national debt and refinancing the national debt?  Where do we stand on that?</p> <p>  I have two further questions specifically for the Minister for Finance.  I note he is doing a review of corporation tax.  When does he expect that to be ready?  It is a feature that comes up a lot in the media.</p><p>Our corporation tax revenues are buoyant but in many cases they are coming from a small group of companies giving an exponentially high level of corporation tax.  That is to be welcomed, but how will that frame the policy on taxes and spending?</p><p> I have a specific question on the Living City initiative which I will hold to the end because it is a stand-alone question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-14a.1201" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022071400002#K00200"><p>I will kick off because the Deputy opened with questions that are relevant to me.</p> <p>  I do not foresee any changes in our budget day parameters between now and budget 2023 being announced.  At &euro;6.7 billion, it will be the largest budget in core spending that any Government has introduced in Ireland for quite some time.  However, as the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, has said on a number of occasions, it will be accompanied by once-off measures within 2022.  That means the overall budget day package will have additional measures for 2022 on top of a very significant increase in our budget day package for 2023.</p> <p>  I have already acknowledged the growth in our national debt.  Deputy O'Donnell is well aware of it so I will not repeat what I have said on that.  If I look at the measure that matters very much to us, which is what that stock of debt looks like as a share of the value in income of the goods and services in our country, an important picture is developing.  First, when and if the Government holds inside the budget day parameters that we have indicated for this year and the years to come, it means our stock of public debt will begin to fall after the very sudden increase during the era of Covid-19.  According to the summer economic statement, we currently stand at a stock of debt for 2022 of &euro;233.8 billion.  As we stay inside our budget day parameters it will begin to fall as an amount of debt, which is a significant change from where we have been over the last two years, moving by 2025 to &euro;227 billion.  While that fall in the quantity of debt in itself is helpful but in real terms is not huge, it means, importantly, that our debt as a share of national income when measured as GNI begins to fall.  That is the key thing for us given how high our debt is in the first place.  Notably, it means that our share of debt falls from 96.5% at present to below 90% next year and to below 80% by 2025.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-14a.1203" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022071400002#K00400"><p>The percentage reduction is faster.  All other things being equal, on our current forecasts we are still expecting our national income to grow.  That is particularly important.  At the start of the year the interest we were paying on our national debt for new borrowing was approximately zero and today it is 1.7%.  I will note, before others make the point to me, that the 1.7% is a reduction on where we have been in the last few weeks, when it was well above 2%, but there is a hell of a difference between zero and 1.7%.  Our expectation is that we will continue to see change in the sovereign bond markets as the ECB changes monetary policy in response to what is happening to inflation.</p> <p>  Finally, the Deputy asked a specific question about corporation tax.  We will have that work complete before the budget.  There are many different forecasts regarding how much our national debt and how much our corporate tax receipts could be affected by changes in the business cycle or OECD corporate tax reform.  It is not always helpful for me to base our preparation on what could be the biggest figure.  What we have to do is try to have a figure that we believe is a reasonable assessment regarding what the vulnerability could be, as opposed to the largest figure out there.  That is work I asked the Department to do and we will have that work done by the budget because, in turn, it could influence other choices we make.</p></speech>

The principal one I have responsibility for is the national recovery and resilience plan, which is close to &euro;1 billion.  In that context, a range of investment projects is being implemented across Government.  We are making provision, as can be seen in the summer economic statement, for a further &euro;200 million of that to be spent across next year.</p> <p>  Under the Brexit adjustment reserve we will receive a total of &euro;1.165 billion in current prices.  We have already received the first tranche of that.  It has to be spent by the end of next year.  The reference period goes back to the beginning of 2020 so eligible spending must occur between 2020 and 2023, inclusive.  We have made certain allocations so far to a number of Departments.  We have given approval to a range of schemes in agriculture and fisheries brought forward by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue.  We have a major infrastructure project at Rosslare Europort that is currently under procurement and there are a number of other proposals from Departments that are currently being considered.</p> <p>  This funding comes in the form of pre-financing.  We submit the formal claim in 2024, after the reference period, but we get the money upfront.  Clearly, we have to ensure that it is spent in a way that fully conforms with EU spending rules and there is a strict requirement that it must be linked to the adverse effects of Brexit.  Ensuring that the spend is eligible is a critical test and it is one on which we must be sure.  It is not as simple as coming up with new spending ideas or things it would be nice to do.  The link with the adverse effects of Brexit has to be explicit, clear and demonstrable, but we are making good progress on it.</p></speech>

The public works contract is being bedded down at present.  It is a big factor in terms of public contracts, and I have discussed this previously.  Is the Minister satisfied that it will work?  Will it be subject to review?  Can he give a general overview on that and the current position from his perspective?</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy in particular, as Chairman, for that because I believe it helped to articulate the challenges that have been growing in recent months for the delivery of different public works contracts.</p> <p>  We have been assessing this for a while.  We made an initial change in January and we made a further change in recent weeks in terms of the inflation co-operation framework, which has been broadly welcomed.  There is a period of familiarisation required now in order that contracting authorities and contractors can understand the full detail of it.  The Office of Government Procurement has done a great deal of work to provide guidance and supporting documentation and to assist all the partners in the delivery of the NDP to have a clear understanding of how this burden-sharing process is going to work.  A small number of agreements have been entered into to date, and more are expected imminently.  The initial feedback has been encouraging.  That is the update I have received from my Department and from colleagues across Government.  The fact that we included energy as well as construction materials and that it is backdated to the beginning of this year was very helpful.  We are seeing a greater level of interest now in new tenders, which is positive, and we are successfully placing contracts.  However, it is a very uncertain time for major contractors.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister.</p> <p>  My next question is for the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  I refer back to the end of last year.  The Living City initiative is available in Limerick city, which is a Georgian city.  Unlike probably any other city in Ireland, the footprint in the city is primarily Georgian.  The Living City initiative was introduced a number of years ago.  There has been some success, but not what one would expect.</p><p>In terms of the latest figures from the Department, about 37 properties have availed of the scheme.  I asked last year for a review of the scheme and the Minister kindly took it on board.  I understand that the Tax Strategy Group is looking at it and will bring forward a report to the Minister.  Really bringing the city up - and the city is doing very well with great employment and a lot of positivity - is very difficult when it comes to the footprint of the city, which is Georgian.  I ask that when the Minister comes to his budget deliberations, he would consider the review and look at certain areas such as owner-occupier residential properties, particularly around making the initiative consistent with the other schemes for commercial property and landlords in terms of the period for which they can claim and being able to carry forward the relief.  It is scheduled to conclude at the end of this year.  If the Minister is looking at it, I ask that we would get some bit of headwind that the Minister might extend it for a number of years rather than just one year.  I wanted to raise the matter with the Minister in advance of his budget deliberations.  It is something in which I am particularly interested.  Could the Minister give me his thoughts on the initiative?  For those of us in Limerick city, it could be a phenomenal catalyst if it is looked at and amended and if we can encourage more people to participate in it.  I want to see families coming to live in the city and people being able to move to the city.  The city is very vibrant but the cost of doing up Georgian buildings is far more expensive that the cost of doing up a standard house.  The announcement of  Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe, what is the Irish pronunciation-----</p></speech>

I was looking through it.  It should make an enormous difference but it does not apply to cities and city suburbs.  Limerick city is Georgian.  We have a scheme but with only 37 properties participating since 2013, I ask that the Minister give it serious consideration.  He initiated a review last year, which I very much welcome.

A proper review of the scheme has been done and I will be getting a copy of the report very shortly.  The Deputy raised some very reasonable points regarding how what is a very targeted scheme could work better and they will be given proper consideration in the time ahead.  The Deputy raised these points in the context of last year's Finance Act.  At that point, I said we would give it a thorough run-through in the Tax Strategy Group process, which is nearly complete.

I just discovered that data out today tells us that prices have risen by 9.1% up to June 2022.  That is the highest in 38 years, which is quite shocking.  What inflation rate and ECB interest were assumed when the summer economic statement was formulated?  What contingency plans have been made if the situation worsens?  Are there plans to contribute to a rainy day fund or pension reserve fund?</p></speech>

When the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I published the stability programme update in April and the summer economic statement a couple of weeks ago, we acknowledged there was a risk to that 6% and said there could be changes that would move it to between 8% and 9%.  Even though it is still too early to say where this rate is going to land overall for the year, we are clearly moving into the higher inflation scenario as opposed to the 6% one.  We will produce our next inflation forecast on budget day.</p></speech>

All of the measures the Government has announced during the year will be implemented across the summer.</p> <p>  The Government has not made any decision yet about what role could be played by the rainy day fund for 2023.  I have acknowledged for many years that there is a risk.  We were making progress in reducing that risk and got hit by a pandemic.  We need to begin that work again but the Government has not considered any recommendation from me about whether we would use such a fund.  </p></speech>

I met the CSO in recent weeks.  I visited its head office in Cork, met the leadership team there and had a really good discussion.  I thanked it for all of the work it is doing.  The turnaround time it achieved for the census and the headline population figures was remarkable.  It did not raise any specific issues that warranted intervention but I will have a look at what the ESRI has said.  If there are any resource implications, we will consider them in the context of the Estimates.  I commend the CSO on the outstanding work it does.  It has significant value in policy making and the work we do in government.  I am sure the Deputy as a Member of the Oireachtas-----</p></speech>

I am very aware that we have had Covid but I would still like us to get things more quickly.</p> <p>  Sebastian Barnes appeared before the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach yesterday.  He said that the full costings on actions to meet climate targets and Sl&aacute;intecare had not been provided by the Government.  What provision has been made in the summer economic statement for both of these?  </p></speech>

Legislation is now in place, the Climate Change Advisory Council is up and running, we have the overall carbon budgets and the sectoral emissions ceilings will be agreed shortly.  The allocation of responsibility for those will be agreed by Government.  On the capital side, we have multi-annual ceilings so every Department knows exactly what it has out to 2025.  Some Departments have certainty beyond that because of the long-term nature of delivering major capital infrastructure projects, including in the Department of Transport, which will play a key role in that climate transition we all acknowledge we must implement over the period ahead.</p><p>On Sl&aacute;intecare, the Government's commitment to funding healthcare cannot really be called into question.  We have seen significant increases in healthcare funding in recent years, aside from Covid-19, even on the core side.  The overall budget is approximately &euro;22 million.  That has enabled us to fund a major increase in capacity.  We have provided funding for the addition of well over 11,000 beds and between 800 to 900 of those are now in place.  That is a significant increase on a base of approximately 11,000.  Thousands of additional healthcare staff are being recruited which is to be welcomed and there is more recruitment planned.  Sanction has been given for further recruitment and ambition.  It is going to require a medium-term to long-term commitment to implement Sl&aacute;intecare in its fullest respect.  As you know, the Minister of Health, Deputy Donnelly, is keen to negotiate a new contract with hospital consultants.  The principles of that were agreed by Government quite some time ago.  We want to see a focus on public work because we want to see the level of waiting time and the number of people on waiting lists in the country reduced dramatically.  That is the Government ambition.  In terms of the costings and the budgets, we have set out on a multiannual basis what our commitment is on the capital side and we have provided through our actions to date on the current side, very strong resources-----</p></speech>

I am glad the Minister, Deputy McGrath, mentioned transport as well because we saw in Spain this week that they have cut their public transport by half.  Train journeys of less than 300 km are now free of charge.  Would the Minister consider this at any point here?  I know he may say it is up to each Department but for those that are really struggling currently, it might be something to think about down the road.  I will finish on this last point.  We have seen in Poland what is called an anti-inflation shied where VAT has been cut to 0% on food, gas and fertilisers, to 5% on electricity and heat, and to 8% on fuel.  I wonder why we have not done something similar here.  I am very aware of the package he is going to tell us about and while we are extremely grateful for any package, we certainly feel it is not enough.  I listened to Deputy Doherty earlier and he spoke about the two months of recess and asked what was going to happen to these people struggling.  We are aware of schools opening up.  I wonder is there anything extra that could be added?</p></speech>

I make the point that just last week an additional &euro;67 million was announced which included the extension of hot meals to children attending DEIS schools.  This was a really important initiative that the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, brought forward.  This also included the abolition of school transport fares and the improvement in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  We recognise there are extra costs at this time of year and we took the view that because this is when these costs are being incurred, we would have to address these outside of the normal budgetary calendar.  Those moves have been broadly welcomed.</p> <p>  On transport fares, we should not understate the importance of the 50% reduction on fares for young people and the 20% reduction across the population generally on public transport services.  The continuation of that or any further measures and all of those issues have to be considered as part of the Estimates process.  There will be a lot of different priorities competing for resources and we will have to work our way through that as best we can.  </p> <p>  Progress is being made on the payment of the pandemic recognition payment.  We would all have liked it to have happened more quickly.  For those who are directly employed by the HSE, I think the vast majority have now received the payment.  For those who are not directly employed such as staff in hospices, private nursing homes and members of the Defence Forces, there is further work to be done.  The Department of Health is working its way through that currently.  </p> <p> Regarding waiting lists, we have an initiative to the value of approximately &euro;250 million because waiting lists have grown unfortunately.  The pandemic had a real impact.  It is a Government priority now to address that.  People are waiting too long and we are going to do all we can to make a lot of progress in that area.  </p></speech>

I will time myself.  I appreciate the Ministers' willingness always to come before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  The Ministers have mentioned the significant measures the Government has taken to address the cost of living and that there will be more.  One that stands out to me and that I have highlighted is the medical expenses threshold measure which has been cut in the space of 18 months.  As the Minsters know, the threshold was &euro;124 before people could get free medication on a monthly basis and this is now down to &euro;80.  That is a saving of close to &euro;500 a year.  It is quite significant then.  I refer to some of the other measures as well not least the back-to-school allowance which is a very proactive response.</p> <p>  I want to take into account everything that has been said about the pressures that people are under.  I went to buy a pair of shoes recently in Rathfarnham Shopping Centre.  I got good value you will all be pleased to know.  However, the staff there said that all the talk of the challenges facing the country is having a negative impact on people's willingness to spend.  People have become quite anxious about it.  There is the message of the fact of full employment and the fact that two weeks ago 200,000 people left this country to take holidays - a very positive sign of an economy doing well.  It is an economy that clearly has its challenges and we need people to keep spending money to bring more taxes in and to be able to make the significant impacts we have been making on the cost of living for people.  I put the question to both Ministers.  Is the fact that very little is being made of the really positive things happening in the economy and that so much negative talk is going on creating an environment where people are anxious to spend, something they are conscious of?   </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-07-14a.1238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022071400002#M01000"><p>The Minister, Deputy McGrath and I are constantly at pains to acknowledge the challenges and difficulties many are facing at the moment but in the same breath to make the point regarding the things that are still going well in our economy.  We both made reference in our opening statements to where we are with income, with employment and to the growth that has taken place in our economy and the very positive change that has happened since the pandemic has lessened.  We are aware of the need for that balance because it is important the people of our country are reminded that despite the new challenges we are facing so soon after we have dealt with the cost of a pandemic, we have an economy that has a very high level of employment, is still growing in a very robust way, and has public finances that have recovered.  That should give us confidence in our ability to manage the challenges that lie ahead.  Deputy McGrath and I have said again and again that we cannot meet every need placed upon us in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere but we are both confident we can do enough to help and that we will continue to do that.  As one final concluding comment on that,  Deputy Ryan made the point earlier regarding what is happening with public transport in Spain and what is happening in Poland with VAT.  If we go down the path of picking the single biggest measure each country has done and say in the round that Ireland has to match them all, that is the path to the creation of new risks and problems for ourselves.  We have to compare what we are doing in the round, to what other countries are doing in the round.  There are plenty of economies that have not cut excise, or VAT, or that have not done the one-off payments that Minister McGrath has brought forward.  What Ireland has done in terms of scale and targeted and broad measures, compares well to what many other countries in Europe have done and we should continue to look at it in the round when comparing overall what we are doing versus elsewhere.</p></speech>

However, there are many positives.  Ireland is an outlier in European terms in so many respects on the positive side.  There is the level of growth we continue to enjoy, the job creation, the dramatic improvement in the public finances and the continuing strong investment pipeline announcements by both FDI clients and Enterprise Ireland clients, which are really strong and positive.  We must strike a balance between acknowledging the headwinds - and there is a great degree of uncertainty at the moment about the international economy in particular - but also recognising sentiment is important and the Deputy is spot on there.  It is a key driver of economic performance because while there are undoubtedly many people struggling at the moment there are many others who have resources and we want them to make decisions to invest, spend and play an active part in our economy.  Our giving a fair presentation of all the issues, including the challenges and also the positives and strengths, can play an important point in giving that sense of confidence, because we are confident.  It is not false hope.  It is important to give people hope based on realism about the outlook for the Irish economy.  We will get through this period and Ireland will continue to be a strong performer.  It is just important we make the right decisions to help us on that journey.  I thank the Deputy for making the point as it is a really important one.</p></speech>

We are coming to the end, so I would like to ask two things.  They are not big questions.  On the different tax expenditures or reliefs that expire at the end of the year, will the Ministers provide a note to the committee itemising those that sunset this year, the portion of their costs included in the base for next year, the cost of expending them into next year and whether a portion of the &euro;2.7 billion will need to be used for mica redress?
