    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022051100002#A00200"><p>The proceedings of Oireachtas committees will be conducted without the requirement for social distancing, with normal capacity in the committee rooms restored.  Committees are encouraged, however, to take a gradual approach to this change.  Members and witnesses have the option to attend meetings in the relevant committee room or online, through Microsoft Teams.  All those attending in the committee room and environs should continue to sanitise and to wash their hands properly and often, and to avail of sanitiser outside and inside committee rooms, be respectful of other people's physical space and practise good respiratory etiquette.  If they have any Covid symptoms, no matter how mild, they should not attend in the meeting room.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  Members are well aware that if they are participating in the meeting remotely, they are required to do so from within the Leinster House complex only.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Bruton.</p> <p>  The main item for discussion today is the waiver of intellectual property protection in the context of the World Trade Organization agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS, as it relates to Covid-19 vaccines.  The TRIPS agreement is an international legal agreement between all member nations of the World Trade Organization, WTO, and any proposal for a potential variation or waiver of the current intellectual property protections under the TRIPS agreement is for negotiation at the WTO, of which Ireland is one of 164 members.  Furthermore, at EU level, international trade is an EU competence such that the EU, as a single voice, represents the co-ordinated position of the 27 member states, including in discussions on TRIPS at the WTO.  Universal and equitable access to vaccines is crucial in the global fight against Covid-19.</p> <p>  I am pleased that the committee has an opportunity to discuss this matter further with a number of representatives from the following organisations.  I welcome the following: from Oxfam Ireland, Mr. Jim Clarken, chief executive; from Maynooth University's department of law, Professor Aisling McMahon; from M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, Mr. Dimitri Eynikel, access campaign EU policy adviser; from St. Vincent's University Hospital, Dr. Christine Kelly; from the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, Mr. Oliver O'Connor, chief executive; and from BioPharmaChem Ireland, Mr. Matt Moran, director, and Ms Nessa Fennelly, senior executive.</p> <p>  Before we start our discussion, I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  The opening statements have been circulated to all members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I now invite Mr. Jim Clarken and Professor Aisling McMahon to make their opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Clarken" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022051100002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for this opportunity to brief them on the TRIPS waiver as it relates to the Covid-19 pandemic.  I am Jim Clarken, CEO of Oxfam Ireland, also representing the People's Vaccine Alliance Ireland.  Oxfam is a development, humanitarian and human rights organisation working across 66 countries to end inequality and poverty.  The People's Vaccine Alliance Ireland is made up of NGOs, health practitioners across the medical profession, trade unions, academics and faith groups.<br/><br/>We are over two years into the Covid-19 pandemic and huge levels of vaccine inequity persist.  Just 13% of people in low-income countries have received two doses, compared with 75% of people in high-income countries.  Less than 1% of people in low-income countries are boosted, compared with over 60% of people here in Ireland.<br/><br/>To address this and to prepare for future pandemics effectively, we need diversity of production and supply.  Multiple producers should be able to produce vaccines in sufficient quantity and to adapt them to new variants and needs.  A TRIPS waiver will help to achieve this.<br/><br/>An example of this potential is the WHO mRNA technology transfer hub in South Africa, which has the potential to lead and to inform the development of mRNA technology in Africa.  However, this may be hampered without a TRIPS waiver.<br/><br/>Moreover, Covid-19 therapeutics remain &quot;out of reach of the poor&quot; without a TRIPS waiver, according to the WHO director general, Dr. Tedros, last week.  This is particularly egregious given that those who are unvaccinated are those who would benefit most from therapeutics.<br/><br/>Not having control over vaccine and therapeutic production means that low-income countries continue to experience the same devastation we experienced before vaccine roll-out, even though the tools to prevent this are out there.  As Wilfred Gurupira, an academic in Zimbabwe recently interviewed by Oxfam, put it:</p> <blockquote> 	It's one thing losing those you love to a pandemic where there's nothing that can be done.  But it's quite another, losing people when you know there was something that could be done to help them, but you can't access it. </blockquote> <p>The lack of access to vaccines and therapeutics is translating into huge numbers of deaths.  Since the start of the pandemic, <i>The Economist</i>estimates that 19.5 million people have died and over 3 million Covid-19 deaths have occurred since the Omicron variant emerged.  The majority of all those deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries.<br/><br/>Arguments have been made that enough vaccines are coming online to address this issue.  Experts have estimated that there will be a 15 billion dose shortfall in mRNA Covid vaccine production in 2022.  mRNA vaccines have the highest reported effectiveness against Omicron.  This gap is likely to increase due to the need for boosters, especially variant-specific boosters.  We cannot expect developing countries to fight today's virus with yesterday's tools.<br/><br/>A TRIPS waiver would not just prevent large levels of mortality and morbidity in low-income countries; it could also help to prevent the emergence of vaccine-resistant variants that have the potential to drag Ireland, this part of the world and the whole world into lockdowns and restrictions again.<br/><br/>Allowing generic production worked before during the HIV-AIDS epidemic, although millions of lives were lost before such production was allowed.  I urge the committee not to allow a similar outcome to arise by continuing to delay a TRIPS waiver, which would create a similar level of suffering and damage.</p><p>Ireland's continued opposition to the TRIPS waiver is in contravention of Ireland&rsquo;s human rights obligations and is greatly damaging Ireland&rsquo;s hard-earned international reputation as a champion of low-income countries and human rights.  The need for Ireland&rsquo;s support of the TRIPS waiver is pressing, as the WTO ministerial conference will be held in June.  Low-income countries cannot wait any longer.  The TRIPS waiver is supported by more than 100 countries, the WHO, the Seanad and the majority of the Irish public.  It is time Ireland supported the TRIPS waiver, helped to save millions of lives and helped to put an end to this pandemic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Aisling McMahon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022051100002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for this invitation to address the committee today.  I am a professor of law in Maynooth University specialising in intellectual property, IP, and health law.<br/><br/>IP rights, such as patents, provide rights holders with an exclusive right over the patented technology for a limited period, which is generally 20 years for patents.  If the patented technology is an element of a vaccine, rights holders can control who can access that vaccine and at what price, and who can use that element to produce similar vaccines.  Accordingly, how IP rights are used is a key factor affecting access to Covid-19 vaccines, medicines and diagnostics.<br/><br/>The TRIPS agreement is an international WTO agreement which imposes minimum IP obligations that must be offered in all WTO states.  Due to concerns about the effects of IP on access to Covid-19 health technologies and, in particular, concerns that low- and middle-income countries were highly likely to fall significantly behind high-income countries in securing access to such technologies, in October 2020 India and South Africa proposed the TRIPS waiver.  This proposal was made and discussed against the backdrop of a lack of sufficient industry support for voluntary global initiatives to encourage the sharing of IP data and know-how to radically upscale Covid-19 vaccine production for global needs.<br/><br/>The waiver proposes to temporarily suspend certain IP obligations under TRIPS for Covid-19 health technologies.  If it is adopted, it will suspend WTO states' obligations at the international TRIPS level.  However, states like Ireland could likely maintain IP protections at a national level if they wished.  The main likely effect of the waiver would be to allow low- and middle-income countries to avail of it, thereby enabling entities within such countries to produce similar Covid-19 vaccines, medicines or diagnostics without facing IP litigation.  While this waiver is not a panacea, it would, nonetheless, clear IP hurdles and act as a key step in increasing global vaccine production.  More specifically, it would be a key step to enable low- and middle-income countries to develop sustainable long-term solutions to vaccine supply issues where the <i>status quo</i>model under TRIPS has simply failed such countries.  In doing so, it would help to build resilience for future pandemic preparedness.  However, no agreement has been reached on the waiver to date, and the EU is a key blocker of the original TRIPS waiver proposal.  Most recently, it has been reported that the EU is supporting a so-called quad - comprising the EU, India, South Africa and the US - outcome text proposal.  This proposal arose following informal discussions among the US, India, South Africa and the EU.  However, it is not clear at this point if India, South Africa or the US support the text.<br/><br/>In my view, this quad proposal, in its current form, does not offer a useful pathway to upscale Covid-19 vaccine production for four main reasons.  First, it applies primarily to patents, not other IP rights such as trade secrets, which are also vital for vaccine production.  It falls far short of the broad package of measures envisaged by the original TRIPS waiver.  Second, unlike the original TRIPS waiver, this proposal does not waive IP rights, as such.  Instead, it primarily makes modifications to existing TRIPS compulsory licensing mechanisms.  Compulsory licensing can be useful in some contexts but it, alone, is not an effective tool to address vaccine access issues during a global health crisis.  Third, the quad proposal introduces various additional requirements for compulsory licensing other than what TRIPS requires.  For example, it requires a list of all patents relevant to the vaccine before a compulsory licence is issued.  This could prove exceptionally difficult in practice.  Fourth, this proposal only applies to eligible members and this is narrowly defined, thereby limiting who can use it.  Put simply, the quad proposal in its current form is not a workable or effective solution for Covid-19 vaccine access issues.  For these reasons, states such as Ireland should advocate at an EU level and internationally in support of the measures set out in the original TRIPS waiver proposal and work to actively achieve such measures in a waiver text under the current WTO negotiations.  I thank the members for their attention.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Oliver O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022051100002#B00400"><p>I thank the committee for inviting us to appear before the this committee.  The Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, and BioPharmaChem Ireland, BPCI, are here jointly as the representative organisations for the research-based biopharmaceutical industry in Ireland.  Our remarks are set against a backdrop of very low Covid-19 case numbers in Ireland, high rates of vaccination and avoided mortality and serious illness from the disease.  It is more than 16 months since Annie Lynch, the 79-year-old Dubliner, became the first person in Ireland to be vaccinated for Covid-19.  Since then, almost 11 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.  More than 4 million people are fully protected against the disease through vaccination.</p> <p>  The efficient roll-out of the vaccination programme here attests strongly to the capacity of the Department of Health and the HSE to respond to an emergency.  The biopharmaceutical industry, the work of which, along with others, led to the discovery, development and manufacture of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments in record time, is proud of our achievement too.  We are aware that there is more to be done.  While Ireland has a world-class Covid-19 vaccination rate, much of the world remains unprotected.  That must change.  We are as committed to this as any other party.  We want as many people as possible, regardless of where they live, vaccinated for Covid-19 as fast as possible.  The response to this pandemic, to future ones and to all other diseases depends on stable conditions for the discovery, development and production of vaccines and treatments.  Speed of delivery and global equity of access to Covid-19 vaccines and treatments, and the protection of IP rights, are not mutually exclusive.  They are complementary. </p> <p>  To thrive, innovation depends on IP protection.  It is the certainty that shields the risky business of investing in research and development.  Most of this fails.  The global patents system is the basis for innovation.  The proposed TRIPS waiver is a serious risk to the global patents system.  Waiving IP rights will not accelerate global Covid-19 vaccines access.  Production is not now the problem and has not been.  There are already more than enough vaccines for the world.  The problem is they are not getting to the people who most need them fast enough.</p> <p>  The effort to vaccinate the world for Covid-19 is limited by vaccine administration, not by vaccine production.  By the end of June, 16.3 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines will have been produced since the start of the pandemic.  At the end of January, there were more than 12 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses produced, including 3.4 billion mRNA vaccines.  Of the 12 billion, 10 billion were administered.  The speed of Covid-19 vaccines production is outpacing their administration globally.</p> <p>  The cause of global Covid-19 vaccine inequity is the capacity of some countries, mostly developing countries, to absorb, distribute and administer the doses they get.  In some of these countries, Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy is high.  There are reports of shortages of syringes and medical equipment, as well as the destruction of significant quantities of doses of expired vaccines.  Clearly, this is not to blame countries for shortcomings and for their great challenges and difficulties.  Rather, it is a signal to us to do more to help in this area of vaccine administration.  In essence, the problem is not vaccines, it is vaccination.</p> <p>  By the end of last month, COVAX, Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access, the vaccine distribution programme backed by the WHO, had delivered 1.43 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses to 145 countries.  Africa has received around 672 million doses.  In January, 96 million doses were shipped to Africa, which is more than double the number shipped six months before that.  However, COVAX is now only shipping Covid-19 vaccines to countries on demand to ensure the right volume at the right time.  The WHO has reported that up to 3.5 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have had to be destroyed. </p> <p>  Dr. Mike Ryan, the executive director of the WHO's health emergencies programme, whom we all know, has indicated that global vaccines access is affected now more by demand-side challenges than by supply-side ones.  Most recently, on 22 April, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention asked for all Covid-19 vaccine donations to be paused until later this year because hesitancy and logistical hurdles are hampering administration.</p> <p>  Our industry has met the challenge of global production by investing in existing sites and voluntarily entering into over 370 licensing and other agreements with manufacturing partners with the skills and technology needed to produce Covid-19 vaccines to the highest regulatory standards.  Further production capacity expansions are planned, especially in Africa.  For Covid-19 treatments, over 150 voluntary partnerships are in play.</p> <p>  Often, global supply of vaccines and medicines is managed from a small number of manufacturing sites, with production of the drug substance, known as the active pharmaceutical ingredient, concentrated in one site.  Building manufacturing sites across multiple continents is impractical and unnecessary.</p><p>Importing and exporting raw ingredients is complex.  Early in the pandemic, that process was exacerbated by trade barriers, such as export restrictions.  For one mRNA vaccine, there are some 280 raw ingredients.  Local regulatory approval is needed where manufacturing sites are located.  The right skills are not always available locally.  Until 2020, there was no mRNA vaccine manufacturing anywhere in the world.</p><p> Waiving intellectual property rights for use in manufacturing sites with very limited capacity, or to be made available to companies with no track record or experience in manufacturing complex medicines such as vaccines, could result in the diversion and hoarding of critical raw materials and the weakening of already strained supply chains.  That could lead to fewer, inferior or even unsafe vaccines.</p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Matt Moran, from BioPharmaChem Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matt Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022051100002#C00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for inviting us.  Following on from Mr. O'Connor, I will continue our contribution.</p> <p>  A draft proposal released in March by the WTO puts forward a limited waiver or modified compulsory licensing provisions for Covid-19 vaccines and treatments.  We consider these proposals as serious risks to global public health.  Voluntary production partnerships have been shown to work, as Mr. O'Connor outlined.  We must avoid dampening research and development, which would damage health outcomes, as well as potentially costing jobs in locations where there is significant biopharmaceutical investment.  Members are all aware of the important role of that investment in the Irish economy.</p> <p>  According to the European Patent Office, a waiver would lead to a 37% drop in research and development for Covid-19-related products, such as vaccines and therapeutic treatments.  The impact would disproportionately be felt in higher income countries where research and development activity is more likely to be concentrated.</p> <p>  Multilateral solutions are needed to strengthen healthcare system capacity for Covid-19 vaccine administration and to empathetically tackle vaccine hesitancy.  Efforts must focus on developing economies.  Two thirds of the 1.3 billion people living in poverty are in middle-income countries.  Lower and upper middle-income countries are home to 75% of the world&rsquo;s population and 62% of the world&rsquo;s poor.  A collaborative effort to protect vulnerable populations against Covid-19 must involve a co-ordinated effort between industry, the global health community, governments and non-government organisations to help bridge gaps in cold chain and service delivery, insufficient workforce capacity and challenges with demand and vaccine confidence in some countries.  These challenges should not be underestimated.  The challenge of making and distributing pharmaceuticals is significant and complex.</p> <p>  Our industry is part of the effort to achieve global vaccines equity.  We believe there are six ways to achieve that goal.  These are to continue to surge production of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments through in-company investments in sites and voluntary on-boarding of suitable manufacturing partners; eliminate trade barriers so that the free flow of vaccines, ingredients and medical goods and supplies across borders is facilitated in the global supply chain; increase dose-sharing, with developed countries giving developing countries much more of their surplus vaccine doses faster; support country readiness, building the capacity of healthcare systems in developing countries to efficiently absorb, distribute and administer vaccine doses; combat vaccine hesitancy through education and health awareness programmes, empathetic and tailored community outreach and influencer activations in mainstream media and on social media platforms; and drive further innovation in vaccines and treatments and work with healthcare systems on planning to guard against variants of concern and future pandemics.</p> <p>  We cannot afford to undermine innovation.  Scientists expect more zoonotic contagion in the future, making IP rights a key part of the public health response.  We still have to find answers to the diseases we do not know about.  Globally, there are thousands of medicines in development.  Among them are cell and gene therapies to treat, prevent and potentially cure some diseases such as cancer.  This is the dividend of innovation.</p> <p>  Covid-19 has been harrowing, causing sickness and death for so many people.  According to the latest estimates, over 15 million people have died globally and there have been 13% more deaths than are normally expected over two years.  However, without vaccines and later treatments, the death toll and lost economic output caused by Covid-19 would have been so much worse.</p> <p>  This is our industry's contribution to the world - saving lives, guarding against severe illness and maintaining economic life.  We are proud of that contribution, made possible by science.  Let us protect it for the health of all of us and for economic progress.  I thank members for listening.</p></speech>

I will have to leave briefly to speak in the Chamber but I will be back.  We have a rota system, so I hope I will also be able to contribute in on the second round.</p><p>I am struck by the words of Mr. Clarken.  He stated:</p> <blockquote> 	We are over two years into the Covid-19 pandemic and huge levels of vaccine inequity persist.  Just 13% of people in low-income countries have received two doses, compared with 75% of people in high-income countries.  Less than 1% of people in low-income countries are boosted, compared with over 60% of people here in Ireland. </blockquote> <p>Clearly, there is an issue, which cannot be explained away with words because the facts illustrate that it is a major problem.  We all believe, I am sure, that nobody is safe until everybody is safe.  We keep saying that but we need to give that some meaning.  If we say nobody is safe until everybody is safe, it has to have some substance.</p><p>I have done a small amount of reading on this.  From what I can see, people with much more knowledge of IP law than I have argue that a TRIPS waiver is necessary and proportion.  It clears the IP barriers and facilitates increased supply and development of technologies, etc.</p><p>Given the figures I have outlined and the evidence given by Professor McMahon on the protection of income, will Mr. O'Connor explain how a TRIPS waiver would be detrimental to innovation, particularly given that a TRIPS waiver was not detrimental to innovation when the generic production of HIV-AIDS drugs was finally allowed?  Mr. O'Connor seems to be suggesting that there is some sort of an administrative problem and that the problem is not vaccines but vaccinations.  I believe it is a little more complicated than that.  I ask Mr. O'Connor to outline how the TRIPS waiver would be detrimental to innovation given that the evidence available in relation to HIV-AIDS drugs suggests it would not.</p></speech>

The study by the European Patent Office showed that a waiver would lead to a 37% drop in investment in research and development for vaccines and therapeutics and that this effect would be felt in both developing and developed countries.  The reason is that vaccines, like medicines, are created, funded and researched by capital that comes from both the public and the private sectors, but predominantly the private sector.  Any uncertainty in what are the rules of the game in advance will have a dampening effect on the willingness or ability of companies to raise funds for investment in very risky research.  One has to look right back to the earliest part of the process of the development of vaccines and therapies to see that this is where the investment in Europe of &euro;35 billion a year by the pharmaceutical industry happens.  It is not sufficient to look at it simply at the point where there is production of the vaccine and all the manufacturing processes that are protected by intellectual property rights.  It is not sufficient only to look at a certain point that they are actually developed.  One has to look right back to the start to see how does the investment in risky research happen.  Creating an uncertainty about the outcome at the end point has a dampening effect on the ability to raise funds to invest in risky ventures, especially where many of the results do not come through.  That is the fundamental economic point here about how vaccines and medicines actually get developed.</p></speech>

It just strikes me often that when economics wins out at the intersection between economics and health, it is invariably people in low to middle-income countries who lose out.  I ask Mr. Clarken, Professor McMahon and Mr. Eynikel to comment on what has just been said.</p></speech>

Moderna received $10 billion in government funding, including vaccine preorders.  Very unusually, the risk and capital were front-loaded by the taxpayer, or all of us.  As a result, this needs to be a public good.  My colleagues might elaborate a little on that.</p></speech>

We both work on the Covid-19 response, particularly in peaks of the pandemic and here and there with the roll-out of vaccines.  We also work on access to treatments, which we have not talked about but which I hope we can get back to, in addition to vaccines and diagnostics.</p> <p>  On the research and development cost, I disagree a little with the position that has been presented.  It is true that the research and development of vaccines is risky and takes much investment.  There is a big chance of failure; however, exactly for that reason; we have seen very little investment by the industry in vaccine development in recent decades, except when there were major outbreaks.  When there were outbreaks, there was significant public funding.  This happened with Ebola.  We can see a very similar situation now with the Covid-19 pandemic.  It was known that coronaviruses posed a serious threat of pandemic and epidemic outbreaks but there was very little investment.  When the outbreak came, significant funding was made available and advance-purchase agreements were signed, etc.  That is what created the enabling conditions.  The intellectual property rights existed before the outbreak.  There could have been investments in that regard but they did not happen.  I am happy that, at European level, the European Health Emergency preparedness and Response Authority, HERA, is being created precisely to provide significant funding to enable research and development efforts to protect us from diseases.</p> <p>  On the second element I want to address, let us bear in mind what the waiver is: it is an option for countries.  It is not about the abolition of intellectual property rights across the board.  The waiver of intellectual property rights is a temporary one that countries can use for a few years.  It will not harm intellectual property rights in Europe or in the US, for example.  </p></speech>

I wish to elaborate on what Mr. Eynikel has mentioned.  I am actually one of the authors of the paper mentioned.  Together with colleagues in the London School of Economics, University of Leeds and University of Kent, we argue that the intellectual property waiver proposed was a necessary and proportionate step in 2020 and 2021 and still is now, for various reasons.  In the paper, which was supported by over 200 intellectual-property academics all over the world in an open letter, we highlight that innovation is one of the arguments that is often presented but that when one digs deeper into those details, one notes those arguments could be questioned, particularly in the vaccine context.</p> <p>  First, as Mr. Eynikel has mentioned, intellectual property rights traditionally have been recognised as a very poor incentive for vaccine manufacture, for several reasons on which I will be happy to expand.  In the past, as Mr. Eynikel has highlighted in some examples, we have not had vaccines even though we knew a disease was likely.  There can be a risk of disease but not necessarily a guaranteed market.  In the Covid-19 context, it is important to state there has been very significant public funding, which is very good, and incredible scientific research, which should be acknowledged as excellent.   On top of that, however, public funding, advance-purchase agreements and other factors de-risked the production of Covid-19 vaccines.  The reality is that if we maintain intellectual property rights without recourse to any interventions for low- and middle-income countries, vaccines will be distributed not necessarily on the basis of health need, as we saw in 2020 and 2021, but rather on the basis of deals done between holders of intellectual property rights and countries that may have more money to facilitate access.  Low- and middle-income countries are those that are most likely to suffer, as pointed out.  At the moment, we may have more supplies but the situation is in flux because we could face a new variant at any moment or, indeed, a new pandemic.  If we do, low- and middle-income countries will not have the capacity built up, which is what they are asking for.</p> <p>  It is important to state that while there may be some supplies of vaccines going to low- and middle-income countries, they do not have a sustainable supply.  Many of those countries are asking to be able to have technology-transfer-related intellectual-property waivers so they can produce their own supply of vaccines, as we in Ireland and others have done.</p></speech>

I want to understand that because it strikes me that, if it is true, it is a fairly reasonable explanation.  If there is evidence to suggest that is not the full picture, we should hear it.</p></speech>

If the contention is that some countries are unable to manufacture in some instances because they do not have the skills, I completely disagree.  There is evidence to which I could point, and I am sure Dr. Eynikel and Mr. Clarken could add to it.  mRNA vaccines have been upscaled since the start of the pandemic.  We know that is the case in several countries.  We also know that, for example, Afrigen, together with the WHO hub, has recently replicated in South Africa a vaccine similar to the Moderna vaccine.  Therefore, we know there are skills there.  We also know that over 100 companies are willing to try to manufacture mRNA vaccines.  We know the skills exist.  The literature points not to Mr. O'Connor's conclusion but to the conclusion that entities are willing and have the skills to produce vaccines if intellectual property rights are waived and if there is a transfer of know-how and technology.  I am sure Mr. Eynikel can add to that.</p></speech>

It was actually our study in which it was identified that there are 100 companies capable of producing mRNA vaccines worldwide.  We ascertained this based on an examination of the profiles of the companies that work for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna to produce these vaccines.</p> <p>  The question also refers to the roll-out of vaccines, administration and skills that exist.  We have to recognise there are challenges.  They are predictable.  While I agree there are challenges associated with administering vaccines in certain countries and support is needed, let us not whitewash what has happened.  The vaccine inequity that we see today is largely the result of what happened last year, whereby very few vaccines were available for most of the world.  Eighty percent of the world's population live in low- or middle-income countries.  There were very few supplies available.  That is the problem we are addressing here today.  It is, of course, related to intellectual property rights and trade issues.  There was a large concentration of production in a few countries, including the US, European states and India.  The countries that could produce had priority access whereas those that could not did not have access to these tools.  They had no other source of supply.  That is the problem we are discussing here today.  We need diversity of production and supply so there will be multiple producers from which countries can source their vaccines now and in the future.</p></speech>

The first point, on innovation, is really important.  I am an infectious-diseases physician and also work in academia.  My job is really to prescribe pharmaceutical interventions to people every day, so I understand the key role of research and development and innovation in driving forward patient health.  On that point, I agree with my colleagues from the pharmaceutical industry.  However, a pandemic presents a very different scenario, for two reasons.  First, an infection, by nature, is transmissible from person to person.  An intervention will potentially interrupt transmission chains, which makes it different.  Second, when there is a pandemic, you are not dealing with one specific country but with the entire global population.  You eventually get to the point where if you are protecting your patent to drive profits for further innovation, the innovation you are protecting will not be capable of being used for certain populations.  The key issue I have with the current model is that we have got to the point where the innovation falls into this category in respect of certain populations of people.  That is bad for medical ethics, interrupting transmission and public health.  There has to be a balance.  There has to be a point at which we say enough is enough and that we now need to regulate what happens in terms of protecting the patents and making sure the product is available to everybody who needs it.</p></speech>

My time has expired but the Chairman might indulge me by allowing him to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Oliver O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022051100002#D00900"><p>I thank the Chairman and Deputy.  Let me respond to a couple of points.  On the question of the African production of vaccines, it is best to refer members to something I read recently, the African Union's plan entitled "Partnership for African Vaccine Manufacturing".  It sets a target for Africa to be able to manufacture 60% of its needed vaccines by 2040.  Its target is to be able to manufacture 10% of its needed vaccines on the African Continent by the end of 2025.</p><p>It does not include a requirement to achieve this to have a TRIPS waiver.  It is a very sophisticated document and it alerts to the importance of regulatory and standards controls and, indeed, the building of the skill sets needed within Africa.  It is an important report that would be worth looking at in this context.</p><p> On the overall issue of the economics of this, it is an unavoidable issue.  We are asking for private as well as public capital to be raised and it is up to the public sector rule-makers - the legislators - to say what are the rules.  We want to have a rules-based international system both for the production and the development of vaccines and medicines.  To go back, the initial TRIPS was set in the Doha round of trade talks and it allowed for compulsory licensing and so on.  Companies invested in their capacities and in their research and development on the basis of the rules that were in place.  If we now say those rules are not applied because we are going to have a waiver for vaccines, that changes the rule set.  For example, the Chinese want to manufacture mRNA vaccines and they are unhappy with the Quad proposal because they would not be currently allowed, and so on.</p><p> The fundamental point about investment is that the rules are set in advance.  Companies are raising capital, and the public sector is raising capital too, on the basis of the rules as set in advance.  If we change them, and it is open to the public sector to do that, we have to calculate the effects of that for future investment.  No company is forced to invest in any circumstances and no company can magic up the capital to invest both in its production capacity and in vaccines and medicines research and development.  They can only do so within the context of set international order and set rules.  It is a very important thing to ask whether we are changing those rules fundamentally and what effect that might have.  As I said, the European Patent Office said there will be a 37% reduction in vaccines.</p></speech>

A vast and unprecedented amount of public money was allocated towards the research of these vaccines.  As we are all aware, billions were given by the US Government to Moderna, which almost entirely funded the development, AstraZeneca was funded by the UK Government and the German Government provided in excess of &euro;400 million to BioNTech, which partners with Pfizer, as we are aware.  I find it difficult to see this point applying in this case.  The estimate I saw was that governments had spent more than &euro;90 billion on vaccines and therapeutics.  Is it not disingenuous for pharmaceutical companies to accept in excess of &euro;90 billion from countries across the globe to fund the vast majority of vaccine development and then say innovation is risky so we cannot have a waiver?  I ask Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Moran for a response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Oliver O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022051100002#E00500"><p>In all considerations of the interplay between public-private investment and payment for vaccines, we consider that we have to look at the benefits and the value generated.  For any vaccine or medicine, the value accrues to the individual and to the state, and some value accrues to companies that produce medicines.  That is the balance, and how that is divided up is the constant job of the payment and investment in medicines and vaccines generally.</p> <p>  I would say that, in this case, the value generated by vaccines incalculably outstrips both the value for money investment the public sector has made and the value that is earned by companies.  Even within our own economy, we can see that.  We have a domestic economy of some &euro;240 billion or &euro;250 billion.  If we have a 1%, or 10%, or some other level of fall in that economic output, that vastly exceeds what Ireland would have invested in any part of the European investment in research and development and, indeed, paying for the medicines.  In the balance of who gets the benefit globally, it is society that is getting the huge benefit from all of the excellent investment that has been made by the public sector.  Along with the reward for pharma companies that did invest, fundamentally, the value that is delivered has accrued to people in their lives and to societies.</p></speech>

This has often been referenced by pharmaceutical companies since this debate began, and it has been repeatedly said that developing countries lack the capacity to manufacture vaccines.  When I was doing research for this meeting, I came across an article by Stephanie Nolen in <i>The New York Times</i>, published on 22 October, which identified ten different locations in developing countries, including India, Thailand, South Africa and Indonesia.  It was a detailed, well written piece.  Ms Nolen had examined the key criteria, including existing facilities, human capital and so on.  Did Mr. Moran or Mr. O'Connor see the piece and what is their reaction to it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.33" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matt Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022051100002#E00700"><p>Having worked for many years in pharmaceutical manufacturing, I think it is quite easy to do fairly general studies of potential capacity or capability within any country in the world.  Normally, what the pharmaceutical industry does and has done is enter into licensing agreements and technology transfer agreements to ensure the capability is present and that they are able to manufacture these products and the ingredients.  To underestimate the complexity of what is happening here is a bit of a risk.  For instance, to make an mRNA vaccine that is made currently by Pfizer-BioNTech requires in excess of 280 different components, 46 different countries need to supply ingredients and there has to be a laboratory that can conduct more than 50 tests on the product.  The capability is not necessarily there.  The risk is that if one asks a company that does not have the capability to engage in manufacturing and supply, one is risking diversion of raw materials away from manufacturing and risking producing products which might be substandard, which is a risk to society and health.</p> <p>  The answer really is that, yes, the industry is keen to enter into joint agreements on a voluntary basis, which it has done and there are in excess of 350, as Mr. O'Connor referred to in his presentation.  They scour the world all of the time for new arrangements and, recently, joint licensing agreements have been agreed on the African continent between major pharmaceutical companies and local suppliers, and they will continue to do that.</p> <p>  Again, to put this in context, to establish a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant takes approximately two to three years in terms of the capital investment required, the regulatory approval required, the validation required and the training of people.  It is not something that is easily accessible.  I would congratulate the organisation Mr. O'Connor refers to with regard to establishing manufacturing on the African continent because it needs to be done, but it is not something that is going to happen overnight.  It is an area where we need to be very careful in terms of how we manage and deal with it.  The industry is keen to do this and has been doing this, and the evidence of that is the number of joint licensing agreements achieved.  Indeed, the committee is probably aware of the significant amount of vaccine that has been manufactured in India by the Serum Institute through an agreement it has with AstraZeneca.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.34" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dimitri Eynikel" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022051100002#E00800"><p>AstraZeneca&rsquo;s agreement with the Serum Institute is the odd one out, to be honest, and is a bit of an exception.</p><p>We appreciate, of course, that the Serum Institute did share the technology.  There is a major difference between conventional vaccines, the different types of vaccines that existed before, and the mRNA vaccines.  The latter vaccines are largely synthetic vaccines and that means they are less complex to produce.  In opposition to what has just been said, they can be produced by many pharmaceutical companies that normally produce medicines, because these vaccines are simpler to produce.  Equally, the production process is closer to that of certain medicines.  In that regard, I disagree with what was said.</p><p> It is correct that there are some 300 agreements.  I am sure they exist, but to a large extent these are agreements with companies in the US and Europe, or they concern fill and finish deals.  These types of deals mean the vaccine substance is produced in the US or Europe and then shipped to some companies in Africa, for example, where the vaccine is just put in the vials and quality tests are done.  It is a valuable part of the production and supply chain, but it is not vaccine production.  It does not provide an alternative source of supply.  We have seen that, for example, in the context of the agreement between Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson and Biovac in South Africa, where the vials were filled in that country but then shipped back to Europe.  It means that Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson were still selling these doses that were filled in South Africa back to Europe.  Such a process does not provide any solution for African countries seeking to buy access to vaccines.  A full production process is needed and we have not seen any commitment in this regard to share the requisite technology widely across the world.  This is why companies in India, Indonesia, Thailand and South Africa have been successfully re-engineering and developing mRNA vaccines themselves.  There is no reason they cannot do it.</p></speech>

In one way, a consequence of Covid-19 is that we are lucky to have a backdrop like it so we can see first-hand the benefits of our discussions today.  Licensing agreements, international property rights and all these add great value to companies.  We all agree on this aspect.  Reference was made to it probably taking two to three years to start up a production process, but in most instances, foreign direct investment, FDI, especially in modern, advanced societies, is aided by state supports.  Research and development investment also benefits from state support as well.  I appreciate that Mr. Moran and Mr. O'Connor set out in their document some of the initiatives they have taken or they are involved with globally and that companies must make a profit, but at the same time, putting on their humanitarian hats, do they think companies also have humanitarian, ethical and moral responsibilities to fulfil, or how do they marry those aspects?</p></speech>

The first way to discharge that is to use what they do to pursue it properly and with standards of excellence, which in the first place is to discover and apply and do research to the highest standards of excellence possible to discover the solutions we want.  Two years ago, there were no vaccines.  Companies made strong ethical commitments to devote all their resources - every possible one they could - to making that discovery and to organising their global manufacturing processes to deliver the vaccines.  That is a very high ethical obligation.  Therefore, companies do that and they are very conscious of those obligations.  As I said to the committee previously, the question of the balance of reward and value is one that is thought about constantly.  It happens in dialogue daily with our public sector, including with the HSE and the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  It happens at a global level as well.  People are very conscious of their obligations and their role in society.</p></speech>

Any of them I speak to, it is a bit like the English 700 years ago.  They used to go to war when the economy was faltering.  It has been a decent period for the pharmaceutical sector.</p> <p>  Some of the initiatives were referred to, including the mRNA technology transfer hub and COVAX.  Regarding what is being put into Africa, which is 672 million doses, it probably seems like a large number until we realise 11 million doses have already been administered in Ireland and Africa is a large continent.  It was brought into context for me yesterday when a South African lady came into my constituency office.  She had waited 18 months for her Irish citizenship to come through and her Irish passport finally arrived this week.  She can now go back to South Africa and visit the grave of her son, who died in the early stages of Covid-19 because he did not have access to a vaccine.  This woman was in the fortunate position that she was living here in a very advanced society and was able to access her Covid-19 vaccine quickly.  That experience showed me at first hand the disparities that exist.  While I appreciate what is happening in respect of the transfer of technology and in the context of COVAX, there is an onus on the pharmaceutical sector to do much more.  Certainly, the only space where we can see that happening is through the TRIPS waiver.</p></speech>

A good point has been made regarding the human cost of this.  Mr. Clarken referred in his opening statement to how bad the scenario is regarding global vaccination now.  Many countries still have vaccination rates of less than 10%.  WHO guidance is that 10% of a country's population must be vaccinated to cover the most vulnerable people.  These are people we started vaccinating here in Ireland in December 2020.  We are talking about healthcare workers, elderly people and immunosuppressed people.  Those categories of people still have not had any vaccine administered in some countries around the world.  This hits me particularly hard, because as a healthcare worker, I understand how difficult it is to grapple with these issues of going in to treat people when you have not been vaccinated yourself and of watching people potentially getting very sick and dying from a vaccine-preventable disease.  I am grateful for that context having been brought in because this is the key aspect we must remember.</p> <p>  We now have enough production and things like that, but it is important to note, however, that this delay in rolling out vaccines has already had a major impact.  It is fair to say we have failed in global vaccine roll-out.  Large parts of the world have not received any vaccines at all.  The consequences of this are increased disease and death from a vaccine-preventable disease, increased transmission and prolongation of the pandemic.  Also worrying for me is our global health security, our ability to manage infections and prevent new infections and new variants, should they crop up.  All of this has been impacted by the delay.  It is not okay to sit here and state we had a very good programme in Ireland and we now have lots of production, because we are missing out on that crucial time when we missed doing this properly.  It is important for us to understand the impact this has had.  It has had an impact not only from a clinical point of view but also from a point of view of confidence in vaccine programmes.  Therefore, if we are talking about hesitancy and things like that, much of that has been driven by the fact there has been unreliable vaccine supply for a long time.  People were worried that some of the vaccines were expired.  Some had to be destroyed.  All these things also undermine global confidence in vaccines, which is a real issue for us at the minute too.</p></speech>

He can, though, come back in again.</p></speech>

We talked about the huge death toll of an estimated 19.5 million people.  Of those, 14% have been in high-income countries, while the rest have been in poor- and middle-income countries.  For every life lost in a rich country, four have been lost in a poor country.  People in poorer countries are much more likely to die from this disease than those of us lucky enough to have had the opportunity to be vaccinated.  Every minute, four children lose a parent or caregiver as a result of the pandemic.  Considering this impact in the context of global human development, it is estimated that 90% of the world is worse off due to the effects of the pandemic.  Some 160 million people have been pushed into extreme poverty, bearing in mind that we had been making slow progress to rid ourselves of extreme poverty.  We had a long way to go, but we were making slow progress.  We have now gone backwards and dramatically so.</p><p>The impact on women, in particular, has been devastating.  Those who are on the front line, working in precarious, low-income jobs, have put themselves hugely at risk.  The amount of unpaid care work, 90% of which is carried out by women in the first place, has dramatically increased.  We know about the huge growth in violence against women and girls both in this part of the world and throughout the world.  There has been a massive human impact to this.  I really appreciate the Deputy raising it because at the end of the day it is up to us to minimise the human impact in any way we can.  Clearly, a TRIPS waiver does not solve all of our problems but it gets us a long way there.  </p></speech>

Mr. Eynikel made the point earlier that we should not whitewash the impact of the intellectual property stranglehold on vaccines.

We know the death rate but I cannot say which of these people have died specifically as a result of that.  That is an impossible or very difficult calculation to make.  Let us be careful about putting numbers to that exactly.  This does not mean that the TRIPS waiver will not help to reduce that number, particularly for treatments.  Let us not forget to discuss treatments.  We have talked a lot about vaccines so far but when we are talking about access to treatments there is a serious problem right now.  There are countries particularly in Latin America that are completely cut off from access to Covid-19 treatments.  I am sure that Dr. Kelly can talk more about them.  They can save lives.  They are very easy to produce.  They are cheap.  People do not have access to them because of intellectual property rights.</p></speech>

Similarly, it is open of course to governments and authorities to say we will have a situation in the future where we are prepared to invest money but there will be no intellectual property, IP, rights for any private investment company.  That is fair enough.  If that is what they want to do, that is fine.  My only point was that as long as the public sector sets the rules clearly in advance and sticks to those rules, as they were set in the Doha Round that would be the most predictable and indeed order-based, rules-based type of environment in which you could have joint public and private investment.  It is not a matter of disputing how much investment; clearly the investment has been made and it is good.</p></speech>

I do not accept the idea of "at the expense of".  What I see is legitimate public investment in research and development and a large amount of private investment.  Companies are making huge investment over many years in their own capacities to manufacture, develop and deliver and roll out on a global basis medicines and vaccines.  I see them asking investors, pension funds and many other private organisations to invest in their companies, to put their money at risk.  I see them getting rewarded for that.  Yes of course there are profits in that area.  There are also many investments which produce nothing.  The public sector, as a matter of public policy, would have to consider whether states, such as Ireland, would be prepared to invest hundreds of millions of euro in investment projects that could produce nothing.  The risk tolerance of states and the public sector is quite low for those things.  The risk tolerance in private investment is somewhat higher.  Therefore it is a blend of the two.

Can he unpack that for me, in the context of the African Union for example being very clear in favour of a TRIPS waiver, of the reported gap in mRNA vaccines needed between 4 billion and 15 billion?  To put it bluntly, is there not a certain racist trope going on there suggesting that African countries are not capable of using these vaccines?</p></speech>

The evidence I bring to bear for that, if I may, is the statement indeed from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention from only three weeks ago.  Three weeks ago it asked for a suspension of delivery of vaccines.  That is really the basis of what I am saying.  More is being produced than is capable of being administered currently in Africa.  Of course there is a bigger demand.  That should be delivered later, and it will be.  The industry is scaling up production.  It is going to continue to produce and serve the needs of patients in Africa.  Absolutely.  There is no call whatsoever for such language in this sort of debate.</p></speech>

In regard to the vaccine hesitancy, I notice that the IPHA has said low update rates are due to hesitancy.</p><p>She may correct me if I am wrong but I think Dr. Kelly penned a letter to <i>The Irish Times</i>last January contradicting this, saying there is no more hesitancy in the market than there is in Europe or elsewhere.  She also stated that hesitancy in Africa and other countries is due to historical issues with respect to vaccines that were used unethically.  Will witnesses comment on the extent of vaccine hesitancy, what can be done about it and the issue of how it may be leading to a lack of uptake in some countries, which we are all concerned about?</p></speech>

Vaccine misinformation is one of the biggest challenges we face as physicians in the area of infectious diseases.  It is something we need to be really careful about and challenge it properly and not make it worse.  By compromising our global vaccine roll-out programmes, we have actually inadvertently contributed to that through decreasing population confidence in vaccines in general.<br/><br/>A lot of data has been published.  An excellent paper was published in<i>Nature</i>last year that showed vaccine hesitancy rates in Africa and other low-income countries, apart from those in Africa, were similar overall to higher-income countries.  The problem we have is that the current distribution model is based on giving surplus supplies to these countries.  Until recently, we did not have enough production, and we still do not have enough production of the right type of vaccines.  We have not had reliable supply chains.  We have not had the right kinds of vaccines.<br/><br/>NIAC is a fantastic body.  It put so much work and effort into meticulously generating guidelines for the Irish public that were evidence-based.  Many countries around the world have not been able to do that.  They have not been able to sit down and say what is the best, most effective, safest vaccine for their population.  They are dealing with what they believe to be leftover vaccines from other countries, so that actually fuels vaccine hesitancy.  Because of vaccine inequity, we have made vaccine hesitancy worse.  That is one of the big issues at the minute.  When we are talking about countries that are not able to absorb vaccines, that is certainly one of the factors in the mix.<br/><br/>We also have to remember that it is not easy for people in many of these countries to get to vaccine centres.  They can be travelling for long periods.  They might not be able to afford transport and such things, so there are logistic issues.  We are not at a point in the pandemic that we are seeing high transmission peaks.  That may come again and there may be a time when the pressure is on again to get vaccines rolled out.  All those points are in the mix.</p></speech>

They were given permission to do so.  Even if those vaccines were manufactured in the states Dr. Kelly mentioned, would the challenges regarding hesitancy, supply chains, enough syringes, and getting the logistics in the countries up to speed to administer the vaccines continue?</p></speech>

I worked in Malawi for four years and I have seen fantastic vaccine roll-out programmes.  If there is one thing a lot of countries in low-income scenarios are very good at, it is rolling out vaccines.  We have to be very careful about looking down on countries and saying that are not able to do this, because a lot of the time they are able, but it is about equipment and supplies issues.</p> <p>  The TRIPS waiver would help with the autonomy of a country to be able to decide what vaccines it will introduced and how it will do that.  For me, that is the big issues as a clinician.  I want to be able to decide what I am supplying based on evidence, not based on the leftovers or whatever is being given to me.  The essential point of the TRIPS waiver is clinical autonomy, as well as diversity of production and being able to produce the vaccine within the contingent for the continent, and for it not to be exported.</p></speech>

It is clear a lot of work is going on in Africa and with the Africa CDC about studies on how they can effectively roll out vaccines.  A recent study stated that the most effective measure is to target older people earlier than the general population when vaccinating.  Studies are being done in multiple countries on how to use the vaccines we have most effectively and more quickly.  In that respect, the industry is collaborating with them in doing so.</p></speech>

The US trade representative, Katherine Tai, announced in 2021 that the US would support the waiver of IP protections in the context of Covid-19 vaccines that were introduced by the governments of India and South Africa.  That is a major step forward.  Jorge Contreras, from the University of Utah, stated in <i>Intereconomics</i>that:</p> <blockquote> 	...even if a company is legally required to &ldquo;share&rdquo; its proprietary trade secrets and manufacturing know-how with others, there are countless ways to delay and subvert the effective transfer of knowledge.  In practice, the most effective technology sharing programs are supported by voluntary action rather than governmental compulsion. </blockquote> <p>Has the industry considered voluntary knowledge transfer to alleviate the global supply shortages?  Does the IPHA agree that there are 100 manufacturing sites across the world that are now able to manufacture generic versions of Covid-19 vaccines?</p></speech>

The mRNA vaccine has been developed as a European and American innovation.  The vast majority of new medicines and vaccines are developed between Europe and the US.  In considering how that is playing out, one has to look at the current discussions on the Quad proposal that has been referred to, and why China is not happy with the Quad proposal because of the 10% limitation on exports.  China wants access to the mRNA technology with no IP rights - completely free access.  As a matter of the current global political economy and how things have developed in the past year and, indeed, in recent months, the American Government will, no doubt, consider whether it should allow American-European technology to be accessed completely free, with no IP rights, by China.  This is an issue that is in play and it is not something the pharmaceutical industry can decide.  It is obviously for governments to decide.  This is the enterprise committee and, as we all know, it is concerned with international trade and so on and so forth.  It is an important aspect of international trade and is relevant to these considerations as we see them played out at the WTO.</p> <p>  My colleague might like to speak about the number and availability of manufacturing sites around the world and what that represents.</p></speech>

We have said there are 350 agreements, which is a significant number, and they are supporting manufacturing where it can.</p> <p>  The complexity of making mRNA vaccines has been underestimated a bit.  For members' information, it actually takes 60 days to make one batch of an mRNA vaccine.  In fact, that technology is not off the shelf.  The view of the industry still is that they have scoured the world looking for what they believe are suitable partners to enter into agreements with.  That probably is the more productive way to go.  In the long run, it will enhance the supply of vaccines.</p></speech>

In particular, it is very important to note that the Covid-19 technology access pool, C-TAP, which the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence previously considered, was an initiative set up by the WHO to facilitate the sharing of intellectual property rights, data, IP, etc., to upscale vaccine and other health technology production for Covid-19.  That initiative was one with great promise.  It was the idea that industry and states would come together in solidarity.  The reality is that industry did not sufficiently support that for vaccines at any stage.  It was precisely because of that lack of voluntary support for these types of global initiatives that India and South Africa had well-founded fears, sadly, that low- and middle-income countries would fall behind.  In an ideal world, voluntary agreements would have been the solution if there was sufficient engagement at that stage, but there was not.</p><p> The TRIPS waiver was proposed and has arguably been a leverage to encourage voluntary agreements.  Of those that have happened, we cannot prove that the waiver was definitely what led to them, but certainly waivers and compulsory licensing have been used as leverage in the past.  As Mr. Eynikel pointed out previously, many of the voluntary agreements, which are good to have and it has to be commended when such agreements are set up, are fill-and-finish agreements, which means the technology, the know-how, is not necessarily being transferred.  The issue with that is we are not building long-term capacity in low- and middle-income countries.</p><p> COVAX has been mentioned.  While it is a good system for short-term supply, COVAX does not allow countries to upscale their own manufacturing capacity, which is also a real issue.  It is the same with some of these voluntary initiatives.  It is important that we recognise the waiver debate is in a context in which we have not had sufficient support for those initiatives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.87" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dimitri Eynikel" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022051100002#J00200"><p>I will respond to the point on China.  When it comes to the mRNA technologies, it is quite interesting that the example of China is used, because one of the only agreements BioNTech has to voluntarily share its technology is with Fosun in China.  I do not know where this threat or risk from China suddenly comes from if BioNTech actually shares its technology with a Chinese company.  China is, by the way, one of the only countries that has the ability to lift and get access to trade secrets out of public interest.  BioNTech did it voluntarily despite that risk being there.  It does not jeopardise any voluntary agreement.  That is the first aspect on China.</p> <p>  The second aspect is that China is not happy with being forced out of the Quad text because that is what it actually entails.  China is forced out of using that text but it has said that it is not interested in using it.  Lately, it has been commenting that it voluntary wants to opt out of using that text, will say it is not interested in the use of the text and will form a licence as well.  The issue of China is not at all a serious concern for us in that respect.  However, we support the idea that any country that wants to use this text, or the waiver that will potentially come at the end of the process, should have the text available to it because any country is at risk of the pandemic.  It is of shared interest to have this option available.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Connor said 10 billion doses had been administered and the "speed of Covid-19 vaccines production is outpacing their administration".  There seems to be a contradiction there in that the need, according to Oxfam, etc., is for 15 billion doses for this year.  Does Mr. O'Connor agree with that?</p></speech>

We have not said that the entire demand has already been met.  Clearly, it has not been met in Africa and globally.  Clearly, the companies producing different types of vaccines are continuing to produce at great pace and scale.  We are confident demand can be met.  What is clear is that the capacity to administer the production so far, at this point, is not there.  That is why Africa CDC has asked for a pause.  Certainly the need is there.  African countries and the centres for disease control and prevention, CDC, are estimating and making their own calculations about the best way to roll it out and how they should prioritise within their own countries to meet that need.  Their advice is now to prioritise older people in Africa.  There is not that much of a contradiction in the numbers.</p></speech>

However, the Oxfam figure singles out the supply of mRNA vaccines because they are most effective and are easier to adapt to variants.  They are most effective when it comes to Omicron and that is what the number refers to.  What we also have to bear in mind is whether we are prepared for a potential next wave.  Are we prepared for new inequities when new, more potent vaccines adapted to new variants arrive?  If a new wave of variants comes, we are not there.  We will have the same inequity all over again if we do not address the structural issues.  That is the point of discussion today.</p></speech>

In some ways, I feel bad that I have had three vaccines at this stage while, during a global pandemic, many millions have had none.  I feel guilty about that.  As of December 2021, only 27% of healthcare workers on the African continent had been fully vaccinated.  The public money invested in vaccine development is estimated at approximately &euro;93 billion.  In December 2021, the Seanad passed a motion calling on the Government to publicly support and lobby the European Commission to support a TRIPS waiver.</p> <p>  With regard to the innovation of vaccines, is it not the case that public and political concern and public funding was key to the innovation of Covid-19 vaccines?  If that was the driving force, where is the public benefit of it globally?  Legal and IP scholars have argued that the TRIPS waiver is a necessary and proportionate legal measure for clearing IP barriers to facilitate increased supply of Covid-19 vaccines and other health technologies.  In these circumstances, is it not the case that high-income countries will continue to be markets for innovation regardless of the TRIPS waiver?  Is it not also the case that innovation of HIV-AIDS drugs continued after generic production was allowed in low-income countries?</p> <p>  It is not as if we have not been very successful, thanks to big pharma, governments and public funding.  We all know what happened with the HIV and AIDS epidemic.  The pharmaceutical industry rolled out similar talking points to the ones the witnesses have been providing today, but allowing generic production of HIV-AIDS medicines was what it took to get increased production, lower prices and millions of lives saved.  On a very simple scale, looking at what we did around AIDS in terms of what big pharma and public funding did, I do not understand why we are not doing the same here.</p> <p>  Vaccine manufacturing projections include vaccines that are not as effective as mRNA vaccines.  Why should low-income countries accept vaccines with lower effectiveness when the people of Ireland are no longer using them?  I was kind of on the fence about this a while back but I trust Tr&oacute;caire, Oxfam and Amnesty Ireland.  These are organisations that are work with developing countries all the time.  Big pharma does not do so, and nor do I.  I trust these organisations.  If they are asking for this, maybe it is time we listened.  Maybe we and big pharma do not know best.  It is brilliant that the pharmaceutical companies came up with the vaccines, thanks to public funding, and rolled them out successfully in some countries.  However, can we put our hands on our hearts and say we are doing right by everybody globally?  It is very unfair.  There is already such a struggle for clean water and to meet basic human rights.  We know we can turn this around.  We have done it with AIDS.</p></speech>

We are constantly being bombarded with messages that it is too complex, too difficult and cannot be done or that it will collapse the entire global system, medicines will never be developed again and the world will not benefit.  The Senator's example is the perfect example of what was done about HIV and AIDS.</p><p>After many years of campaigning by Oxfam, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF, and many others, the world forced the global pharmaceutical industry to allow general production.  After the loss of millions who should not have died, it transformed the lives of millions more and still does to this day.  That is an example of how these things can work.  The suggestion here is that if there is an agreement on TRIPS, it will collapse the system in future.  It is important to remember that TRIPS is part of the rules-based system.  It is built into the agreement and is there for a reason.  This is the reason.  We have an extraordinary, once-in-a-generation health crisis.  We have the tools available to us to create a temporary waiver.  It is important to remember that the waiver described is temporary.  It can transform the production and roll-out of vaccines for the rest of the world, while those of us sitting comfortably here have been vaccinated.</p><p> There is no strong counterargument to stand up to that.  The examples given prove that it works.  We can do it and support developing countries in the roll-out.  As Dr. Kelly mentioned, we have seen just how effective developing countries are at rolling out vaccines.  I worked on vaccine distribution in remote parts of rural South Sudan.  People queued for days.  There is a significant appetite.  The hesitancy is no stronger than it is anywhere else in the world.  We need to address these issues.  The tools and the solution are staring us in the face.  It is time for Ireland and the EU to move their position to support the TRIPS waiver so that everybody who needs to be vaccinated can be and we can finally start to bring this pandemic to an end.</p></speech>

We respectfully disagree on the role of IP in the solution.  The solution and desired outcome is for people's health to be protected, with a vaccination for those who need and want it around the world.  Our industry is doing everything it can, as evidenced by the production, to deliver that.  Our fundamental point remains, that a change to the TRIPS waiver is a change to the rules set up after the discussions on HIV.  It changes the rules to IP protections.  In some people's eyes, it would change the rules for everything, including production processes, the formula for the vaccine, therapeutics and so on.  If the public sector, State and international organisations want and choose to proceed on that basis in the future, they are entitled to do so, but it changes the rules.  We have not used words like "collapse".</p> <p>  We brought forward evidence from the European Patent Office.  There has been a 37% drop in investments in this area.  We think the rule change will have an effect.  We caution that the idea that IP protections are a barrier to vaccination being made available is simply incorrect.  Fundamentally, we want vaccinations to be developed.  From my point of view, I can see how many companies will think twice about the level of investment they put into what is a risky venture on their part if they are told they will not have any rights to their production processes, formulation or anything else if they do this.</p></speech>

I understand that big pharma makes a lot of money on many things.  Vaccines are not their big win.  I do not know if it is fair to say that these will become generic products and the IP will be sorted out.  We all know that big pharma makes money from many different drugs.  It does not rely on vaccines to make profits.  Am I correct that Mr. O'Connor said the rules changed since the issues with HIV and AIDS?  Did we have to change the rules to address AIDS?  I am not clear on that point.  I do not buy into the fact that big pharma might not want to produce vaccines if it has to relinquish the IP.</p></speech>

The TRIPS agreement was adopted in 1995.  It is a WTO framework that sets out minimum standards.  Prior to that, some countries had abolished patent systems for pharmaceuticals.  Other countries did not have them.  They had different effects.  The TRIPS waiver required minimum standards.  The Doha declaration was a direct acknowledgement of the need to take into account public health issues when considering IP rights.  Paragraph 4 of the declaration highlights that intellectual property rights should not be used in a way that would damage public health.  That is built into the TRIPS agreement.  If adopted, the waiver has to be negotiated and discussed with the WTO states.  It can only be adopted subject to the WTO rules.  That is built into the system.  It is a temporary waiver.  The TRIPS framework has always provided for waivers.  The Doha declaration was a waiver itself.  This would be no different.</p> <p>  We have to be careful about what the waiver would do.  Much would depend on how it is negotiated, whether a text is adopted and what happens in that context.  The waiver originally proposed by India and South Africa was a comprehensive waiver, but it was a temporary suspension of IP rights.  The other important point is that it would suspend such rights at the TRIPS level, so states would not have to comply with TRIPS requirements if they so wished.  However, it is likely that many states like Ireland and other high-income countries with access to Covid-19 vaccines and other health technologies, thankfully, would not need recourse to that waiver.  The effect of the waiver is likely that it would be used by lower-income countries.  It may have impacts, but it will not necessarily have impacts in high-income countries.  As Senator Garvey pointed out, precedents for this exist.  Antiretroviral drugs are made on a generic basis.  Medicines Patent Pool makes products on a generic basis, primarily for lower-income countries.  There are different markets in high-income countries.  It is important to see it in that context.</p></speech>

I acknowledge what Mr. O'Connor said, but it is important that we all accept that there will always be resistance from industry to the changing of rules.  We see this with the corporate tax rate.  The Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association made comments about resisting changes to the 12.5% rate.  It is only when state actors make decisions such as the Clinton Administration on HIV medication the 1990s that we see radical change.  While we can ask the IPHA and the pharmaceutical industry to step up to the mark, change only happens when our Government, the European Union and other global actors make decisions.</p> <p>  Much has been made of how future innovation will be threatened by a TRIPS waiver, yet we understand that on foot of the breakthrough in South Africa, which is an mRNA hub, patents were lodged to effectively scupper the roll-out of the generic vaccine developed there.</p><p>Aggressive tactics were used by pharmaceutical companies to block the South African experiment.  I ask the contributors to go into detail about what happened in that instance and I ask the IPHA to also comment. </p></speech>

Faced with a lack of access to Covid-19 vaccines the WHO, together with a consortium in South Africa, developed a manufacturing and technology transfer hub.  The idea was to produce Covid-19 mRNA vaccines and, potentially, use the technology afterwards for other diseases.  That initiative asked two pharmaceuticals, BioNTech-Pfizer and Moderna, that use mRNA technology and have a product on the market, to share their technology and the rights with the initiative so they could set up a production network with different companies in Africa - so not only in South Africa but in other African countries - and share their technology and teach people how to use, produce and develop these vaccines.  Moderna and BioNTech-Pfizer refused to share their technology, data and production knowledge.  As a result the hub, in particular Afrigen, which is a small or medium-sized enterprise in South Africa, started together with the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg to re-engineer the Moderna vaccine and see whether they could develop and produce a vaccine.  Against the odds and expectations within six months they have succeeded in producing a test patch, which looks quite good, but now they will go into clinical trials, and this is another issue.  The fact that data is not openly shared means that this whole production process and clinical trial on whether this product is safe and effective now must be done again, which already exists if Moderna or BioNTech-Pfizer had shared some of their technology and data.  This will cost a lot of time and money but the reality will be that there will be independent production.  Moderna has three patents on mRNA technology in South Africa so they can block the initiative at any time when they start to produce the vaccines.</p></speech>

On the broader point, I have been the chief executive of the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association since January 2015 and in that time we have never issued a statement that resists Government policy on corporation tax at 12.5% and so on.  We work with the Government in that respect and we have not been resisters in that sense.  We have always worked closely with the Government to encourage investment in the country and successfully so.  I am sure that goes for our colleagues in BioPharmaChem Ireland.</p> <p>  On the question about specific actions and instances, I am not briefed on that and I do not have responsibility in this area.  I cannot answer for the actions of particular companies here today.  I would say that some companies have invested large amounts of their capital that they raised, which was not in their plans two and a half years ago.  If it is the case that the rules or the environment changes where the entirety of that investment and the entirely of their manufacturing capability to deliver medicines and vaccines globally in this respect is to be shared and given for nothing then one has to consider the following.  If that is what the public authorities want then that is fine and it is a policy that one can choose.  However, if we were running the circumstance again, and there is no doubt that there will be another pandemic at some point, can one expect those companies to engage in the same type and level of investment with their capital at risk if they have the level of uncertainty about the intellectual property rights that will govern that investment after it is done?  That is simply the question that we would ask the committee and the Government to consider.  Our answer is clearly "No".  We believe that there would be a diminution, to put it in the most neutral word, in the capacity and willingness of companies to make the investment and make their processes available for anyone else around the world to take.  That is our position.</p></speech>

I am open to correction but I feel sure that the Department of Finance has received letters that highlight the fears of the IPHA member companies unless the 12.5% rate exists.</p> <p>  The submission mentions six ways to achieve the goal global vaccine equity.  It reads that there should be more charity from developed countries and more vaccine sharing.  Is that really the IPHA vision for developing countries?  What message is sent by saying that we are prepared to deprive developing countries the capacity to build up their own resilience?  I expect that the industry will say that one must protect one's own interests.  As the industry has benefited greatly from public finance in developing these vaccines then the pharmaceutical industry must step up to the mark, make a very significant contribution and ensure that capacity and resilience is built up in developing countries to withstand the current pandemic.</p></speech>

We will work in partnership with countries and companies globally to develop capacity to manufacture, voluntary licensing arrangements and so on.  We are absolutely not against the development of Africa's capability to manufacture vaccines.  In fact, we are very much in favour of that.</p></speech>

I am not saying that the industry is hesitant or hostile to doing the right thing  but we all know what the right thing is, which is to ensure there are vaccines and treatments.  Let us not forget the treatments because there is a danger that we will focus all of our energy and efforts on vaccines and the train has moved on because increasingly treatments are being spoken about.</p> <p>  In terms of the change of rules, Mr. O'Connor has said that the change in rules will have an impact.  Of course they will.  I know that, everyone seated in this room knows that and anyone watching this discussion knows that.  Mr. O'Connor called it a change in rules and Professor McMahon described it as not so much a change in rules but a temporary suspension of them.  I can see Mr. O'Connor nodding.  A temporary suspension is a change but it is not a change in rules.  Mr. O'Connor said that there will be an impact.  Is there a potential for the impact to be very positive?  Will the impact move the figures that we have looked at?  We all agree that the figure is too low and I refer to the 1% of people in low-income countries who are boosted compared with 60% here.  Is there a chance that 1% could move closer to 60%?  If so, would that not be a very good thing?  If everything stays as it is then we are dealing with the figures whereby 13% of the people in low-income countries have received two doses compared with 75% of people in high-income countries.  That is not good and the situation must change.  If change involves a changing of the rules, as described by Mr. O'Connor or what Professor McMahon has described as a temporary suspension of the rules with some of those to be negotiated at the level of each individual State, is that not a good thing?</p></speech>

We agree that we want to see vaccines developed, produced and delivered to the people who need them in Africa and globally.</p><p>The issue is finding the most effective way to do that.  We believe, and the evidence so far supports this - that the IP rights, such as they are without a waiver, are not acting as a barrier to the production to sufficient capacity in time to meet demand, given the capacity locally in many countries to administer vaccines.  The industry will continue to do that.</p></speech>

I know it is not intended that way, but it is verging on the disrespectful to say that low rates of vaccination are caused by a lack of infrastructure, or whatever.   There is absolutely no disputing the fact that people in low- to middle-income countries want the vaccines and the treatment.  When I say "vaccines", I mean both.  These countries want the vaccines, so they will make it happen.  Surely Mr. O'Connor would agree that in circumstances where they are facilitated, they will make it happen.  It is not just something that people in low- to middle-income countries want, but something that they absolutely need.  If we leave things as they are, we are all sitting here and saying that the 1% figure for people who are boosted is grand.  We cannot say that.  We all agree.  At the start of this, I said that nobody is safe until everybody is safe, and everybody nodded.  We all established that.  However, it is just a slogan if we cannot put a bit of weight behind it.  It strikes me that the capacity can be there.  I am aware that the issue has been spoken about.  I will give other contributors a chance to speak on it as well.  If we do not change the rules, or temporarily suspend them, is it not the same as saying that we accept that things will change?  The experience from HIV-AIDS is that nothing changed, to any substantial extent, until the technology and the drugs became more freely available.  With the greatest of respect, all of the available evidence supports making a change.  All of the available evidence suggests that if we do nothing, we will stay where we are, which is not where any of us want to be.  If we are going to put some weight behind, and meat on the bones of, the idea that nobody is safe until everybody is safe, surely there has to be some form of a change that is different from how things have been done up to now.  The way things have been done up to now has resulted in the figures that we all agree are unacceptable.</p></speech>

With great respect to members of the committee, the facts are that there are more vaccines produced than the African countries can currently accept.  That has been said by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, not us.  That is the evidence for the position we hold at the moment.  If they were crying out for more to be delivered and the industry was not delivering, that would be a different case all together.  However, that is not the case at the moment.  Where we are right now is that the level of production is there.  The industry will continue to develop and increase that level of production so that demand can be met.  On the question of changing the rules, we think it is a change of the rules, obviously.  It certainly changes the environment.  That affects the environment for investment in the future, as well as the environment for the current production.  They are distinct issues to discuss and debate.  The future is something to be thought about very carefully in terms of whether we will see the solutions emerge, in any event.  It is up to public policymakers to make their choice on that and to have whatever risk tolerance they want for that.  My point is that it is very difficult to expect companies to invest, on a constant basis, in their capacity to manufacture and deliver vaccines and medicines on a global basis, with all the regulatory requirements and quality control environments needed, if we are going to change the rules suddenly in respect of a large amount of investment and in respect of every aspect of the production which they have invested in over many years.</p></speech>

I agree it is really important that we think about the need for change.  Production has been an issue all the way through this, and it will be an issue again.  We may have a new variant of SARS-CoV-2.  We may have a completely new virus that is capable of causing a pandemic.  The chances of that are probably going to increase over time.  Climate change, urbanisation and global mobility are all increasing the risk of a new viral pandemic.  The current model that we have, whereby bilateral agreements between governments and the pharmaceutical industry are prioritised and leftover supplies are given to those with lower buying power, has to change.  It will change eventually.  The question for us is whether we want to do it sooner rather than later.  I feel that Ireland is in a really good position to stand up and take leadership on that now.  We have to drive forward a new global vaccination distribution model that is centrally based and clinically prioritised.  With the current model, pandemics will go on for longer and more people will die.  Global health security is at risk.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.120" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Aisling McMahon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022051100002#M00900"><p>I wish to respond and add to some of the points just made.  Most people would agree that the current TRIPS <i>status quo</i>model has really failed low- and middle-income countries not just in the context of Covid-19 but also in other contexts, such as infectious diseases like malaria and other diseases where the incentives for innovation do not necessarily match the health need.  On the question of current supplies, it is true that there are more supplies at the moment.  That is a very good and positive thing.  However, the difficulty is that when we look back at this, we see that in 2020 and 2021 when we were at the height of Covid-19, vaccines were being distributed on the basis of bilateral deals, not necessarily on the basis of health need.  That is exactly how the TRIPS framework is set up.  The problem, as Dr. Kelly has pointed out, is that if we have a new variant, the same is very likely to happen.  The other issue is that even though there may be more vaccines in some states, as we have already discussed, many low- and middle-income countries want the ability to make their own vaccines so that they can have a secure and stable supply.  Charity and donations do not do that.  Indeed, many activists in the global south have highlighted that countries do not necessarily want to rely on charity or donations.  They have their place.  It is important to recognise the contribution of COVAX in the short term, in particular, but COVAX charity donations just do not provide long-term sustainable supply.  The other point that we should be clear on is that Covid-19 is a global pandemic.  It is probably the worst health crisis that we have faced in our lifetime, in terms of its global impact.  The TRIPS waiver is being discussed in that context, and in a context where voluntary mechanisms such as C-TAP were suggested by the WHO.  Sadly, they did not have enough support from states and industry to be successful.  It is in that context that we are discussing mandatory solutions like the waiver.  Let us be clear, IP is not the only issue.  There are other issues as well.  However, if we do not address the IP obstacles, we will not have those other solutions.  That is what I would add.</p></speech>

It is just not a feasible model.  We need a stronger and more effective model.  I want to go back to the principle that we are discussing here, which is basically to provide governments with the tools available to protect their populations in the middle of a pandemic.  It is about telling them that they have the freedom to operate and produce the tools they need to protect their people.  I hear, from the industry side, that there is a change of rules.  Let us go back for a moment.  What happened 20 years ago was that patent rights could be overruled with compulsory licensing.  That principle was already there.  As Professor McMahon explained, it was there in the Doha declaration and the TRIPS agreement.  What happened afterwards was that the industry started to push for other tools to protect its intellectual property, by protecting the data related to the products and protecting the trade secrets on how to produce certain complex products etc., in addition to the patents, which was not so much the case 20 years ago.  There was a change in the rules that happened over those 20 years, with additional protections.  These are exactly the barriers we are discussing today with the TRIPS waiver.  We are saying that compulsory licensing is a valuable tool, but it falls short because there are other elements that have been added over the course of the 20 years that make it more and more difficult to reproduce some of these medicines when they are needed.  That is where a waiver for a certain period of time will cut through the red tape.  Countries will be able to produce and supply the medicines, and import and export any tools and raw materials as well.  The issue of raw materials has been brought up.  It also falls under the same category.  The waiver will resolve the raw materials issue as well.  </p></speech>

Perhaps "prioritised" is the wrong word but there is no disputing the facts and the evidence on the levels of vaccination.  If that is repeated in respect of the level of treatment, we will see low- to middle-income countries fall even further behind.  That is not a space any of us should be looking to get into.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Clarken.  There is a view we should not be having this discussion here and that it is not a matter for the Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I think it is, but sure what would I know about it.  Our witnesses are the experts.  Perhaps they might be able to enlighten us on this.  It is up to the Chair and I again thank him for facilitating this debate.  On where this issue now goes, where does the decision lie with Government?  Who is the senior and chief decision-maker and to whom should we be speaking if we are persuaded that a change in rules, a temporary suspension or whatever might be a good idea?</p></speech>

Before I get to that answer, on this constant referring to the big threat to pharma created by this, the reality is that pharma has never seen profits like it has seen in recent years, and many new billionaires have been created in the pharma industry.  While it did extraordinary work and everybody wants to give the credit for it, the idea that somehow this temporary waiver which we keep reiterating, which is a waiver based within a rules-based system that already exists, will somehow greatly and detrimentally damage pharma and the development of medications into the future is just not believable, to be perfectly honest.  I give tremendous credit to the industry to adapt, evolve, move within the spaces that are there, and make profits, because is what it does.  There is nothing wrong with that.  Let us just not keep knocking that one back that it will somehow lead to devastation of the industry.  It will not.</p> <p>  On the question that this must be on a human rights and health needs basis rather than some charitable act where, when we are ready to provide vaccines to poorer countries, we will, we know what happened at the start of this.  Wealthy countries raced to push others out of the way to get as many vaccines as they could, even fighting among themselves, let alone with countries in the global south.  We cannot have a system that allows that to happen again because everybody will be affected.</p> <p>  Let us remember that even from a self-interest point of view, which should not be the way we think about these things, the longer this goes on, the greater the possibility of new variants arising and the more it will affect everybody.  Even economically, if that is the way one wants to look at it, the International Chamber of Commerce reckons that $9.2 trillion is going to be lost because of the pandemic and because of our inability to get our hands around it fast enough.  This will roll on and on.  The countries we are talking about are vital countries for us and for the world.  I am just putting that argument, which would not be of our core argument, just to put it out there.</p> <p>  On this issue, Ireland has traditionally shown tremendous leadership and courage.  We were speaking to our colleagues at the UN Security Council earlier this week about the work they are doing in pushing into very difficult spaces and trying to resolve issues by using the Irish moral standing and respect the country has across the world to push agenda items.  Here is another one where Ireland can make a difference.  We know it is a European decision, but to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s question directly, it will be decided by the trade element of Government, and in this case the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, will be the representative in that space.  This is the right place as far as we are concerned to be discussing this issue and I know the Chair appreciates that.</p> <p>  We emphasise that if every country sits back and waits for this to happen, it will not happen.  Ireland can make a difference, is very credible, has deservedly built up this very strong reputation, has sacrificed as a result of it and is willing to do so.  We plead with the committee to urge the Minister and the Government to make a decision to support the TRIPS waiver or the elements to it that are essential in order for vaccines to be created locally to give that autonomy of supply to ensure the rest of the world will be vaccinated.  There is no doubt in my mind that we will be waiting for years if we are to continue on the current basis.  We have a solution.  It is not perfect but we know it can work.  We have the examples of what happened in the past where a transformation can be made when the political courage is there.  We plead with the committee and the Government to move, to agree to the TRIPS waiver and to bring its voice to the table in Europe to try to have it change its position also.</p></speech>

On the final point as to whether we are the correct committee to deal with this, I note the Department has issued a note stating we may not be.  Perhaps our secretariat could check that out.  I believe the Department is saying it is the Committee on Health that should be dealing with this, which is somewhat frustrating if that is the case.</p> <p>  I also refer to the letter from Africa, which has been referred to more than once, mentioning that delivery be stalled.  That seems to be on a separate track to the production and availability because that leads to what we discussed earlier about hesitancy, supply lines and so forth, which needs to be sorted out in any event.  Would it be in order, Chairman, for a copy of that letter to be sent to the committee?</p> <p>  It has also been said that there are 100 experienced manufacturers all over the world who say they can start manufacturing the generic versions.  It would also be useful for us to get a list of those various manufacturers and locations.</p></speech>

We are inviting the committee to consider that a change in incentives or in intellectual property rights may cause a change in the likelihood of capital being invested to invent, create, deliver, manufacture and provide vaccines and other medicine solutions in pandemic situations.  We have as evidence a study by the European Patents Office, EPO, to show that in its view and analysis there would be a diminution, and quite a serious one, in investment in this area.  We work very closely in every country and in every medicine to deliver human health.  If we do not deliver human health, there is no business for pharmaceutical companies.  In that respect, we support and deliver human rights.  There is no opposition within the pharmaceutical industry to human rights or to human health.  We are not in the business of raising barriers to the delivery of healthcare solutions here in Ireland or globally, and we want to work on that.</p> <p>  To answer Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s question, we are certainly not saying that everything should stay the same.  There will have to be new solutions, but we invite members to consider the critical role of intellectual property rights in the discovery, development, production and delivery of the solutions we seek to massive healthcare problems at all times and to be very careful about protecting those rights.  I have heard it mentioned that there is no incentive for malaria or that it is insufficient.  Our principal point is that if you diminish incentives, you will diminish the results that you are seeking to achieve.  That is very important.</p> <p>  That is our position and we hope we are being respectful and are not exaggerating, and we are certainly not threatening anyone.  We want to be involved in human health.  We are, I believe, and we have certainly been involved in the delivery of new solutions and in the development and delivery globally of vaccines and therapies for Covid-19.</p></speech>

I can give a concrete example.  Pfizer has in fact lobbied on the Covid-19 Bill, as it has also been described in the media.  It is applying for patents worldwide and has signed a voluntary agreement for generic production, which is good for certain countries.  The supply at Pfizer itself has been bought up almost until the end of the year.  Half of the world does not have access to the generic production.  That means this other half of the world has almost no access to any supply at all.  That is very problematic, obviously, for a disease that is so lethal at this stage and is still being widely transmitted.</p><p>I can give another example of a Roche drug that is given to severe Covid-19 patients.  There is a severe lack of supply.  M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res tried for several months to place an order with Roche and never succeeded so we did not get access to the treatments because of a lack of supply.  Where it is available, it is over $700 per treatment in India, which is a huge amount for people there to pay.  I could go on for a list of treatments and vaccines.  That is one element.  The case is there.  It is definitely needed.  We are 100% certain of that.</p><p> I disagree with the lack of incentives.  There is no discussion about lack of incentives.  There are more discussions about future incentives so I do not think there is any risk in that regard.  Negotiations have also gone forward.  Discussions are materialising within the WTO about a potential outcome.  Unfortunately, the discussion that is on the table is a completely watered down version of the original TRIPS waiver that is very weak and not very effective and puts at risk some of the public health safeguards referred to by Professor McMahon.  We are particularly concerned about it.  We call for Ireland to support the original TRIPS waiver, in particular to ensure that the essential elements of it are maintained throughout the negotiations.</p></speech>

I disagree regarding the incentive intellectual property represents.  Traditionally, it has been problematic in the vaccine context for various reasons.  More broadly, while intellectual property rights exist, other human rights also exist.  Many UN committees have already considered the impact of lack of access to vaccines on low- and middle-income countries.  Many of them have highlighted that we also have the right to health and life and we also have a duty to co-operate at an international level.  Many of those committees have highlighted that companies and states should not block a comprehensive waiver if there are global access issues in this context and there are.</p> <p>  At the international level, we see the human rights obligations that companies and states have.  In 2021, the International Commission of Jurists, a group of over 85 experts, highlighted that states that continue to block a comprehensive global waiver are in breach of several of their obligations under various international human rights treaties that go beyond intellectual property rights.  We have obligations under the WTO at an intellectual property level but we also have human rights obligations, which we are likely to continue to be in breach of by not supporting a waiver and certainly by obstructing discussions in this context.  It is important to also recognise those issues in this context.</p></speech>

My colleagues Mr. Cullen and Mr. Sheridan are from our income tax and indirect tax units, respectively.</p> <p>  We are meeting at a time of unprecedented uncertainty and economic volatility.  As well as the ongoing humanitarian crisis, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has created a large supply side shock that has shaken the global economy, with European economies at the epicentre.  Given Russia's outsized role in global energy supply, oil and gas prices have risen sharply in recent months.  As Ireland is a global price taker, this has fed through to higher energy prices for businesses and households.</p> <p>  It is important we give some context to the current inflationary environment.  The emergence of inflationary pressures contrasts markedly with the relatively low inflation we experienced for the guts of the past decade.  In Ireland, inflation averaged at 0.5% between 2010 and 2019 and at 1.5% in the euro area.  Initially, the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated this low inflation environment.  As the decline in demand in 2020 outstripped the fall in supply, Ireland's inflation turned negative, reaching something like -0.5%.</p> <p>  While consumer price inflation remained subdued in Ireland in the first quarter of last year, the annual rate of inflation picked up sharply thereafter, with both domestic and global factors behind the increase.  These included a recovery in energy prices from their lows in 2020 - we call these base effects - as well as global supply chain disruptions, supply side bottlenecks and pent-up demand.  To address this, budget 2022 in October contained an income tax package to the value of &euro;520 million.  This involved increases in the standard rate band and key personal tax credits.  On the expenditure side, a social welfare package worth approximately &euro;560 million was introduced, as were a range of other measures, including health and childcare supports, aimed at mitigating the cost of living.  At the time of budget 2022, inflationary pressures were expected to ease over the course of the winter and throughout this year.  However, higher than anticipated energy prices throughout last winter resulted in higher than expected inflation in the winter and into early spring.</p> <p>  The war in Ukraine has served to exacerbate inflationary pressures further.  Inflation stood at 7.25% in April, which was the highest rate since the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, series began in 1997.  This is a trend we are seeing in all advanced economies.  In the euro area, inflation reached 7.5% in April.  Today, the US reported that its inflation rate had reduced to 8.3% in April from 8.5% in March.  The rates in the UK have been similar.</p> <p>  Higher energy and commodity prices are expected to continue feeding into higher inflation over the coming months.  As set out in the stability programme update, SPU, in late April and based on market prices at the time of the forecast, inflation is expected to remain elevated in the near term, peaking in the second quarter of this year and averaging at approximately 6.25% for the year as a whole.  Pass-through price effects are also expected in other sectors such as food through higher prices for energy and fertilisers - the latter is a by-product of higher energy prices itself - and consumer goods and services, also through higher energy prices and transport costs, with core inflation of approximately 4% projected for the year.  A significant easing is anticipated next year, with the headline rate projected to be approximately 3% for 2023 as a whole.  In fact, energy prices, while still expected to stay high, are expected to ease next year.</p> <p>  Higher energy and commodity prices will erode the real incomes of households while also denting the margins of firms.  This, alongside heightened uncertainty, will dampen consumer spending and private sector investment this year.  In this manner, inflation will act as a headwind against output growth.  As a result, we have revised downwards our forecast for modified domestic demand growth &ndash; our main indicator of economic activity &ndash; by approximately two and a quarter percentage points this year, with growth of 4.25% being forecast.</p> <p>  These projections were produced against a backdrop of exceptional uncertainty.  As such, risks to the forecast are considerable and firmly tilted to the down side.  In light of this, we also published a scenario analysis in the SPU in which wholesale oil and gas prices returned to their early March levels &ndash; indeed, slightly higher &ndash; and remained elevated relative to the baseline throughout this year.  Gas prices in this scenario are 75% above the baseline projection and oil prices are approximately 50% higher.  In this scenario, inflation would be two percentage points higher this year at 8.25% &ndash; peaking at 9.25% in the third quarter &ndash; and one and a quarter percentage points higher next year at 4.25%.  Of course, the energy price shock would not only affect inflation and would also have broader macroeconomic implications.  Output in the domestic economy would be approximately 2% lower over the medium term and the budget surplus of in or around &euro;1.2 billion for next year would be wiped out.</p> <p>  I will outline the Government's more recent response to increases in energy prices from a taxation perspective, and my colleagues from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will speak about expenditure measures.  In early March, the Government approved a VAT-inclusive reduction in excise duty of 20 cent per litre on petrol, 15 cent per litre on diesel and 2 cent per litre on marked gas oil, MGO, amounting to &euro;320 million.  Further measures were announced in mid-April, including a reduction in the VAT rate for electricity and gas to 9% from 1 May until the end of October, which should result in estimated annual savings of &euro;49 on gas bills and &euro;69 on electricity bills for households.  The cost of this measure is estimated at &euro;46 million.  There was also a further VAT-inclusive reduction of 3 cent per litre on MGO from 1 May and an extension of the reduction in excise duties on MGO, auto diesel and petrol to mid-October, with a combined cost just shy of &euro;100 million.</p> <p>  Overall, including the expenditure measures that colleagues from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will shortly outline, cost-of-living measures announced since the budget amount to just over &euro;1 billion on top of the roughly &euro;1.1 billion in measures announced in budget 2022.</p></speech>

Budget 2022 set out an expenditure allocation of &euro;87.6 billion for investment in public services.  This allocation was made in line with the medium-term expenditure strategy, which sets out core expenditure growth of approximately 5% on average over the period to 2025.  A &euro;1.2 billion package of expenditure measures was announced to support citizens across a range of sectors with cost-of-living pressures.  Some of the headline measures were increases in social protection payments, including weekly working age and pension payments, the living alone allowance, qualified child increase and fuel allowance; health affordability measures; funding for social and affordable housing; and enhanced student and childcare supports.</p> <p>  Analysis was undertaken using the ESRI's simulation welfare and income tax changes, SWITCH, tax and benefit model to illustrate the impact of the budget.  The combination of tax and expenditure measures was progressive in nature, with households in the lowest income deciles seeing the strongest gains.</p> <p>  The economic and social context has changed considerably since the announcement of budget 2022 in October.  The emergence of this new set of challenges, including rising energy prices and the humanitarian response to the war in Ukraine, has resulted in a number of budgetary developments.  Since December 2021, in the region of &euro;560 million in additional expenditure measures has been put in place to support citizens and businesses with increased costs.  A number of these measures build on supports put in place in budget 2022.</p> <p>  I will set out a summary of the main measures.  An energy credit payment automatically applied to the electricity bill of all domestic account holders to assist with rising energy costs.  This will benefit more than 2 million households at an Exchequer expenditure cost of just under &euro;380 million.  In addition to the &euro;5 per week increase in fuel allowance payments introduced in the budget, a further two lump sum payments totalling &euro;225, paid in March and in mid-May, will benefit more than 370,000 households.  Budget 2022 announced an increase of &euro;10 in the weekly income threshold for the working family payment.  The implementation of this increase was brought forward from April to June.  A further reduction from &euro;100 to &euro;80 in the monthly payment threshold for the drugs payment scheme was also introduced.  This will reduce medicine and drug costs for more than 70,000 recipients.  A temporary 20% reduction in public service obligation, PSO, public transport fares until the end of 2022 was introduced to reduce the financial burden on commuters returning to the workplace.  The estimated cost of this is &euro;54 million.  The maximum annual school transport charge was reduced to &euro;150 per family at primary level and &euro;500 per family at post-primary level for the next academic year.</p><p>A temporary and targeted emergency grant scheme for licensed hauliers provides a payment of &euro;100 per week for licensed heavy goods vehicles for a period of eight weeks.  This scheme reflects the vital role hauliers play in the supply chain.  The estimated cost is &euro;18 million.</p><p> Turning to the impact of construction inflation on public works projects, a number of changes were introduced in January to address price volatility.  These changes were made to contracting arrangements for new contracts to ameliorate challenges arising from inflationary pressures deriving from the pandemic.  Based on extensive feedback from Departments and owing to further constraints on supply chains and increased fuel and energy prices arising out of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, yesterday announced the introduction of an inflation co-operation framework for those parties engaged under public works contracts.  This seeks to address the impacts of the most recent onset of exceptional inflation and supply chain disruption.</p><p> The Revised Estimates 2022 set out an overall Government expenditure ceiling of &euro;87.6 billion.  This is inclusive of an unallocated contingency reserve of &euro;3.9 billion.  At this stage, approximately &euro;1.5 billion of the reserve has been committed, taking into account the increased Covid-related supports introduced in response to the December wave of the virus, and additional funding required for the cost-of-living measures I have outlined.  Furthermore, there will also be calls on the contingency reserve in the coming months in the context of any additional Covid-related expenditure, in particular as we enter the winter period, and for the provision of humanitarian supports to refugees arriving from Ukraine.  A Supplementary Estimate for Vote 29 - Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, was brought before the D&aacute;il in March.  Further Supplementary Estimates may be required later this year to provide for the measures I have set out.</p><p> The series of recently introduced measures to support households with cost of living pressures comes at a time of significant additional expenditure to mitigate the impacts of Covid-19.  The public finances are in a stronger position than this time last year, with Covid-19 related supports being unwound and tax revenue increasing.  However, risks to the fiscal position remain.  Borrowing since the beginning of the pandemic has increased, with gross general government debt of &euro;234 billion forecast for 2022 compared with &euro;204 billion at the end of 2019.  In this context, Government has sought to implement measures which strike a balance between delivering targeted support, capable of timely implementation and are temporary in nature to ensure that our public finances remain on a sustainable trajectory and avoid actions that could result in further inflation.  I thank members for this opportunity to speak with the committee.  We look forward to answering questions.</p></speech>

I have two questions.  They relate to a couple of pieces I was reading about France.  In the context of the offsets by the Government, my layman's interpretation is that if you throw money at an economy during an inflationary period in terms of wages and things like that, it just helps to drive up the cost of living if the relevant measures are not targeted.  I advise our guests the cost of living is significantly impacting on constituents of mine, as it is on those of all my colleagues.  I read an interesting article about France.  The country was in election mode, but that does not matter.  The article stated: "A decision last year to limit the amount by which France&rsquo;s largely state-owned energy companies could raise prices has benefited consumers and taken some of the inflationary pressure off industries that depend on gas and electricity."  The article also points to the fact that the electricity component of inflation in France has risen by 4% in the past 12 months but by an average of more than 27% in the eurozone generally.  France obviously took a measure there.  It could not ban an increase in energy prices by the energy suppliers but it did bring in a regulation that restricted the amount by which the suppliers could raise their prices.  My first question relates to whether those options open to Ministers here.  The officials may come back and say that France has had other problems, with other costs of living skyrocketing too.</p> <p>  Another piece I read recently also relates to France.  Macron has won the election and must deliver on some promises.  I am interested in the following concept though.  He is looking at trying to cap the prices of say, the top 120 essential items that we would get in our supermarkets or that families need.  In other words, this would cover the staples.  I would like to hear the officials reactions to those two issues.  I have no other questions after that.  I am happy to just get feedback on those two pieces.</p></speech>

Electricity prices in Ireland are regulated so I am not 100% sure what the legislative position is.  I genuinely do not know.  This is coming from someone with a background in regulation.  I actually do not know what powers are available at present.  I apologise for that.</p></speech>

The approach taken by Government was to introduce the energy credit to offset part of the increase in the electricity bills and then to use the fuel allowance as a means of targeting the additional funding at the most vulnerable sections of society and possibly the sections of society that are seeing higher levels of inflation because more of their income is being spent on the items the Deputy highlighted.  That is the logic behind the approach, namely, to provide the broad-based support through the energy credit and then the targeted support through the fuel allowance.</p></speech>

Again, France is looking at trying to cap the price of these.  Clearly, a retailer could decide to offset any loss of profit through the price of other items but it would at least keep the top 120 staples from increasing and inflating.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.149" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022051100002#C00900"><p>The Deputy is quite right about inflation in France.  As far as I know, the rate of inflation in France was something of the order of 5.4% in April.  I guess we are getting desensitised because in Ireland in April it was 7.3%, so it is comparatively lower.  If you look at Irish inflation though, energy prices most recently, I think in April, had gone up year on year by something of the order of 44%.  It only about 8% or 9% of the overall basket but that sort of increase probably accounted for about half of the inflationary increase or there or thereabouts.  Thereafter, we are still seeing some price increases on the goods side.  Essentially, for the past decade, goods prices year on year were generally negative, for many reasons.  There was low-cost production in the far east and benefits from global supply chains kept prices low.  That has slightly reversed.  The pandemic has given rise to higher goods prices in Ireland and of course food is an issue.  However, we are not yet in the space where some goods and some foods are the subject of very strong rates of inflation.</p><p>On the basis of recent data, the price of energy is still the main driver of inflation.  Today's data are interesting and show that US inflation was 8.3% in the month of April, but that core inflation, stripping out energy prices - energy actually fell by 6% in the US in April - was 6.2%.  While the Deputy's question was about France, price increases in the US appear to be much more broadly based than in Ireland.  In Ireland and in some other European countries, it has been very much concentrated on energy to date.</p><p> There will be some exceptions in the context of some products in the basket, but it is not yet at the stage where it is being passed through.  We are expecting that to happen.  I stated earlier that we expect to see the effects passed through.  Obviously, food is one to watch.  While there might be exceptions on a product-by-product basis, on aggregate, food price inflation is not accelerating very strongly.  At this point, it is still relatively low and, interestingly, still lower than the euro area average.  Of course, we have seen extraordinarily high increases in fertiliser prices.  One fifth of our fertiliser comes from Russia.  It is one of the things in respect of which prices have accelerated quite a bit.  Wheat prices and general energy prices, particularly that of gas, will have an impact on products.  It will take a bit of time.  We might see it later in the year.</p></speech>

It would be interesting to drill down into this.  An Indian friend of mine is one of the hardest-working people I have ever come across.  He has worked really hard.  He opened an Indian restaurant in Deputy Boyd Barrett's area between Monkstown and D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  He opened a second restaurant in Sandyford just before the Covid pandemic.  He has managed to keep them both going.  The man in question told me that a 15 kg tin of tomatoes was &euro;9 before Christmas and now costs &euro;18.  A tray of fresh chicken from his supplier used to cost &euro;43 or &euro;44 but he got it discounted to &euro;38 because he was a regular purchaser.  It now costs &euro;83 or &euro;84, discounted to &euro;78.  He has also been affected by the cost of petrol and diesel.  This is because he does a lot of deliveries for people who order takeaways.</p> <p>  I asked him if he was planning on increasing his prices.  He told me he was waiting until September.  Indian food is hot food and people tend not to come out to the restaurants so much at this time of year.  It is more of a winter kind of thing in colder weather.  Last week, I walked up Pembroke Road and looked at the menu in FX Buckley's.  I noticed that an 8 oz fillet steak costs &euro;42 and that a 10 oz one costs &euro;46.  FX Buckley is a good butcher, and it has a number of high-end restaurants for those who can afford to pay the prices.  Those are colossal prices.  My Indian friend had not passed on the cost to the consumer.  If he does in September, if others are also holding back, it will be pretty substantial.</p> <p>  The figures I have provided are not made up; they are real figures.  I was very much taken aback by what I discovered.  I do not expect feedback, I am just highlighting this as something to keep an eye on.  I am surprised at what Mr. O'Connor said to the effect that most of our inflation relates to energy.  It is very noticeable that the price of a cup of coffee and the other bits and pieces people buy all seem to be increasing.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.153" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022051100002#D00400"><p>I do not disagree that certain products are probably the subject of high rates of inflation.  Regarding the aggregate for food, I am just looking at the March data.  In March, inflation stood at 6.9%.  Food price inflation contributed about one percentage point in total to that.  Energy contributed approximately four percentage points which brings it up to five percentage points between food and energy.  Obviously, goods and services make up the extra two percentage points to make 6.9%.  That is the average.  Obviously in every month there will be some items in any given basket with very strong rates of inflation, for instance the ones the Deputy has mentioned.  There will be some that will experience decreases.  On aggregate, for food and non-energy staples we are not yet experiencing very high rates of inflation.  I certainly would expect to see food prices rising over time, particularly given that the price of wheat has increased by 44% and with very high rates of inflation for things like fertiliser, which has increased by 75%.  In fairness, we have relatively strong projections for core inflation, non-energy inflation, of about 4% this year anyway.  That would probably tally with what the Deputy is saying.  We are expecting to see it in an aggregate sense later.</p></speech>

The times we are facing are extremely unusual.  Deputy Lahart gave examples of his hard-working and nice friend who is struggling with the ever-increasing costs of the goods he supplies to his customers.  I have been a small shopkeeper for over 30 years.  Particular goods we have in a shop are called lines.  One of the biggest problems we now have with an awful lot of lines in a shop is not the cost of them, which is outside our control, but the actual supply of those lines.  It is the most random things.  For example, it can be a type of fruit, tinned food or anything.  It is the most unusual thing that can happen all of a sudden and it can go on for a couple of weeks or for a couple of months in every shop.  For instance, it could be lemons and there would not be a lemon to be got in any shop because they will only last for so long.  If the supply has stopped, everyone in a particular locality has no lemons and that can go on for weeks or months.  That has been happening with many hundreds of lines.  That is a problem we seem to be having.  I am afraid it will be beyond the reach of everybody to try and sort that.  It seems to be getting worse.</p> <p>  I wish to speak about public contracts.  In case that anybody says that I have a conflict I am not declaring, I just want to say that I work at public contracts.  I would not have any benefit or loss necessarily.  I would be working as a subcontractor for larger contractors.  My interest is obviously in the provision and delivery of the major public works that we want to do, such as our school building programme, road building programme and hospital extensions works.</p> <p>  For some time, I have been shouting about and looking for something to help contractors with inflation.  I welcome the inflation co-operation framework that was announced yesterday.  My question for the guests is whether they really think this will be enough.  In other words, will we still be able to get contractors to sign a contract with local authorities or the housing department to build so many houses at such a cost?  Will people take on the building of a bypass or a new section of road and agree to tie themselves into contract prices?  Will the assurance and what we might call the comfort zone which was provided yesterday be enough to ensure that the State will continue delivering on the programme that we are committed to delivering?</p> <p>  For instance, regarding access into County Kerry, we obviously want to see the Macroom bypass finished.  We want to see Listowel bypass, which has been started, finished.  We want to see the bypass coming down from Adare started.  Those are concerns I have.  The same applies to hospital works and school building programmes.  Many schools are on a programme for refurbishment and some are awaiting an entirely new school.</p><p>Some of those are in County Kerry and throughout the rest of the country.  When I am talking about Kerry, I am obviously talking about the rest of the country as well, because everybody has these concerns.  Do our guests think the measures put in place are enough to ensure we will continue delivering the works we have promised?  That is the first issue.</p><p> The second issue is our energy security, on which I have spoken and campaigned for a long period of time.  I was extremely disappointed that the provision of a liquefied natural gas facility was abandoned in the programme for Government.  I was obviously very disappointed with the Green Party, but I was hoping Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il would have insisted on it staying in the programme for Government but they did not.  They all abandoned it.  How do our guests think the lack of energy security in Ireland will hinder and upset the ever-increasing cost of our electricity?</p><p> In recent days, I was contacted by people from a middling-sized town.  They run a chipper.  It is not McDonald's or Burger King.  It is just a chipper run by two family members.  They are very efficient and hardworking people.  They told me that their monthly ESB bill is &euro;10,000 every two months, that is &euro;5,000 a month.  They said that this is unsustainable.  They cannot put up the price of a carton of chips or a burger to cover this cost.  They have to be mindful of their pricing structure to ensure their customers can afford to go to them.  They have been in business for many years and they are seriously considering throwing in the towel.</p><p> Due to the fact that we will be so reliant in the future on England and France, and we are dropping the ball as a Government in ensuring we have gas or energy supplies ourselves, we are letting down those types of hard-working people and, indeed, young couples and householders who have endured enormous price hikes.  All we are being told is that it will continue.  That is unsustainable.  I would like to hear our guests' opinion on the Government taxing the life out of them, doing very little to help them, and at the same time saying it will try to give them back a bit of money by taking a couple of hundred euro off their ESB bills to keep them quiet.  The people are not falling for that.</p><p> We saw the rejection of what happened in the North when Green Party policies were thrown out the window.  That might be an eye-opener to Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il in the South as to what will happen here if people do not realise that the big issue today is mom's purse.  While we have great financial witnesses here today, they will know exactly what I mean by mom's purse.  If mom's purse is not right on a Friday evening, everything will be wrong in the world of finance after that.  Saturday, Sunday and Monday will get off to a very bad start if mom's purse is not right on Friday evening.  I was brought up to believe that.  If that purse is not able to pay the bills, run the show, and have a couple of pounds for a rainy day, everything will be in disarray and chaos as far as I am concerned.</p><p> The last issue I raise is farming.  It comes back to the most basic need of all, which is feed.  In order to have feed, we must have fertiliser.  I thought I would not live to see the day when bags of fertiliser would cost &euro;50 or &euro;55, a price which continues to go up.  One would nearly want to take the fertiliser out with a spoon in case one would waste any bit of it because it is so valuable.  It is crazy.  That model is unsustainable.  Some parties have said that they want to reduce the national herd.  This will make it very easy for them because people will not be able to keep the animals over the winter.  If they cannot keep animals over the winter and if we do not have a supply of beef coming into the trade, we will have food shortages because it will not be viable for farmers to stay in business and supply milk, beef, or lamb.</p><p> We have seen what happened in the pig industry.  It is unsustainable for pigs to be sold at a loss of up to &euro;30 and &euro;35 per pig.  Many people might not think about that.  Our hardworking piggeries that have survived different calamities over the years will be forced to closed in the coming months.  The package that was delivered was a sop.  It meant nothing in real financial terms.  I could provide figures in which it equated to 35 cent per pig to certain piggeries that supply an awful lot of pigs in the trade and whose losses are enormous.</p><p> We are facing very serious problems.  At the same time, we heard the Minister for Finance last week, and I have heard him in other public outings, say that the moneys coming into the Exchequer are very large.  While that might be happening, mom's purse is in serious difficulty and jeopardy at present.  I want to know what more we can do about it.  The idea that this scheme and that scheme will be made available is akin to chasing our tail.  What we have to do is try to bring down the massive increase in the cost of living that the people endure.  Today, for example, there was a motion before the D&aacute;il on wage increases.  I would love for people to have larger wages but we have to be mindful of the employers who are trying to pay those wages and find it very difficult to run their businesses.  Again, it is a case of the dog chasing the tail.  If we could arrest the massive increase in the cost of living, everything might start to stabilise.  I am sorry if I have gone on too long.</p></speech>

The changes the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced yesterday were the second set of changes announced this year.  On 7 January, in order to address the inflationary pressures we saw through the latter part of 2021, changes were introduced that applied to new contracts moving forward.  Under the contracts for public works that were in place prior to 7 January, there were stringent requirements in the cost of recovery during the fixed-price period.  Very high levels of inflation were required before a contractor could recover costs.</p> <p>  In recognition of the fact that we were in a period of high price volatility, changes were introduced in January that applied to new contracts.  Since then, with the war in Ukraine, the situation has deteriorated.  Some issues were highlighted and a number of contracting authorities and Departments raised these with the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  They included difficulties with existing contracts and issues as a result of the high increases in fuel costs, which were impacting on contracts for roads that require a large amount of machinery.  Bitumen was also an issue there.  Following this engagement, the Minister decided to make further changes.  These changes addressed contracts that were already in place in January.</p> <p>  At the time of the January changes, it was anticipated that we might see a moderation in inflation and that contracts which were already in place would be able to manage within the existing contractual arrangements.</p><p>The changes introduced yesterday now allow for retrospective recovery of price increases on materials with respect to payments made since 1 January for projects delivered under the old forms of contract dated prior to 7 January 2022.  Contractors will be able to recover price increases above the position of the relevant index at the point that they submitted their tender.  This applies until the completion of the project.  There is also retrospective recovery of price increases associated with energy and fuel with respect to payments since 1 January for projects being delivered under forms of contracts dated prior to 7 January.  Contractors will be able to recover price increases above the position of the relevant index at a defined date.  This will also apply until the completion of the project.</p><p> The forms of contract dated from 7 January already contain measures to recover inflation on materials over defined thresholds.  However, recovery of energy and fuel prices will now also be permitted as part of the measures introduced by the Minister yesterday.</p><p> Bearing in mind the supply chain disruption which contractors are facing, relief is also being provided in the form of an extension of the date for completion for the contract where there is disruption to the supply of materials linked to the war or to the pandemic for all public works contracts.  The measures set out by the Minister represent a balanced and proportionate response that looks to protect the delivery of the national development plan in a manner that also protects the Exchequer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.159" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022051100002#F00300"><p>I will make a very brief point.  Deputy Healy-Rae made reference to mom&rsquo;s purse.  He is speaking there to inflation and to the cost of living in a general sense, and I like the way he has put it.  We have had big increases in the Irish economy in gas and oil prices and we know why that happened.  These were obviously rising last year as well.  There were very strange things going on in gas markets in the world.  Gas is usually bought in a therm - do not ask me to explain what a therm is or what it looks like - and, generally speaking, it costs about 50 British pence for a therm.  It has been like that for a very long time where it may be 40 cent in the summer, where one is not using a great deal of gas, and 60 cent, perhaps, in the winter.  It increased considerably last year and breached the &pound;1 mark and was &pound;4 at one stage during the early days of the war.  These are price levels we have never seen in natural gas and there has obviously been a big oil price shock.  The cost of fertiliser is up approximately 150%, and this is also a by-product of natural gas.  Wheat, corn, soya beans, cooking and sunflower oil, one can name any product, and they have all increased greatly in price.  These are all things we import.</p> <p>  Earlier on we spoke somewhat about food prices and capping such staples.  We domestically produce some of these, such as cooked chickens or unprocessed foods, but we import many of these.  Essentially, income in Ireland is going to producers of fossil fuels around the world and the economy as a whole is poorer.</p> <p>  There is also then this debate or judgement, and one is getting into the core of policy here which I will not really comment on, about who takes that burden, be they households, firms or the Government.  Previously and certainly in the 1970s, and I have followed much of the discussion that has gone on recently about things like stagflation, which is where there is high inflation and low growth, the view at the time was that governments should borrow a great deal of money, run massive deficits and try to protect the full economy from the oil price shock as it was at the time, and from OPEC essentially.  Growth rates collapsed afterwards and unemployment completely skyrocketed.</p> <p>  The judgement that is being made now is that the Government will bear some of the cost and try to do this in a targeted manner.  That then becomes a decision, judgement or analysis as to whether that is enough, but much of the analysis, which I believe Mr. Kinnane mentioned in his opening statement, has shown that most of the gains have been to lower income households, which is what I think one probably tries to do when one targets these measures.  At least the gains from those are going to the types of households that one wants to target these measures at.  The higher income households, obviously, have a great deal of savings from the pandemic, and the analysis shows that things like the types of subsidies and allowances Mr. Kinnane spoke about are going to the lower income groups.  That is probably as much as I can say without going into policy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.160" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022051100002#F00500"><p>Perhaps following on from that point, Mr. O&rsquo;Connor put it well there when he said that the rising cost of energy is going into the pocket of energy providers.  This very accurately describes what is going on.  Somebody is benefiting from these price rises and it is the fossil fuel companies and the energy providers.  I wonder if any consideration has been given or has there been any discussion at all - I appreciate Mr O&rsquo;Connor cannot veer too much into policy as this is the area for politicians, and so on - about trying to control the cost of these things essentially by levying, either at a national, European or international level, the profits of those who are doing well ?  There is much international co-ordination going on these days, with unprecedented unity in the European Union when it comes to sanctions.  Is there any thought on co-ordination when it comes to controlling the price or the profits, or both, of the fossil fuel companies and the energy providers?Might that be a way to address the problem rather than chasing the price increases by giving money to people but, essentially, that is just public money going to those fossil fuel or energy companies?</p><p>I noted the discussion earlier on about what legislative powers are available to the Government.  I take the point that the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform might not necessarily be familiar with that.  To address the point raised by Deputy Lahart and to familiarise people with it, the power exists to control the price of goods in, I believe, sections 60 and 61 of the Consumer Protection Act, where in situations of emergency the Government is allowed to control maximum and unit prices of goods and services.  Legislative power is there to do that and I wonder if any consideration has been given to doing that in the discussions as to how we might deal with these things, because it is worth saying the profits of energy companies have gone up considerably.</p><p>I will also be interested in hearing some comment because the profits of these energy companies went up long before the war in Ukraine and so have the prices.  To my mind, Ukraine is obviously having an impact, but there were also increases in energy and fuel prices before the war in Ukraine.  I would like to hear our guests comment on that and on why that was happening.  The website <i>bonkers.ie</i>has in recent days done some work in this area and estimated that energy prices in Ireland are something like 25% higher than the average in Europe and are among the highest prices in Europe.</p><p>Four other countries in Europe have energy prices in the same high range as us.  Why are we at the higher end?  Twenty years ago, we had some of the lowest energy prices in Europe, before the deregulation and privatisation of ESB, Bord G&aacute;is and so on but we now have some of the highest energy prices.  Will the witnesses comment on that?</p><p> There is a narrative that, given the impact of Ukraine, fossil fuel supply and the cost of fossil fuels, we need to develop more renewable energy.  We need to do that anyway for climate reasons.  Is it correct to say that even if we develop much renewable energy, it will have no impact whatsoever on the market price or even on the security of supply?  We have much more wind energy in this country than we used to, but it has not coincided with a reduction in electricity prices, even though we produce far more wind energy than we used to.  It has coincided with an increase in energy prices because, no matter how much energy is produced, the international market sets the price.  Energy production could be 100% renewable and it would not make any difference to the cost of electricity unless we publicly owned and controlled it and the prices.  Is that correct?  At the moment, all those prices are set by the market.</p><p> In their opening statement on the cost of living, the witnesses did not make much reference to the cost of housing and rent and what we will do about that.  Will they comment on that?  I am of the view that we need to bring in rent controls and to have maximum price ceilings on what can be charged, because every other measure seems to have failed.  I do not believe there is any evidence that ramping up supply will lead to a reduction in rents or house prices, as the Government is saying.  I do not know of any evidence in the history of this State of rents or house prices falling just because supply happened to be increasing.  The opposite happened in the Celtic tiger period.  Does the Department of Finance think, if we ramp up supply, that rents and house prices will fall at some point?  If that is the thinking, where is the evidence for believing that might be the case?  I do not see how it could happen and do not think there is any precedent for it happening.</p></speech>

I will hold my hands up and say that I am certainly no expert on this.  In response to Deputy Lahart's question, I understand that while price caps could be implemented, there are certain key considerations.  The key driver of the increase in costs is the increase in raw material prices, including natural gas and oil.  The ability for energy companies to absorb this may be limited and price caps could be an issue.  In the UK, some electricity suppliers which had a price cap went out of business.  The other crucial aspect follows on from points made by Mr. O'Connor about distributive impacts of the measures taken.  A cap is broad-based by its very nature and everybody benefits.  The measures the Government introduced in February applied a mix of broad-based measures through the energy credit and using the fuel allowance, in the social welfare system, to provide additional support of &euro;225 in two lump sum payments to the 370,000 recipients of the fuel allowance.  This approach of targeting funding and support to the most vulnerable can be effective in alleviating the burden on people who are experiencing difficulties.</p></speech>

Being a macroeconomist, the policy advice that I give is quite different to this issue.  I have limited knowledge of the profitability of energy companies in Ireland.  Some are State-owned and some are not.  The majority, with probably just one notable exception, buy energy on international markets and essentially just supply households and businesses domestically.  We have a gigantic cost shock.  If the price was capped, someone would bear the burden, including owners of those firms, which is the State in some instances.  I have not looked at the balance sheets or profitability positions, so I could not comment.  Someone has to bear the cost of what comes into the country.  The Government has made some effort to alleviate the burden on certain households.  The private sector has to bear some costs as well and probably is in some examples we have given here.  The economy, society and State as a whole are worse off from the shock.  Where the burden of policies fall has to be thought through.  It is like when one pushes something down a hole and wonders where it will pop up on the other side.  If I had given it more thought, I would probably be able to do more analysis today, but these are the thoughts I have here.</p> <p>  The Government has a housing policy, which I understand is settled.  The intention is to increase supply and there are various mechanisms to do so.  Supply is increasing.  First quarter numbers were the strongest in the series.  There is seasonality to housing supply.  One should not multiply the 5,000 or 6,000 units produced in the first quarter by four and end up with an annual number, because numbers generally pick up throughout the year.  Those numbers in the first quarter are encouraging and suggest a substantial increase in year-on-year supply.  Approximately 35,000 housing units have started construction in the last 12 months.  That does not mean there will be 35,000 completions in the next year.  It depends on the mix of housing units.  Some take longer than others.  We will see something in that order in the next year to 18 months.  There is unmet demand from the last decade or so.  The reasons for that are reasonably well understood and have been debated in many forums.  That demand needs to be caught up on.  It is the view of the Department and my view that increase in supply will alleviate the increase in price, whether on the purchase or rental market.</p><p>My view is that increasing supply is a means of alleviating the issue but there are many other policy instruments in Housing for All, which have been discussed in many fora.</p><p> I have answered the points made about a cap and housing.  Was anything missed in the middle?</p></speech>

I defy anybody to provide evidence that where one increases the supply of housing, rent or house prices come down because that did not happen in the Celtic tiger period and there is no sign that is going to happen now.  Obviously it is up to the Government to think about that but economists or somebody must question such thinking.</p></speech>

It is not necessarily the market that I would immediately go to where one is trying to see is it worth comparing.  Obviously there was tonnes of supply at the time and we produced something of the order of between 90,000 to 100,000 units per annum or one for every 50 persons in the country, which is a huge number.</p></speech>

Many other factors affected house prices at the time other than supply.  There was a credit surge.  There were loads of different things that are well understood and well written about.  There was the way the tax system was structured and how that incentivised certain types of activities.  For sure, in the housing market, there was a hell of a lot of credit chasing people and people were purchasing for various reasons.</p> <p>  The rental market was a little different at the time.  The rates of growth in the rental market, and I do not have the figures to hand, were nothing like what we saw in the house prices at that time, which might point to the fact that supply was having an impact on rent.  Certainly not negative rental growth and I think that would probably have been unusual.  The Deputy is quite right that in most markets in the world one tends not to see things fall, and certainly in housing markets.  Normally they would increase at least with median income or these types of metrics.  There was definitely a different story during the Celtic tiger between the rental market and the housing market.  The house price market at the time was completely dysfunctional and would not normally be the one that I would point to as one that would indicate that an increase in supply had an alleviating effect on price.</p></speech>

I cannot envisage the circumstances in which house prices or rents are going to fall here even as supply increases.

I just do not see how a reduction is going to happen.</p></speech>

Ireland produces more renewable energy than we have ever done before but that has not had an impact on the cost of electricity.  In fact, the cost of electricity has increased rather than decreased.  Does that situation give pause for thought as to what is going on?  Even though we can increase our supply of renewable energy, which we have been told is the answer to the difficulties that we now face, but that has had no impact whatsoever on the price of energy.</p></speech>

When one considers the supply of renewables and the mix between renewables and gas-fired and coal stations, what is driving up prices is the huge increases in fossil fuel prices.  The proportion that renewables account for within the overall mix is not enough to offset the huge fossil fuel increases.  We might get back to the Deputy separately with a short note on the issue.</p></speech>

I have listened to a great deal of the discussion and I will try not to repeat material that has been discussed.</p> <p>  The cost of living is hitting many people hard and inflation has increased to almost 7%.  The cost of living is very uneven in that some people experience its impact much more than others.  For example, when we spoke to officials from the Central Bank they pointed out that rural people, people on fixed incomes and older people are hit hardest by the cost of living.</p> <p>  There is a range of packages available ranging between the fuel allowance, the diesel and petrol prices for school buses and so on, health charges and electricity charges to support people in different ways.  Have the officials measured whether the packages reach the most hard hit people?  Can they get a handle on the situation?  Have they identified other ways to ensure that future measures focus on supporting the people who are hit the hardest by the cost of living and price increases?</p> <p>  A lot of focus has been on energy being the key driver for price increases.  However, Covid restrictions and the subsequent disruption to supplies have caused a lot of price increases.  For example, the scarcity of timber and insulation products increased the price of construction.  At the moment there is much more severe Covid restrictions in China.  Also, a huge volume of business, which amounts to over &euro;20 billion, is conducted between Ireland and China and concerns a whole swathe of goods that range from textiles, machinery, electronics and every kind of a thing.  What consideration is given to the disruption in supply and the price increases that flow from same?  Have the officials measured the effects or taken them into consideration?  For example, Shanghai port is experiencing delays due to Covid restrictions and over 500 vessels are waiting outside many Chinese ports thus the unavailability of materials will have an effect in a range of places across the world and I expect that prices will increase.</p></speech>

This time last year and any time before the war or during the winter I would have probably said that economies have re-opened and there is a massive surge in demand for goods, although services are completely restricted so consumption has shifted completely over this way, and that has driven up prices around the world.  At the same time demand is rising but there are supply shortages for the exact reasons that the Deputy has described, which occur today but occurred this time last year, but that we expect the situation to be alleviated.  I refer to things that affect the production of cars and the supply of semi-conductors and, indirectly, the supply of semi-conductors is affected by things like inert or neon gases, which come from Ukraine.  So the same problems that we had last year we are likely to have this year though admittedly for different reasons.  There is a disruption in the global supply chains but whether it is the energy stuff that we talked about earlier or imported goods into the economy a lot of it is completely imported.</p><p>It is very difficult, and China&rsquo;s Covid strategy will prolong these disruptions.</p><p> Some of the data we have seen, even in today's release in the US, shows there are starting to be reductions in, for example, the price of motor vehicles.  I raise the US data because they are the most current.  There has been a large increase in costs such as those relating to airfares and hospitality, on the services side, and some easing on the goods side.  My personal view is this stuff is still time-bound but, obviously, it is dependent on factors over which we have zero control.  Trucks that may have come from Far East manufacturers as an alternative to ships last year, when ships were constrained by certain port bottlenecks, went through Russia to get to Germany.  Obviously, that is now unavailable to them and it will take time to find alternative solutions.  It is as though sand has been thrown into the cogs; the supply chains have been completely disrupted.  Nevertheless, there is evidence that the issue is being alleviated and that it is time-bound, but the Deputy is quite right that the problem is very acute at present.  It is not unique to Ireland but is a global issue.</p></speech>

It has been in the system since around this time last year.  Goods were declining in price year on year for the guts of a decade, which was curious because the question arises as to whether the prices will eventually fall to zero.  The trends for services, on the other hand, were positive.  If I had showed the committee a chart on inflation, we would see an upward line, not very steep, at about 0.5% per annum.  The trends for services were all positive and those for goods were all negative, but that just abruptly stopped last year as we flipped out of the pandemic because of all these blockages associated with the pandemic, some of which remain, such as the issues in China the Deputy mentioned.  While there is evidence that some of those blockages are easing - I mentioned motor vehicles in the US - our inflation projections completely bake them in.  Non-energy, non-food core inflation will be 4% this year.  These are really high numbers in the context where, as I said, goods prices were trending towards zero, but that is not unique.  Every country is facing it.  In the US, core inflation was 6.2% in the month of April, which is really high.</p> <p>  This takes us back to the point we were making earlier, namely, that countries that are not producers of raw materials or fossil fuels are becoming poorer as a whole because the costs of their imports globally are increasing.  It has to be a case of burden-sharing.  We talked about the energy measures earlier.  They were an effort on the part of the Government to target and point at certain imports.  This leads me to the Deputy's first question, about the economic evidence.  He is quite right about the Central Bank research, and OECD research, published in a blog today or yesterday, shows the very same point in a cross-country sense.  Of course, lower income households spend more of their income on staples, as do older and rural cohorts, depending on their energy mix.  The best way to focus on that relates to income.  We should examine income groups and the analysis that is generally based on income.  Most of the analysis we and the Economic Social Research Institute, ESRI, have conducted seeks to find the impact of budgetary measures on various income groups.  It is correct to say older households are more severely affected, but not all older households will be in the first, second or third deciles.  In fact, what we should care about is the intersection between low income and older age.  The evidence to date, based on the analysis of the budget we carried out, the analysis the ESRI conducted on the February and March package and further analysis we have done on all of that, has consistently shown that the highest gains from these measures have always been in the lower income groups.</p></speech>

Obviously, the fuel allowance is a means-tested payment and, therefore, as Mr. O'Connor suggested, the support can be targeted at the lower income deciles.  The key with trying to implement these measures in February and subsequently was to do so quickly.  The energy credit was a broad-based payment that provided some support to everybody.  Given that the legislation had been published, increasing it to &euro;200 inclusive of VAT, or about &euro;176 net, could be done quickly.  The legislation had been published and could be enacted quickly, with the funding put in place.  Likewise, the fuel allowance was a means of quickly getting these bullet payments, of &euro;125 in March and &euro;100 subsequently, to people in the lower income deciles.  In the budget, there was a &euro;5 per week increase for all working-age payments and pension payments, and there was an increase in the qualified child payment of &euro;2 for under-12s and &euro;3 for over-12s.  Furthermore, there were increases in the living alone allowance and the working family payment.  These were all put through SWITCH, the distributional analysis, which showed they were effective in providing income to the lower income deciles.  That is the type of support that can be very effective.</p></speech>

They travel into and out of work every day and pay for that in diesel.  They may live in a rural area and may not have public transport other than, perhaps, the school bus.  Are specific measures identifiable that would be able to support that cohort of people, who are likely to be suffering a great deal from the cost of living?</p></speech>

Figures I saw earlier show that the tax-exclusive price for petrol went from &euro;0.48 in February 2021 to &euro;0.82 in February 2022 and &euro;1.01 in May 2022.  There is a very significant problem, as is reflected in the price of diesel as well.  The Government has responded through the various measures relating to excise, whereby it reduced excise on petrol by 20 cent and diesel by 15 cent in order to alleviate those problems.  There are limits to what the Government can do within that, given there is an excise directive that imposes a minimum level to which the State must adhere.  The Minister for Finance, in considering this and making these changes, was conscious that excise is a considerable revenue-raiser that is used to pay for the running of the State, so a balance had to be struck in trying to improve the circumstances of people who were affected by the rises in fuel costs while recognising, as I think everyone does, that it is impossible to alleviate the issue altogether.  That was the balance he decided to apply.  It is fully appreciated that the measures have merely tempered a very significant increase and prices remain at a very high level, but if these changes had not been made, those prices would be considerably higher.</p></speech>

I missed some of the debate as a result of being at another committee.  If I am following up on things that have already been talked about, the witnesses should not hesitate to let me know.</p><p>One of the issues I would like to get a view on is inflation, on which there is a lot of discussion at the moment.  What we frequently hear is around a wage-price spiral.  We see that energy prices and the reopening of supply chains are driving inflation rather than wages.  I saw a graph in the <i>Financial Times </i>this week that showed hourly earnings in the private sector back as far as 2015 in the eurozone in comparison to the United States and Britain.  It showed that, since 2020, wage growth was almost stagnant in the eurozone but there were good gains in the US and Britain.  I would like to hear the witnesses&rsquo; views in regard to evidence or lack thereof of a wage-price spiral.  If wages are not the driver, would an inflation-adjusted wage increase not be of benefit?  That is my first question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.188" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022051100002#K00200"><p>It is an excellent question.  Where do I start?  The wage data in Ireland for the last year or two are borderline impossible to interpret.  When we get down to averages, we had 600,000 people on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, in 2020 and they are all, comparatively speaking, lower-paid, part-time workers.  Therefore, we get this massive mechanical shoot-up in the average wage because we are dividing the wages of those who are still in work, which is comparatively higher, by a much smaller number.  It is very hard to interpret.  However, although they are not the official data on wages, which, as I said, are completely messed up, some data have been published by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, which looked at tax records for people who were in jobs in subsequent quarters, and it is almost controlling for everyone who was on PUP and similar payments.  As of the fourth quarter of last year, quarter on quarter, from the third quarter of last year, on a like-for-like basis, wage growth was of the order of 6%.  Therefore, in Ireland, for those within work over the past year or two, wage growth was actually quite strong.</p> <p>  That probably explains what we have seen on the income tax side, given it has been difficult to explain what has gone on with income tax in Ireland, where there was near double-digit growth last year.  Is that because of people coming back into work who lost employment because of the pandemic, or is it because of wage growth for people who are working and have continued to work?  There is no easy answer to that.  However, if we look at what happened in 2020, when we have this huge fall in employment but income tax only fell by a tiny amount, it probably speaks to those who left employment and were supported by the PUP being comparatively lower paid and, therefore, paying comparatively less tax.  Therefore, it would stand to reason that when they return to work, there would not be a huge tax dividend, which then probably speaks to the fact that if income tax in particular shot up last year, it must be to do with wage growth within the economy.</p> <p>  In my view, even though the national official statistics do no not show it, there is evidence from Revenue data and the like that there was quite strong wage growth in the economy.  Of course, at the same time-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.190" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022051100002#K00400"><p>If we look at those same data, it is definitely across the board, even in sectors that were more affected by the pandemic than others, and those within work were still experiencing wage growth.  However, yes, it was absolutely tilted towards those sectors where profits and revenues were growing, particularly the multinational sector.  That would make sense.  If a firm is making an awful lot of profits, it is reasonable that there is a return to the people working in it.</p> <p>  To get to the core of the Deputy&rsquo;s question about wage-price spirals, that is the economic question of the age, namely, what do we do in an economy where there is comparatively high inflation?  All economies are quite different at the moment and the components of inflation are very different.  If we look at US data, there is a very particular story over there.  Core inflation is through the roof and is up at about 6% or 6.25%.  That is why we have seen the Federal Reserve moving and if it really wants to control it, there is probably a considerable degree of work, if we consider what market expectations are for interest rates at the very end of the year.  By the way, the US labour market is super-tight and unemployment rates are at 3.5% or something like that.  In the UK, it is kind of a similar story, which is one of pretty strong core inflation and super-low unemployment.  In the euro area, there is a bit more slack in the labour market.  That said, unemployment rates are at record lows and it is just that, historically, it has been a little higher.  However, core inflation is certainly not biting to the same extent yet in the euro area, although it is definitely picking up and, in Ireland, is expected to be of the order of about 4% this year.</p> <p>  If we think about inflation as a whole, there are the energy products we import and the goods we import and, basically, pretty much all goods are imported into Ireland, certainly consumer goods, although some food is produced and consumed domestically.  Then, there are services, which encompass many different things and, within services, wages account for perhaps two thirds to three quarters of costs.  Therefore, if, as a rule, we are trying to ensure that everybody should be compensated for the full price increase, that clearly goes straight into the costs of firms and, ultimately, comes out the other end.  To slightly simplify this, we can think of a market where things are quite competitive, say, fruit or if we want to buy a carrot in a market.  If some cost upstream goes into it, whether it is a fertiliser price increase or something else, the price that the customer pays increases quite quickly.  That is the wage-price spiral.</p> <p>  Where does that actually lead us?  If I am to pre-empt the Deputy&rsquo;s next question of what should happen with wages, it is a very difficult one to give an answer to.  Everybody tries to compare the situation today to the 1970s but it was a very different situation.  We have independent monetary institutions now, central banks with inflation targets did not really exist to the same extent back then and we had economies that were way more energy-intensive.  At the same time, we had a lot of economies where wages were simply indexed, so it completely did chase inflation.  Basically, we had increased wages, which increased costs and increased prices, which again increased wages, and that was the wage-price spiral.  That led to super-high inflation, really low output growth, in some cases recessions and very high unemployment.</p> <p>  I do not have an answer for the Deputy as to what should happen with wages.  I would probably say that in normal times, and we are not in normal times, we would expect wages to increase at least with productivity and some compensation for price increases, but I am not going to say that increasing it for all of us would not have an impact on inflation in a spiralling sense.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. O'Connor for that, as it was a very interesting response and engagement.</p> <p>  On another question, I cannot remember when we had the Central Bank officials in before the committee &ndash; it was at some point in the last weeks or months - but I asked them about the risk of stagflation.  It now looks likely that the ECB will hike interest rates in July whereas for a very long period &ndash; obviously, this was before the war in Ukraine - the ECB was clear it was not going to increase interest rates.  If we look back to previous times, the ECB increased rates in July 2007, when we entered the global financial crisis, and it also did it in July 2011, when we entered the eurozone sovereign debt crisis.  This is something we discussed with the Central Bank officials and it was interesting to hear their response.  I have a fear that the ECB will decide to hike interest rates in the middle of war and of high inflation which is primarily due to energy prices.</p><p>I would be interested to hear Mr. O'Connor's view.  My concern is that that would happen and it would not bring down inflation but could slow growth and increase the risk of stagflation.  What is Mr. O'Connor's view on the risks of stagflation resulting?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.195" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022051100002#L00200"><p>Stagflation can mean many things to many people but probably in its purest sense refers to a high inflation environment with very low growth.  We have revised down our growth forecasts, as is well known, by something like 2.25% but are still posting reasonable figures in the region of 4% for modified domestic demand.  Admittedly, some of it is affected by the year-on-year comparison.  We are not in that space in a baseline sense.</p> <p>  I refer to what could happen with much higher energy prices.  Energy markets are extremely volatile.  At one point yesterday, gas prices fell to 11 pence before quickly going back up to 146 pence.  I was out watching my daughter play football.  It was a warm day but full of wind, so people were not purchasing gas on spot markets.  It goes to show that minor changes in the situation in Ukraine and Russia or by policymakers in Europe with regard to sanctions will have large impacts, positive or negative, on energy prices.  It is difficult to say but as the prices go up and that affects inflation, obviously there will be a spill-over to growth.  We have put that into the stability programme update in our scenario analysis.</p> <p>  On interest rates, I have to be careful what I say because monetary policy is completely independent so I will not give any strong views on that.  The expectation is the ECB will move.  Markets have priced in something of the order of 0.75% or 75 basis points before the end of the year.  In the US, markets expect interest rates to go to something like 2.75% to 3%, while in the UK it is of the order of 2%.  According to people who base their careers on this, European interest rates will still be considerably lower by the end of the year.</p> <p>  There is another concept, which I am sure any central bankers present would love to talk about, called the neutral rate of inflation.  That is the one that is neither stimulatory nor contractionary.  People have to estimate it and some make careers out of it.  If the ECB gets to 0.75% by the end of the year, it will be considerably below any estimate I have seen of the neutral rate of inflation, which means the interest rates in Europe will still be expansionary rather than contractionary.  They would have to go much higher, up to where the UK is, or even the US.  I do not expect interest rates, given what markets are expecting, to have a significant contractionary impact on the economy unless things change hugely.</p></speech>

I was in a meeting and in the Chamber as well.</p> <p>  I have a question I encountered through a constituent this week.  It concerns fuel costs, as well as consequent delivery costs and inflation on goods.  The gentleman in question was a haulier who wished to avail of the diesel rebate scheme.  He has a number of lorries on the road and purchased around 100,000 l of fuel in the first three months of the year.  The difficulty is the scheme is set up with the requirement that the haulier must purchase fuel in units of 2,000 l or more.  This company's tank is 2,500 l.  Sometimes with a contingency order, when the delivery arrives, the tank will not take 2,000 l.  This means the delivery does not qualify for the rebate.  If the lorry is on the road and running low, it may pull into a garage and use the DCI card or whatever to fill up.  Why is the scheme set up in this way?  Could it be altered in favour of small businesses, many of which are struggling with rising energy, fuel and other costs, by taking into account fuel bought on trade account or by debit card?</p> <p>  When was the &euro;100 per week hauliers support scheme first paid out and to when was it backdated?  The briefing note says it began on 11 March.  Recently I was on local radio and a constituency colleague was trumpeting it and saying it was there, yet people were texting in to say they had not received it.  That was on 29 March.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.200" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cathal Sheridan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022051100002#L00700"><p>I will take the first question.  I am not sure I can answer it directly.  I am familiar with the diesel rebate scheme which kicks in once diesel rises above &euro;1, exclusive of VAT, per litre.  It gives the hauliers a reduction of 7.5 cent per litre once they cross the threshold of about &euro;1 or &euro;1.16.  Everybody at the moment, because of the price of fuel, is getting the maximum diesel rebate scheme.  It is targeted at hauliers and at large-scale transactions.</p> <p>  The Deputy made the point that the transactions of the haulier she refers to are not sufficiently large to qualify for the scheme.  I do not know what the answer to that is.  I can try to get clarity on that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.201" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1588" speakername="Patricia Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022051100002#L00800"><p>The tank they use does not take the full amount of diesel required for the scheme on a regular fill.  We need to address the issue.  If they get 8,000 l of fuel per week over five deliveries and pay by credit card, they do not qualify for the scheme.  However, if they buy 8,000 l in four deliveries, they do.  That is the difficulty.</p></speech>

That is targeted at heavy goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes.  One has to also hold an operative road haulage operator licence.  In deciding on targeting of this scheme, the Government considered the licensed haulage sector as a specific case for several reasons.  Primarily, the sector is of national strategic importance as a critical enabler of the supply chain, bringing essential supplies into and out of the State, supporting key infrastructure and enabling the maintenance of economic and social activity.  The Deputy mentioned 11 March.  That was the day the scheme was announced but application forms were issued directly to all hauliers on 5 April.  The closing date for receipt of completed applications was Friday, 29 April.  Payments are to be processed after that date.  That might explain the difference in dates.</p></speech>

The new form of contract introduced in January allowed for greater cost recovery.  For contracts already in place, there was no cost recovery as long as they were within the fixed-price period.  The change introduced yesterday provides that there can be indexation based on CSO indices for payments from January onwards for those existing contracts.  There is a retrospective element, given the payments that were made from January to date.</p><p>There is an estimate that there is a cost of &euro;30 million to &euro;40 million for the retrospective element of this, so the scale of what was introduced yesterday would not impact significantly on the delivery of projects or capital envelopes.</p><p> The other change applies to all contracts, both the existing contracts and the post-January contracts.  It is to allow for specific issues relating to fuel costs which were not covered by the January changes.  This was impacting on certain roads contracts, in particular, where obviously the price of bitumen was increasing but the price of diesel required for the machinery was also increasing.  There is also the change introduced which relates to the time.  Given that supply chains are being disrupted because of the war in Ukraine, contractors who do not meet contractual time targets due to the supply chain disruption, where it is proven it is because of the situation in Ukraine, are not subject to liquidated damages.</p><p> Given the scale of the capital envelope that is available for this year, the retrospective element arising from yesterday's changes would not impact significantly.</p></speech>

If one goes back to the time of the budget with the approximately &euro;1.1 billion of measures that were introduced based on a certain economic scenario at the time, we have had an opportunity to update our economic projections which I believe, at this point, capture most of the energy price increases.  I will not speak to the future if there is an escalation in the war to suck in third countries or no gas supplied to the EU whatsoever, but they were most recently introduced on the basis of what we think the next six months will look like.  That is a reasonable way to put it.</p> <p>  Currently, to paraphrase something that was said by somebody else in the past, risks are getting riskier.  There was a time when we used to do forecasts and we would have a lovely little fan chart around them based on what the past looked like, how wrong we were in the past and here is our point estimate but we think we are going to be within this.  That thing is stretched.  One could have energy prices bouncing from $106, or whatever it is today for oil prices, back up to $150.  We model that, and that is published.  The implications for growth and the budget balance are in the document and we have written about it.  It could be gas prices that used to be 50 pence per therm permanently for a decade hitting &pound;5 sterling.  We have had such volatility.  However, on the basis of what has happened since the budget and on the basis of market prices for what it is going to cost to buy gas, oil and all these things for the next year, it appears as if a lot of that stuff is now priced in.  We have a good handle on where we are with energy costs.</p></speech>

With regard to the energy credit for electricity, the cost of electricity has gone up way over 100% in the last 12 months or the last year and a half.  People are asking me if there is any control or how the companies are allowed to do this while at the same time we read that they made &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million in profits last year.  I am being asked if there is any control of them.  Then there is ground rent.  If somebody is not using a premises, and people were not able to use their premises because of the lockdown or whatever, the ground rent or the standing charges have gone up way beyond as well.  People cannot understand it.  While I accept and appreciate the money that is being given, it is not enough.  What are the views of the witnesses on it?  It appears to everybody that since Bord na M&oacute;na was closed down in the middle of the country that the price of electricity has been going up day by day.  Have the witnesses any response?  Perhaps it is not the right question for them, but I am being asked those questions.  Is there any control or where will it stop?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.210" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan O'Connor" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022051100002#M00600"><p>This touches on nearly all the questions we have received today.  They all have been excellent questions, like the Deputy's.  All these energy prices are imported, so there is this massive shock to the Irish economy.  Gas prices on wholesale markets in early March were ten times above their average price.  They are currently approximately three times above it, so there has been a threefold increase to energy suppliers' inputs.  Unfortunately for all of us, that is reflected in retail prices.</p> <p>  The Government has made its policy decisions.  The effort was to try to alleviate some of those prices for everybody to some extent and then to target additional supports for lower income groups, such as fuel allowances and so forth.  I am not 100% sure if I can say much more than that.  Controlling prices has come up previously and I had to apologise to one of the Deputy's committee colleagues earlier.  It is definitely not my realm.  I am not familiar with those legislative powers or what could be done.  All I can say is that somewhere someone has to bear these costs.  Unfortunately, energy suppliers or energy producers elsewhere in the world are benefitting and economies that import this stuff, like ours, are poorer as a result.  What does one do?  Does one try to compensate the entire economy for all of these increases?  That is one option.  It was tried previously in the 1970s and it was probably a factor for the super high inflation and low growth we got afterwards.  On the other hand, does one try to alleviate the burden for those who need it most through people who are on State supports such fuel allowances, which is the strategy that is being followed now?  They all are difficult policy choices.</p></speech>

We had a brief discussion on price caps.  Apart from anything else, the key driver is the price of the gas and oil.  It would be very expensive and it is not targeted.  The Government has decided to target lower income households through the social welfare system, particularly through the fuel allowance and the two lump sum payments that have been made under that scheme, and then to provide broad-based support through the energy credit and the reductions that have been made on the taxation side, which bring us through to the budget.  It is a significant intervention.  When one totals all the interventions, they come to just over &euro;1 billion.  They certainly go some way towards addressing the issue.  The Government has set out the position that trying to compensate completely for all the price rises in energy would be a huge burden for the Exchequer to bear.  Nonetheless, the intervention that has been made is still very significant.</p></speech>

Is that a large factor in explaining why electricity prices are going up, day by day?  It does not seem to be stopping.  Electricity prices went up by 28% or 29% last week or the week before that.</p></speech>

Some of the questions, including those from the Deputy, would be for an energy expert or an energy economist.  Again, I must apologise to the committee but this is genuinely not an area with which I am overly familiar, in terms of what determines electricity prices or energy prices in Ireland.</p> <p>  I would make one additional point in the context of the question of how much is the right amount of support.  We must think about where the money comes from.  The Government is currently running a deficit this year and is forecasting a very modest surplus next year.  However, as we said in the stability programme update, if energy prices go back to the levels they were at in early March, and it is not inconceivable that they would do so - there are various scenarios in which one could see that happening - then next year's surplus is gone.  The surplus would be gone simply because of higher energy prices, higher inflation in the economy and the impact they have on output.  That is without any more policy measures by the Government.  Meanwhile, the interest rate environment is completely changing.  We have seen what happened with the Bank of England last week, and with the Federal Reserve a week or two before that.  Irish bond yields which for a long time were either at zero, marginally below zero or close to zero are very close to 2% right now.  The Italian bond yields are up at around 3%.  We are seeing a big pick-up.  The so-called "free money" era is gone.  Basically, it is getting much more expensive for states to finance deficits.  If we want to do more, it will have to be paid for in higher debt and higher interest and that is an important consideration in the context of policy decisions and policy choices.</p></speech>

The carbon tax increased again in recent days.  How much of the carbon tax is being directed towards the fares measure?  Is there a figure for that?</p></speech>

It was allocated across measures in the social welfare area to take account of the increases in prices.  Some of it was allocated towards the national retrofitting programme and some towards additional funding for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to encourage and incentivise farmers to transition to more sustainable forms of agriculture.  That carbon tax funding has been ring-fenced, in effect, to protect the most vulnerable in society from the effects of the carbon tax increases, to support the retrofitting programme and the just transition.  That is where the increase is being spent.  When the carbon tax increase is implemented, how it is expended is set out each year.</p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Ms Callaghan, to respond on the cost of the transport measure.  </p></speech>

The cost of the fare reduction from now to the end of the year is &euro;54 million.  This is also on top of the measure in budget 2022 to introduce a youth fare card on PSO and commercial services, which gives younger people discounted travel, at an average of 50%, across all services including city, inter-city and rural services.  There are a number of different public transport measures there, on top of the free travel scheme.</p></speech>

It is my understanding that one has to have a haulage licence to qualify for the diesel rebate scheme.  As there are many lorry drivers who do not have a haulage licence, they do not qualify for the diesel rebate.  Has consideration been given to expanding the rebate scheme in light of the savage running costs faced by many lorry drivers?  Could the scheme be expanded to include all lorries, including quarry vehicles, for example?  I should say that a family member has a quarry and it could be construed that I have a particular interest in that regard.  This is affecting a lot of people who did not have to have a haulage licence and who do not have one now.  Given the savage cost of diesel at the present time, is there any possibility that the scheme could be expanded to include more people?  Everyone is being adversely affected in the current climate.</p></speech>

I am not aware, as of now, that he is giving consideration to that.  The scheme has been around for quite a long time and has operated very successfully.  It is very important to the haulage industry because it does give, what would have seemed in the past, quite a generous concession.  Maybe now it does not seem generous because of whole scale change in the nature of pricing.  I am not aware, as of now, that the Minister intends to make any change to the scheme.  Obviously it is a matter he may look at but I cannot give a definitive view on it at the moment.</p></speech>

I know it is, inevitably, going to be a complex area.  I do not expect Mr. Kinnane to have all the details in front of him if this information has not even been published yet.  What I am getting at is that many of the contracting bodies in this case may be local authorities or organisations of that nature.  In a package like this, what is the engine of oversight?  Often, local authorities do not come under the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  They are audited themselves.  On the other hand, this is a special scheme, so I wonder what body is envisaged - and I am not necessarily referring to the detail here - as auditing, keeping an eye on or providing oversight of the scheme?</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Kinnane.  I have a quick question about the SWITCH system.  We talked a little about this today and good examples were given of the various groups included in this context.  We are in an incredibly volatile moment.  I wonder about the Department's confidence in the SWITCH system's ability to respond to situations of particular groups.  I am thinking specifically about child poverty and impacts on gender.  I pose this question to the representatives of both Departments.  I refer to the level of confidence they have in their own forecasts and the analyses of the impacts in the context of these aspects of child poverty and gender.</p></speech>

Let me get this point right.  There are some household types in there, but primarily it is used for looking at income groups.  I refer to households split into income groups.  There is also some analysis within the SWITCH model of households, such as impacts in cash terms on different household structures.  Regarding how confident we are in this regard, it is a difficult question to answer.  As I understand it, this approach uses data from things like CSO household budget surveys and information on incomes of household groups, etc., to try to model the impact of tax changes.  Therefore, it is a function of the data going into the model.  What the model, or the modeller, then tries to do is to adjust these things for changes in wages or inflation.  A starting point is modelled, then adjustments are made over time, based on forecasts-----</p></speech>

Obviously, forecasts have been horribly wrong over time before.  Generally, however, what happens is that they are updated with more information.

During the last Government, this committee did a piece of work on gender equality, of which the witnesses are aware.  There are well-being indicators in the programme for Government.  Both these initiatives are worthwhile.  The witnesses have all done work on this and I know they are aware of these aspects.  The Departments have done excellent work on this, in fairness.  My impression of the budget cycle, though, and it might be unfair, is that gender equality budgeting and well-being indicators are still somewhat a satellite element in the context of the work being done.  They are in the process of being implemented.  When we talk about budgets, the SWITCH system is still central to the decisions we are making.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, because households are incredibly important, as is understanding and calibrating in that context.  We may, however, be missing a piece in the discussion by following this one system and not having fully implemented the other two systems.</p></speech>

Therefore, I assure the Chair this is something that will be very much to the forefront of our minds for budget 2023.</p></speech>

We are relying on sectoral Departments to do the work and almost report back.  The witnesses could encourage them to do that.  Ms Callaghan wants to come in.</p></speech>

I would refer to the working family payment and the national childcare scheme.  However, in the last budget there were announcements around a new funding stream for childcare, which is obviously not captured within the model.  Considerable work, separate from the switch model, is done on social impact analysis, which examines different schemes in terms of gender breakdown, regional breakdown and age breakdown.  Individual schemes are analysed using other methodologies.  Switch can only take account of tax on certain expenditure measures but we spend a great deal of money on many other different services, which are delivered in a different way, and we need to find better ways to capture that.  The social impact assessment and the spending reviews we undertake in the Department and across the Civil Service are also a key input into trying to answer some of these questions.</p></speech>

I am not denying that work goes on.  My question relates to that process of the budget and what we end up talking about on budget day.  I have found that what gets measured at the core of things is often what gets changed.  It is noticeable that on budget day what we talk about often is the switch model and not necessarily gender equality budgeting.</p></speech>

With regard to the budget, on the expenditure side, there is much focus on the budget day announcements but they account for only approximately &euro;1 billion.  We are spending about &euro;80 billion-----</p></speech>

However, there is the matter of what is happening the bulk of the spend and through the equality budgeting work.  Also, a well-being framework has now been published and we have a set of indicators.  We are examining how we can utilise this framework, which will take some time - it took New Zealand, which was well advanced with regard to well-being, some time to do so - to set out how budgetary decisions are impacting on well-being.  It will develop over time but considerable work is ongoing, particularly when we consider performance budgeting and how we can better utilise it and integrate it with the well-being framework to provide better information that can inform budgetary decisions.</p></speech>

I am aware we are already in the budget 2023 cycle.  As we move further into that process, I presume all the witnesses are working very hard on the cost of living issue.  It is very volatile and there is much social pressure, both political and worldwide, to address it.  This committee will be working on the issue of tax expenditure in the next few weeks.  With the budget looming, we are examining that aspect.  Is there consideration in either Department of a review of tax expenditure as it relates to the cost of living?  When we discuss it at this committee, we might examine it in the context of fossil fuel subsidies, foreign direct investment or whatever it might be.  Is that something the witnesses are reviewing in terms of the cost of living?  We have heard from the Parliamentary Budget Office that 23% of tax expenditure, which is a spend of approximately &euro;7 billion, has not been reviewed recently.</p></speech>

To the extent that an incentive or measure might help alleviate cost of living pressures, that would certainly be taken into account.  To answer the Chairman&rsquo;s question directly on whether there is a formal process examining tax expenditure against the cost of living dynamic, I am not clear there is a particular process but bearing in mind what she said, we will certainly reflect on that.</p></speech>

This engagement marks Europe Day and the European Year of Youth and the topic of youth experiences and perspectives on Europe.  The purpose of today's meeting is to mark Europe Day by amplifying young voices and hearing youth experiences and perspectives on Europe.  Europe Day marks the anniversary of the historic Schuman declaration, a day to reflect on the strides taken to bring peace and prosperity to the continent of Europe.  The war in Ukraine highlights that the ideals behind the setting up of what became the European Union are still very much necessary.  This week also marks the 50th anniversary of the referendum in which Irish people voted to join the then European Economic Community on 10 May 1972.</p><p>The year 2022 has also been designated as the European Year of Youth and the aim is to boost the efforts of the EU, the member states and the regional local authorities to honour, support and engage with youth in a post-pandemic perspective.  In this context the committee is pleased to be joined by representatives of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, which are child and youth councils in the 31 local authorities of the country, which give children and young people the opportunity to be involved in the development of local services and policies.  We are joined by Mr. Leo Galvin, representing Donegal, by Ms Prachi Agrawal representing D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, and by Mr. James O'Brien, representing Wexford.  You are all very welcome as are your parents and guardians who are here with you today and who are in the Gallery.  I will shortly ask each of you to contribute but before we begin I must read a note on privilege and house-keeping matters before you make your presentations.</p><p>All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if the statement of a witness is potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue these remarks.  It is imperative that he or she complies with any such direction.</p><p>For witnesses attending the meeting remotely from outside the Leinster House complex, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  <b></b></p><p>Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give.</p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.</p><p> I invite all of the witnesses to make their opening presentations, starting with Mr. Galvin, and then we will have questions from members.</p></speech>

Is on&oacute;ir m&oacute;r &eacute; a bheith anseo inniu chun labhairt libh.  Over the course of this year, the European Year of Youth, young people across Europe have been given a voice.  It is a long-awaited chance to have a large scale input on European policy and legislation.  Having attended several of these consultative events, I must say that the energy was electric.  There was a feeling of "Oh my, the European Union wants our opinion!"  It was an incredible once-off opportunity but what if it was not a once-off?  What if the young people of Ireland were consulted more?  What if the decisions the European Union makes had the input of young people more often?  Day in, day out decisions are made and many of them affect young people's lives.  As we sit in our homes and schools, the desire to have our say is growing.  Organisations such as Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, SpunOut, the Irish Second-Level Students' Union, ISSU, and many more have the aim of allowing young people to voice their concerns.  From lowering public transport costs for every young person in Ireland to gaining a seat on the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, their achievements have been earned through years of work.  This clearly demonstrates that young people want a say and an input into the decisions that affect them.</p> <p>  The Schuman Declaration, which we are here today to celebrate, has inevitably led us to this point.  A coal and steel community became a legislative and policy-forming coalition where everyone has a say.  The benefits of this have been felt throughout the decades as it responded to the problems voiced by its members, especially in Ireland.</p> <p>  Many young people would not be here without the EU's open border policy, finding jobs that can sustain them abroad.  I certainly would not be here if my mother had not been able to work in Ireland when she moved here from France.  Many young people take public transport, which relies on funding from the EU.  Motorways, railways and even infrastructure were built with EU funds, not to mention the transport schemes in rural areas.  Even the clothes I wear today would not have made it into the EU without the many trade agreements the Union has made across the world.</p> <p>  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas as aird comhalta&iacute; an choiste agus t&aacute; suil agam gur bhain siad luach as an m&eacute;id a bh&iacute; le r&aacute; againn inniu.  I will leave members with the words of Seamus Heaney, "The next move is always the test".</p></speech>

After 50 years of our membership of the European Union, I reflect on how immensely this country has progressed because of it.  We have grown from a country of political and economic turbulence to a nation with remarkable opportunities and overall standard of living.  However, as times progress and change, we must adapt and maintain that level of remarkability for generations to come.</p> <p>  This generation has grown up during the age of uncountable historic events and there is no doubt this has had a monumental impact on the way we perceive the world around us.  From living through a global pandemic to the current climate crisis, we have grown up looking at people suffering and the planet dying from a very young age.  It does not help that we are growing up during a time of rapid technological progression and the rise of social media, being exposed to an abundance of content before we can even create our own opinions.</p> <p>  I will talk about how all of these issues are closely interlinked and how certain EU policies could potentially solve not one but many of these problems.  On a European level, climate change has been a core topic of discussion and some amazing initiatives have been introduced.  The European Green Deal, for example, aims to transform Europe into a carbon-neutral continent by 2050.  Some funding provided by the EU has been used in fantastic ways, including to restore many bogs and in agricultural activity, but a lot more can be done.</p> <p>  The 2020 European semester country report for Ireland stated that transport and building were hindering our progress towards becoming carbon neutral.  Using funding for accessible and affordable transport and green urban development could have a massive and positive impact on our progress.</p> <p>  As students, one of the best and most beneficial resources for us is education.  Funding science sectors that investigate and develop reliable renewable energy sources, supporting students of all demographics to pursue environmentally-inclined careers and providing equal opportunities to students to keep different perspectives in the climate conversation would enable us to contribute to change from a young age and not feel helpless about our future.  The benefits of education do not stop at climate change.  The digital education action plan is a brilliant EU policy initiative that integrates technology into education.  We noticed during the pandemic how crucial technology was to us.  It allowed people to make a living, receive an education, stay connected and enabled the entire global market to still function.  Technology has proved to be integral to our lives, especially those of this generation, yet there are many cases where the digital world has affected us in a harmful or detrimental way because of its growing dangers.  Integrating technology into first, second and third level education through accessible and affordable equipment, digitally trained staff and inclusive and user-friendly lessons are just some of the many ways to allow children to understand the online world from a young age, thereby allowing us to feel confident in using technology because it is so prevalent in today's society.  Technology could genuinely be the future if it is kept safe and used properly.</p> <p>  As I said, everything is closely related and linked.  Quality education empowers students to explore opportunities and develop interests in fields that are necessary and useful in the future, such as climate change and technology.  This is just one of the many knock-on effects the implementation of certain EU policies would have on this generation and the population as a whole.</p></speech>

As a member of Wexford Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak to the committee.</p> <p>  Recently, I was lucky enough to attend the 25th annual European Youth Parliament national session in Cork.  I and many others each worked with a group of like-minded individuals on a committee to research, discuss and form a resolution.  The committees debated and voted at general assembly to decide whether the resolutions should pass.  A wide variety of topics was discussed, including the housing crisis, unpaid internships, artificial intelligence, or AI, the introduction of tighter restrictions on gender-based violence, the lowering of the voting age to 16 years and many other topics.  The European Youth Parliament has proved to me beyond doubt that every young person in Europe deserves to have his or her voice heard when it comes to major issues such as these.  These issues will ultimately shape the future that we are expected to and eager to lead.</p> <p>  While Comhairle na n&Oacute;g is an amazing tool for its members that serves to help young have their voices heard where they otherwise might not be, it is only representatives of young people's voices and the opportunity is not available to everyone.  For many young people, having any kind of influence on the issues that directly affect their lives seems totally impossible.</p> <p>  Young people face problems that are not being addressed nearly as much as they could or should be and that will only grow exponentially over time.  If young people had a platform to have their voices heard on issues such as prejudice and harassment towards members of the LGBTQ community, the way the education system and school curriculum are laid out and the housing crisis, it would go a long way to reduce friction between young people and those who have the influence to decide their future.  Given the atrocities taking place in Ukraine, a lack of friction is exactly what we need.</p></speech>

I thank our guests for their short presentations.  Members could learn from them as regards brevity.  I thank them for their clear and concise presentations that raised important points.  I will open the debate to members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.282" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022051100002#C00600"><p>I really enjoyed the presentations.  My first question is for all our guests.  Both Mr. Galvin and Mr. O'Brien mentioned the issue of having one's voice heard.  Mr. Galvin put it very well when he said, "Oh my, the European Union wants our opinion".  It is great when people want to listen.</p><p>Mr. O'Brien can correct me if I am wrong, but I get a sense he is saying a lot is being said but nobody is doing anything about it, or at least there is the impression nothing is being done about his concerns.  Have any of the witnesses put any thought into what sort of structured forums need to be put in place, not just on an EU basis, but more particularly on an Ireland basis and a local basis, whether in County Wexford or Dublin?  The witnesses will move on.  They will be elected to the D&aacute;il and will be Ministers in due course.  What sort of forums need to be put in place ensure that those coming up through the organisation in five or ten years' time can actually see the issues that are being raised and can track that it is actually being put in place and they are not just getting warm words from politicians about this?</p><p> Ms Agrawal's speech was particularly informed.  It would not have been out of place in the European Parliament.  However, that is not always the case for people of Ms Agrawal's generation.  Does she believe there is a dearth of information, especially about European issues, whether through formal education or any of the organisations she is involved in?  Would she like to see more information about how the EU works and how all three of the witnesses could influence those decisions?  If so, how could that best be achieved?  There is no point in us saying nice things and asking the questions.  The most important thing we can take out of today's meeting is for the witnesses give us substantive things that we can work on.  I thank the witnesses for attending and for taking the day off school to present here today.</p></speech>

They are very connected to each other.  In writing my speech, the information I used was not anything from school or anything that was formally given to me.  I did a lot of research.  I am really interested in EU affairs, policies and initiatives that have been taken because they affect me.  They affect many people, but some do not know what is affecting them.  The engagement could be done through councils and entities that have children sitting on them, have young people voicing their concerns about policies, educating and spreading awareness on what the EU is doing for us and how we can contribute to change.  It would be extremely helpful if young people had a voice in European affairs and education on European affairs.  As a young person, education is one of the most important things for me.  In CSPE, I learned about politics in Ireland, but not on an international or European level.  I would love to receive that education.</p></speech>

There are already many organisations, forums and groups that cover what young people want to say, but on the manner in which it is dealt with, it is usually swept under a rug, almost.  There is not much done with the information provided.  I do not mean to be rude, but it almost works as a two-way street, to some degree.  I have spoken to young people and many of them did not know that the Erasmus programme existed until I spoke to them.  It is very much two way in that manner.  They do not know what the EU is doing for them, but the EU does not know what they want.</p></speech>

Every person my age that I know is on social media.  That could be a good way of building it in.  The European Youth Parliament, in particular, it is modelled on the European Parliament.  We spend days working on, researching and putting together resolutions.  It seems a shame for all of those opinions not to be used.</p></speech>

It is an invaluable resource in terms of information.  However, I know that not every young person goes through the course.  I call Deputy Howlin.</p></speech>

M&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas as na r&aacute;itis th&aacute;bhachtacha sin.  We certainly need to readjust ourselves to a listening mode, from what the witnesses have said.  I have two questions.  When President Macron embarked on the future of Europe dialogue, there was a certain dryness about it.  There was a certain staleness about the notion that we were going to look at the institutions, how they operate and perhaps consider majority voting and so on.  I think that has changed because of the invasion of Ukraine.  The idea of Europe and the values of Europe have been re-looked at, with countries such as Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia applying for EU membership.</p> <p>  My first question concerns the idea of Europe that the founders of the EU had, post-war and after centuries of conflict.  Is that a thing?  Is it something that young people get?  Do people appreciate that they want the notion of a democratic entity with values that are European?  I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' perspectives on that.</p> <p>  My second question builds on Deputy Richmond's question.  How well did the outreach to young people, in this outreach process, work?  Obviously, the witnesses are very well-informed individuals.  How representative do the witnesses think they are in terms of their state of knowledge?  From what has happened in the outreach process, can we do things better?  Have the witnesses suggestions on how to do that.</p></speech>

It could be done by showing young people bill digests, which could show them their input it is being taken into account and that a particular bill has what they want included in it.  We could even show them their input is going into the European Parliament or the Council of Europe and is being considered, or at least shown to be considered.</p></speech>

I try to avoid conflict as much as possible.  I do not know whether, generally speaking, they are as well recognised in our age group.  I try to recognise them.  I would not consider myself to be the most well-informed person here with regard to legislation and everything along those lines, but I try.</p></speech>

It blends into the Deputy's second question on whether we are informed about legislation.  It is hard, because sometimes we forget we are only 15 or 16.  It is really hard to digest all the different legislation and things that are happening.  I think the vision of the EU still exists and there is some meaning to it.  I think we recognise we are part of a bigger union that was essentially set up to help us.  However, it gets lost somewhere because we do not understand as much as we should.</p></speech>

We are not quite used to synopsised, short narrative.  They will also discover very quickly that I am not used to it myself.  They have dealt with a fair amount.  The big issue to which we should be listening, as Deputy Howlin said, is the idea of engagement.  Ms Agrawal got it there in that Brexit, the pandemic and the illegal invasion by Russia of Ukraine, have probably shown us the absolute necessity of Europe and co-operation, if people had any doubts beforehand.  Mr. Galvin was talking about Bill digests which tells a tale that the members of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g are probably outliers.  Deputy Richmond, I and others were involved in the Conference on the Future of Europe.  I completely understand making a considerable number of points and none of them making it on to paper and being utterly disregarded.  That conference became a better process as it went on.  It made many mistakes.  Were the witnesses even aware of the Conference on the Future of Europe, the meetings and Ireland's engagements at it?  Were they aware it was happening to any degree?</p></speech>

I had a meeting yesterday in the estate where I live.  It was one of the first issues that people brought up with regard to drug dealing, crime and their impact.  I could not see how that would not be brought up during the entirety of what is meant to be engagement with all citizens throughout Europe.  There is an abject failure, not only to deal with young people, but to deal with large sections of society.</p> <p>  We are engaging with the members of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g who are interested.  It is how we engage those who are not interested.  People are distanced from politics in this day and age.  They are definitely distanced from European politics.  The fact that our guests all know the constituent institutions within the European Union makes them complete outliers.  I doubt most people on the street know what the European Council, the European Commission or the European Parliament are.  Ireland at this stage is probably different from it was ten years ago when we were dealing with austerity, which was seen to have been imposed to some extent by Europe.  People are happy with Europe and see it as a good thing, not only in terms of the peace project but also because it is the means of necessary co-operation at this point in time.</p> <p>  The members of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g have already gone through the issues that are important to them.  They spoke about social media.  We could get into the rights and wrongs of social media companies.  Europe has made some sort of moves with regard to taking them to task.  What can be done, in real terms, to reach other people?  How do we interest the disinterested, especially young people?  At the Conference on the Future of Europe, we heard that its engagement would continue in future.  This is engagement of which the members of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g were unaware.  What can be done to involve our guests and other people?  I said there would be a bit of ponderous meandering.</p> <p>  I have other questions on European politics and what should be happening on a couple of the major issues.  Climate change is an issue throughout Europe.  People became very worried about Marine Le Pen.  Climate change is almost a weapon for the likes of Ms Le Pen but that will be the case until we can show that the state will step up to the mark throughout Europe, as opposed to putting further pressure on young people.  My view is that there needs to be a step change in that respect.  What is the view of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g's members?  Will they pick a couple of the major issues?</p></speech>

Obviously, you will find people who do not find interest in these things but the majority of the time, people just do not know that these things exist because we have not been taught that in school.  In junior cycle, civic, social and political education, CSPE, was a one-hour class every week.  Sometimes, we did national news and at other times we talked about recent news stories but it was not a set curriculum in which we had discussions about the European Union, the UN or policies that affect this generation.</p> <p>  Only certain people take either politics and society or economics, where the European Union is discussed in that sense, as leaving certificate subjects.  Interesting this generation would be just showing it information.  You would then naturally find people who did not think they were interested but when they have been given the source through education and have to get to school and sit through and listen to it, you would find many of them are interested.  I do not know how we would interest the disinterested but I keep bringing up education because it is very important.  Education on the European Union and international affairs is crucial.  I have forgotten the Deputy's second question.</p></speech>

I mentioned climate change but I asked the members of Comhairle na n&Oacute;g to pick a number of issues in terms of what they believe, from the perspective of their generation, needs to be done at a political level and at a European level, in particular.  They should feel free to throw in an issue that matters to them.</p></speech>

There is climate change, war and a global pandemic.  It is overwhelming.  If we narrow it down, climate change is one of the most important issues to this generation.  We have seen school strikes and people on the street saying what needs to be done in rural areas to amplify marginalised voices.  We then talk about social media and younger children of 11 or 12 years going on to social media apps such as Instagram and the apps completely changing their view on the world and how they perceive themselves.  A lot of things are detrimental to this education but there is also a flip side to it in that climate change has taught us so much about the environment and the world we live in and how we can change it.  Social media is an amazing invention.  It has taught me a lot about opportunities around me and what I am interested in.  Flipping these issues and turning them into positives could definitely help.</p></speech>

In terms of interesting the disinterested, if people want to be heard, then they are worth listening to.  As Ms Agrawal put it, education is incredibly important when it comes to these issues.  I apologise.  I need to just gather my thoughts.</p></speech>

It is more about delving into the issue of people who are mildly interested.  To get those people interested, aside from bribery, one could show them what the European Union has done for us.  Many people do not even know about roaming charges.  That was a massive piece of legislation and work done by the European Union.  Not many young people are aware that this happened or that they existed.  It is a matter of education.  One cannot force a person into something in which he or she is not interested, but if you just tell them - I do not want to say it like this - the bare minimum, that can fuel their interest further.  We believe the social, personal and health education, SPHE, and CSPE programmes are flawed because they do not complete the outcome they were designed to achieve.  It is more a matter of considering those programmes and trying to change them.</p><p> As regards the Deputy's second question, one of the major topics currently for young people is transport.  It has a lot to do with independence.  In rural areas in particular, there is much discussion of climate change and going green, but if, in a virtuous attempt to do something, one takes away a person's ability to go anywhere, I cannot see how that benefits anyone.  It would almost be better to target urban areas because although rural areas have a lot of emissions, targeting transport there is not a good idea, especially considering they have such a deficit in public transport.</p><p> I refer to general supports in schools in the context of mental health skills in particular, such as in respect of panic attack crises.  I will not bring in the issue of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, because it is far too large an issue.  There is a need for general supports.  CAMHS is an difficult system to get into, with long waiting lists for its therapists.  I have never been in CAMHS but I know it is not an amazing system.</p></speech>

If people are educated properly, one will naturally find that far more people want to be heard.  As Mr. Galvin stated, the CSPE and SPHE programmes are flawed, but they are a good starting point on which to build.  A change, even a minor one, in the curriculum is all that is needed to light the spark.</p> <p>  As regards the most important issues, there is an argument to be made that climate change is the most important issue because it relates to where young people will be going.  If something is not done about it, they will be living in a world that is not feasible to live in.  That is a major point of education in the context of the programmes as well.   Mental health is another good one, as is support for minority groups such as the LGBTQ community.  That support has been getting a lot better in recent years but there is still a deficit there in terms of how minority groups are seen and treated.</p></speech>

In fairness, our guests were very clear in respect of the work that needs to be done on bridging the gaps, particularly as regards information.  I have taken on board all their points in respect of the issues.  None of it is shocking.  It was all very well put.

Our guests have highlighted the lack of engagement of politicians at local, national and European levels with youth.</p> <p>  What does it mean to our guests to be a good European?</p> <p>  What are their views on a voting age of 16?</p> <p>  I also ask for their views on the effects the pandemic and the associated restrictions have had on young people in this country.  How did that affect them?</p> <p>  I refer to the European grants that are available for youth.  There are many grants available, such as from the European Youth Foundation.  How does one get the word out about those grants?  Very few Irish groups are on the list when those grants are announced.</p> <p>  What are our guests' two biggest worries as young people in Ireland today?</p> <p>  Those are my questions.

I could go on and on about how those two years impacted me personally, but also my generation.  First, I referred in my opening remarks to technology being such an integral part of the pandemic, both positively and negatively.  Social media and the Internet are so useful to me because I can stay connected and updated about things that are happening around the world.  I started getting interested in politics and global affairs because I saw all these movements, such as Black Lives Matter, and policies that were happening all over the world while I was just at home, isolating or doing school online, and I thought there was something more that could be done.  The pandemic was definitely an eye-opener for many people, but it was not the best for the mental health of people around the world.  We were at home without social contact.  We were not meeting up with anyone.  We were at home for the majority of the time, on our phones and almost overdosing on social media, scrolling for hours on end and almost getting indoctrinated by the screen.  When we got back to school, one could see how we had changed.  We were a lot quieter and shyer because we had not had social contact in two years.  There were added mental health pressures caused by being at home for two years, not knowing oneself as much and feeling that we almost missed our teenage years in that sense.  It was a really difficult transition.  On a European level, more could have been done in respect of mental health awareness.  That was the biggest thing we probably needed at the time - someone or something to tell us that mental health can get bad and that is okay.  There is a need for support systems because it is difficult to go tell a teacher at school that your mental health is bad but it is even more difficult to be at home wondering what to do.</p></speech>

I may be in the minority to some degree in this regard.</p><p>I have heard that young people are not too supportive of lowering the voting age.  I believe voting at 16 years of age would be a positive and effective change, if not for the entirety of elections then perhaps just for MEP elections.  Many countries have started out with lowering the voting age to 16 and allowing for the collection of data on how those elections fared.  In certain countries, such as, I believe, Scotland, the turnout for that age group jumped massively.  In Austria, over time, turnout lowered slightly for young people but it has continued to be quite high.</p></speech>

I do not mean that as an insult; it is my anecdotal experience.  It would be a two-part process.  It would relate to how educated people are.  If the CSPE programme were built upon in a way that would inform people of the different parties they could vote for, that would increase the number of people who vote.</p> <p>  With regard to my two biggest worries, Ireland is perhaps one of the better countries for climate change but it is a worry regardless.  The inability to do anything about it would be my other biggest worry.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.342" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022051100002#G01400"><p>The witnesses are very welcome.  It is brilliant to hear real voices talking about the real issues.  It makes a pleasant change.  I represent Wicklow.  A large event was organised by Wicklow Comhairle na n&Oacute;g last Friday and was attended by more than 100 young people.  They broke into workshops, and I had the privilege of sitting in on some of them and hearing about some of the real issues.  It is great to hear the witnesses articulate many of the issues raised at that meeting.  The issues included everything from mental health, the illegal invasion of Ukraine, hate speech, climate and biodiversity to drug use and a lot of other issues.  The meeting was in line with what the witnesses identified as the real issues.</p> <p>  I want to pick up on a couple of points.  Reducing the voting age to 16 is something I firmly believe should happen.  The case of Scotland was raised by Mr. Galvin.  The level of engagement by young people, the education built around that and the turnout on the initial day was fascinating to watch.</p> <p>  A significant piece of work was done in Leinster House in the previous D&aacute;il term when a Bill tabled by my one of my colleagues, Senator Fintan Warfield, to reduce the voting age to 16 worked its way through the Seanad.  Unfortunately, it did not progress.  To see the level of engagement by young people in that process was fascinating.  Having the witnesses before us today shows there is a level of knowledge.  In my view, the witnesses are the very reason the age should be reduced to 16.  That is not to be patronising; I am saying this because they are so articulate in terms of the issues.  From an educational perspective, getting young people engaged in decision-making is something that should happen.  </p> <p>  To follow up on the question of whether the witnesses think the voting age should be reduced, would reducing the voting age to 16 force the people who make legislation at European and State level sit up and listen to people like the witnesses?  I have heard from young people that they speak, but there is a perception that the people who make the legislation are not listening.  Would reducing the voting age help to change that and ensure the voices of young people would be heard, listened to and acted upon?</p> <p>  Over the past three months we have seen the fallout from the horrific invasion of Ukraine.  That has also shaped a debate in this State around Irish neutrality.  We have predominantly middle-aged people talking about our neutrality.  If a decision was taken to drop our neutrality, the young people who are not making that decision would be affected.  It would be fascinating to hear a young person's perspective on neutrality.  The witnesses are the sort of young people who, in such a scenario, would be sent to the front line in a war situation as, unfortunately, we are seeing in Ukraine.  I would like to hear their views on whether young people are engaged with and aware of the debate on neutrality.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses.  They have done very well today.  The issues they have identified on behalf of their peers are consistent with issues raised by many of the people I had the pleasure of meeting the other day.</p></speech>

I had not thought about whether it would have a knock-on effect when it comes to people our age being listened to, which it definitely would.  It is something to take into account.  There are many layers that need to be considered when thinking about lowering the voting age.  I would be more in favour of lowering the voting age having heard what the Deputy has said.</p> <p>  With regard to neutrality, I consider myself a pacifist.  I am a massive advocate for non-violence.  What is happening with Putin and Ukraine is unprecedented in the 21st century.  It is appalling.  That goes without saying.  However, where a diplomatic solution is possible, which I think it is in most cases, or at least should be, neutrality is necessary or at least helpful in fostering that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.344" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Leo Galvin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022051100002#G01600"><p>Lowering the voting age would certainly force politicians to consider a young person's point of view and recognise young people's problems, because if such a change was made to the law, it would encompass a large portion of the electorate.  Young people would be listened to much more because their voices would matter more to politicians if they were being told they can vote for them now and, therefore, they have to appeal to that cohort.</p><p> On neutrality, I believe very strongly that Ireland should remain completely neutral.  Warmongering is not something that is positive.  In our country&rsquo;s history we have experienced what war and fighting result in.  It is not long ago that we had the effects of a war, or an unconventional war, occurring on the Irish isle.  I would strongly say that Ireland should remain neutral in all senses of the word.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.346" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Prachi Agrawal" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022051100002#H00200"><p>I completely agree with what Mr. O&rsquo;Brien and Mr. Galvin said.  In regard to voting at 16, I have not formed an opinion yet.  However, I believe that, if given the vote, we would obviously be taken more seriously and given more of a thought by politicians because, as Mr. Galvin said, they would appeal to us and, in their campaigns, do things that appeal to 16-year-olds and those under or over 16.  I support lowering the voting age.  That is all I can say on that for now.</p> <p>  Neutrality, again, is something I feel extremely strongly about.  In the 21st century, talking about going off to war is dystopian.  It should not be happening.  However, if it is, Ireland can help in many other ways, such as through immigration policy.  We have accepted many Ukrainians into the country, which is fantastic.  Helping in those aspects is much more helpful than, as Mr. Galvin said, warmongering.  I believe that neutrality is important to Ireland as well.</p></speech>

It is all well and good for middle-aged people to talk about neutrality and what it means but it is young people who would ultimately be put on any front line.  The voices of our young guests are powerful and I thank them.</p></speech>

I am sure it is a little intimidating but hopefully they have relaxed more into it.  It is very interesting to draw out their opinions on so many issues, including climate change, neutrality, the voting age and so forth.  It has been a learning exercise for us.  We get the message loud and clear that the voices of young people need to be heard and that is not quite happening at the moment.</p> <p>  We are celebrating 50 years of Ireland&rsquo;s membership in the European Union this week.  We had Europe Day on Monday.  The presentations are part of the week-long schedule of activity.  We had a comprehensive debate in the D&aacute;il yesterday about Europe Day and what Europe means to us all.  It is clear that membership of the European Union has transformed Irish society.  We joined in 1972.  Looking back on it, and I do not remember the 1950s and the period prior to membership, but Ireland was a very dark place at the time.  The European Union dragged Ireland kicking and screaming into the 20th and 21st centuries.  That is something we need to be conscious of.</p> <p>  The European Union espouses liberal democratic values and tolerance.  The vision and ideals of the European Union must relate to young people, in particular.  When we consider the Brexit vote in the UK in 2016 which led the UK to leave the European Union, it is interesting that research shows that young people voted in very large numbers to remain in the European Union and it was the older people who wanted to leave.  That tells a message as well.  Even in regard to rule of law issues, when the Polish Government introduced LGBTIQ+ exclusion zones, the European Union was very strong in saying that it was just not acceptable.  Countries have to adhere to the values and ideals of the European Union if they want to be a member of the Union.  I just put that out to our guests and hope they agree that the European Union is particularly good for young people in respect of the values that it espouses.  I hope they will agree with me on that.  </p> <p>  On climate change, which Ms Agrawal and others mentioned, the European Union is to the forefront in dealing with it.  Ms Agrawal mentioned the European Green Deal and so forth.  That is just one issue.  Countries such as Russia, China and India are not pulling their weight in regard to dealing with climate change, which is a big worry.  However, the European Union is to the forefront of that.  </p> <p>  Do our guests agree that the European Union is actually good for young people?  Where do they see themselves going in the future?  Would any of them consider a political career, for want of a better word, joining a political party or becoming actively involved in politics?  They have taken big steps in coming here today and becoming involved in Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  Would any of them pursue politics formally and perhaps run for office in a local council or the D&aacute;il some day?</p></speech>

Ireland is much more of a moderate country, politically speaking.  We do not have many extremist parties or extremist views.  I believe the European Union, to some extent, is very much the same in that regard.  As such, I very much agree with the values of the European Union.</p> <p>  On the second question as to whether we are considering some sort of role in politics, I would not be certain of it.  Politics is a very complicated field to get into and especially to begin with.  The world of political parties is an incredibly difficult one to navigate as well.  I would shy away from political parties, but I would stand by organisations or different points from a very utilitarian sort of point of view.  I would not side with any politics, if that makes sense.</p></speech>

I believe it was Senator Keogan who asked the question of what it means to be a good European.  What it means to be a good European and a good person in general are essentially one in the same.  It means, for example, being tolerant of others, respectful, kind and actively trying to help people.  That is why I would not necessarily consider politics as my first career option.  I would perhaps skew more in favour of therapy or counselling, considering the mental health deficit that more or less everyone is experiencing, especially in the wake of the pandemic and everything happening in Ukraine and the world over, essentially.  Helping people with that would be my main priority.  The way we perceive the world around us impacts on our mental health.  If that can be fixed, then the issues themselves do not matter to the individual as much.  That is not to say the issues are not important or anything, because obviously they are.</p></speech>

The whole idea of diversity, inclusivity and culture is one that interests me very much.</p><p>I hope that in the coming decades the world will have this unity of tolerance and inclusion with every country.  In Ireland we learn about European countries through modern foreign languages.  Irish is recognised as a national language in the European Union.  It is amazing for our culture and heritage and for learning about other cultures.  I am very interested in politics.  Perhaps one day I might decide to run in a general election.  I am not sure because there are not many young people in the D&aacute;il at present.  I am not sure how inclusive it would be for me to go into an election as the youngest in it.  I am not sure the Government likes young people in politics that much.</p></speech>

I will use this as a preamble to introduce Senator Martin, who is an example of somebody who was not a member of a political party in university but he championed and campaigned on various causes.  It was politics without being part of a formal organisation.  That is a big build-up for him.</p></speech>

Deputy Haughey's question was a good one.  I hope the witnesses think about it because they would be wonderful additions but they must have the calling.  I spoke to someone I had not seen in a number of years who had entered the seminary as a priest.  He did not stay for too long and only did a couple of years.  When I asked him about it he said he did not have a vocation but his mother had one for him.  He realised he did not have it himself.  It has to come from within.  There are many types of callings in politics.  There are advisers in the background and people involved in communications.  Without telling the witnesses who know so much what to do, perhaps they could put their toes in the water by checking out student union politics.  This would give them a flavour and taste for it.  The witnesses are wonderful ambassadors.  This has been insightful session.  I am sorry I had to leave to go to the Seanad and I privately apologised to the Chair.  I returned because it is wonderful the witnesses are here.</p> <p>  I have several questions that are not connected.  A bugbear of mine has been the lack of law on the curriculum at second level.  Until a few years ago I was trying to demystify the law in second level schools with the public access to law programme.  Do the witnesses agree it is a shame it is not on the State curriculum?  The function of a proper legal system is part of the democratic process </p> <p>  I know the witnesses are discerning and they have the undoubted capacity but do they have the time to analyse, assess and differentiate between advocates of various methods of how to tackle climate change?  I have not met a politician who is against tackling climate change.  I am not politicising it and I will not say what party I or anyone else is in.  It can be a generalisation.  Do the witnesses have time to drill down a little bit?  They are leaders.  Some people say they are totally in favour of tackling climate change but might be utterly against any imposition of carbon tax or considering water as a finite resource, even among the most well-off.  There are people with the genuinely held view, with which I do not agree, that cutting sod turf should not be stopped.  They say they are totally in favour of tackling climate change but that sod turf should remain.  I do not want the witnesses to tell me the differential results of it but have they had an opportunity to drill down behind the slogan on tackling climate change and look at what people want to do in this respect?  I am not necessarily speaking about party politics but individuals.  There is a wide sphere of approaches to this biggest challenge facing humanity.  I would love to get the views of the witnesses on this.  Do they assess various ways of taking tangible steps to achieve the desired response?</p></speech>

I believe law should be taught but that is only because I have an interest in it.  For many people law is an incredibly long-winded subject that takes a long time even to comprehend let alone get into the details of it.</p></speech>

Law itself as a subject would not serve much of a purpose unless people went on to do a law programme.  Even then, an advance placement in college could suit that fancy.  That would be a difficult vocation to get into.  It falls back to the interest of students and the interest people have in law and politics.  We are not ingrained with this interest.  It is only that if people happen to have it, they can go and search for it.</p></speech>

If people are not aware of the political sides of the argument or the people campaigning for it, I am not too certain how it would go.  Our organisation works on a consultative and project basis.  Unless we are doing a project on climate change, we would not examine a person or group for this type of work.</p></speech>

If law becomes the subject, why would we not learn about engineering at post-primary level?  Law is important in the sense that we should know about the Constitution and our rights, but it could be introduced through other ways in the curriculum, such as civil social and political education courses or social, personal and health education.  Law as a subject on its own might not appeal to many people.  It might cause some people to lose interest because they would have been learning it for six years and would think they know everything they need to know about it.  This is my opinion.  I do not think law should be a subject but we should learn about certain aspects of it such as the Constitution.</p> <p>  With regard to climate change and analysing exactly what needs to be done, in our organisation we focus on issues that affect young people such as fast fashion.  We have worked on this for the past two years.  Identifying how it affects us is the way we analyse it.  Climate change impacts different people in different ways.  Everyone has some solutions.</p></speech>

We should definitely know our constitutional rights and we should know about the legal system.  Elements of the legal system can come up in subjects such as history and English specifically.  It would come in to civil, social and political education the most, and that curriculum could be changed to teach us about our rights and how the legal system in Ireland works.  It would also come into being educated on various tactics or strategies for tackling climate change.</p><p>There is a definitely a responsibility on young people and people in general to do individual research on how they feel about it and what they would do about it.  If it were part of the curriculum, it would go a long way to ingrain it more into our lives and give us a more active reason to think about it, as opposed to it being an ethereal thing we cannot really grasp.</p></speech>

From the feedback from the members here today, this has been quite a significant intervention.  Sometimes things can be a one-off and tokenistic but perhaps the committee should have a further discussion on keeping this going in terms of hearing the voice of young people.  Today was very important.  We are thankful and grateful to you, our guests, for having the courage, first of all, to come before us and then being so honest, frank, comprehensive, precise, concise and illuminating.  We have all been out of the loop for the past few years.  We just do not pick up where we left off.  The world has changed.  Everything has changed.  Commissioner Johansson was here a few weeks ago and she said, "You are only ... [young] once, but you are 50 forever".  It was a very interesting one.  We have to listen to you, our guests, because you are the next generation.  You lost out a good bit during the Covid lockdown and we must be very attentive to what you are saying.  We are grateful to you for coming here today.  I thank you so much for doing so.  Ar&iacute;s, ar son an choiste, gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas libh f&aacute; choinne an taispe&aacute;ntais chuimsithigh.

Deputy Tully is substituting for Deputy Farrell and Deputy Matthews also sends his apologies.</p> <p>  No. 6 on today's agenda is the minutes of the joint committee's meeting of 4 May 2022.  They were agreed at the earlier meeting.  No. 7 on the agenda is an engagement with former members of the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal.  I welcome members and viewers who may be watching the proceedings on Oireachtas TV to the public session of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure, Reform, and Taoiseach.  The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss the disabled drivers and passengers scheme with the former chair and a former member of the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal.  They are Dr. Cara McDonagh, former chair of the board, and Dr. Nicky Scaramuzzi, a former member of board.  Dr. McDonagh will make some brief opening remarks, which will be followed by a question and answer session from members.</p> <p>  I draw attention to privilege because we cannot malign or draw attention to anybody outside the House who cannot answer for himself or herself.  Using the privilege of the Houses to make remarks about somebody else is not allowed and we cannot do that.  I am not suggesting for a minute the witnesses would do it.  It happens from time to time, much to the chagrin of the committee.  We must deal with it as it comes up.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  We must take that with a grain of salt too with some of what we see from time to time, including recently.  However, I remind members attending remotely that the constitutional requirement is the members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament sits, namely, Leinster House.</p> <p>  I invite Dr. McDonagh to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.378" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cara McDonagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022051100002#A00300"><p>The disabled drivers scheme began in 1968 as a tax relief for drivers who suffered from a permanent disability, mainly affecting those with traumatic spinal cord injury and lower limb amputation who were largely dependent on a wheelchair for mobility.  The scheme was extended in 1979 to include disabled passengers with severe disabilities, and this included babies and children who had severe permanent mobility disability and who fulfilled the strict medical criteria.  In 1990, the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, DDMBA, was established by the Department of Finance to review individuals whose application for the primary medical certificate, PMC, was unsuccessful at local HSE level.<br/><br/>Section 92 of the Finance Act of 1989 enabled the Minister for Finance to make regulations providing for repayment of excise, road tax and VAT in respect of vehicles used or driven by persons who are severely and permanently disabled.  In 1994, the disabled drivers and disabled passengers regulations introduced the six medical criteria.  The regulations state &quot;the eligibility on medical grounds of disabled persons who are severely and permanently disabled shall be assessed by reference to any one or more of the following medical criteria&quot;.  It is important for the committee members to hear these six medical criteria the DDMBA was obliged to use to assess persons appealing the decision not to grant the primary medical certificate.  They were:</p> <blockquote> 	(a) persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;<br /><br />(b) persons wholly without the use of one of their legs and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to the movement of their lower limbs;<br /><br />(c) persons without both hands or without both arms;<br /><br />(d) persons without one or both legs;<br /><br />(e) persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;<br /><br />(f) persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </blockquote> <p>It does not take a medical qualification to know that the language used in these criteria is bizarre and the criteria are very restrictive and exclude many people with genuine, severe and permanent disability from accessing supports.  For example, the person with weakness on one side of the body from a stroke, traumatic brain injury or cerebral palsy may be excluded, as may the person with an amputated or absent upper limb, or a child with physical or neurological and development disorders who needs specialised seating.  These are just some examples among the many people who have genuine disability and require an adapted vehicle but do not qualify under the medical criteria.<br/><br/>Persons wishing to avail of the disabled drivers and passengers scheme are first assessed at community level by community doctors.  If deemed ineligible at this level they can appeal the decision to DDMBA.  The board operates independently of the assessment process carried out by the local HSE community medical officers.  The members of the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal are medical practitioners appointed by the Minister for Finance on the recommendation of the Minister for Health for a serving period of four years.</p><p>The adjudicating panel at all clinics comprised the chair and two ordinary board members.  In the years between 2010 and 2019, only between 1% and 8% of persons were successful at appeal hearing with the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal.<br/><br/>I was appointed chairperson of the DDMBA in 2015 as part of my appointment as a consultant in rehabilitation medicine in the National Rehabilitation Hospital, NRH.  Concerns about the restrictive and inequitable nature of the medical criteria were expressed by my predecessors.  Within the first year of my appointment, at interactions with the Department of Finance I expressed my strongly held view that the scheme needed to be changed.  In June 2018, the board formally wrote to the Department of Finance laying out our concerns about the inflexible and discriminatory nature of the criteria and the need for the scheme to be revised or updated.  We did not receive a reply despite expressing our willingness to discuss further.  I continued to link with the officials in the Department of Finance on a regular basis and meetings were held in the National Rehabilitation Hospital and the Department of Finance at which I repeatedly outlined our concerns about the difficulty in fairly applying the criteria and the inequitable nature of the scheme.  The DDMBA also had regular requests from the Office of the Ombudsman in relation to complaints made to it in respect of the decisions taken by the board.<br/><br/>In June 2020, the Supreme Court found against the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal and the Minister for Finance in an appeal brought by two persons who had not been granted a primary medical certificate at an appeal hearing.  The court went on to quash the board&rsquo;s decision and granted a declaration that in applying the criteria set out in regulation 3, in other words the medical criteria, to the appellants the board failed to vindicate their rights under section 92 of the Act.  As stated by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, in an answer to a parliamentary question in July of 2021, &quot;The judgement found that the medical criteria set out in the Regulations did not align with the regulation making mandate given in the primary legislation to further define criteria for &lsquo;severely and permanently disabled&rsquo; persons.&quot;<br/><br/>All assessments for the primary medical certificate were suspended at community level and at the DDMBA following the Supreme Court ruling.  I engaged regularly with the Department of Finance between June and November 2020 via telephone, email and video link.  During this time, I repeatedly expressed my opinion that the Supreme Court decision further vindicated our concerns about the medical criteria and emphasised the importance of progressing rapidly with a comprehensive review of the scheme and complete revision.  During this time, the Minister&rsquo;s official responsible for the scheme had advised me that the Minister planned to have new legislation prepared in time for the Finance Bill 2021.  It is my recollection that in September 2020, his official also spoke to me about a plan to insert the existing medical criteria into primary legislation.  I expressed my view that I and the other board members would not be willing to continue to use the existing medical criteria after the Supreme Court ruling and that I felt this approach was a retrograde step.  The Minister for Finance made the decision to make an amendment to the Finance Bill 2020 to allow for the existing medical criteria in primary legislation.  The legislation was amended without any notification to the DDMBA and I only became aware of this change when allied health staff in the National Rehabilitation Hospital informed me in late 2020 that assessments for the primary medical certificate would resume in January 2021.<br/><br/>In December 2020, I wrote directly to the Minister for Finance on foot of this change to the legislation to express our concerns about the course of action taken by him.  I also again expressed our concerns about the lack of any significant action on a new scheme for disabled drivers and passengers in the six months since the Supreme Court decision.  To quote my letter, &quot;the DDMBA have unanimously stated that they will not be able to assess appellants for the PMC using the same medical criteria whether in legislation or not given the recent Supreme court ruling and their long- held view that the scheme is inequitable&quot;.  The Minister wrote back to me on 21 January 2021 and requested that we reconsider our decision to avoid &quot;directly penalising applicants who otherwise may have their cases successfully appealed by the Medical Board&quot;.  I wrote back to the Minister in March 2021 and advised that we would be willing to resume appeal hearings to clear the backlog from 2020, a period during which public health measures meant that appeal hearings were suspended.  My letter stated:</p><blockquote>	  	[H]owever, continuing new hearings on the basis of the existing medical criteria after the backlog of current appeals is cleared is fundamentally a wrong way of continuing our work in equity and disability terms for disabled drivers and passengers.  It is very important for the members of the DDMBA to see substantial progress being made towards a new scheme for disabled drivers in a timely manner...  </blockquote><p>I asked the Minister to meet with the DDMBA and, to quote my letter again, &quot;to give us reassurance that our concerns are heard and that you fully understand the inadequacies of the current scheme and the urgency of devising a new scheme for disabled drivers&quot;. <br/><br/>Members of the DDMBA met the Minister and his officials on 29 March 2021 via video link.  During that meeting, the Minister acknowledged the validity of our concerns about the scheme.  He made a commitment to put time into a process that would yield a scheme that better met the needs of those with disability.  He also talked about the need to deal with this issue in the Finance Bill in December 2021.  He told us he had been in contact with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O&rsquo;Gorman, to see if his Department would co-chair a review with him in relation to these issues.  He also said that if that Department was not going to participate or did not get back to him quickly, he would get this work under way within his Department.  Overall, the Minister accepted that there were issues and recognised that the board was making decisions that were even more demanding than they should be.  He accepted the validity of the points we made and said he was going to put time into getting the scheme to a better place during the year.  Due to these reassurances, I told the Minister that the DDMBA would be willing to clear the backlog of appellants from 2020, but that we were very reluctant to see new appeals from January 2021 until we saw substantial progress on a new scheme.  I had also indicated this to him in my letter of March 2021.<br/><br/>Appeal hearings with the DDMBA resumed in April 2021.  In ensuing months, we worked through the backlog of appellants from 2020 as agreed following our meeting with the Minister.  Between July and September 2021, there were an unprecedented number of complaints made to the Ombudsman in relation to our decisions not to grant primary medical certificates.  There was no demonstrable progress on a new scheme for disabled drivers and passengers during this time and I remained in contact with officials in the Department of Finance.<br/><br/>The scoping exercise talked of in the autumn of 2020 by Department officials had not yielded anything despite assurances that they would soon forward documents to me in November 2020.  On 2 September 2021, more than five months after our meeting with the Minister, I wrote again to the Minister requesting an update on progress towards a new scheme for disabled drivers and passengers.  On 9 September 2021, I spoke to a Department official responsible for the scheme and he admitted that there had been little or no progress.  On 14 October 2021, having received no indication of any significant progress on a new scheme 16 months after the Supreme Court ruling, I wrote to the Minister giving notice of my intention to resign on 11 November 2021 when the last appeals clinic was scheduled to clear the cohort from 2020.  As I stated in my resignation letter, as a medical professional who in my clinical role cares for people with disability and makes every effort to advocate on their behalf, I could no longer participate in a scheme that is unfair and denies assistance to people with genuine disability.  I remained in post until 30 November to deal with any paperwork or issues resulting from the last clinics.  Within 24 hours of my notice of resignation, two other board members had resigned and the remaining two board members tendered their resignations within weeks.  On the day I gave notice of my resignation, and after the Department of Finance had received my resignation, I was sent a letter from the Minister in response to my letter of 2 September 2021 requesting an update.  Unfortunately, this letter did not alter my decision to resign.<br/><br/>Since December 2021, I and two other members of DDMBA have participated in a subgroup to review the disabled drivers and passengers scheme set up by the Department of Finance.  My understanding from Department officials is that it is agreed that our review will come under the national disability inclusion strategy, NDIS, working group tasked with reviewing all Government-funded transport supports for those with disability.  I and other members of the DDMBA have repeatedly expressed our willingness to lend our experience and expertise to devising a new and fairer scheme.<br/><br/>I believe this statement demonstrates that the decision to resign from our positions on the DDMBA was a difficult one for board members and it did not happen without us making every effort to highlight the inadequacies of the scheme and to repeatedly advocate for comprehensive revision.  We have always tried to engage constructively with the Department and the Minister to try to push for change.  Unfortunately, on professional and ethical grounds, I felt my position as chairperson was untenable as I could no longer preside over a scheme that was inequitable and there seemed no urgency to even start the process of change.</p></speech>

I want to get a greater understanding of the events that led to the entire board resigning.  I am sure it was not something board members did lightly as professionals dealing with people with disabilities and the difficulties there and having indicated at an earlier stage that they could not continue to assess but took the commitments at their word.  I also want to look to where we go forward and how the scheme needs to be fixed so we can provide the necessary supports and not force families into the situation they are in.</p> <p>  As a committee we have sought the correspondence on numerous occasions and the secretary to the committee has written to the Department of Finance and the Minister's office over a dozen times.  We have raised this every week and sought all the correspondence in the Department on this but we have not got it.  We made the point in private session that the Department stonewalling us on this issue is not acceptable.  There was a verbal commitment that all correspondence would be given.  Yesterday or in the last couple of hours we got some correspondence-----</p></speech>

It was an FOI I received two months ago and nothing else.  Going back to the 2018 letter, I am struck by the absence of acknowledgement of or response to that letter because its content was quite serious.  I invite the witnesses to talk about that.  If I am correct in my memory, that letter talked about the safety of members of the board and the anxiety and stress appellants and their families are going through.  Was a rationale given by the Department for ignoring the board reaching out at that time?</p></speech>

Our mistake was we should have sent the letter directly to the Minister for Finance at the time.  We sent it to the officials we dealt with.  We felt it would be brought to the Minister's attention.  I cannot say whether it was or not.  They always acknowledged our concerns but we were told there was not an appetite in the Department to change the scheme.  They acknowledged it was difficult for us at times.  During that phase we had a lot of very angry, aggrieved people.  That would not be infrequent but it was a particularly bad phase.  I was stood down from being chairperson at the time.  I was on leave on the days we did the clinic and Dr. McNamara was the chair.  The other board members decided on the letter.  I was in total agreement with it and involved in it.</p> <p>  I cannot answer as to why we did not get a response.  Maybe we should have pursued it but I followed up verbally and by email.  We also had a meeting in 2018 in the Department of Finance and I expressed my concerns then.  It was along with Dr. McNamara.  I wrote to them by email after that to document that we had discussed the concerns.  Nothing happened on foot of that.  Before my time as chair, I know predecessors had raised these concerns repeatedly.</p> <p>  The medical criteria are extremely difficult to apply.  One does not have to be a medical person to read those and wonder how they could be fairly applied.  Even taken as they are, there are many people they exclude who have genuine disability, need adapted vehicles and cannot understand why they cannot access anything.  If one has a scheme, it has to be more equitable.  Do not have a scheme that only applies to a small percentage of people.  </p> <p>  It is not just that the scheme tries to give benefits to those at the severe end of disability.  There are certain criteria which allow people who can drive a standard automatic vehicle access the scheme.  It really is unfair but I cannot answer as to why we did not get a response.</p></speech>

We heard from the Ombudsman that his predecessor had written on numerous occasions concerning commitments not lived up to.  Strong criticisms were made of the Department for not dealing with the issue or making the necessary changes.  I said to the current Ombudsman that if the public knew what was happening and was able to put faces and names and see how cruel the system is, it probably would not accept it.  However, it is off to the side.  The witnesses are dealing with it and seeing the families who feel the system is failing them and venting at the witnesses.  Can the witnesses explain, without personal details, cases where the current system involving the six criteria fails people with severe disabilities?  I mean people who should, in the witnesses' view, be catered for but, because of the criteria, they have to rule against them.</p></speech>

A person missing an upper limb cannot drive a standard vehicle, for instance.  Somebody who is walking but has weakness on one side and therefore needs adaptations to the vehicle, such as hand controls, generally does not qualify.  Sometimes with children it is extremely difficult because they may be at the age where they should walk, developmentally, at two or three, but are not walking.  They may start to walk so it is difficult.  Parents are trying to prove their child will not walk.  No parent wants to try to convince a doctor that their child will not walk.  They spend most of their time doing the opposite.</p> <p>  The other difficult category is children with autism spectrum disorder and many behavioural problems.  All they really need may be a special seat for their car or a bigger vehicle.  They are not asking for all the scheme can provide but that is all there is.  There is just a scheme that provides a large financial benefit when maybe they would be happy with a grant towards a vehicle or a special seat.  It is difficult to bring a child into a room with three strange doctors and try, in front of the child, to talk of the difficulties they have in transportation.  That should not be the way.</p> <p>  Nowadays we look at disability in terms of function rather than in terms of pathology, whether autism, epilepsy or stroke.  We ask what the person can do and that is how we should assess people.  We should ask what their level of function is and what they need in the vehicle, and they should qualify on that basis.</p></speech>

People with a disability feel desperate because this is the only transport option they have.  They have nothing else.  We are not dealing with the cohort of people who cannot afford to buy the car even if it is tax free.  I work in Dublin 8 and we do not get many applications because even with the primary medical cert, these people cannot afford a car.  It is unacceptable that there are young people who cannot work for that reason.</p><p>We have a reversal of what should be happening.  Instead of people coming in and being asked what they can do they are being asked to prove how bad they are.  We tell them they need to be disabled and that in addition to being disabled they need to fit into these criteria.  Then, on appeal, the majority are not disabled enough.  It is a shameful way to practise.  We are forcing a situation where in some cases people are desperately underplaying their levels of function in order to access transport.  With children we place ourselves at risk because we tell parents their child will not walk.  If that child does walk we are at risk because it is traumatic for parents.  They could come back to us and say they were traumatised.  The whole experience for the people who come in, whether they are adults or adults with a child, is traumatic.  It is doing harm.  This is where we are coming from and have been for a long time.</p></speech>

I should mention I am a former member of the committee on the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  This is an issue that was also discussed there.  There are a number of key decision points that are extraordinary to me, including the decision to appeal to the Supreme Court.  There is a Supreme Court ruling in this regard.  It seems the State, through the Minister for Finance and the board, had been fighting these individuals who were seeking their rights but the board had been expressing very serious concerns.  It is part of the culture in Ireland, unfortunately, that individuals have to seek their rights and the State pushes back at every stage.  Will the witnesses comment on how difficult the process was given that they agreed with many of the concerns?</p> <p>  I find extraordinary the amendment made in the Finance Act 2020.   The witnesses have mentioned there was no notification to the board on this legislation.  It is not simply a matter that the criteria identified as problematic were left hanging.  These criteria, which were narrow and not adequately delivering people's rights, were included again through new legislation.  There was almost a new decision by the Government to make these the criteria for access to the scheme.  Do the witnesses agree that such criteria, especially being introduced in 2020 after Ireland had ratified the UNCRPD, was an extraordinarily poor decision?  It was a new decision to embed them.  The witnesses mentioned they had been very keen to come up with a fairer scheme even if it were to be an interim scheme.  Would it have been better if the Minister have engaged with the board prior to making changes to the Finance Bill in 2020?  Would the witnesses have been able to engage with him on identifying new criteria that could be applied?</p></speech>

They did not notify us and that was not acceptable but I felt very aggrieved they thought it was a suitable solution.  The Minister, in his defence, said it was an interim plan so that appeal hearings could proceed.  I felt it was the wrong approach.  When the Supreme Court decision was made on many levels I was relieved because I felt that now they would do something and they would change the scheme.  This was what I harped on at to the officials in the Department.  I thought that surely now we were going to do something.</p> <p>  Throughout that summer and even in the autumn I was regularly in contact with them, even at times when I was not working.  I was asking them when we were going to meet and start to look at this.  Nothing happened.  One of the officials told me the Minister was thinking of putting in the medical criteria, and that he had sought legal advice and it seemed to be an interim solution.  There was never confirmation of this.  I was sitting with my team in hospital when I found out.  The occupational therapists, who liaise with community doctors about referring patients for the primary medical certificate, said it would be up and running again in January.  I had no idea it was going to happen.</p> <p>  At that point we were all decided that we would not continue and that something had to be done.  The only power we really felt we had was to say we would not do it.  He appealed to us to reconsider on behalf of the people who would appeal and get the primary medical certificate.  At that point I said we needed to meet him because we needed to know that he understood where we are at and what needed to be done.  That was when the meeting happened.  He gave us many reassurances and seemed to understand the urgency of it.  We came away from that really feeling that something was going to happen but very little did happen.  There was some background work happening but it seemed to be at a very slow pace.  There was nothing yielding from it.  We were not getting updates or documents.  Any contact was through me making contact to ask whether there was any progress.  Ultimately I felt I could not do it any more.  It became harder and harder to sit in front of people.  We made decisions after seeing people but we had to write to people after listening to their stories.  We explained everything.  We explain about the criteria but it became increasingly difficult.  We felt we had no other recourse except to resign.</p></speech>

It was something that had already been found to be inadequate after the UNCRPD was ratified.  Will the witnesses comment on this?  It strikes me that the six criteria laid out had come from a very paternalistic and narrow interpretation of disability and the needs of persons with disabilities.  The witnesses have spoken about this.  While I understand the State has a number of failings in a number of areas, and we know it failed in terms of the contracting of public transport to private operators, nobody doubts there are multiple issues to be addressed.  Effectively, it cemented the same criteria again, albeit in interim measures.  Was a different interim scheme possible?  If Minister had engaged with the witnesses do they believe a good interim scheme could have been put in place, and remained until the wider review being spoken about was completed, which would have been at least not incompatible with the UNCRPD?</p></speech>

It could have been possible.  We certainly would have been willing to work on it.  There was a period of time when no clinics were happening due to Covid.  We could have been working on it then.  From the time of the Supreme Court ruling we could not participate in clinics.  Then there was another lockdown.  We could have devoted all of that time to it.  We could have met twice a month when normally we would have been doing clinics.  There certainly could have been progress.</p> <p>  The WHO does not look at disability now in terms of pathology.  It looks at it in terms of function.  I have always said that we need to move towards a less medicalised system and more towards how the person is functioning.  We need to look at a graded system of supports.  Some people need big adaptations or a special vehicle in which a wheelchair can be placed as they will not drive themselves.  Other people just need a specialised seat or a swivel seat.  It does not have to mean a big benefit to everybody who qualifies.  It would be much better to have a graded system.  People would be happy with that by and large.  It would have been possible.  It would been challenging but it would have been possible.  If we had seen motivation and the will to start to work on it we definitely would have stayed in post.</p></speech>

Regarding the risk potentially created for board members, there is a risk associated with any public body or scheme in respect of the public duties concerning equality and human rights.  Equally, the UNCRPD is law.  The optional protocol will mean that individuals will be able to seek vindication under that rubric.  It was mentioned that an incredibly high volume of complaints was made to the Ombudsman.  As board members, was it the witnesses' sense that the decision not to address the issue was creating an inappropriate risk regarding the performance of the functions they were asked to undertake?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.393" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Cara McDonagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022051100002#E00200"><p>There was the Ombudsman's request for reports, but also solicitors' letters and legal actions.  This has gone on for many years.  It is also important to say that the DDMBA sounds very grand, but the reality is that I also have a full clinical commitment.  I undertook my work with disabled drivers as part of my role, but there was me and an administrator, while the doctors came in on a sessional basis.  We had very little support.  I refer to assistance with the sorts of legal issues mentioned.  Many legal issues arose on foot of the ruling by the Supreme Court and it was hard for me to access the legal advice.  The Department had sought it, but did not want to share it with me.  In fact, it became quite difficult and stressful to deal with that aspect.</p> <p>  It was a big factor for us.  We are clinicians, and not lawyers or specialists in international or disability law.  We knew our situation was tricky and we spent a lot of time explaining the situation to people.  Most people would have come away feeling we had understood their difficulties.  There were probably fewer complaints because of that.  Of course, people had the right to complain and we told them they had the right to complain to the Ombudsman if they were not happy with the decisions made.  All the letters received by applicants contain that information.  Most of the people getting this benefit when they appeal are people whose situations have progressed.  They have progressive conditions.  I am explaining this because the community care doctors often get this right.  The people who generally do get to avail of this scheme after appeal are generally people whose conditions have progressed, which means they meet the criteria.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.394" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Nicky Scaramuzzi" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022051100002#E00300"><p>To add to that, it is interesting to point out that in the assessment process we would have a mindful routine that we work through when we meet appellants.  We would introduce ourselves and try to keep the process similar for each person.  We would always ask them if they understand what they are with us for and what they are applying for.  It would not be an exaggeration to say that nine out of ten people at the appeal stage cannot tell us what they are with us for.  They have been told it is a driving benefit they are entitled to.  Some people think it is the parking sticker - they may have come all the way from Kerry, for example, for something they could have got through their GP.  Occasionally, we encounter someone who is incredibly well informed, but the majority of people do not know about the primary medical certificate, its definition, the legalities or the criteria.  We send out the information to them in writing and we explain the situation to them.  Some of those people are a bit shocked because they thought they had come to us so they would be able to get a benefit to enable them to buy a car or get an adaptation.  They do not realise that this is done via tax.</p> <p>  We walk people through the process and they are shocked when they realise they are not with us to get a sticker.  Therefore, people are not really being informed of what they are applying for.  The mechanic or the social worker may have told them they are entitled to a benefit and they have applied for it.  This is a problem.  There is a large gap in what is being understood as being offered and what is actually being offered.  People are on the back foot from the beginning of the assessment.  They will often have come all the way from places like Cork, Kerry or Clare to try to fight for something and it will then have been exposed that they do not know what they have come for.  This whole process is about education.  It involves telling people what they are applying for, explaining the criteria and going through a detailed examination.  People are not told the outcome on the day, because the group of three must sit down and discuss applications to ensure there is consensus.  There are occasions where two members agree and one does not.  It is necessary to get through that.  Generally, however, it is found that there is full agreement with what happened at the first level.  </p> <p>  At that first, community, level, there is a great deal of pressure.  It is easier in the cities, but in the country and rural areas we get situations where the doctors are under pressure.  What they do is to advise the applicants to appeal.  Many of the applicants therefore come into us and say they went through the first level, but they were told they would get it on appeal.  That means they have an expectation.  As Dr. McDonagh said, the people who get this certificate on appeal are those who have a progressive condition like Parkinson's disease.  It may be six months later when they are seen by the DDMBA, their illnesses will have progressed and, sadly, those people will then qualify.  That is, however, a small percentage of the appellants.  The majority will be exactly as they were when they were seen at the first level.</p> <p>  There is a lot of confusion as a result and all that builds into the atmosphere of anger and frustration.  People arrive sometimes accompanied by legal representation.  We ask their legal, or sometimes political, representative about the situation and they are unable to tell us what the primary medical certificate is.  Those individuals are there representing people, but they cannot tell us what they are representing them for.  Therefore, there is great lack of understanding about what is offered in this context and this plays into the lack of people being heard.  All people want is to be heard and to be helped, as appropriate, and not to be discriminated against.</p></speech>

We are tasked with overseeing the implementation of the UNCRPD and this issue concerning transport comes up continually.  There is a lack of accessible transport, especially in rural areas, and that means people cannot take up employment or educational opportunities.  Sometimes it means that people cannot live independently.  It is an issue that comes up consistently.  Another aspect is that three schemes were operating at one time.  The other two schemes were suspended in 2013.  It is now 2022 and they have not been replaced, even though it was indicated at the time that alternatives would be devised.  The criteria for this scheme are much too stringent.</p> <p>  I am delighted the witnesses are engaging with the national disability inclusion strategy subgroup and that they have been invited to consult in that context.  What are the witnesses' feelings in this regard?  Do they think progress is being made?  I ask that because I think this process is supposed to oversee the three schemes or perhaps to come up with one new scheme that will be a better fit and be better able to support more people.  Do the witnesses think progress is being made?  Do they know if there is a timescale in this regard?  Is there reason to be hopeful?</p></speech>

I hope we are going to make progress.  We are trying to do so.  I do not have a good understanding of where the national disability inclusion strategy working group is at.  The impact of Covid-19 meant there were no meetings of the working group.  I do not know if it has resumed meeting now.  It has been agreed that we will provide feedback to the working group.  I do not have a good understanding of where this process is at.  I hope the group is starting to make progress and that it is meeting regularly.  Otherwise, we will make our recommendations, and we are in the process of putting those together.  We are examining international schemes and all that type of good work which exists.  I do not, however, know where the working group is at in its endeavours.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct in what she said.  The two other schemes that existed were then abolished after the financial crash and the recession.  We noticed in the following years that many people came to the DDMBA because they were not able to access those schemes.  That goes to show that people are not necessarily looking for the major benefit this scheme gives them.  They are instead seeking something to help them and it does not have to be a benefit on the scale provided by this scheme.  This costs the Exchequer &euro;64 million, but it only helps a small and distinct group of people.  Therefore, the lack of the other two schemes has caused major frustration for people.  They just want some help.  </p> <p>  I would like more rapid progress to be made, but I am not a politician.  I work in a very different sphere.  I would like to see things having progressed further, given we are now coming up to two years since the Supreme Court made its decision.  I feel like we could have had this all sewn up, delivered and ready for legislation perhaps six months ago, but it should certainly be done this year.  Unfortunately, that has not happened.  </p></speech>

I recently attended an assessment for a primary medical certificate with a constituent on being asked to do so.  The community doctor who did the assessment was very thorough.  I discussed the matter with the doctor afterwards and we both knew the man was not going to qualify because of the stringent criteria.  The doctor was completely frustrated with the system also.  The constituent was refused.  He does not have the use of one of his arms, so he could not possibly drive.  Despite this, he still did not qualify.  He has appealed the decision.  Recently, he was asking me whether he should follow up on the appeal.  The response to a recent parliamentary question I put to the Minister for Finance indicates that attempts to put together another appeals board have been unsuccessful to date.  Does that surprise Dr. McDonagh?  Apparently, there were no applications by the deadline.</p></speech>

In addition, what we do is very specialised.  I am referring to the type of assessment and the way we explain it.  We would have to train the candidates.  They could not just land into the job and do a good job.  We have learned over time to manage this situation so we can mind people in the assessment process and try to let them go home not feeling utterly devastated.  That has to be shown.  It would not work and would be wrong to appoint new people to a role from which four doctors have resigned on ethical grounds.  There is something not right about that.</p></speech>

However, I do not know whether the applicants are suitable or whether there will be progress.  I am concerned about the number who have appealed a decision and see no end in sight in having their appeals heard.  As was asked, do they even know what is happening?  There is a considerable lack of information regarding entitlements and supports available to disabled people in general, especially concerning transport options.  It needs to be addressed immediately if we are to implement the UNCRPD.</p></speech>

We have an administrator who is extremely good and has to deal with many people who are very aggrieved, but we do not have any other support and run on quite a narrow margin.  We have an information leaflet but we should have much more.  There should be much more backup.

I apologise for being a little late.  I was at another meeting so I missed some of the earlier presentations.  Some of the questions I wished to ask have already been asked.</p> <p>  The criteria are very strict.  Both guests referred to them in their presentations.  Let me give a small example.  Only last week I raised with the Department of Finance in a Commencement debate the replacement of the board and the filling of the positions.  I have constituents who have been waiting from mid-term last year for their appeals to be heard.  One constituent was in an accident and has plates in an arm, meaning their arms are not quite as flexible as those of the rest of us.  The person was turned down and is waiting for the appeal.  Should there be some sort of in-between board dealing with primary certificates for those who end up in a position like the one I have described?  The individual&rsquo;s movement is quite impeded.  An electronic car or a car that would not require much arm use would certainly be suitable, but I am not sure the individual will qualify after an appeal once the new board is put in place.  I understand that the possibility of an appeal is being assessed.</p> <p>  One of the delegates said there should be broader criteria.  Could they elaborate on their thinking in that regard?  I agree that the criteria are too strict for some to qualify, yet they are not able to drive a normal car with a gearstick or otherwise and are in need of the primary certificate.</p></speech>

One cannot just amend them and carry on as before.  The person the Senator described would probably be happy if he or she got a grant to adapt his or her vehicle.  That is what I was talking about earlier in terms of a graded scheme.  Some people need a very much adapted vehicle into which they can bring a wheelchair and fix it in.  There will never drive themselves so it is a matter of being transported.  People like that often work.  It might be surprising to people but I have patients who work despite quite significant disabilities.  They need a vehicle.  Most of them will qualify, but in the scheme there is only one benefit available.  Most people want a swivel seat or an automatic car that might be a little more expensive.  Alternatively, they might want a special seat or bigger car to separate the children because of behavioural problems.  There are all sorts of reasons.  The scheme should not be about ascertaining somebody&rsquo;s diagnosis and whether he or she is wholly or almost wholly without the use of his or her legs; it should be about determining what the person is able to do or not able to do.  For instance, the Irish Wheelchair Association's driving instructors assess people.  Where I work, they are assessed along with an occupational therapist in the car and they decide what the person needs.  It does not have to be a doctor doing this.  Maybe a doctor will have a role in some cases but the scheme needs to be more tailored to what we now understand about disability and how we manage it.  It should be about function rather than disability or dysfunction.  Most people come to us and do not even realise what the scheme offers.  They just say they want a swivel seat because it was really difficult for them to get in and out of the car.  You might need controls or whatever it might be.  Another request is for a bigger car or a special harness on a seat for an older child who needs to be properly seated in a car.</p> <p>  We have many ideas.  At meetings of the subgroup, we communicate all this.  Those concerned are taking it on board.</p></speech>

I am referring especially to people with children with challenging behaviours who whizz around the inside of the car.  A simple, specialised seat restraint might just transform the people&rsquo;s lives such that they could go from A to B.  It is often a question of a simple solution, but what we are offering is a very generous lifelong benefit that is great but gives an awful lot to very few.  Even if we had, as an interim measure, the ability to grant a certain amount of money to people for an adaptation, 50% of people we see would probably be quite happy with that.  That is the sort of thing they are looking for.  There are looking for help with adaptation.</p></speech>

They would not necessarily need the primary certificate.  If they were given a certain amount of money to adapt their cars so they could drive themselves, they would be quite happy.  I hope the reviews and suggestions are taken on board in the review that is taking place.</p><p>It is clearly important that the scheme is brought back up and running as quickly as possible.  There are many people out there who could avail of it.  I am not laying the blame at anyone's door.  However, I believe it must be brought back up and running again as quickly as possible, perhaps in a more reformed way.</p></speech>

I have the pre-notes outlining the approach the Minister was going to take.  It is very clear that commitments were going to be given.  In the notes, it says that answers to some of the questions would be provided at the time of the finance Bill.  It appears that very little, if any, work had been done leading up to that.  One of the documents we have, dated 27 October 2021 - which would have been shortly after Dr. McDonagh's resignation letter - deals at the end with a number of issues such as how they were going to try to get the NRH to appoint a new chairperson, which obviously was not successful.  The last point, on managing communication, states that given the high profile of the disabled drivers scheme and of the review managing communications and messaging about the DDMBA resignations, it is extremely important and may be useful to discuss with the Minister's advisers the best approach in this regard.  We found out from RT&Eacute; on 11 January that there was no longer a board.  I find it astonishing that the House was not informed.  There was no public communication.  There was nothing in regard to this months after an entire board resigned.  It is interesting that in response to our freedom of information request, we see all the other letters - you get a log from the Department of Finance which tells you when the letter was created, by whom it was assessed and so on - but there is no log for the letter the Minister sent to Dr. McDonagh, as chairperson.  That is quite interesting because it arrived the day after she issued her resignation, while the Department claims it was written beforehand.  The log would be very interesting.</p></speech>

Such a log would tell us exactly when the document was created because the log is linked into the system.  The letter that the Minister sent to Dr. McDonagh indicated the approach he was taking as he looked forward.  He was suggesting that he was going to set up a working group, of which Dr. McDonagh is now part, to operate concurrently with the work that would be done by the NDIS working group on behalf of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  He made the point that it was important for the members of the DDMBA to see substantial progress being made towards a new scheme.  He said that if there was a delay in the secondary approach, the Department of Finance could implement the changes.  Is it Dr. McDonagh's understanding that this is still on the cards?  From our knowledge, the only meeting that took place in regard to the other working group with which she is concerned was on 26 January last, which coincided with the Minister being questioned here about the emerging information that the board of appeal had resigned.  Is there still an approach from the working group of which Dr. McDonagh is part that could progress some of these matters independently from the work being done by the NDIS group?</p></speech>

I do not think we necessarily have a remit to create a new scheme.  We are charged with informing them of the issues with the current scheme, particularly the medical criteria.  It is actually called the criteria subgroup.  We are currently looking at international schemes.  That is what we looked at during our last meeting.</p></speech>

Nothing like this is available anywhere else.  We are getting some ideas to use a bit of creativity.  Part of it is that we have to let go of the notion that the criteria need to be adjusted.  The criteria need to be put aside.  We need to look at disability in terms of function.  We need to create a scheme that has levels where people with certain disabilities can access what is appropriate for them, in order to get them to participate in society.  It baffles me that the priority is scrabbling about to put a new board in place.  That should not be the priority.  To be honest, approximately 1% of those waiting for appeal might have progressed sufficiently to get it on appeal.  We are not actually harming a huge number of people, but people are being harmed by being continuously assessed at primary level and turned down due to a set of criteria that is not fit for purpose.  That is a problem.  I do not believe that the priority is in place to get this thing rewritten and present the Irish people with an equitable scheme for people with disability to access transport.  I think the priority has been to put together a new board to continue, in what could be a very questionable way, what is not working.  That is not good enough.  We need to prioritise sitting down.  We know what people with disability would like to help them with transport.  We are a huge resource.  We have both been involved in this for ten years.  We know what they want, and we want to help them.  We just need to sit down and get out of the mindset of rebuilding what is not working.  We have to start from the bottom and work out what is going to work for transport for people with disability.  It is there and it is available; we just need to reset our mindset and look at it.</p></speech>

Indeed, needs evolve as people evolve, as disabilities worsen or as medication improves.  Without underplaying the complexity of this matter, how to deal with it is obvious enough.  It is a question of taking a person-centred approach as opposed to trying to get everybody to fit into a box, and anyone who does not fit into the box is forgotten about.  I presume the Department is looking at this from a cost perspective.</p></speech>

It is giving an awful lot.  This is a scheme for life.  You have people who improve who are still availing of this scheme.  We recently revoked it from someone who had done a marathon.  The Revenue Commissioners let us know.  I do not think anything like this should apply for an entire lifespan.  There is a need to review things, especially with children.  The premise is that people are going to be the same with their disability, but some people will get better, other people will get worse and technology will improve things.  The concept has changed since this scheme was put together.  As we say to people, being disabled in the 1950s was different from being disabled in the 1980s or 1990s.  The whole definition of disability has absolutely expanded to include many more people than was the case 50 years ago.  We need to build that into a scheme that grows, changes and looks at function.  The most important thing to get across today is that it should be about function, not diagnosis.  One person with multiple sclerosis can function perfectly well, whereas another person with multiple sclerosis might be in a wheelchair and need a hoist to be transferred.  The actual words of the diagnosis should not be relevant.  It should be about what a person can do; for example, what a person with a hoist transfer needs in order to be able to get to work as a coder in a software company.  It should be about the different things needed by a person who has really bad balance issues.</p><p>It does not necessarily have to be very expensive.  For the lifespan of a car, people could have an adaptation and be allowed to renew it every five years or whatever period is sensible.  That would work.</p></speech>

One of my questions looks forward while the other looks back a little but also forward at the same time.  Obviously, this committee is responsible for finance and it deals with how matters are transposed into law in terms of the taxation end of it.  I am taken by the comments of our guests, but also those of the Ombudsman, regarding the scheme, the way it works and the fact that the provision of support is only available to people who already have money to expend.  Even if that was got right and it was still based on that type of criteria, that ignores so many families with disabilities.  The case that hit home with me was that of the parent of a child with autism.  The child was grabbing his parent from behind but, during the lockdown, it was the only comfort that could settle the child.  That was taken away from him because the scheme does not provide for the special seat that he needed.  That case involved a small amount of money that would transform the child and his siblings.  Anyone who is a parent of children with autism knows that it affects all the family.  I am digressing a little.</p> <p>  Obviously, we have to come up with our own solution, but is there an international model that has done this better than us or to which we should be looking?  I know that our guests indicated back in 2020 that they would not hear appeals but then reconsidered that.  Part of the letter that came from the Department or the Minister at that time was read out.  In my view, that letter was unfair as it nearly put the responsibility on our guests and suggested they were failing individuals, whereas it is the Department that has failed them over several years.  The board did reconsider at that point.  Would it reconsider again and get involved?  I refer to the expertise our guests have amassed over a long period.  Would they get involved under a new scheme?  Is there any possibility that they would work under the existing scheme again?</p></speech>

It was a really difficult decision for us to reach.  We felt we had been back and forth with the Department and really tried to push.  For want of a better phrase, we stomped our feet and said we would not do it.  When the Department put the criteria into legislation we stated we would not do it, but then agreed to do it on the basis that the Department would do something about it.  Nothing happened, however, and it just got too much.  We believed the only way to make change was to pull back from it.  We did not do so without thinking of the people who then would not be able to attend for appeal.  We granted only a small percentage of overall applications but there is no other appeal mechanism.  Applicants can go through the assessment process after six months in the community but it would still be better if we were running appeal clinics.  Since we resigned, there have been meetings of the subgroup but, as the Deputy pointed out, there has only been one meeting of the national disability inclusion strategy working group tasked with this.  I believe that impetus is lacking.  If there was such an impetus, maybe we would reconsider.  I do not know.  I cannot commit to that.</p></speech>

I spent almost my entire political life, which has been a long one, in reverse while arguing the case that our guests are arguing correctly and that members have been putting forth as well.  It was with frustration that every time I saw a refusal, I immediately went back to have it reviewed and to chase it.  I refer to the frustration that comes with dealing with something that is obvious.  A passerby on a bicycle would be able to come to a conclusion without half the nonsense that has been going on.  I strongly support the points that have been made by our guests and the members of the committee.  We should communicate with the office of the Minister and also with the Minister for Health because there is a joint responsibility there.  The criteria have to change.  Dr. Scaramuzzi stated that certain matters mean different things to different people.  One person's disability is another person's challenge.  A person with a mild disability may be unable to deal with the challenge whereas another person with a serious disability may be well able to conquer it.</p></speech>

It is all in the ability of the individual to deal with the situation.  All present know people who have dealt with serious disabilities and other people who have other disabilities but just do not have the confidence to get involved to the same extent.  We are familiar with the issue.  It is appalling that it has taken this long.  I cannot remember who designed the scheme but they must have gone out of their way to make it impossible to qualify for it without going to the most extreme measures.  There are still people who do not qualify and have been dismissed but will be coming back.  If members agree, the committee should do its bit, contact the Minister and keep our guests informed.  They should be kept informed of the progress we are making.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I thank Dr. McDonagh and Dr. Scaramuzzi for coming before the committee and giving of their time and expertise.  I thank the members who contributed in person and virtually.</p> <p>  The committee stands adjourned until 12.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 18 May, when we will meet in private session in advance of the public session at 1.30 p.m.  We will meet with representatives of Ulster Bank and KBC, and later with representatives of AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB, to discuss the impact on customers and banking of the withdrawal of Ulster Bank and KBC from the Irish market.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputy John McGuinness.  I welcome members and also viewers who may be watching our proceedings on Oireachtas TV to the public session of the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in a committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts, which is in Leinster House, in other words.  In order to participate in a division in the committee, members must be physically present.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, and his officials.  Any Member substituting for a member of the committee should formally notify the clerk now.  No one is substituting for a member yet.  Divisions will be taken as they arise.  Members must attend in person in the committee room for divisions, although they can attend the meeting remotely.  Members attending this meeting in accordance with Standing Order 106(3) should be aware that they may move their amendments but cannot participate in voting on that amendment.</p></speech>

The Minister of State will be familiar with the practice that moneylenders use.  I use the word "prey" to describe what they do to vulnerable people at times of financial pressure, including in the run-up to Christmas and at this time of year as parents prepare children for communion and confirmations.  There is no prohibition on promoting new loans when customers are nearing their final payments.  Why were no further restrictions on advertising put in place when the Minister of State was considering this legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.448" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#A00700"><p>Section 2 provides for the terms "moneylender", "moneylending", "moneylender&rsquo;s licence" and "moneylending agreement" to be replaced by the term "high cost credit provider", "high cost credit", "high cost credit provider's licence" and "high cost credit agreement", respectively.  The purpose of this change in language is differentiate licensed providers more clearly from unlicensed lenders.</p><p>The many suggestions relating to advertising are currently catered for either by the Consumer Credit Association, CCA, or the moneylending code.  In addition, the Central Bank has since published the moneylending regulations, which address areas like advertising and targeting.  The requirements of the moneylending regulations should assist customers and consumers in becoming more informed and encourage them to consider alternatives.  These requirements include that moneylenders insert an enhanced high-cost credit warning statement in all advertisements, regardless of whether advertising refers to a rate of interest or a cost of credit.  The following text must be included in the warning statement: "Warning: This is high-cost credit. Consider alternative options before applying for this credit, including alternatives from other lenders regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland."  The cost of credit must be clearly displayed on the moneylender's website, and they are required to provide an information notice on the application stage.  Moneylenders' advertising must be clear, not misleading, and presented in a way that customers will know that it is an advertisement.  Moneylenders can no longer make unsolicited contact on the recommendations of an existing customer, in other words, refer a friend.  This is a very important issue that deals with vulnerable people who might be looking for funding in the run-up to some of the big family events.</p><p> Moneylenders are required to take reasonable steps to identify customers who are vulnerable customers and to ensure they are provided with the assistance that may be necessary.  The essence of this legislation, which was not there before and which is very strong now, is that, before the moneylender gives a loan, they must look at the person's ability to repay that loan and take into account the existing financial commitments the person might have.  There is a requirement for moneylenders to consider that.  The whole tone of this legislation is that when the Central Bank is satisfied that some high-cost lenders are not actually doing that, it can have an impact on their licence.  They could have it withdrawn, suspended or, ultimately, not renewed.  This is the whole tone of the Bill.  It is not just one section the deals with this.</p><p> Since we have spoken, the Central Bank has published its moneylending regulations to address the issue of advertising.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, will have a role in advising consumers on this, separate from this legislation, even though it will also play a key part of it around consumer protection.</p><p> When it comes to granting licences, the Central Bank will take all of these matters into account any time it is issuing a licence or considering taking any action where there is an actual breach.  The conduct standards required by the Central Bank of these licensed operators can be taken into account whereas up to now those factors were not specifically included in the legislation.  There is a raft of areas dealing with consumer protection that perhaps had not existed heretofore.</p></speech>

Regardless of the fact the moneylenders will have to disclose "We are fleecing you", there remains the fact they are targeting people during that period.</p></speech>

There is no specific section in the legislation that prohibits the distribution of advertisements in a specific time period.  When one can advertise is not confined to certain days of the year.  As I have said, the interest rate must be clearly displayed and must clearly state that it is a high-cost interest loan.  This must be clearly displayed.  Most people will understand it is an advertisement.   I take the Deputy's point, however, that it is a temptation when people see these advertisements.  I believe we are strengthening the requirements on the industry to make clear what is involved if one takes up the temptation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.452" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#B00400"><p>What is the Minister of State's view on that?  It is that type of advertisement.  We are aware advertising takes place in different ways now than it did in the past.  That kind of leaflet drop is still a part of moneylenders' operational procedures.  They are not going to drop leaflets out in Donnybrook.  They target social housing estates and they target areas they believe are lower income areas.  They make it very appealing to people that there is an easy fix.  Given the Government is legislating for warnings around the high costs of the interest rates, does the Minister of State not feel this is a missed opportunity to prohibit that type of practice?  We know of this type of lending.  I am sure everyone in this House would advise people that before they go to a moneylender, they should check all of their other options, including credit unions and loan supports by the State through the credit union movement, and other retail banks.  Allowing them to advertise at times of vulnerability is a mistake.  I believe it is something we will have to come back and revisit in this legislation in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.453" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#B00500"><p>I understand.  We were all in the same space on this in protecting vulnerable customers at a vulnerable period in the year just coming up to Christmas.</p> <p>  The Central Bank brought in the high-cost warning requirements, which came into effect on 1 September 2020, and the remainder of those regulations came into effect on 1 January 2021.  Some of those have already come into effect since the discussion started around this legislation.  It is very important that the "refer a friend" practice will be dealt with now under this legislation.  When somebody gets a loan, many may say to a neighbour "This is where I got the loan".  There are no statistics on that but it is a common way for people to hear about a particular moneylender or high-cost credit company.  Provision to deal with this "refer a friend" practice is included in the legislation.</p> <p>  Banning advertising for certain periods of the year is probably a broader societal issue rather than being specific to this issue.  That is something we did not do in the pre-legislative scrutiny with regard to the advertising industry.  That would be a very broad debate that can happen in the Oireachtas, with much wider implications than this exact legislation.  The credit unions have a good product out there.  Some 102 credit unions have an offer called It Makes Sense, which are loans to help customers with household budgetary items.  In many of these communities the credit unions are having an impact.</p> <p>  I would expect a reduction in the leaflet drops because, up to now, a key feature of moneylending has been the door-to-door collection.  It is a key feature.  People were calling to the housing estates, which Deputy Doherty referred to, monthly or weekly collecting money.  Part of that may have been the delivery of leaflets.  Under this legislation, the cost of a door-to-door collection is not facilitated.  The moneylenders cannot charge for a door-to-door collection fee.  We cannot stop them calling door to door to collect money, but they cannot charge for it or include it in the interest rate or a fee associated with the loan.  I would genuinely expect there to be a significant reduction in the number of people calling to houses in housing estates collecting money and possibly delivering leaflets when they are doing the same exercise.  It will be a by-product of this legislation.  They will not be calling around to those housing estates regularly.  There is, however, no proposal to abolish door-to-door leaflet drops.</p></speech>

Is there anything in the legislation that will ban the practice of promoting new loans to customers who are nearing final repayments?  We challenge the interest that is being charged to someone who takes out a six-month loan from a moneylender, and we can see that they are paying possibly ten to 12 times more than if they had received the same amount of money from a credit union.  They must pay hundreds of additional euro than if they had got that loan from a credit union.  It sounds terrible that they will have paid &euro;300 or &euro;400 more, for example, but the reality for many individuals who have gone to a moneylender is the practice of continuing to keep them under the grip of the moneylender.  The moneylender advertises a loan as the current loan is expiring, which means the person is in a continuous period of high-cost credit.  This means he or she is paying thousands upon thousands of euro extra as a result of the level of indebtedness.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.455" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#C00100"><p>I understand the point made about the people we are dealing with.  There is an item in the legislation that is new and is not in existing legislation.  For the first time we will have legislation whereby the loans can only extend for 12 months.  Up to now there was not a 12-month limit and loans could roll over very simply.  It did not have to be a new loan.  Under this legislation, the loan must be repaid and it must be only a 12-month loan.  A new loan would be required to be taken for a second period.</p> <p>  The Deputy has said that towards the end of a loan term, a customer would be offered a new loan.  The second item in the legislation that did not exist heretofore is the obligation to carry out a review of the ability to pay the loan within the 12 months before issuing that loan again.  In the past moneylenders were piling loans on people and maybe two or three moneylenders were calling to some houses.  Now there will be a requirement to know the total ability of the person taking the loan to repay it through normal credit checks.  They did not have to do those up to now.  There are approximately 40 companies in the country that will rely on the Central Bank of Ireland for approval for the period of their licence and if it finds they are not complying with the obligation and are giving loans to people where it is reasonable to say they are not able to repay the loans, it will affect the Central Bank's view.  With this legislation, it can take such consideration when reviewing or examining the licence.  It is a new element.</p></speech>

Would they include the track record of a customer paying a previous loan or would they be based on household income, such as the proportion of income, as applied by banks?</p></speech>

That did not apply up to now in this sector.  The lenders will now have to meet the same consumer credit loan protections and regulations that apply to all other lenders authorised by the Central Bank.  That was not the case up to now.  This will include income and whether a person has the ability to repay the loan.  It will always be the single biggest criterion.  It is not just about historic payments, although such information will tell lenders if there are any outstanding loans to take into account.  It is about the ability to repay the loan.  That provision was not there previously.</p></speech>

We have had much pre-legislative scrutiny of this, including examination of my legislation, and the fear of illegal moneylenders is not seen as a reason to reduce interest rates.</p> <p>  The point I am making is that moneylenders having to calculate ability to pay is good.  I welcome it.  That misses the real point, however, as the default rate with moneylenders is very small anyway.  People pay these loans and the issue is not the ability to pay.  It is the fact that moneylenders are fleecing these people.  If a person borrows &euro;1,000 and pays approximately &euro;560 in interest, rolling it over by taking out a new loan each year, in four years that person will pay over &euro;2,000 in interest on the original &euro;1,000 loan.  That is the problem.  It is not ability to pay because evidence indicates the people will pay the loan.  The issue is the loan will have cost the family thousands of euro in interest over four years.  That is the problem.  The practice will be allowed to continue where Mary and Joe come to the end of their term and the moneylender might say that Seamus is going to college next year and offer a loan for that.  The lender will offer to work out the paperwork in taking out the new loan.  The &euro;1,000 that people will have "repaid" is still be paid and the lender will take another &euro;560 in interest.</p> <p>  That is the issue and it is immoral that a type of loan such as this is rolled over continuously, and this happens with many families.  It ends up costing an individual thousands of euro and multiples of the capital that was originally taken out.</p></speech>

It is a very fair assessment of what happens in many cases.  It is why, for the first time, we are introducing a limit of 12 months on any loan.  In the past, loans would just been rolled over repeatedly but now a loan will have to be brought to a conclusion at the end of the 12-month period.  There will be a fresh application and the normal consumer credit checks by these companies will have to take ability to pay into account.</p> <p>  What the Deputy describes is exactly the position of many people.  They were given loans that, effectively, they could not repay.  There is almost an assumption the loan will roll over repeatedly.  That will be stopped with this legislation.  There is a 12-month limit for the first time and anybody who wants to get a loan for a second period will be starting from scratch with a fresh application.  The Central Bank must be satisfied and it has the ability to monitor these companies, which will now be regulated.  There are only a couple of dozen of them in the country.  I am satisfied the Central Bank will monitor the provisions in this new legislation very closely.  If it finds that, in effect, people are rolling over loans, the Central Bank will be able to take that into consideration in amending or revoking a company's licence or not renewing it.  That option does not currently exist.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is really missing the point here.  We recognise that a loan cannot be rolled over and a person must make a fresh application.  Taking out a new application will not be a problem for many of these families, who will have already met the terms of the previous 12-month loan.  They may have taken a loan of &euro;1,000 and paid &euro;560 in interest.  They will have repaid the capital and are good for another loan.  That is the problem.  If they take out another loan in the following year for the same &euro;1,000, the process repeats.  The new loans are rolled over.  That is what happens with people who use moneylenders.  There is no prohibition on advertising the new loan to somebody coming to the end of term in the original loan.</p> <p>  Somebody may have taken a &euro;1,000 loan over four years and will have repaid &euro;2,240 in interest in such a case.  Can we stop people from going to moneylenders year after year?  We cannot.  However, the core of my argument is there should be regulation of advertising of new loans to new borrowers as they come to the end of their term.  It is a predatory practice that moneylenders are involved with.  The same loan that somebody takes from the credit union over the same period would cost &euro;240 in interest.  That is compared with &euro;2,240 with a moneylender.</p></speech>

Those people would have repaid approximately &euro;500 in interest and the capital.  If somebody gets a loan and repays it within the specified period, including interest, and wants to start again, they are allowed to do it.  Most people do it with car loans etc.  When the loan is repaid, including capital and interest, they will start a new loan.  That is not rolling over the loan.  It would be for some new item in the house, electrical equipment or next year's first communion for a different child.  It would not be the same loan.</p><p>This will be a new loan from the beginning for a new purpose.</p></speech>

That the Minister of State shrugs his shoulders at that idea means he fails to understand exactly what is happening with moneylenders.  This is the problem.  There are families out there at the minute who are borrowing &euro;1,000 and are paying it back.  They pay the &euro;560 interest.  At the moment they are rolling that over and will not be allowed to do that and will have to take out a new loan for the &euro;1,000 and pay another &euro;560 interest, and so on and so forth.  We cannot stop them doing that but we can and should be regulating the moneylenders to prevent them from advertising that new loan as they are coming up to the term.  If an individual wants to seek out a moneylender and apply for high-cost credit, that is fine, but when somebody knows that Mary and Michael are coming to the end of their term, this gives rise to a predatory practice that should be stopped.  That is my point.</p> <p>  I know what is happening in this legislation and that one cannot roll over, but the reality is that most of these customers will be able to get new loans.  It is a good thing that there will be an extra burden there and most will be able to do this but the problem is that this predatory practice is a problem.  It has been happening in the past and this is probably going to limit door-to-door sales where there were three generations involved and they were looking at Johnny who was turning 17 or 18 in the same way where the moneylenders could behave towards him in that predatory way.  That will come to an end but the idea that these moneylenders can hold and try to keep a data sheet is not good.  The legislation should regulate the advertisement in that regard.</p></speech>

A running account operates similarly to a type of credit card and is a product sometimes offered by catalogue companies.  This technical amendment seeks to update a schedule of references to deter moneylending, following the passing of the recent Act.  One of the purposes of the Bill is to replace the term &quot;moneylending&quot; with the term &ldquo;high cost credit&rdquo; where it occurs on the Statute Book.  Since this Bill was published, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Retail Credit and Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2022 has added another reference to the word &quot;moneylending&quot; in the Statute Book.  The reference to &quot;moneylending&quot; should be replaced by the term &ldquo;high cost credit&rdquo;.  This is only a change of nomenclature or name.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, and amendment No. 6 are grouped together for discussion purposes.  Amendment No. 4 sets out the substantive change while amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 6 are required to be inserted appropriately into the Bill.

They will allow the Central Bank to take account of the conduct of the high-cost credit providers in the same way that the bank treats other regulated financial service providers, for example in the monetary compliance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s regulations or codes of conduct.  This deals with the discussion we have been having here up to now.  I am talking about situations where providers breach financial services legislation by failing to pay the Central Bank levies on time or where they do not submit key information on the central credit register on time, or at all.  With the terms of the licences moving now from one to five years, these changes will bring the high-cost credit providers&rsquo; licences more in line with those of other financial service providers.</p><p>I have read the general note I have been provided on these amendments, which were grouped together for discussion.  I can go into more detail, if required, on the specifics.  As I say, amendment No. 4 is the substantive one.  The other three amendments are only there to ensure amendment No. 4 is properly inserted into the legislation.  </p><p>I will move on to amendment No. 4, which is the substantive one.  Section 93(10) of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 sets down the list of practices which the Central Bank can take into account when deciding whether to grant a high-cost credit provider's licence.  The items added to this list will mean that the provider must satisfy the bank that it will be able to comply with the requirements of being a licensed high-cost credit provider, and a regulated financial service provider more generally, and that it will conduct its business in such a way as to ensure the protection of its customers - which is new - and in compliance with any other requirements considered necessary by the bank for the proper and orderly regulation and supervision of high-cost credit and the protection of the applicant&rsquo;s customers.  This legislation is, therefore, very strong on customer protection, which the Central Bank will have a role in now when the providers proceed to the renewal of a particular licence.</p><p>Finally, section 93 deals with the factors considered when suspending or revoking a licence.  The Central Bank will now be able to take into account whether the high-cost credit provider has failed or is failing to comply with any condition or requirement under the financial services regulation.  The Central Bank will now clearly have authority to be able to amend or revoke a licence during the course of the five-year period.  The other two amendments are minor, relatively speaking.</p></speech>

While the Central Bank, through the Minister of State&rsquo;s amendment which I welcome, is allowed to revoke or refuse a licence midstream, I encourage it to apply this provision where this has happened.  I have made the point before that I accompanied whistleblowers to the Central Bank which led to quite a significant fine - a six-figure sum - against Provident Personal Credit for practices in which it was involved in my constituency.  The company never lost its licence.  The Central Bank has to be feared, particularly when we are moving from a one-year licensing regime to a five-year regime.</p></speech>

The term of the licence changing will bring high-cost credit provider licences more in line with existing Central Bank licensing arrangements for other types of regulated financial service providers.  The Deputy might say that this is a particular case because of the clientele involved, but the reason we have done it is to be consistent with other licensing agreements that the Central Bank would normally issue.  They are usually for five years.  That is the norm that is coming in under this Central Bank regulation now.  We are taking the norm.  That said, I accept the separate point that the Deputy makes.</p></speech>

It would also separate cash loans from loans provided on a running account.  The new interest rate as it applies to cash loans would be as follows: a simple interest rate of no more than 0.75% per week up to a maximum of 36% per annum for a period of three years, to be known as the initial cap; a simple interest of no more than 0.035% per week up to a maximum of 18% per annum after a period of three years, which would be known as the further reduced cap.</p><p>The impact of this cap for borrowers with reference to the interest charged on a &euro;1,000 cash loan by a credit union and by the largest money lender operating in the State is significant.  Currently, on a &euro;1,000 loan over a 12-month period, a credit union charges interest of &euro;60 while a money lender, for the same loan over the same period, would charge &euro;560 in interest.  The initial cap that I am proposing for a three year period would reduce that &euro;560 down to &euro;360 but would substantially reduce it further after the three year period down to &euro;180.  The initial cap would be six times that which the credit union would apply but, as we get to the second step, it would be three times what the credit union would charge.  Crucially for the moneylender, the total interest payable does not include the impact of collection charges, which obviously have pushed up the cost of credit further in the past.</p><p>I argued strongly on this when my own legislation was before the House but unfortunately, the Minister voted against all sections of that Bill.  We have tweaks in some of the sections of this Bill to the licences of moneylenders, which I broadly support, but when we get down to the meat and bones of this legislation, what the Government is legislating for is to allow high-cost credit but with a warning on the label.  It is like phoning people up to tell them that they are going to get robbed in the next half an hour.  The Government is just letting them know that they are going to get robbed but what I want to do is stop the burglar coming through the door in the first place.  This amendment would still allow for substantial profits to be made on these types of loans, which have been described by others during the pre-legislative scrutiny process as immoral.  It would still allow for high interest rates to be charged, specifically in the initial period but I would argue that a step-down approach is the more appropriate way to deal with this and to bring it into line, with reference to credit union lending.  The initial cap of six times the credit union rate and then three times the rate in the further cap is appropriate.  I commend the amendment to the select committee.</p></speech>

I know that Deputy Doherty has a great interest in this legislation and I can see where he is coming from with his proposal.   Lower interest rates are better for consumers.  The key purpose of this legislation is to reduce interest rates.  Deputy Doherty will say that Government is not being ambitious enough, but we have to strike a balance and reduce rates without reducing access to credit.  We can reduce rates right down but we might not have any companies providing credit if it is not viable from their point of view.  We want to make sure that the people we are talking about have access to credit.  If we make it unviable for providers, then people will not have access to credit except through the illegal moneylenders that we all want them to avoid.  There is a balance to be struck between reducing the rate and making sure that we keep lenders in the market.  We are looking at a substantial reduction from where we were previously.  We need to do this in a balanced, responsible way.</p> <p>  There is currently a concentration of loan offerings between 1% and 1.2% per week in the market.  Most of the loans tend to be in that bracket.  An initial interest rate cap of 1% per week will allow moneylenders operating at rates above the limit to revise their business model and reduce their margins to enable them to operate within the legislative cap.  This is not the ultimate destination but it is the right place to start.  The legislation also sets down the principles and policies to guide the Minister when making regulations to set the specific caps going forward.  This provides flexibility to amend the caps downwards while ensuring that there is always an upper limit in the primary legislation.  We are starting with 1% but the legislation specifically allows for that cap to be reduced.  It cannot go above 1%, but it can be reduced.  What we are saying is that at the point of introducing this legislation, we want the rate to be 1% but we are not precluding, after a couple of years when the Central Bank has monitored its operation closely, reducing that further.  That is provided for in the Bill.</p> <p>  Deputy Doherty's proposal is to have the reduced rate now, but I would be fearful that if we go too low too quickly this will lead to fewer people offering credit.  Furthermore, to fix the reduction in primary legislation without any assessment by the Central Bank of how the legislation is operating would not be good practice.  We are starting with 1% per week, with the commitment that it can be reviewed when we get some information from the Central Bank as to how this is operating.  It may be appropriate to reduce the rate at that stage.  This is a maximum cap and represents a reasonable and balanced approach.  I understand where Deputy Doherty is coming from, but we are clear about the way we want to do this.  It is a very big step from where we are to go down to 1%, with the option of going further at a later date, on foot of information from the Central Bank, without the need to revisit the primary legislation</p></speech>

The Minister of State is proposing to bring that down to &euro;480.  That is an improvement but it still immoral.  The fact that the Minister of State is asking us to legislate to allow for these types of high-cost loans is problematic.  Many moneylenders do not even charge that rate at this point in time; some of them are below that.  It is crazy that the Government is suggesting that we would say that charging this level of interest is legally permissible.  The Minister of State claimed in the D&aacute;il Chamber that this legislation would reduce the APR on a 12-month loan to 48%.  Does he wish to correct that?  </p></speech>

What calculations has he done to suggest that rate is the appropriate rate?  All of the experts, including the Social Finance Foundation, have told us that this rate should be reduced further.

Part of our work here is to encourage people to go to credit unions as well.  Deputy Doherty and I often have discussions on credit unions.  It is something that we would support, but this legislation is introducing a cap at this stage and what Deputy Doherty is calling for is provided for in the legislation.  The rate can reduce to the rate the Deputy is talking about, but we are saying it will just not happen on day one.  We are starting with the 1% per week and it can go down, but the view in the Department of Finance in bringing forward the legislation is that we would like to see the operation of the 1% per week for a period and get information from the Central Bank, and if it feels that the industry could continue to operate at a lower rate, this legislation specifically provides for a reduction to the rate Deputy Doherty has signposted.  Our only point of difference is we are saying we want to stick with the 1% on day one.  It is a reduction from where we were.  None of us like to see the high rates that have been in place, but we are on a road whereby we can reduce the rates at a further date.  The principal point of difference is we are saying we will start with the 1% cap now, which is an improvement for most people who are getting loans, and there is scope for a reduction when we get more information from the Central Bank reporting on how the operators are complying with the new legislation.  There is scope by means of a statutory instrument to make a change at a later date without having to come back with primary legislation.</p></speech>

The view is that if the companies cannot charge 126% APR on a loan over a 12-month period that will scare the horses.  How has the Minister of State come to that view?  Was it the moneylenders that told him?</p></speech>

A rate of 126% APR is immoral.  There is no way I am voting for the legislation, especially at a time of pressure on workers and families.  The Minister of State is saying that instead of them charging &euro;560 interest on a &euro;1,000 loan, we are going to legislate for them to charge &euro;480.  Jesus Christ, this Minister has got your backs, folks.  Interest of &euro;480 if people take out a &euro;1,000 loan is ridiculous.  I tabled this legislation years ago.  I have been frustrated at every stage.  The Government has made a dog's dinner of my legislation.  Every single amendment was deleted, bar the definitions.  The Government has frustrated this and come forward with the argument that it would bring a Bill itself which would be better.  It is absolutely terrible that the Government is going to allow moneylenders to charge this level of interest on people in society who are on very low incomes.  Those people are really pressed now because of all the issues in terms of inflation.  Where is the calculation?  The core of the issue is how the Minister of State came up with this figure.</p></speech>

The majority of loans are above this figure, and we are bringing it down.  That is only part of this debate.  Deputy Doherty has studiously not dealt with the other issue.  The existing legislation allows for the cost of door to door collection to be charged as well.  That is being abolished in this legislation.  What I am saying to people in this situation is that up to now they were paying a very high interest rate and they were also being charged a fee for door-to-door collection, which in many cases was even in excess of the cost of interest.  We are eliminating that cost entirely.  Moneylenders cannot charge for door-to-door collection.  That is a very significant element of this legislation.</p> <p>  The interest rate is a further enhancement for customers.  As I stated previously, this legislation sets the cap at 48% - 1% per week.  That is the maximum in the legislation and there is clear provision for that to be reduced at a further date if the circumstances warrant when we see the operation of this Act and the report from the Central Bank on how it is being implemented.  The legislation provides specifically for reduction at a later date.  I understand that the Deputy is in opposition to the legislation as proposed, but the essential difference between us is that we are saying we are abolishing the charges for door-to-door collection, which is a very significant issue, and we are introducing a cap which will immediately reduce interest rates for the majority of people who have loans from high-cost lenders.  In addition, we are providing for a further reduction in the interest rate to be made in due course, depending on how the legislation operates.  We need to give it a bit of time to see how it operates.</p></speech>

Is there any evidence?  The Minister of State has said half of the moneylenders will not be affected by the Bill because their charges are below the maximum rate and half are above it and they will be affected.  The core point that he made is that this would scare people off.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party believe that if lenders cannot charge &euro;480 on a &euro;1,000 loan, then there is no market for them in Ireland, so we need to allow these companies to be able to charge that level of interest.  How did the Minister of State come up with that figure?  How did he come up with &euro;480, as opposed to what I am proposing here for the first three years, which is &euro;360 or some number in between?  Where did &euro;480 come from?</p></speech>

What I want to achieve in this legislation is that we have lenders that people will be able to go to, rather than go to illegal moneylenders.  It is essential that we keep the option open for moneylenders to be able to lend money even at the reduced rate we will allow, because if it is eliminated by companies not being in the market, people will only have the option to go to illegal moneylenders.  We want to make sure that we have that option available.  We could bring it down to 20% and have nobody in this market, but that would be a worst-case scenario.</p> <p>  In May 2019, the Department of Finance launched a public consultation process to gather views from stakeholders on whether the Government should introduce a statutory interest rate cap on moneylenders in Ireland, along with other regulatory matters.  The majority of submissions received were in favour of the introduction of an interest rate cap.  These submissions were primarily received from non-governmental organisations and credit unions.  All of the comments and submissions made through this consultation process have been considered and taken into account, as appropriate, in formulating the proposed policy options.</p> <p>  What we did say is we are striking a balance to make sure, first, that we are eliminating the charge for door to door collection, which is a significant feature; second, we are reducing the rate that is being charged on the majority of loans; third, it is a maximum cap that can be reduced at a further date.  We have taken all those factors into account to make sure we have people who will lend money at this rate.  There are only a couple of dozen companies operating in the country.  This is a balanced approach to achieve those three objectives.  It is not only looking at one side of the equation.  I have mentioned the other side of the equation and the reduction in fees the companies can charge in terms of not being able to charge for calling door to door.</p></speech>

He has failed to tell this committee how he came up with an annual percentage rate, APR, of 126% for moneylenders for a &euro;1,000 loan over 12 months.  He has acknowledged that the submissions called for a reduced rate and that the experts in the field are all critical of the level of interest the Minister of State is going to allow to be charged.  There is no empirical evidence to say that, if we go below this rate, businesses will somehow be scared off and will not provide credit in Ireland.</p></speech>

I will not be guided by that body and I do not agree with a lot of what it says but its key point is that it is important to keep this industry and these lenders in the market.  Achieving that is a question of balance.  It is not a scientific issue.  It is about striking a balance and keeping lenders in the market so they can lend money at a rate that allows them to cover their costs.  It is also about making sure those who charge door-to-door collection fees are not allowed to do so.  This 1% is a first step.  We are not precluding a reduction of this rate at a future date.  Let us start with this 1% for now as a balanced and responsible measure.  When we get information from the Central Bank on the implementation and operation of the legislation, we can revisit it.  The 1% can be changed very quickly by statutory instrument when we have that information.  I would not like to make that move without information as to how the new legislation is operating, however.  There is a net point of difference here.</p></speech>

It is my understanding that sections 2 and 3 relate to the deduction by insurers of Covid-19 related State supports for final business interruption insurance claim settlements.  We are all quite aware of how difficult Covid-19 has been for businesses and the impact it has had.  The fact that people had to use that business interruption insurance shows the impact it had.  The Central Bank informed my party in written correspondence in May last year that more than &euro;163 million had been paid out to in excess of 5,000 policyholders through settled claims and interim payments.  Over the course of the pandemic, it became apparent that insurance companies were deducting the value of State supports provided to firms during the pandemic from the value of the business interruption payouts.  That came as a major concern to businesses.  The reality is many of the insurance companies thrived during the pandemic.</p><p>These payments were made to assist the businesses, not big insurance companies.  I am seeking an update on this because this section deals with it.  I also have a question on sections 3 and 4 relating to the database, but perhaps the Minister of State can give an update on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.579" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#K00200"><p>This is an important new section in the legislation regarding deducting the value of State supports.  That issue became apparent as the Covid-19 situation emerged.  There is a general misunderstanding among the public because many of the insurance companies had said they would not deduct any payments the State had made from any payments they would be making under business interruption policies.  Many people felt that all that funding was going to come back to the State.  However, what the companies that made those statements did not say is that the vast majority of them had no business interruption policies to start with.  When they knew they had no business interruption policies, it was very easy to make a statement that they would not deduct any State payments from any payments they might be making because they were making no payments anyway.  That point has not been picked up fairly across the industry.  I am putting it on the record now because a narrative about this issue has carried through in that respect.  With regard to the figure the Deputy mentioned, most of that relates to one particular company.  Most of the other companies that have spoken on this in various public venues said they would not be deducting from any of this because they were not providing business interruption policies to start with.  I want to make that clear.  They were correct in what they said, but people did not fully grasp the subtlety of what they were saying.</p> <p>  When this issue arose and it came to our attention during the course of the pandemic that the limited number of insurance companies that had business interruption policies were deducting some of the State payments so that the business or sometimes sole traders, if they were publicans or restaurateurs, would receive the net loss, there was concern in the Department and the Government that the insurance companies might make a profit from the State supports.  We immediately examined this matter closely with a view to dealing with it, but it became clear from legal advice that it was not possible to legislate retrospectively.  Bear in mind that these policies might have been written before the Covid-19 pandemic and these payments happened during it.  When we saw this happening, it was not possible to come back and change a policy that was written 18 months or two years previously because it was a legal document.  It was not possible to look back retrospectively to claim payments in respect of policies that were issued and in existence before that.</p> <p>  The issue that arises then, and I would put this down as one of the big lessons from Covid, is that we saw what happened.  The reason we are introducing these sections is so we can gather information on these supports, and if any other situation arises in the future, we will have a base to work from and to understand how it works.  It might not be related to Covid.  Some other issue could arise in the country where there is an insurance policy and the State is also supplementing some of the cost.  This is a forward-looking legislative measure and it is important that it be seen in that context.</p> <p>  I will make another point.  The reason I looked at this at that stage was that I was conscious that, under the Department of Social Protection, other State payments may be relevant to insurance claims.  There already are processes in place.  We already had legislation in place dating back many years strictly to deal with what is known as the recovery of benefits and assistance scheme by the Department of Social Protection.  I will explain it simply.  Let us say somebody was in a car accident and he or she was out of work for a significant period and received disability payments for a period.  Then the insurance company settles the claim in due course.  It estimates the value of the person's claim at &euro;100,000, for example, but the person has already received &euro;20,000 from the State.  If the company pays out the &euro;100,000 there is a legal mechanism in place for the insurance company to refund that &euro;20,000 back to the State.  That happens currently.  Ultimately, we want to get to that situation across the board, but the first thing we must do is gather information on this.</p> <p>  On the up-to-date figure I have in respect of business interruption policies, the Central Bank has stated that a number of insurers accepted and commenced settling claims as a result of the Central Bank's intervention.  I welcome recent data to the end of February 2022 which show that more than &euro;171 million has been paid to 5,312 policyholders through settled claims and interim payments.  This is up from the earlier figure.</p> <p>  Another point is that this matter is still before the courts, so the matter may yet come to light as part of the quantum hearing in ongoing litigation that remains before the courts.  The approach of the Bill is designed to ensure we do not pre-empt any legal ruling by passing legislation at this stage before the relevant court cases are dealt with.  This issue may be raised during those quantum hearings which are not yet concluded.  From that point of view, I am precluded from saying anything further on this because, as people will appreciate, the matter is currently before the courts.</p> <p>  However, this is really a lesson learned for the future.  We want to have a cross-government approach.  We already have it in the Department of Social Protection and, ultimately, I would like to see this in any Department where a similar situation could arise in the future.  The first thing that must be done is gather the information so the Central Bank will be able to give us information.  When we get that information we can then look at policy implications and draw up legislation in due course.</p></speech>

There is a precedent in social protection legislation which, in my view, is probably the model we should follow, but we need information about what happened during Covid before we can draft any proposal.  We have to gather the information first.  I have an open mind, but my instinct is no insurance company should profit on any State supports, and I believe there would be a unanimous view in the House on that.</p></speech>

Sections 5 and 6 relate to the issue of dual pricing.  Unfortunately, this practice is where companies are identifying loyal but often vulnerable customers who might not have the ability to look around insurance companies and are less likely to shop around, but are also more than likely more sensitive to price changes and so forth.  It is often recognised that price gouging undermines the interests of loyal customers, and this has long been talked about in the House.</p><p>Indeed, it is something a lot of customers talk about a lot as well.  It is welcome that the Central Bank is taking action in regard to banning price discrimination.  This is clearly something Deputy Pearse Doherty has been campaigning on for a long number of years and, in fact, he submitted a complaint as far back as October 2019.</p><p> What is important is that when regulations come into force, they are kept under constant review.  We know that the Central Bank had previously found that 2.5 million customers were paying a combined &euro;187 million more than the actual cost of their policies, which is very significant.  Can the Minister of State advise in regard to keeping these regulations under constant review, if that will be happening and how he sees that going forward?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.596" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#L00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for her constructive comments.  I acknowledge the role of her party colleague, Deputy Doherty, in dealing with this topic over a period of time.</p> <p>  We had complicated issues with price walking and dual pricing, and they were connected issues but subtly different in their own way.  What is happening here is that we are dealing with this issue as part of the programme for Government and the action plan for insurance across all Departments.  To put the insurance plan in context, the relevant committee is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, so the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is involved, as is the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and I am also involved from the Department of Finance because insurance is a regulated industry.  The committee also involves the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and, in particular, the Minister for Justice because much of the legislation comes from the Department of Justice with regard to insurance.  It is a whole-of-government approach.</p> <p>  In dealing with the action plan for insurance, all the bodies I have mentioned have different roles on different aspects, different legislation comes from the Department of Justice, and State agencies like the Central Bank have a key role in implementing some of the measures.  The Department of Finance has put forward this Bill and we also helped bring forward legislation on the personal injuries guidelines six months earlier than had originally been envisaged.  Right across that committee, different sections of the State are doing different operations.</p> <p>  In this section, what we have is an acknowledgement that the Central Bank has agreed to implement this from 1 July for dual pricing only.  That is in regard to motor policies, whereby people should get a price equivalent to that of a new customer.  We have had what we call the loyalty penalty, whereby people who are with an insurance company and never seek to move to another company may well have been paying too much for not doing that.  After nine years, they would be paying a penalty of about 12% or 14%.  The issue in the house insurance market is even more serious and, after nine years, some people are paying up to 34% over and above what they would be paying if they were a new customer going into the same insurance company to insure the same house for the same value.</p> <p>  That is extraordinary but understandable.  Just around Leinster House, I have asked people which company their house insurance is with and they reply that they got their house insurance when they took out their mortgage, and they are not exactly sure.  Very few people query their house insurance because it just goes through as part of the mortgage payment.  For that reason, I think insurance companies have abused the situation and loyal customers, and they were adding a small percentage, year by year, knowing people would never check it.  I encourage people to find out which company their house insurance is with in the first place, and to make sure they make the phone call at the next renewal date.</p> <p>  From 1 July, this practice is going to be outlawed by the Central Bank.  The amendment in this section arises because the Department of Finance has insisted that the Central Bank will not just do it, because it will do it, but that it will produce a report within a set timeframe of one year after the coming into being of the Act, or as quickly as possible thereafter.  I am sure that report will be published by the Central Bank directly as well.  We have asked for some interim information after a six-month period to see the effect of this change.  There is no point in something happening if we do not have the evidence to track it.  Our role here is to make sure there is a reporting mechanism back into the system.  This practice has been ongoing for ages and it is now coming to an end.  We want the evidence and the proof that it is coming to an end.  That is why we have this section to make sure there is a clear report from the Central Bank in regard to those areas.</p> <p>  We are the first country in the EU to introduce this price walking ban.  Other countries in the EU have been talking about it and England has commenced a similar but slightly different approach, but we are the first country in the EU to introduce this.  This is to ensure the Central Bank comes back to us next year with the hard information and then, like everything else, when we get the information, we will be in a position to take whatever policy decisions are required.  I expect that, given the fact the Central Bank is outlawing the practice straightaway from 1 July, we will see reductions in those cases for loyal, long-standing customers.</p></speech>

Many people imagine that if they are loyal to a company, it will be loyal to them and will support them and make sure they get the best deal.  Unfortunately, we often find out that simply is not the case.  What the Minister of State said in regard to home insurance is particularly shocking.  If an insurance company is caught still doing this, do we know what kind of penalties will apply?</p></speech>

Until now, it has been quite legal for them to do it and there is no provision against this abuse of customers&rsquo; loyalty.  It is shocking that the insurance companies were doing that for years.  That is why this is now coming to a head.  The Central Bank has the regulatory powers to deal with the issue.  In regard to the companies, the Central Bank can seek information, it can do audits and, as with previous issues, it will write to the chief executives to correct this.  It has powers in regard to the licences of these companies to ensure they comply with good practice and consumer protection.  The Central Bank itself would be the sanctioning body with the insurance companies because it is the regulator, not the Department of Finance.</p></speech>

In order to protect consumers&rsquo; interests, section 11 amends the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015.</p><p> These amendments will provide for technical changes in order to address two issues identified by the Central Bank of Ireland and relating to the scope of an insurance temporary run-off regime for UK- and Gibraltar-authorised insurers.  This arises directly as a result of Brexit.  The temporary run-off regime was established to facilitate the orderly withdrawal of UK- and Gibraltar-authorised insurers from the Irish market following the departure of the UK from the EU in order to protect almost 35,000 policyholders.  Those companies provided insurance policies to 35,000 policyholders but are now withdrawing from the market because of Brexit.  The aim was to enable such firms to continue to service their existing portfolio of business for up to 15 years in order to ensure service continuity of those insurance contracts for existing Irish policyholders.  Other EU member states also introduced similar provisions.</p><p> Section 11 provides for the following changes to the scope of the temporary run-off scheme.  First, it amends the 2015 regulation to provide that UK and Gibraltar firms in the temporary run-off regime that are in the process of running off their existing insurance liabilities in the State may provide third-party reinsurance business here.  This change will align the temporary run-off regime with the provisions of the 2015 regulations whereby third-country undertakings can carry on reinsurance activities in the State, provided that they satisfy certain conditions.  This should also assist to preserve reinsurance capacity in the Irish market.   This is to facilitate the wind-down in an orderly manner.</p><p> Section 11 further amends the 2015 regulations to enable firms in liquidation that otherwise satisfy the conditions of the temporary run-off regime but may have had their authorisation withdrawn under the law in the UK or Gibraltar prior to the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU to enter into the regime and run-off their Irish insurance portfolio in order to terminate their activity in the State.  This is a separate provision to deal with insurance companies that have gone into liquidation and will not be continuing in the long term.  This is necessary as the current wording of the 2015 regulations makes it a condition of entry to the temporary run-off scheme that the entity was, immediately before the relevant date, authorised as an insurance undertaking under the law in the UK or Gibraltar.  However, some firms in liquidation may have had their authorisation withdrawn before 2021 on the opening of the winding-up of the proceedings and, therefore, would not otherwise be able to enter the temporary run-off scheme.  It is important to note that these changes to the 2015 regulations merely reflect what was the original policy intent behind the temporary run-off scheme.  The amendments will not give UK- or Gibraltar-based insurance firms any competitive advantage over firms based in Ireland or elsewhere in the EU or EEA.  As it is an issue relating to dates, we were concerned that these firms would be captured.  It may be the case that some companies that were in liquidation and had their authorisation withdrawn before 1 January may not otherwise be able to fully avail of this temporary run-off scheme.  There is no change in policy; it is just a clarification of an issue relating to dates.</p></speech>

The Minister is joined by Mr. John O'Donoghue, legal representative for the HSE, Ms Mary Brosnan, director of nursing and midwifery, Professor Mary Higgins, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, Dr. Rhona Mahony, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane, chairperson of the HSE board, Ms Ita O'Sullivan, legal representative for the HSE, Mr. Dean Sullivan, chief strategy officer for the HSE, and Mr. Paul de Freine, head of estates for the HSE.  They are all very welcome.</p> <p>  Members and guests are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If, therefore, their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  I remind members that today's meeting concerns the proposed new national maternity hospital and ask them to stick to that theme rather than raise other issues with the Minister and his officials.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.630" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051100002#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend and for the opportunity to discuss the proposal for the new national maternity hospital.  I am joined by Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane, chairperson of the HSE board, Professor Mary Higgins, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, Ms Mary Brosnan, director of midwifery and nursing at the National Maternity Hospital, and consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Dr. Rhona Mahony, who knows the history of this project like few others and who negotiated the initial Mulvey agreement and can speak to that.  I am also joined by Ms Ita O'Sullivan and Mr. John O'Donoghue, members of the HSE's legal team for this project.</p> <p>  While there is good, proper and important debate about this issue, I believe we all agree on many of the important issues relating to this project.  First, clinicians at the National Maternity Hospital, NMH, provide excellent care to women and infants and have been leaders in modernising women&rsquo;s healthcare.  Second, a new and modern hospital building is urgently needed for the National Maternity Hospital and services for women need to be expanded there.  Third, the new hospital should be built beside a major adult hospital to ensure women will have access to the widest possible range of healthcare.  Fourth, the new hospital must be fully clinically independent and there must be no religious influence, now or in the future.  Fifth, the new hospital must provide all services and all procedures that are permissible under law.  Finally, the State&rsquo;s investment must be protected.</p> <p>  The proposal we are discussing meets all of these goals.  This is a partnership between the State, the National Maternity Hospital and St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group.  The National Maternity Hospital will provide all the clinicians, who will move from Holles Street to the new building, and the National Maternity Hospital will run the new hospital.  The State will fund the construction of the new hospital building and retain full ownership of the building as an asset, while St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group will provide lease ownership to the State for 300 years.  Each party will appoint three directors to the new board of the NMH, and the NMH will, in turn, appoint directors to the board of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group.  The two hospitals will be physically connected to ensure seamless access to care for patients, which is especially important for critically ill patients.  Both hospitals will provide shared services to be used throughout the healthcare campus.  Many clinicians will work in both hospitals, as they do now.</p> <p>  A structure was agreed in the 2016, namely, the Mulvey agreement, whereby the shares in the NMH charitable company will be owned by the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group charitable company.  This provides St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group with some administrative rights relating to, for example, accepting annual accounts at general meetings and approving the appointment of auditors.  The national maternity hospital will be fully clinically, operationally and financially independent.  It will have its own constitution and its own operating licence with the HSE.  All procedures that are currently carried out at the National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street will be provided at the new national maternity hospital.  The new hospital will provide all maternity, gynaecology, obstetric and neonatal services that are legally permissible.  These include, but are not limited to, terminations, tubal ligations and gender-reaffirming procedures.  Religious involvement in St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has ended with the transfer of shares.  Religious involvement in the National Maternity Hospital will also end.  For example, the chairperson of the National Maternity Hospital since its foundation has been the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin.  Religious influence of any kind is expressly prohibited in the new national maternity hospital.  There is no mechanism for any religious involvement, now or at any time in the future, in either St. Vincent's Healthcare Group or the new national maternity hospital.</p> <p>  Ireland does not have a good track record when it comes to religion and women&rsquo;s reproductive health.</p><p>It has a poor and dark history.  Women are, therefore, rightly demanding that when it comes to our new national maternity hospital there can be no religious involvement whatsoever at any point, now or into the future.  Women and, indeed, men are right to demand that.  People for very understandable reasons are demanding absolute assurances that all legally permissible services are provided, and they are right to make that demand.  All of these services are provided in Holles Street today.  The same clinicians, some of whom are here today, are going to provide these new services in the new hospital.</p><p> Concerns are understandably being raised and questions are being asked about land ownership and other issues.  I look forward to discussing these issues with the committee.  I also look forward to hearing from the people who provide the services in Holles Street.  Those of us who campaigned for repeal of the eighth amendment said we must listen to the midwives, nurses and doctors working in our maternity hospitals.  That is what I asked people to do in Wicklow when I walked up and down the streets and knocked on doors week after week.  Some of those same clinicians are with us today.  I hope that on this important issue, we will once again listen to the midwives, nurses and doctors working in our maternity services and providing these services.</p></speech>

They are all very busy people who have other things to do, as do members.  Why does the Minister think there is growing opposition to the proposal?

I believe this ultimately comes down to a deep-seated mistrust of institutional Ireland based on an appalling track record in our country when it comes to the church and women's reproductive health.  Ultimately, I think that is what this boils down to, and I understand that.  It has, therefore, been incumbent upon four Ministers for Health - my predecessors, Dr. James Reilly, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar and the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and me - and two Governments to make sure those concerns are addressed absolutely and the new hospital we set up not only provides all of the guarantees and services that are needed, but gives space to expand the provision of those services and many other women's healthcare services, including maternity, obstetrics, fertility and gynaecology.  I ask for a response to the Deputy's question, because it goes to the heart of everything we are doing here, from some of the clinicians who are working and providing the services.</p></speech>

I agree with the Minister.  Ireland has been through a lot.  When we look back at the history of women's health in particular and the interplay between church and State, it has been very difficult for women.  It has had a profound impact on women's health and lives.  We are now moving forward into a different Ireland.  We have seen huge advances in the past ten years.  The campaign for the repeal of the eighth amendment was a real moment for me.  I remember attending a meeting of a health committee, just like this one, in 2013 when I was pretty much a lone voice.  I was not as lonely as all the women who had gone to Europe to fight their cases on their own.  By 2018, we had all come together and we had a movement and could talk about and express what happened to women.  That was a pivotal point in our history in terms of moving forward in women's health.</p> <p>  With this project, we are moving forward again.  We are saying goodbye to the church completely.  There is no religious ethos pertaining in St. Vincent's hospital.  There is a complete separation.  We are moving forward and leaving that behind.  However, we are moving forward in a different way.  The vision for this hospital is a vision of enormous possibility for what we can give to women in this country.  It is not just about the old facilities in Holles Street where women are crowded into tiny wards and long 14-bed wards, where we do not have an intensive care unit, ICU, or high-dependency unit, HDU, where babies are crammed into units in which their parents cannot be with them and where there are no toilets and a lack of showers.  We have heard a great deal about this.  The new facility is going to be magnificent.  We will have a facility where the tiniest citizens in the State, babies as small as 23 weeks and weighing 500 g, will be in a magnificent, dedicated pre-term birth centre and their parents can stay with them and be involved in their care.  A neonatal intensive care unit is a really scary place.  We know this has much better outcomes for babies.  We will have proper labour rooms.  We will give expression to the maternity strategy in terms of having all that choice for women, with midwifery-led birthing units, birthing pools and beautiful rooms.  Women will have dignified, single-room accommodation across the whole building.  We will have proper operating theatres.  The key here is that those operating theatres will link into St. Vincent's hospital, the very place we need them to link into, and also into the hospitals ICU and HDU, which Holles Street does not have at the moment.</p> <p>  It is much more than that, however.  I think the piece we have missed is what is on the campus of St. Vincent's hospital.  Women have been hearing a lot and have been worried that the services available to them will be restricted.  It is quite the opposite.  We will be hugely increasing services.  The St. Vincent's hospital campus deals with 150,000 inpatient and day-patient cases every year.  There are 50 clinical specialties, more than 200 consultants and 5,000 staff delivering a whole gamut of healthcare services which will be available for women.  The hospital already cares for 500 women with breast cancer every year who are treated there.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.637" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Rhona Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051100002#D00700"><p>I absolutely do not, for two main reasons.  The first is the series of protections that are built into the legal framework that has arisen out of Kieran Mulvey's work.  This is a series of documents that creates layer after layer of protection.  The NMH DAC is a separate company and separate legal entity, which is very important.  In the course of our conversation, I would like an opportunity to go through in detail all of those layers that give us those protections.</p> <p>  In parallel, St. Vincent's hospital is now a secular organisation.  There is no link to the church.  That is over and gone.  When the share transfer was completed, it marked the end of any association with the Religious Sisters of Charity and any association with religion.  We are now a secular organisation and the constitutions of St. Vincent's Holdings, the holding company that holds the shares, and the operating company, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, are published in full on the website.  There is no vehicle or mechanism through which any religious ethos, any Catholic ethos, can be imposed.  That is terribly important.</p></speech>

If we look in particular at termination of pregnancy care, the vast majority who attend us are fit, healthy and well.  There is a significant proportion who have medical conditions where I then have to talk to the clinicians in St. Vincent's hospital who give that advice without any issue.  They do so appropriately, kindly and respectfully.  There have been women who have required termination of pregnancy care on the physical campus of St. Vincent's hospital without any issue from the clinicians or management and administrative staff.  I have provided that care.  That is why I am confident we can do it.</p></speech>

We are interested, of course, because we want to provide the care.  We have had to satisfy ourselves.  We appreciate that people want to ask questions because they are concerned and worried.  We are satisfied with the arrangement.  We hope the effect of this debate will be that everybody else in the country will be satisfied as well and that they realise this is the best thing.  It is the greatest investment in women's health that the country has ever made.  It is a massive step forward.  As Dr. Mahony says, it is a massive step forward for midwifery and nursing medicine so we can provide care to women, pregnant people and neonates.  We totally support this.</p></speech>

Depending on who one talks with, the cost may be &euro;10 per annum for a certain number of years, &euro;800,000 or &euro;600,000, or whatever the case may be.  Could our guests shed some light on where that conflicting information is coming from?  Can they tell the committee from a legal point of view, which is it?</p></speech>

The short answer is that the cost will be &euro;10 per year for the next 300 years.  There are conditions on that.  The conditions are that we, the State, remain as the tenant running healthcare services there.  By agreement, that can be changed but essentially once we are running our hospital on the site, that is that.  There is a condition that we do not look to acquire freehold ownership of the site.  We are entering into an agreement on a leasehold ownership basis.  That is securing that in times to come, this will still be a maternity hospital providing great care.  I will ask Mr. O'Donoghue to come in and add to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.648" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Donoghue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051100002#E00800"><p>There is a clause in the lease which, as the Minister has said, provides that there is a commercial rent which will be abated to &euro;10 per annum as long as the HSE complies with certain conditions.  That is clearly set out in clause 4 of the lease and those conditions are very clear.  Those conditions relate to the State continuing to provide public healthcare facilities from that building into the future and for the term of 299 years.  That protects both parties.  It protects St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, which owns the freehold interest in the site, to ensure that the State does not try to change the use of the facility to something else.  This facility will be state-of-the-art but in less than 299 years, it will need to be redeveloped, replaced and refurbished.  There is no guarantee that it will be required as a public hospital facility in the future so there is no reason for the State to have a freehold interest, or an interest into infinity, on that site.  There are other protections in that document to ensure that this facility, once constructed, and which the State, through the HSE, has full rights over is used for 299 years for public healthcare.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for being here.  He is also welcome.  I will take the Minister back to last Tuesday's Cabinet meeting.

Before the Cabinet meeting, there was a lot of discussion.  Between us all, we agreed before the meeting that we all wanted to open the issue up and have these kinds of debates.</p></speech>

Is it paused on the basis that following hearings such as this one, there could be fresh discussions with St. Vincent's Holdings CLG or is it the view of the Minister that he will go back to Cabinet next week, after these meetings, to sign off on what could have been signed off on last week?</p></speech>

However, it is important that we listen.  It is important that this conversation happens.  I would not rule anything out.</p></speech>

Is this an exercise for the Minister to sell this deal?  He has the right to do that.  We were told this was an exercise in scrutiny.  Many people have concerns.  Is this discussion being held on the basis that this agreement is a <i>fait accompli</i>?  I have heard the Minister say he is listening.  It seems that on the basis of what the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il and in the media, and on the basis of what the Minister is telling me now, the intention is not to go back and renegotiate or discuss any changes.  The proposal will go to Cabinet next week and will be signed off.</p></speech>

It is his job to stand up for taxpayers and the interests of the State.  We know the view of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group as it has been expressed.  There are some holes in that argument and I will get to those in a moment.  However, my point is that before all of this, and this process has been going on for many years, the Religious Sisters of Charity wanted to gift the land to this entity as opposed to gifting it to the State.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group now owns the land.  It is free to do what it chooses with the land.  Am I correct that there is no legal impediment to St. Vincent's Healthcare Group gifting the land to the State?  If it wanted to do that, it could.</p></speech>

That is not contested, but we cannot then credibly argue that the State owns the land.  The group owns the land.  It could gift the land in its entirety to the State, which would remove the need for all the companies that have to be set up.  It would enable the HSE to build a HSE hospital on the land.</p> <p>  If other clinicians could not shake their heads when witnesses are speaking, it might be helpful.</p></speech>

The two HSE board members who dissented from the decision, Professor Deirdre Madden and Dr. Sarah McLoughlin, stated they "continued to have concerns regarding legal ownership of the site and building, and the governance and control of the proposed new maternity hospital" and this "led to our dissent from the Board's decision."  They go on to say: "The advantages of co-location could be achieved by contractual terms through which both hospitals agree to collaborate effectively[...]."  They then go on to say: "The statement from SVHG that they must retain ownership for the delivery of integrated patient care is unsatisfactory and runs contrary to the argument that the location of the underlying freehold ownership has no bearing on the governance [and] operation of the hospital."  It strikes me that this is about control by that group.  It does not want to give the State the land because it does not want a HSE hospital on that site.  As a result of that, we have ended up with a convoluted process, as I have discussed with the Minister in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere, of companies within companies.  I am not a legal expert but some such experts talk about phrases and language in the constitution that are ambiguous.  All of that is a product of the State not owning the land.  That is a fundamental problem.</p> <p>  I will make a point to the clinicians in the room.  I have no difficulty with clinicians arguing we need a new hospital.  We fully agree.  There is nobody in this room who does not want a new national maternity hospital.  I do not dispute that Holles Street is not fit for purpose.  The Rotunda Hospital is not fit for purpose.  Of course we need a new national maternity hospital but we have wider responsibilities.  We have to protect patients, clinicians and the interests of the taxpayer.  The taxpayer and the interests of patients and citizens are best protected by a public hospital on public land, rather than the convoluted process the Minister is presenting to us.</p></speech>

It is not an accurate characterisation of what is happening.  St Vincent's is not appointing board members to the new NMH because it owns the land.  Let us say a third party such as a developer in Dublin owned the land.  That developer would not be appointing board members to the new NMH.  This is a partnership and, as Dr. Mahony spoke to earlier, the reason the State, the NMH and St. Vincent's are all appointing members to the board is that this is a partnership.  One proof of that is that the NMH does not own the land under St. Vincent's but it is appointing board members to St. Vincent's.</p></speech>

I am stating the fact that we have companies within companies, several constitutions and directors coming from three different sources onto the new company being established.   The Minister cannot credibly argue this is not a complicated legal scenario when he looks at all the documents that were published and which we had to go through.  It is only complicated because the land is being gifted to the State.</p></speech>

It is complex.  Of course, an investment of, potentially, &euro;1 billion in a new healthcare campus is complex but the complexity and the governance structures are not based on the land.  As Mr. O'Donoghue has said, we have leasehold ownership of the land for the next 300 years.  The fact St. Vincent's has freehold ownership of the land and it reverts to it after 300 years is not why it is appointing directors or why we have the corporate structures we have.  We have all of this because we are entering into a partnership.</p></speech>

The HSE board got some publicity today.  Two voices demurred but there are 12 members of the board.  The bottom line is the board has approved this, regardless of why and how many members did so.  We have heard the views of Fergus Finlay as to why he supported it, but we did not get the view of the other eight or nine members as to why they supported it.  We got the views of the two who demurred and I respect them and thank them for making their submission to the committee.  For people watching, it is important to state the board of the HSE supports the move.</p><p>To give some of background on myself, an <i>ad hoc</i>cross-party group was established last year with some members from parties, including, from my party, me and one or two colleagues.  It was set up based on those people who had concerns about the move to the St. Vincent's hospital site.</p><p>I was a member of that group so that was where I was coming from.  I had concerns.  The time, energy and detailed interrogation of all the issues involved between last year and this year have been incredibly valuable.</p><p> I supported repeal of the eighth amendment and strongly supported women's right to choose and investment of trust in women to make the best decisions regarding their own health and bodies.  It is important to state that.  The Minister will agree that if we were starting today, everybody would want this hospital built on public land with public money but this process did not begin today.  It began in 2013 and he inherited it two years ago.  Will he give us a brief two- or three-minute summary of what he inherited and where he has taken it to? </p></speech>

My understanding is people have talked about this for decades.  Doctors hired by Holles Street in the 1960s were asked when they were going to move to co-locate with the adult hospital.  The process as we understand it now began in 2013 when the then Minister for Health, James Reilly, announced the intention to move.  This was on the back of a KPMG report, which he received.  In July of that year, the campus project board was established by the HSE and in 2015 a memo to Government on the relocation of the Coombe and the Rotunda, which we should talk about on another day, noted the recommendation that Holles Street should move to Elm Park, in effect.</p> <p>  In 2016, the Mulvey agreement was brought together.  My understanding is the negotiations were complex and at times difficult so Mr. Mulvey was brought in to chair that.  The Mulvey agreement was put together and, in essence, the corporate structures and what we see today came out of that agreement.  Dr. Mahony was involved in that and she may want to add her comments on it.  In 2017, there was a memo to Government from the then Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, with information on the relocation.  Planning permission was secured in 2017 and in 2018 there was another memo to Government on the relocation and agreement in principle on some of the key areas.  In 2018, the contract for the first phase was announced.  As the Deputy will be aware, significant works have already happened, such as pharmacies, car parks and so forth.</p> <p>  What changes have been made since then?  In essence, we have moved from a 99-year lease to a 299-year lease, or from 100 years to 300 years.  We have moved from one public interest director to three.  It was one-four-four; it is now three-three-three and, critically, we have written the constitution.  All parties have been involved in that.  The constitution is essential to all this because it is the operating manual and the legal instructions for how the NMH will work.  What we have done with it is very important.  We are not only guaranteeing clinical and operational independence through the constitution, which everyone has rightly demanded, we have gone much further, which I am advised by the Attorney General is either very rare or unique.  We are not just saying the new hospital can provide all services; we are saying it must provide all services.  We have said six times in the constitution there can never be any religious influence whatsoever.  The board of directors is obliged under its constitution to ensure all services are provided.  As a final certainty, the Minister for Health has the power to intervene at his or her discretion to ensure that all services are provided without any religious influence at all.  The three big changes are boards of directors, the lease and the constitution.</p> <p>  With permission, Mr. Devane will come in on the matter of the board.</p></speech>

For example, we wanted to see the transfer of shares come through.  We wanted to see some of the details on the duration of the lease consistently written into all the documents across the whole agreement.  The constitution was one of the things for which I pushed very hard.  It is the foundation document around protections for women, the independence of clinical decision-making, and making sure this will be the biggest and most exciting step forward and new hospital the HSE will build for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>  It is not just about moving location but increasing capacity.  Some 100 beds will increase to 150 so there will be more and better capacity.  It is to allow the innovations to take place, including things we do not really talk about, such as gynaecological mesh, menopausal clinics and so on.  Those services will be put in as well.  As a board, we saw all these amazing things we were doing.  We had very robust debates.  The conclusion we came to as a board was that there are sufficient protections for the things people are worried about and a tremendous opportunity to take a major step forward.  That was the decision of the board.</p></speech>

It is as if the ethos piece has been forgotten because it seems to have been dealt with successfully.  Ethos was a big issue two weeks ago for protagonists and opponents.  It seems all the concerns and queries around that have been satisfied.  Dr. Peter Boylan will be a witness tomorrow so I have no issue making this point when he is not here as he will have a chance to answer then.  One of his major points, repeated in today's newspaper, is no Catholic-ethos hospital in the world, including St. Vincent's public and private hospitals, permits terminations.  Do terminations take place at present in St. Vincent's Hospital?</p></speech>

Most of the emails I have had regarding this in the past one to two months, related to the justifiable and legitimate fear of women of church interference, or the interference of a religious ethos, in respect of any procedures they are entitled to under law.  We seem to have forgotten that very quickly because it has been dealt with.  All those fears and concerns that were raised have been very adequately dealt with to the point they are not being raised anymore.  It is now all about governance and ownership, but let us not forget the most significant points raised regarding the national maternity hospital were that all procedures and interventions necessary for women's health would be somehow jeopardised under this structure.  It is too convenient to now focus on saying it is all about ownership and governance.  Up to two weeks ago, it was about ethos, religious interference and no Catholic-run hospital in the world could provide X and Y.</p><p>Terminations take place in St. Vincent's hospital right now.  The public and women need to be aware of that, and not for the conversation to be contaminated by supposition, catastrophising, conspiracy building and all the rest of it.  Those are my questions.</p></speech>

I want to put on record that I dispute the points made by the previous questioner.  There has been a range of concerns that many of us have had for several years about this entire project.  It would be interesting just to get some figures on the earlier claim.  Perhaps they could be provided to us in relation to the provision of termination services.  My understanding is that those services are not provided in St. Vincent's in line with the 2018 Act.  If the situation is different to my understanding of it, perhaps we could be provided with figures in that regard.  I am not looking for personal details, only figures.</p> <p>  I go back to comments the Minister made in a earlier reply about the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday of last week.  He said the decision was taken to open up the issue prior to the Cabinet meeting.  That is hard to understand because I recall very clearly the Taoiseach, on his way into that Cabinet meeting, saying to the media that he was entirely satisfied with the proposals and had no concerns whatsoever.  Indeed, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, made a similar comment prior to the meeting.  At any rate, for one reason or another, the decision was taken to open this up.  Would the Minister accept that it would have been a better way of handling this matter to make the legal documents and all other relevant documents available so that people had adequate time to consider them, rather than trying to rush it through without those documents being available?</p></speech>

Considering the scale of this project and the amount of public money involved, would it not have been better if the Minister, prior to last Tuesday, had made those documents available?</p></speech>

We have had this debate in the D&aacute;il and Members in the Oireachtas, including Deputy Shortall, have very reasonably asked to see the detail.  Obviously, we have published all of the documents and we are now discussing the detail.  It is important though that Cabinet has sight of that as well.  Were we to release documents that Cabinet had not discussed, as I think we have all discussed in the D&aacute;il before, questions could arise around whether they represent the Government view or what exactly the detail represents.</p></speech>

By all accounts, the intention was to sign off on this last week at the Cabinet meeting.  As a result of the public outcry, thankfully the documents have now been made available.  Given the complexity of this whole project, including the documents, and to be fair about this and give people a reasonable amount of time - we have been given one week, not two weeks - to consider these complex documents, I ask the Minister if, in the interests of fairness, he is prepared to extend that period to allow further scrutiny?</p></speech>

I put it to the Minister that the first schedule of the lease agreement states in black and white that St. Vincent's Healthcare Group is the owner.  Section 4 of that agreement outlines that the site and the hospital are being leased to the State.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach says the phrase was inserted by the HSE to make sure it would not be a cardiology hospital, neurology hospital or whatever else.  That is to quote his words.</p><p>However, the so-called "fact sheet" that was circulated among Fine Gael backbenchers stated that the HSE will grant an operating licence to the national maternity hospital at Elm Park DAC to run the new maternity hospital and also to St. Vincent&rsquo;s, which will deliver some other health services in the hospital such as dermatology.  Can the Minister explain what that means because it has been put to us, when we query that phase, "clinically appropriate", that is to clarify that it is maternity related services?

We are to some extent protecting maternity services also against the pressures of the State so that the State does not say that it has a state-of-the-art building, it has a lot of extra beds, it has a lot of extra operating theatres and a lot of extra diagnostics and could it not maybe push in and start using those services.

We are just future-proofing for procedures, diagnoses and issues that we do not know about yet.  Forty years ago, the most common form of contraception in Ireland was the Billings method.  Nowadays we have multiple forms of contraception - I am very glad of that - many of which we provide for free for women who are attending for a termination of pregnancy here.</p> <p>  Thirty years ago, I would never have thought we could have done a hysterectomy for a transgender man - in a million years, I would not have thought it - or provide any kind of care-----</p></speech>

We did not think these would happen.  Twenty years ago, if someone had an accreta, she had a hysterectomy.  Now we are doing uterine preservation surgery.  There will be tests, procedures and diagnoses coming up in the future that we do not know about yet and having this "clinically appropriate" means what is clinically appropriate for the time so that we can continue to innovate for women.  For me, it is very respectful for women to have that term.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach is saying something else.  The Minister is saying something else.  It is easy to list the services that will be provided and to qualify that by saying, "but not limited to", which would future-proof the provision of services.</p> <p>  We are told that the HSE insisted on including this phrase in all of the legal documentation.  It is a problematic phrase and the likelihood is it will be challenged in court on several occasions over the next 300 years.  In view of that, is the Minister prepared to revisit that issue?  Is the HSE prepared to withdraw its insistence on the inclusion of that and to come up with a phrase that will be absolutely crystal clear in relation to the services that will be provided?  There are many legal people, and many medics as well, who are seriously concerned about that phrase.  Is the Minister prepared to contemplate the removal of that phrase and replacing it with an agreed form of words?</p></speech>

It matters in terms of services.  It matters in terms of the services provided and protecting those services.  However, if it would be helpful to both the Deputy and the Chair, because I agree with the Deputy that this has become something that people are focusing on and really asking serious and important questions about, I would be more than happy to write formally to the committee - it could be countersigned by the HSE - and lay out formally exactly what is meant by this so that we would have a formal position from the Government to the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I would agree with Deputy Shortall that what we need is something that relates to the actual documentation.  Correspondence between the committee and the Minister and his officials would not be something that in 200 years or 150 years will be laid before a court as legally binding.</p> <p>  I am incredibly disappointed by the phrase "trust doctors".  When I walked the streets in Dublin Central on repeal, that is not what I said to people.  Our slogan, the Green Party slogan, was "Trust her" - trust women.  The issue around "clinically appropriate" is that it places all of the power in the hands of clinicians and in the hands of those legal professionals who will then interpret what "clinically appropriate" means.</p> <p>  Over the past few weeks, I have spent a long time looking over these documents.  I listened to lots of legal opinions, both of those who want to proceed with the agreement and of those who question it.  Many of them are eminent legal minds saying very different things and the idea that it is not open to interpretation is simply not credible.</p> <p>  I can totally understand how clinicians feel it is important but that does not negate the requirement for more rights-based language here.  That is incredibly important when it comes to reproductive care, and that we centre women in it.</p> <p>  There is a trust deficit here and we have ambiguous language.  There is a trust deficit between the institutions of the State and the people of the State.  Particularly when it pertains to this phrase, what can be done now that does not delay the project but that reaches out to bridge that gap and to close that trust deficit?  What can we do now that is legally binding?</p></speech>

What I had said to people was, "Let us listen to the midwifes, the nurses and the doctors", but I take the Deputy's point and I agree.  The reason we are having this debate is because there is a very understandable deficit of trust because of the history in the State between religion and women's reproductive health.</p></speech>

The institutions of the State, in the Department of Health and in the HSE, have also let down women.  I understand the idea of listening to clinicians but Savita Halappanavar died under clinical care.  Therefore, it has to be more than locating this in religious ethos.</p></speech>

Is there a way for the Minister now, without delaying the project, to bridge that gap in order that he can provide people with some kind of confidence that is not the case?  This should be more than what is there right now, because what is in the documents right now is not enough to do that.</p></speech>

The first is whether there is more we can do.  Let us see.  As I said earlier, we have to be open to this discussion.  One of the things we are doing is clarifying categorically what it does mean on the record of the Oireachtas.  This carries legal weight.  I have also offered to write to the committee to do that.</p> <p>  The second part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question was around there being ambiguity, but the constitution is crystal clear.  It is important to point out that the clause here that matters states that the powers &ldquo;must be exercised by the Directors independently, without religious ethos or ethnic or other distinction, in such a manner that any maternity, gynaecology, obstetrics and/or neonatal services which are lawfully available in the State shall&rdquo; - not may - &ldquo;be available in the New NMH&rdquo;.  The Minister has power whereby the directors have the duty to carry out any direction that is issued by the Minister, including "to ensure that any maternity, gynaecological, obstetrical or neonatal service which is lawfully permissible in the State shall be available in the hospital, without religious ethos".  The phrase &ldquo;clinically appropriate&rdquo; does not appear in either of those clauses.  It only appears in clause 3(1), for the reasons that Professor Higgins, the Taoiseach and I, along with others, have already outlined-----</p></speech>

A correspondence to this committee does not bear that kind of legal weight, as far as I am aware but I am not a legal professional.  It would have to be something that in the 298th year they can still point to.</p> <p>  I want to move on to the business case.  I am aware that the business case is still under review.  I have a number of questions.  First, can the Minister elaborate a bit on that review?  My understanding is that the hospital itself is to be 55,000 sq m.  I am drawing on a previous life when I say that the healthcare build costs are approximately &euro;5,000 per square metre.  That would give us a cost for the hospital of &euro;275 million.  If you add on maybe 25% for VAT and fees, 25% for equipping, that still brings us to a figure that is under &euro;500 million.  Yet, we are quoting a figure of &euro;1 billion in the general ether of this conversation.  How have we got to the figure of &euro;1 billion?  Where is that number coming from?  By the way, I have factored inflation into my figures.  </p></speech>

The full costings have not been put together.  We need the Government decision.  We need the detailed business case.  Then it has to go out to tender.  When the Stat has a view, it will have an accurate view as to what it should cost.  Typically, that figure would not be released, because we want to run a competitive tender.</p></speech>

A contractor who knows that this project will be coming out for tender and will know that the actual costs of the construction build for the building at &euro;5,000 per square metre will be &euro;275 million.  We have now inflated and almost doubled the cost of the hospital ourselves before we ever put it out to tender.</p> <p>  To go back to the business case, can the Minister give us details about why this is under review?  Can he give us details about the enabling works?  As I understand it, the enabling works are something in the region of 20,000 sq m, which would result in approximately &euro;50 million in costs.  Is that what we are looking out for the enabling works and the car park?  </p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses for the work they do and for coming along here today.</p> <p>  I have to say that I feel that we are in the middle of something really weird.  Drip-fed bits of information keep coming at us, as elected politicians.  We are not getting the full truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  For example, the Minister has just told the committee this morning that parts of the new national maternity hospital will be occupied by other elements of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group that have been displaced.  He cannot clarify for us if that will all be public, all private or a mixture of both.  I find that really upsetting.  We are getting this drip-fed information bit by bit when we have an opportunity to delve down.  </p> <p>  Earlier, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane said that for the last year they have been debating and robustly listening to queries about this project.  Yet, we have been in here asking questions for the last year and we have been getting no answers.  I do not know how many times most of us in the Opposition stood up in the D&aacute;il to ask for full debates about the future of the national maternity hospital.  We are now getting it, after kicking up a fuss and having been told that we are guilty of a campaign of disinformation or misinformation.</p><p>The Minister has come in today and is remembering the moment of repeal and the seismic shift that was for the women of this country.  Members of the Government engaged in that campaign, whether they were knocking on doors or advocating for it and that was helpful but repeal changed everything.  When you look back at the history of the debate, discussion and negotiations around the new national maternity hospital that go back to 2012 and 2013, it seems to me from what the Minister has told us today that the bones and structures were all agreed pre-repeal.  How much did post-repeal Ireland change that discourse and discussion?  It must have changed it.  A lot of that discourse and discussion took place when the sisters or nuns were still on the field.  We are told that they are gone from the field and we are repeatedly told that no religious influence will be allowed.<br/><br/>I want to put the following thesis to the Minister.  In the same week we got the announcement that the Cabinet was about to sign off on this arrangement the US Supreme Court leak happened.  It was leaked that Roe <i>v.</i>Wade was about to be seriously challenged and possibly taken down.  For me, as somebody who has fought for repeal and abortion rights all of my life, that was shocking.  I understand, as many women in this country do, that for women's healthcare and reproductive rights you make two steps forward and you can take four back.  That happens because there will always be a kickback and a backlash against women's rights.  That is part of the way our society has been structured.  Women's oppression has always involved us making gains and them lashing back against us.  Religious interference does not always appear in nuns with long veils traipsing the corridors in the image of Mother Mary Frances Aikenhead.  That is not what we mean when we talk about religious interference.  We mean a deep-seated and deep-rooted prejudice and an in-built thinking about women's health that goes into the heart of the Civil Service, the health service and the political establishment.  It is something that cannot be seen and it does not wear a veil but it traipses around our bodies and lives all of the time and I am seriously worried that this concern will be dismissed.  The Minister said six times that it is in the Constitution, that there will be no religious interference and that this cannot be true.  That is nonsense and that is not the way it works.<br/><br/>I am delighted that the Minister acknowledged this morning that there is a much more deep-seated sociological reason for the mistrust around this deal and that it is not just headcases like me or others giving out misinformation.  There is a deep-seated reason for it.  We have to deal with that deep-seated reason and to do so we need much more than we have had until now in terms of reassurances from the Minister that there will be no religious interference.  For that we need to know why the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, which will have deep-seated and deep-rooted ties to the religious orders, will have the right to appoint three board directors and to appoint the chair every few years.  Why does it have that right?  If this is to be an utterly independent national maternity hospital for the women of Ireland to deliver all reproductive and maternity care then why does it want that interest?  It seems to really and passionately want it.<br/><br/>Its fact sheet is extremely interesting and it does not provide the sort of facts the Minister gives us when he repeats that we own it.  Mr. O'Donoghue keeps telling us that we &quot;effectively&quot; own it because of these leasehold rights but we do not.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group says that it owns the land and the rights and that it is on the board because of this, that and the other.  I am deeply suspicious of its interest in this project.  The Minister for Health was involved in devising Sl&aacute;intecare and I do not understand why we would use all this public money and this opportunity to create a truly one-tier medical system with no discrimination against people based on the depth of their pockets or the size of their wallets with a clearly publicly-owned and funded national maternity hospital in this way.  Why do we not take the opportunity to have that?  That is clearly not what we have and the plot thickens when the Minster tells me about the private elements that will be in the building and about the clinical independence.<br/><br/>Somebody mentioned Savita Halappanavar.  I think of her every day but I did not want to mention her name.  However, now that she has been dragged up I want to say that as she was dying, somebody took a decision that it was clinically inappropriate to give her the abortion that she and her husband asked for.  Somebody took that decision and even then, pre-repeal, it was legally permissible to do that to save her life.  Clinical appropriateness can be decided by somebody who does not agree with my view of the right to choose and of a woman's control of her body.  That could still happen with that the phrase &quot;clinically appropriate&quot; mixed up with the term &quot;legally permissible&quot;.  It is obfuscating in terms of where women stand.  What about what they want, rather than what the clinicians want?<br/><br/>We need to delve down into this much more and we need more time and reassurance.  If we removed the ownership of the land from the equation, we would get rid of this labyrinthine structure that has been described as Kafkaesque, involving three boards of management with three constitutions and three ways of appointing people and the State would deal directly, once and for all, with the future of women's health.  I would like the clinicians and the Minster to address those concerns that I still have, despite this long debate.</p></speech>

I will make a few quick points as follows.  First, a view has been expressed that we could just own the land and the building and that it could be a HSE hospital.  We could take the current national maternity hospital out of it and it could be a HSE-run hospital.  There are 19 maternity hospitals or units in the country and at the start of the year, ten of them provided services.  By the end of the year 14 of them will provide services, so we are all moving in this direction.  There are 11 maternity hospitals providing services right now and the eight that do not provide services are HSE hospitals.  We own the land and the buildings in those hospitals and there are no voluntary structures there whatsoever.  The hospitals that have led post repeal are the voluntary hospitals and the people sitting with us today.  The idea that has been put forward that if they were just HSE hospitals then that would solve the problem is clearly not correct because the eight maternity hospitals that do not provide services are HSE hospitals.</p> <p>  Second, the ownership of the land is not linked to the appointment of directors.  The land under the National Maternity Hospital, Holles St., is owned by the Earl of Pembroke, whoever that is, and he has no influence.  If the Deputy owned the land and we were getting a leasehold ownership for 300 years from her then she would not be appointing any directors.  The directors are being appointed because this is a partnership.  The national maternity hospital, which does not own the land under St. Vincent's University Hospital, is appointing directors to that board as well.  I might ask the clinicians about this.  Could Ms Brosnan come in on this point?</p></speech>

Everything the Minister says conflicts with the fact sheet from the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  The Minister says we own the land but the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group says that it owns the land.  The Minister asks what interest the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has but it says that it has an interest in it.  The St. Vincent's Healthcare Group asks why it requires ownership of the land and it says that land ownership is essential to ensure the ongoing provision of the best possible care for patients attending St. Vincent's University Hospital and the national maternity hospital.  That is not what the Minister says and it says something different.  The Minister says land ownership is irrelevant but the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group says it is very relevant.  Why does it have this continued interest in it?</p></speech>

The Minister and the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group are singing from different hymn sheets and that does not help.  Could the Minister have a meeting with the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, sit down and ask why it is saying one thing when we are saying another and why it says it owns it when we say it does not?  I ask the Minister to get his act together because it does not bode well for a future partnership in our healthcare that the various parties are saying different things about the structures.</p></speech>

It has been clearly said that the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has the freehold and that for the next 300 years the State will have the leasehold ownership.  That is the position.

There is a question on that fact sheet asking:  &quot;Who owns the NMH?&quot; and the answer to that is as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	The new NMH DAC will be part of St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group [which is the subsidiary and we have all talked about the protections].<br /><br />The hospital building will be owned by the Irish State and will be operated by the new NMH DAC under an operating licence agreement from the HSE.<br /><br />The land is owned by SVHG [which is not disputed and which is a freehold interest] and is leased for 299 years to the Irish State [which I have previously said is a sufficient length of time for whatever building will be constructed on that land].  This is not unusual and many state institutions are on lands not owned by the government. </blockquote><p>I would say, as a property lawyer, that is not unusual that buildings are constructed on leasehold interests.

I am the director of midwifery for the last 15 years in the National Maternity Hospital.  I am passionately interested in this project as are so many stakeholders.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked particularly about why dermatology is in the building.  There are very detailed maps available for everybody to scrutinise this.  Much of St. Vincent's campus will be disrupted to build this very large structure.  It is around 50,000 m2 of which 35,000 m2 to 40,000 m2 will be the national maternity hospital's business.  There is another part of that campus that will be shared services, particularly all the catering and all the sterile services department.  They will all be shared and quite a lot of other facilities.</p> <p>  The other element is that St. Vincent's current campus will lose a lot of its space.  Procurement, ward areas such as dermatology and transitional care beds all had to be planned into the new service.  There is a very large, long, L-shaped building in the plans.  At the moment it is configured as a red block in the diagrammatic schematic picture.  If you drill down, there is an L shape which is built into five or six different elements, that is, our own big build - hopefully- the shared services and what St. Vincent's needs to build to replace what we are taking over.  It is very complicated because it is a working hospital.  It is the largest campus hospital in south Dublin and Leinster, almost.  A huge amount of work will be required to be done in the middle of a working campus.  It is complicated.  We phased it.  There was originally discussion of doing it in two phases and now it will hopefully be built in one.  We are very comfortable that the language that was put into the document protects maternity, women's health and neo-natal services for the future.</p></speech>

I can only say from a professional perspective that as midwives and clinicians working in the hospital as nurses working and providing all of the services at the moment - we mentioned fertility, termination of pregnancy and sterilisation - all those things are happening without religious influence and we know they will continue to happen.  It is ten years ago that Savita Halappanavar passed away.  It was a tragedy for every person involved and in particular her family and all the community.  The legislation since then has protected women's interests.  Termination of pregnancy is now legal.  It is being provided in many of the hospitals in the country.  That will continue in the St. Vincent's campus.</p></speech>

Fair play to Ms Brosnan for having such confidence that she can guarantee the future of women's healthcare in terms of abortion in this country.  Nobody in the United States can guarantee it for women in America and they have had it long, long before we have had it.</p> <p>  While I have a minute, I want to thank Professor Deirdre Madden and Dr. Sarah McLoughlin for their statement this morning.  They have been hugely courageous in providing that statement to us.  It should be published and everyone should read it.  In the closing paragraph they express their concerns on governance and control.  It noted that: "Although the agreed clause in relation to services will facilitate the provision of all legally permissible services at the new NMH boards also influence the culture, values, and ethics of the entity they govern, and this gives rise to the legitimate concerns for us about the potential influence of ethos".</p> <p>  I return to how we have three sets of appointees on a board of management instead of a Minister for Health - who I do not fully trust at the moment because of everything I have heard that contradicts what I am reading; even if I trusted the Minister for Health - being able to appoint the directors of the boards or some entity that does not have the vested interest of the St. Vincent's Hospital group and others.  I do not trust it and I think that is shared by many others in the country.  We have a statement from these two eminent people who dissented from the decision on 13 March to go ahead with this deal on 14 March.  I think people need to take note of that statement.  The idea that ethos can influence medicine is always there.  We need much more to guarantee that just because the nuns have gone off the pitch, the influence of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group will have much more weight than it ought to.  I want to thank the two women for taking the courageous step of making that statement.  </p> <p>  I am publicly asking the Minister to hold off on making the decision until we delve down much further into what is going on.  I have heard Dr. Mahony repeatedly talk about how bad things are in Holles Street.  I understand that.  I disagree with some commentators who have said it is like a slaughter house.  It is not like a slaughter house.  I have friends who gave birth there in the last year and they got on very well.  We need to calm down a bit.  We need to step back and really delve down into what we are doing here.  We need to give it more time.  If we have given it eight or 12 years, it can take another bit more time to get it right.  We took a long time with the national children's hospital.  That is costing us a load of money but at least it is being built on a campus where they own the land and are sharing the state-of-the-art facilities and medical facilities with St. James's without all this nonsense of three boards of directors and three constitutions and three mixed-up ways of dealing with things.  Why could we not do the same as with the national children's hospital and St. James's with this?  It is because St. Vincent's Healthcare Group do not want it.  It wants a huge influence on this hospital.</p></speech>

They are managing to serve a community of people who are giving birth there.  Today probably 20 women will give birth over the course of the day.</p></speech>

What is the rock on which we are building these guarantees?  It is the constitution of the hospital.  That is what matters.</p></speech>

It is not that I do not trust anybody at all on the planet to do stuff.  I absolutely trust the clinicians sitting here in front of me.  I admire and totally trust the midwives, nurses and doctors.  The problem is that we have weak abortion laws in this country that have allowed for conscientious objection to be used all over the place without giving women access to the rights they should have.  I want to see a national health service in this country, as does the Minister because he signed up to it, which is freed from voluntary, charity and private medicine.  That is where we have to go.  We are certainly not going there with this hospital and this structure.</p></speech>

It is not overt religious influence I am concerned about but covert influence.  The influence of the church is rampant in education and, unfortunately, it is also rampant in healthcare.  Does the Minister not think there is something ironic about the Taoiseach reading a letter from the 19 maternity providers in this country in support of this project into the record of the D&aacute;il while eight of them are not providing termination services?  I believe there is something fundamentally ironic about that.  I have a simple question.  The Cabinet postponed the decision for two weeks but is anything going to change with regard to this project?  Have the two weeks of engagement led to even one sentence of the constitution of the hospital changing or to any change to the structure?  Is all that has happened that we have paused the decision for two weeks?  Will the exact same memo that went to the Government two weeks ago be passed next Tuesday?  Will anything at all be different in light of the discussions we have had here this morning or the engagement the Minister has had over the last ten or 12 days?</p></speech>

I provide termination of pregnancy services and I advocated, fought and put my professional self on the line to ensure that women should, quite rightly, have access to termination of pregnancy services as autonomous women, services that make healthcare safer for women.  That is really important.  There is no way that I would engage in anything that would sacrifice that.  I fought hard enough alongside all the women and I will never forget the abortion campaign, seeing women coming out and telling their stories, the pain we heard of, how women were listened to on that occasion and how we changed everything.

I thank the Senator.  My view is that it is not acceptable that there are eight HSE hospitals that are not providing those services.  I do not believe that is acceptable.  It is one of the things that is being looked at in the review of the operation of the Act.  However, the direction of travel is very important.  With regard to what is happening right now, this year, we will have gone from ten hospitals to 14 hospitals providing termination services.  That is very important.  This is the second year in which the maternity strategy will have been fully funded.  This year and last year, we have been in the process of setting up a national network of new women's health services in gynaecology, menopause, endometriosis and infertility.  I hope to secure funding in the budget to make publicly funded IVF available next year and to begin to phase that in.  We are introducing free contraception this year, starting with young women from 17 to 25.  Women's healthcare, including all of the services we are talking about today, is an absolute priority for this Government.  An entire national network of service provision is being built at the moment.</p> <p>  I do not want to say the word "ironic" but one of the things that is interesting about this debate is that, although some may have, I have never heard anyone question Holles Street with regard to termination services.  Is it not interesting that two of the members of the board of Holles Street are priests?  One of them, the Catholic archbishop of Dublin, is the chair.  That role is agreed as part of the articles of association of the hospital, dating from the 1800s.  What we are essentially doing is moving the National Maternity Hospital, which everyone accepts is a leader in women's health services, to a state-of-the-art building, to which that hospital is contributing because it is selling its building on Holles Street.  We are putting in nine new directors and replacing all of those old structures.  Right now, we do not own the land under the Holles Street hospital and we do not own the building.  The chair of the board is the archbishop of Dublin.  There are elected representatives, councillors, on the board but there are no ministerial appointments to the board.  That hospital is not obliged, under its constitution, to provide all of these services.  We are moving to a new model and a state-of-the-art hospital co-located with an adult hospital.  The new hospital will be legally obliged to provide all services, any religious influence is expressly disallowed and the Minister and State have the power to intervene if necessary.  It is interesting to look at where we are and what we are proposing.</p><p>What we are doing here is taking any religious involvement out.  We are moving from relying on the wonderful clinicians in Holles Street to provide the services to mandating that they must provide them.  That is what is happening here.  It is very interesting to look at where we are and where we are going; we are moving in exactly the right direction.  I do not believe there should be any religious involvement in any healthcare provision in our country and we are actually taking religious involvement out of the national maternity hospital with this move.</p></speech>

Dr. Mahony and I were involved in the model of care and the guidelines.  Indeed, we have written most of them with our colleagues.  We were one of the first providers to provide under sections 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the Act.  We provide care for women in all aspects of legal care and we will continue to do that because that is our ethos as a hospital.  The ethos of the clinical staff of the hospital is to provide respectful care to women and transgender men.  We have a guideline on abortion care for transgender men.  That is how dedicated we are and that is our culture and ethos.  I really dislike this assumption that there are nuns out there who are going to somehow mind influence me to stop me from providing care that is respectful for women and transgender men.  It is disrespectful to our beliefs as doctors, midwives and nurses.</p></speech>

What we are trying to achieve or guarantee here is that there will not be any religious influence at the national maternity hospital.  If Professor Higgins takes offence at being questioned on that, I would disagree-----</p></speech>

It has been suggested that the national maternity hospital being a separate company is a bad thing but it is actually a really good thing.  The Mulvey agreement fell apart for its first two mediations because we were going to be a branch of St. Vincent's and I very much wanted us to be an independent company.  People have described us as a subsidiary but we are a separate legal entity.  I just want to go through some of the layers.  This is a company that is dedicated to the provision of healthcare for women.  It is actually different from the other hospitals in Ireland.  It is different from the HSE hospitals where one cannot mandate for a termination to take place where one does not have all of the layers of protection.  This is a company that has been designed to deliver care.</p> <p>  If I may, I would just like to go through all of the layers because I think it is important.  I would also like to address, again, the fact that the nuns are gone because it is central-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.898" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Rhona Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051100002#O00700"><p>It is central to our debate.  The first point is that the operation of the hospital is transferring from its charter to a new company, NMH Designated Activity Company, DAC, which is an independent legal entity.  That provides protection of itself because company law means that the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group will, from the outset, have very limited scope to interfere.  On top of that, as the Minister has said, the next really important piece is the constitution of the DAC, which is really and truly enshrining all of the values and principles that we considered so important, when we were designing this, to protect women.  The principle, which is now enshrined in the legal framework, is that the hospital will have clinical, financial and operational independence and without getting too legal, we will be able to provide all legally permissible services without religious ethos or other distinction.</p> <p>  The next layer, and the really big piece, is the reserved powers which cover the independent operation of the hospital.  They are exercised independently by the directors and any service that is legally permissible is available.   We also have the Minister's direction to ensure that those reserve powers are exercised.  People keep saying that this hospital is a 100% subsidiary but it actually has a really special share, called a golden share.  That golden share is held by the Minister and it has very special powers.  It protects the inviolability of the reserve powers and ensures that the director's obligations are provided for.</p> <p>  The next layer is the board of directors.  We have heard a lot of comment about directors and some suggestions that directors coming from St. Vincent's would act against the interests of women's health.  That is very egregious.  When one is a director of a company or hospital, one takes it very seriously.  One has a fiduciary duty to ensure that everything one does is for the benefit of the patients one is serving.  When one is on a board - and I am on a board - everything one does has got to be to the benefit of the patients one serves.  It is wrong to suggest that directors would break their fiduciary duty when we do not even know who they are yet.  That is very unfair.</p> <p>  The operating licence from the HSE is another layer which gives us freedom and independence to protect.  Then we have an ownership lease, which is giving us 299 years on the site, and we have a board and the mastership system.  These are all the layers and that is even before I get to explaining that there is no religious ethos at St. Vincent's.  St. Vincent's is now a secular hospital under the current board.  Again, people are saying that the current board is some kind of proxy for the religious but this is the very board that spent the last number of years separating the hospital from the church because it wants to emerge into the future as a hospital whose only ethos is delivering the best national and international practice of care for the patients it serves.  This is the very board that has removed a religious ethos.</p></speech>

Is there any way of defining that within the constitution of the hospital?  This is a major issue for the people who are listening in to this debate.  While I may be reassured by the Minister's explanation, the public has to be reassured as well.  Can we define "clinically appropriate" in an explicit way within the constitution of the hospital?</p></speech>

At a minimum, what we have already done is to define it explicitly here - what it is and what it is not.  I am not a lawyer but the advice is that Oireachtas proceedings would form part of any considerations were matters to ever go to court.  The second thing I can do, which I said to both Deputies Hourigan and Shortall, is that I can write formally to the committee so that there is a written record that is absolutely unambiguous.  I can engage with the committee on that.</p> <p>  I am going to reflect on this, as is everyone else.  There is a lot of debate, a lot of different issues and many really important matters have been raised.  Obviously, I and others will reflect on the entire discussion.  </p></speech>

I appreciate why the Minister is saying here and on the airwaves, which is that the approximately eight hospitals that do not provide abortion are HSE-owned.  I do not think it is necessarily the "gotcha" the Minister thinks it is.  I think it undermines him as Minister for Health because it seems he cannot get his own State-owned hospitals to provide basic healthcare for women for which he and us campaigned and voted yet he expects us to believe that he or some other Minister with the golden share will be able to intervene in this particular hospital and insist it offers healthcare services that he cannot get hospitals under HSE management to provide.  This is possibly where people are not feeling assured because the Minister's statement is only confirming people's fears that the Minister may not be able to provide for it or step in and insist on it because he does not have HSE hospitals in order.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.907" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1663" speakername="Annie Hoey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051100002#R00400"><p>I am highlighting what I think the public perceives when the Minister says that line.  It is certainly what people have said to me.  I do not think the line is helpful for the Minister in this debate.  The Labour Party position is that we hand over too many projects or State assets to voluntary bodies.  We are moving forward in Ireland.  I appreciate that everyone here is painstakingly explaining to us the different structures, layouts and set-ups but, ultimately, it still seems to boil down to, and this is a public perception, this not being a State-owned building on State-owned lands.  This is the crux of the matter.  People are unable to marry these two things together.  I do not know that we will be able to come out of this committee having married those two things together because I think this is how the public feels and I do not know if a huge amount can be done about that.</p> <p>  I find it difficult to follow some of the companies, set-ups, people and complicated lease agreements.  It is company after company and I feel like we are going to end up in the Cayman Islands.  I am trying to follow these things.  This is not in any way to suggest that anything is going to end up there.  It is a complicated thing for members of the public to follow.  Things that are making it difficult to follow include the fact that some pieces of the paper trail may be missing.  Some of the stuff has been drip fed to us.  It has been a bit of a sprint effort to go through the documents released last week.  Two things are missing.  We are bringing the Vatican back into this so forgive me but in respect of the agreement was sought between the Vatican and the Religious Sisters of Charity, whatever that agreement or paper trail was, we do not have sight of that.  That is a cause for concern for the public because we do not know what was agreed.   Maybe someone here has seen that but I have not seen it.  People have not seen whatever the conditions of the agreement are.  This land is extremely valuable.  It is a valuable asset.  It is hard for people to believe that the Vatican just went "there are absolutely no terms and conditions.  You can just do whatever you like with it."  If it has said that, it would be really helpful for members of the public to see that paper trail.  </p> <p>  Another thing that is a sticking point in public understanding is the fact that what is in the table today is a slightly different agreement to what was touted in 2013.  My understanding is that this change took place around 2017.  It feels as though there was a change in how this would going to look.  We went from public land and public ownership to this agreement.  Has the Minister had sight of or examined the correspondence between the former Minister, Deputy Harris, and his senior officials around 2017 outlining how we got to the current agreement?  Can this be made publicly available because this is something of a sticking point for a lot of people?  </p> <p>  There is a question around the issue of indemnity in the share transfer agreement.  I know a couple of legal experts, and I would welcome the Minister's own legal opinion on this, have said that some of these terms of indemnity are perhaps vague and could even cover the Religious Sisters of Charity holding company, RSC Caritas.  Is it correct to say that the indemnity will extend as far as that?  If so, is it appropriate for the State to give that indemnity to it?  </p> <p>  What happens if the Religious Sisters of Charity ceases to exist?  We have this layered system.  What is the legal follow on if the Religious Sisters of Charity ceases to exist?  Could the Minister elaborate on who owns what because these are the questions that have come into my inbox?  Who would own what if the Religious Sisters of Charity was to cease to exist within the next 300 years, and we do not know what that will look like?    </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.908" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051100002#R00500"><p>The first two questions are around this ask from the Labour Party and others who say they want a State-owned building on State-owned land.  I understand fully why people want that.  The point I was making previously was that this does not provide the guarantee that people may be demanding because when you look at the remaining maternity hospitals or wards that do not provide them, you can see that they are all State-owned hospitals on State-owned land.  By definition, that model does not guarantee what people want.  In fact, it is the voluntary hospitals that have led the way on this.  Regarding the Senator's very reasonable question about why the HSE hospitals are not providing these services, this year, we will have moved from ten to 14 so we are moving quickly in the right direction.  Partly this is because we are directing funding.  I have ring fenced funding for termination services so several hospitals have the money and investment.  We are investing at a level never seen before in maternity services, gynaecology, menopause and endometriosis - a wide variety of areas.  All of this money coming into our services is one of the things helping these hospitals to do it.</p><p>The question was about why we cannot get HSE hospitals to provide services.  I respectfully answer that we are doing so.  We are moving from ten to 14 and I intend to move further.  We are all interested in the review of the Act, which we will debate here.  That is another mechanism that we all want to use to identify the final blockages and to get rid of them.</p><p> On the matter of having a State-owned building on State-owned land, we will build the building and it will be ours.  We hold the operating licence, appoint three directors and the Minister can intervene at any time to ensure that all services are being provided and that there is no religious influence in the hospital.  The State has strong involvement in this new national maternity hospital that we do not have at all in the current National Maternity Hospital, yet it is a leading hospital.  We, as Members of the Oireachtas, have to decide on the land issue.  I would prefer for us to own the land.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, and I asked for that.  The position of St. Vincent's from the first day is that this has never been negotiable.  The original agreement was for a 99-year lease, which has moved to 299 years.  The conditions are essentially that we run a healthcare service on it, for &euro;10 a year, which is basically free.</p><p> There is a question about whether we could try harder to get St. Vincent's to give us the land.  It would say that it is doing so, for the next 300 years.  We cannot get freehold of the land.  Others have very reasonably asked if there could be a compulsory purchase order for the land.  I asked that of the Department.  The answer is that we could try, but I received legal advice that there would be no guarantee of success, because we would have to prove that it has to be built there and nowhere else in Dublin and that 300 years is not enough for us to have lease ownership for a building with a useful life cycle of 50 or 60 years.</p><p> Secondly, this is a partnership.  It would not surprise me if an involved party said we approached it, asked for a partnership and that it gave us the land for 300 years, and that if we are now going to bring it to court, it is not interested in a partnership since that does not feel like a partnership.  It comes down to whether we are willing to move to another site.  Those advocating for it present it as a viable alternative.  Unfortunately, we cannot own the land, but could we build somewhere else?</p></speech>

The Senator asked what would happen if the order ceased to exist.  From our perspective, nothing would happen.  It has no involvement whatsoever.  Finally, any relationship between the order and the Vatican is a matter for them.  People have asked if the Government will release their correspondence.  We do not have that correspondence, because it is not correspondence with us.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group publicly stated that there were no conditions and that no such conditions from the Vatican would ever have been entertained.</p></speech>

It is entirely between the Religious Sisters of Charity, the new company, St. Vincent's Holdings, and St. Vincent's Healthcare Group below it.  The new national maternity hospital designated activity company will have no role or liability.  It has nothing to do with that indemnity.  It only covers any potential liability or risk to the Religious Sisters of Charity, which it is then indemnified for by St. Vincent's Holdings and St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  We looked at those documents to make sure there was nothing particularly unusual or untoward in them, but they are of no relevance to the State.

The site will have a public hospital, a private hospital, a maternity hospital, general practitioner services, screening services, pharmacies, community-based services and many other services.  For the management of the site as a healthcare campus, there should be single ownership.  Many of the shared services for the entire campus will also be provided at the maternity hospital and university hospital.  We are building shared services for the entire campus as part of the national maternity hospital.  I was recently in Texas Medical Center just outside Houston.  I am told it is the biggest healthcare campus anywhere in the world.  It is a voluntary healthcare campus, with a huge variety of healthcare providers.  Despite that, there is one owner of the campus, which is the Texas Medical Center.  St. Vincent's is applying the same logic here.</p> <p>  I am in the realm of speculation now, so forgive me.  All of the debate is about why we should trust St. Vincent's.  People say that it is a fantastic healthcare provider.  There is narrative about whether something is inherently wrong with St. Vincent's, even though it has provided fantastic healthcare for many years.  From St. Vincent's perspective, it has to ask what the long-term motivations of the State are.  It could sell, we could become its freehold owner, then the Government might decide in 70 years that it is done with the maternity hospital, to merge the Coombe and the national maternity hospital, and to build a brand new hospital in Blanchardstown.</p><p>St. Vincent's wants this as a healthcare campus for many years to come.</p></speech>

I think that is putting words in people's mouths.  Our job, as legislators, is to ask questions, including of the Minister.  He is the one who is signing off on the deal on behalf of the State.  It is only fair and appropriate that we do our job and ask him questions.  I do not believe I have cast any aspersions on St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and it is unfair to state that has been done.  Reasonable questions are being asked on this, either as a visceral response in respect of who or what owns this or because people are unclear as to the structure, format and lease of it.  Those are reasonable and fair questions and it is unfair to cast aspersions on people that it is a reflection on provision or healthcare or anything like that.</p> <p>  May I ask a final question?</p></speech>

I followed the debate from my office and while here in the committee room.  As it was going on, it struck me that Mother Mary Aikenhead passed away 164 years ago or thereabouts.  She was a physician.  All the way along, we have been debating something that needs to happen.  We need advanced modern healthcare for the women of Ireland.  I do not believe that physician who has now found her eternal reward, or other such people, would want to put any barriers in front of modern healthcare.  If she could somehow communicate to the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, I do not believe she would say that it is truly representing her beliefs.  Quality of healthcare is what her life was all about.</p> <p>  Like the previous speaker, I will get to asking my set of questions.  Our time is limited.  I have a political question, a legal question and a health question.  My first question is for the Minister.  I am sure he and his advisers have done a hell of a lot of troubleshooting on this.  They have probably modelled different scenarios.  If the Cabinet, the Government and the body politic reject all of this, what is the drawing board to which we will go back that ensures State land, co-location and delivery of a modern hospital in a quick timeframe?  If we go to that other model, what would be the approximate timeframe?  Surely there would be a significant delay.  Have the Minister and his advisers carried out troubleshooting on that and modelled it?  What delays might we face if we all reject what is on offer and go with a plan B that has yet to be even thought of?</p> <p>  Are there cessation or break-out clauses, as Senator Hoey asked, if the Sisters of Charity cease to exist?  A modern building built in the 21st century is unlikely to be still standing in 300 years.  It will have to be demolished and rebuilt.  There are surely some break-out and cessation clauses.  I would like to hear about them.</p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. O'Donoghue and Ms O'Sullivan.  There is an unfortunate saying that doctors differ and patients die.  I am sure it is the same in their world as well.  What do they make of the legal advice that was circulated overnight from the Uplift movement?  It is from Stephen Dodd, senior counsel, and relates in particular to the whole compulsory purchase order, CPO, argument.</p> <p>  The Minister has repeatedly met politicians and stated there are layers of protection.  A question I have been asked, however, is that if each layer is sufficient, why are there multiple layers of protection, up to and including a golden share?  I ask the Minister to explain to those who are tuned in to these proceedings why there are so many levels of legal protection.</p> <p>  My final question is for Dr. Mahony and Professor Higgins.  It is a medical question.  Are their fellow obstetricians and gynaecologists currently limited by any religious, legal, political or ideological barriers in terms of delivering a full suite of healthcare procedures, up to and including abortion, in the current National Maternity Hospital?  Are they limited in any way?  They have probably answered my next question already but I will ask it nonetheless.  Do they believe that, going forward, if they do move - lock, stock and barrel - to the new national maternity hospital, any of the legal protections or political agreements that have been hammered out will be impediments to them carrying out their work?  What do they make of what Dr. Boylan has been saying in recent days?</p></speech>

I will take his first question, in respect of starting again.  I will pass the question on break clauses and the lease to the lawyers.  Dr. Mahony went through issue of the layers of protection.  We can do so again.  She laid it out very well.  The Deputy also asked another question.  We can come back to it.</p> <p>  As regards how long it would take to start again, there is no way to accurately answer that question but my estimate, based on how long it takes the State to build hospitals, is that it would add ten to 15 years to the project.  Some people may say that sounds like a very long time, and it is, but, unfortunately, the State takes a very long time to build hospitals.  We know that from the hospitals in which we are involved.  Would we get another adult hospital to agree to co-locate?  That may be the case.  It may be just a stand-alone maternity hospital.  That would take a very long time.  One must remember that even if we did that and it was a decade on, let us say, and we were discussing a final Cabinet decision on a new hospital, there is no guarantee that we would not be having some version of this debate.  I will be bringing recommendations to the Cabinet in respect of locations for three elective hospitals.  There is debate in respect of where they should go.  All present know there was a big debate in respect of where the children's hospital should go.  No matter what hospital proposal is brought forward to be considered by a government, there always seems to be good and healthy debate because people have different views and they want the right answer.  It would add a very long period to the project.</p> <p>  On a human level, the idea of walking across Merrion Square and into Holles Street hospital to tell the clinicians who work there that we had the most exciting and important investment in the future of women's healthcare ready to go but failed to deliver it and we will be back to them in a decade with another site is unthinkable.  We, as politicians, must not allow that to happen.</p> <p>  Ms O'Sullivan or Mr. O'Donoghue may wish to respond on the break clauses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.927" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Donoghue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051100002#T00700"><p>I will take that question.  The lease is for 299 years.  The only way it can be terminated is if there is a breach by either party.  Basically, the State has to commence construction of the hospital within five years of the date of the lease.  That can be extended by agreement between the parties.  It sets a deadline for shovels to be in the ground and building to start.  We have seen for how long this has gone on so far.  If the State does not do that, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group can take back the site.  That is not in question.  There would be nothing on it.  To be clear, if the State breaches its obligations during the 299-year term, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group can take back the site and the building on it.  The obligations on the State are to build a hospital and ensure public healthcare is provided from that hospital.  If it does not do so, St. Vincent's is entitled to take back the site and the building on it.  As the Minister mentioned, if the building is no longer fit for purpose 70 years from now and the State decides it wants to convert it to apartments or to build a shopping centre, St. Vincent's can take back the site and whatever building is on it at the time.  The commitments in the document are for 300 years.  If in 70 years the parties agree the building needs to be refurbished or rebuilt, that is an agreement they can make.  At any stage during the 300 years, the parties can make alternative arrangements.</p></speech>

It is because of the history of religion and women's reproductive health in this country.</p><p>We cannot countenance a new maternity hospital that would have any religious interference.  I would never bring it forward.  I do not believe the previous Minister, Deputy Harris, would have ever brought it forward.  None of the clinicians here would ever countenance it.  Therefore, it has been incumbent upon all of us to put layers of protection in place to deliver what people are rightly demanding.  Dr. Mahony might speak to some of those.</p></speech>

We have to come back a little bit to the history of the Mulvey agreement because the nuns have gone now, they are out of the picture, but in 2016 they were not.  We knew they might be leaving, but we had to create an entity where it did not matter whether the nuns left or not.  We had to create an entity where we had absolute independence in our company.  That is why we have all the layers.  In the initial mediations we were going to be a branch and being a branch does not give you the same protections as being your own separate legal entity, your own separate company.  We had seen from our colleagues in HSE hospitals where maternity services are departments in large acute adult hospitals that there is almost competition for the funding within the hospital and there are different interests in the hospital such as cancer, anaesthetics and all the different specialties.  Very often, it seemed that maternity services were right at the end of the list.  We wanted our own separate funding as well because when you run a hospital, you need to have control of the building, staff and clinical operations, but you also need to have your own separate funding.  In order for us to achieve that, we had to have a separate legal entity.  We went on a bit of a journey during the Mulvey negotiation.  Two mediations had fallen apart because we were in a branch situation.  We could not accept that because we felt it would not give the right governance structure to provide a dedicated healthcare facility for women.  During the Mulvey talks, both St. Vincent's and Holles Street went on a journey, and we had to understand that it is all about patients.  What we are trying to do here is to create an amazing campus that provides care for women, but also care for adults, one that will elevate Irish healthcare and provide care from birth - from a tiny baby born at 23 weeks weighing 500 g - right up to the end of life.  All the research facilities and collaboration between the two hospitals and the doctors is what is at stake here.  When we look at all the successful academic health centres in the world such as Imperial Hospital and John Radcliffe Hospital, there is a list of the top 10, and we want to be one of them.  That is what this is about.  We are ambitious for women's healthcare.  We want this hospital to be listed in the top 10.</p></speech>

That would not be good healthcare.  The whole purpose of this is elevating healthcare.  Rather than restricting services that are available to women, we are opening up an entire adult campus and adding to the services available to women in the areas of medical, surgical and diagnostic.  It is important to remember the number of women who get transferred over to St. Vincent's.  We have 122 critical care cases in Holles Street every year, and 73 of those women will need to transfer to St. Vincent's.  We have approximately six patients every year who require ICU facilities, but in addition, we have a maternal medicine clinic that sees 500 patients every year that deals with a whole range of issues.  I will ask Ms Brosnan to add to what I have said.</p></speech>

I apologise for the bells in the background.  I am substituting for Senator Black, who would like to be here herself if she could.</p> <p>  We have heard from the Minister that the legal advice is that the expected life of a hospital is 50 years to 60 years.  There is an embodied emissions concern about such a short lifecycle for a building, but we also heard that the requirement is that maternity health services would be continued on this site for 299 years.  This is something important which has not got the necessary focus and it would merit elaboration.  While the rent is currently set at &euro;850,000 per year, which is close to &euro;1 million per year, it is waived to be &euro;10 per year, so long as the permitted use, which is subject to the double constraints of being clinically appropriate and legally permissible, continues.  The Minister tells us the hospital is only to last for 60 years, so what happens after that?  Are we effectively committing to building four or five new maternity hospitals in a row on this site and, if we do not do so, will we become liable for &euro;850,000 or &euro;1 million per year in rent for the site?  It is one or the other.  Either way, both raise significant financial concerns.</p> <p>  There has been talk about the many grounds pertaining to the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, as the landlord, such that it may be able to seek a forfeiture in relation to the lease, but if the State decides 100 years in that we do want to build a new national maternity hospital that is an actual public hospital - publicly owned on public land - where is our exit and what are the liabilities that would come with such an exit from the lease?  I would like the Minister to comment on those legal issues, and he might also come back on the question of permitted use and the terms "clinically appropriate" and "legally permissible".  I will get the answer to the leasehold and rent question first and then I will come back on the question of permitted use.</p></speech>

I will ask Mr. O'Donoghue or Ms O'Sullivan to come in on the clauses and what an exit strategy might look like in 100 or 200 years.  To be clear, the covenants around the &euro;10 a year lease, are not linked to the terms "clinically appropriate" or "legally permissible", they are just linked to the HSE being the tenant, running a hospital on the site and not seeking freehold of the site.  It is not linked to the NMH's constitution.  It is linked to the HSE and the State essentially running public healthcare services on that site.</p></speech>

If the State does not do that, it is at risk of paying market rent and it is at risk of forfeiting the lease in the future.  If, for example, as I mentioned, the State in 70, 80 or 100 years' time decides it no longer wishes to use this site for public healthcare services, it risks losing the site with the building on it, but there is an important protection in the forfeiture obligation Senator Higgins mentioned, which is very unusual in that if St. Vincent's did take back the site there is a covenant that it would continue to provide public healthcare services from that building.</p><p>The Senator asked about the potential liability of the State in the future.  This began as a 99-year lease on the basis that was a sufficient length of term for the building that was to be constructed.  Because of commentary, that has been extended to 299 years, which puts an onus on the State to provide healthcare from that facility for that period or to have that conversation in the future with whoever owns the land or the freehold interest at that time.</p></speech>

I certainly do think that conversation envisaged a market rent of up to &euro;1 million a year to which the State might be liable.  In that context, is the plan to build five or six hospitals in succession?  Are we saying that for the next 300 years, this will be how maternity care operates in Ireland?  Our guests talked about St. Vincent's Healthcare Group's holding if it chooses to terminate the agreement.  If it emerges this is a bad agreement that is not working successfully and we wish to exit it, what will be the mechanisms available to the State?  Will we face liability for the remaining years?</p></speech>

In any event, as an example, if there were no longer a requirement for a public health facility on the site in 70 years, and if St. Vincent's Healthcare Group did not wish to take it back and wanted to charge a rent of &euro;850,000 per annum, the State could decide to use it for something else, such as a shopping centre or an apartment block, because that would force St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group either to terminate the lease or allow the State to do what it wanted for the remainder of the 299 years.  That is a decision St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group would have to take at that time.</p></speech>

Is it to be interpreted case by case by individual doctors?  Is "clinically appropriate" subject to clinical direction, and if so, what are the links between the clinical direction at the hospital and clinical direction from St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group?  These are concerns because, as we have heard, it is not simply about what services might be available but also under which circumstances they will be available.  Ireland has a very complicated history, at times determining, for example, that symphysiotomy was clinically advisable or, in other cases, allowing people to receive tubal ligation but only in certain circumstances.</p> <p>  The phrase "clinically necessary" was used earlier in regard to terminations that have taken place, but that is different from "clinically appropriate".  Where will the latter phrase be determined and will it be done on a case-by-case basis by individual doctors or according to clinical direction?  How will that be reviewed if concerning trends emerge?  As I said, it is not simply about what is available but also when it is available.  Abortion was available in Ireland prior to the repeal of the eighth amendment, but there had to be a determination as to the risk of death.  These were the kinds of decisions that had to be made.  People are rightly concerned, therefore, as to how "clinically appropriate" will be interpreted and that needs clarification.  What is the link with St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group in this regard?</p></speech>

The term "clinically appropriate" refers to services that are clinically appropriate for a maternity, gynaecology, neonatal and obstetric hospital.  It does not include procedures relating to, for example, cardiology or neurology.  The term has caused understandable concern and it is something we have been debating at length during this meeting, but that is what it means under the constitution.  Professor Higgins might give a clinical perspective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.963" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Mary Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051100002#V01000"><p>There are two issues here, relating to ring-fencing and future-proofing.  I will give a very practical example of what Dr. Mahony was talking about in the context of having beds and spaces dedicated to women.  I recall working in a general hospital, having just come from working at a maternity hospital where there was a dedicated operating theatre.  One night, a lady presented with ovarian torsion, which is where the ovary cuts off its blood supply, resulting in a major gynaecological emergency.  I was used to working at a hospital where I could bring such a woman straight to theatre after, obviously, asking for her consent because she has autonomy.  I could advise her about the clinical necessity and bring her to theatre.  At the general hospital, I had to go to an operating theatre and advocate for this woman against orthopaedic, general and vascular surgery all looking for the same space.  Ring-fencing, therefore, is incredibly important for women&rsquo;s healthcare which, as the Senator pointed out, was not suitably looked after for many years.</p> <p>  The second issue relates to future-proofing.  We earlier gave the example of the Billings method, which is no longer used.  Symphysiotomy was absolutely unacceptable in light of everything we have learned from the women who advocated against it.  The Senator is correct that we have clear legal guidelines and frameworks we can work with now.  They are not perfect and I will, I hope, return to talk to the committee about the issues we have with them, but we can work within them.  It is much easier than it was under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and even than before that was law.  We are constantly evolving, and I do not know what procedures we currently carry out that will not be acceptable in 20 years.  That is what the phrase means to me.</p></speech>

As Professor Higgins said, very unacceptable practices have happened in the past and many of them did so on a clinical interpretation, because there is a balancing of what might be most important.  The question of elective procedures, for example, which may not be clinically necessary but which people may wish to have and may be entitled to have, has not been addressed.  Will clinical direction be entirely contained within the new body?  What will be the link between clinical direction from that body and the clinical direction at St. Vincent's Healthcare Group?</p></speech>

Everything we do is evidence-based care.  We can then provide individualised assessment to patients based on their circumstances and on the guidelines for best practice at a given time.  That, to me, is what "clinically appropriate" means.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct about elective care.  We provide that and we are one of the first hospitals to do so, and I am very proud we provide it-----</p></speech>

What we need from the St. Vincent's site at the moment to provide clinically appropriate care is the additional resources it has.  When we move to the St. Vincent's site, and I very much hope we will, we will continue to provide that service because Holles Street will move all the physicians and ancillary staff and everything we provide on Merrion Square will, I hope, be provided on the new site.

It is not a reference to human rights but a reference to dignity.  There is an encyclical from 1965 on human dignity.  We know the Human Dignity Alliance party was founded in Ireland after 2018 specifically with the goal of opposing the outcome of the referendum on the repeal of the eighth amendment.  Human dignity is a term that has been interpreted through Catholic social teaching, whereas human rights are a little clearer in that we all know the associated documents.  With regard to the phrasing in question in the new constitution of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, the question of where clinical direction comes from is extremely relevant.</p><p> The St. Mary's site has not been discussed.  Could we purchase it?  In that context, is it the case that St. Vincent's Healthcare Group would not support or work with us if we purchased the St. Mary's site, which is adjacent?  I have been very concerned by the idea that somehow it is acceptable for the group to say it will not work with the public hospital but only with a charitable hospital.  Could a hospital on the adjacent St. Mary's site access St. Vincent's hospital very quickly in an emergency?  Would that not be a possible solution?</p></speech>

On the question on dignity, I would not cede the word and concept of "dignity" to any individual, religion or philosophy.  I would never accept that just because some group sets itself up and uses the word dignity, its definition of it is the one we should use.  I have a very clear idea of what dignity means.  The clinicians have a very clear idea of what dignity means for patients and, indeed, our workers.  I understand the Senator's question but I would never cede the concepts of dignity and compassion or any such concept to any group set up with a particular agenda.</p></speech>

I, of course, believe in dignity very passionately but I note that the people for whom the interpretation is relevant are those in the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  We have not really got clarity on its interpretation.  Dignity means different important things to different people.  This is not the case with human rights, in respect of which we can refer to relevant, agreed texts.  There are many interpretations, of course, but the relevant question concerns the interpretation that is applied.</p></speech>

It is not directed at the Chairman.  It was agreed that we would have four hours and two rounds of questions.  These are very difficult and complex issues.  We had ten minutes each, which had to include the responses of the Minister and others.  For members of the committee, this does not do justice to the matter.  I am not blaming the Chairman but just stating a matter of fact.  We obviously have to have a discussion ourselves afterwards on what we do next.  All of that is bound up with whether the Cabinet will sign off on this next week.  That is the source of our frustration.  That has to be at least accepted by the Minister.

In any layperson's language, that is considered ownership.  You can make many arguments about buildings being fixed to the land &ndash; Deputy Shortall made the point about the first schedule &ndash; but the site being leased includes the buildings on it.  The reason is that if there is a breach by the State and the lease is terminated, one cannot just take back the underlying land without taking back the buildings on it.

However, because this building could be there for a long time, we do not want to create obligations on the HSE in relation to internal repairs, etc.  Any repair obligations will be passed on to the NMH DAC through the operating licence, which is effectively a 299-year obligation, as long as NMH DAC complies with its obligations to provide all the services it is required to provide from the land.<br/><br/>There is a further provision in that lease, at clause 6.1, quiet enjoyment, which again is a fairly standard provision.  It provides:</p> <blockquote> 	... so long as the Tenant pays the rents [again that is a nominal rent for as long as it complies with certain obligations] ... and performs the covenants ... the Tenant may hold and enjoy the Premises [which includes the land and the buildings on it] and the rights hereby granted peaceably during the Term [which is 299 years] without any unlawful interruption by the Landlord or any person lawfully claiming under or in trust for the Landlord. </blockquote></speech>

That lease contains a right for the State to build a hospital on those lands, maintain that hospital, and grant an operating licence to an operator of that hospital.  There are certain obligations that it continues to maintain it for public healthcare.  That is in the interests of the State and of St. Vincent's.  They want public healthcare.  Again, if this lease is terminated or was terminated or in the unlikely event that the State - we are talking about the State here - does not comply with its obligations, St. Vincent's has to continue to use the building on that land for public healthcare services.</p></speech>

If you told those people they did not own their buildings, they would not accept that.  Likewise, many buildings across this city and country are held under leaseholds and it would not be unusual in this type of structure.  As Dr. Mahony explained, the building being built on this campus is a maternity hospital but it will also have shared facilities for the remainder of the campus and it will have some St. Vincent's hospital areas.  I think it is replacing dermatology facilities in the main.</p> <p>  Deputy Shortall may have made a point earlier about this "clinically appropriate" language.  That language relates specifically to the maternity areas to make sure that is captured.  That is the language used in the lease, the operating licence and any of the documents relating to the maternity hospital.  When we refer to the maternity hospital it is probably the majority of the building but it is not all of the building.</p></speech>

I refer again to the senior counsel's opinion, in which he states on page 62:</p> <blockquote> 	Insofar as the State proposes to compulsory acquire the lands, the appropriate legislation is under the Health Act 1947 which confers on the HSE the power to compulsorily acquire lands.  However, significant issues relate to whether the procedure under Health Act 1947 is constitutional in affording sufficient independence in the process for confirming a CPO. </blockquote> <p>Thus, even the senior counsel's opinion that is circulating is, on the one hand, saying the State should go and compulsorily acquire, yet the paragraph I have just cited sets out that there may be constitutional issues.

I have a few questions and will try to get through them as quickly as possible.  I will ask Professor Higgins about terminations in St. Vincent's currently.  I am aware that terminations are usually carried out in maternity units but are sometimes carried out in non-maternity units.  Have terminations been carried out in St. Vincent's in circumstances where a woman's life was not at risk?</p></speech>

That is a service we provide at the moment under the current legislation.  The vast majority of terminations in those cases are provided in the community.  That is where the majority of terminations take place at less than nine weeks.  After nine weeks, we perform these terminations in Holles Street either using medication or using a surgical technique, just because the pregnancy has advanced a bit more and there are more risks of bleeding.  We feel, therefore, that it is safer to perform those procedures in the hospital.  We do not do that many, actually, because the majority of the cases happen in the community, which is totally appropriate.  It is where women can be at home instead of having to come into a hospital.</p> <p>  If we look at the experience in Scotland, what we found there was as that service developed and improved, far fewer cases came to hospital because those terminations were being given earlier in the pregnancy when it is safer.  That has been the experience in Scotland and we certainly hope we will follow that.  Even in Holles Street today, we do not perform many procedures under 12 weeks because most are done in the community.  The point about this is that under the legislation, terminations under 12 weeks could be performed in St. Vincent's hospital.  There is no barrier in St Vincent's to performing everything but we have to rationalise services.  At the moment, as regards the kinds of services provided in St. Vincent's hospital, it should be remembered that the hospital has not moved yet so we do all of the routine and normal work, including all of the caesarean sections.</p><p>We do approximately two caesarean sections at St. Vincent's per year because we need additional medical backup.  We must remember the hospital has not moved yet.  There is no barrier at St. Vincent's to doing that.  It is just that with the cases at St. Vincent's now, there is a limited gynaecological service and it is generally devoted to cancer.  We are not going to cancel a cancer patient just to make a political point that we can do a termination at less than 12 weeks gestation.  It would be totally inappropriate.</p></speech>

My next question is for Mr. John O'Donoghue because it is a legal question.  There has been much talk about the option of a compulsory purchase order, CPO, of the land.  Will Mr. O'Donoghue bring us through the legal process and tests used by the court when deciding a CPO application?</p></speech>

I do not know when a CPO was completed under the Health Acts or if a CPO was ever completed under the Health Acts.  I work in different areas of law and in the housing sector I am working with local authorities dealing with potential CPOs of vacant properties for use as social housing.  I know the process that can be undertaken and it is an application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to which third parties may object.  If there is an objection, it can go to court and the High Court may make a determination.  It can go on and on up to the Supreme Court.  If the process of a CPO is undertaken, the party involved is not likely to consent, and it could take a long number of years and many challenges to get that CPO.</p> <p>  My understanding is that under the Planning and Development Act 2000, the provision to substitute the Minister for An Bord Plean&aacute;la was not included for the Health Acts, and that is where the unconstitutionality may arise.  The Minister may potentially decide on whether the CPO is right or not rather than a third-party body such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p></speech>

My view is there is every likelihood that if we initiated a CPO, never mind what happens in court, at least one of the parties involved would say "We are no longer interested in this, this is clearly no longer a partnership".  In my non-legal world, I can imagine two people living relatively close together where one has a big old garden.  The other person might suggest selling his or her house if the person gives him or her a quarter of the big garden.  They would be close neighbours and get on very well so would it not work?  The other neighbour might agree and find it interesting but suggest giving a quarter of the garden for the next 300 years for free.  He or she might say, "Let's do this, it is exciting".  The other party may disagree and look to bring the person to the courts, trying to get the garden from him or her, and then believe they will live together in harmony in the two buildings and remain great friends.  The other party would clearly say "Thanks very much but no" to the offer.  It would not sound very much like a partnership but a very difficult way for them to be great friends.</p> <p>  The CPO approach is fraught with risk and, critically, the specific risk of years of extension.  It is also entirely likely it would simply be never put to the test because the concept of the partnership could dissolve.</p></speech>

There is a very high test for parties to reach in circumstances where a very long lease has been offered at nominal rent.  I will touch on the St. Mary's site and building a hospital on the adjacent site.  What would the clinicians' opinion be of that?</p></speech>

The point is it does not achieve the physical integration that this co-location would achieve.  One of the points of the co-location is that in an emergency, where someone is haemorrhaging, with 4 litres of blood loss, for example, we must try to manage such cases in a stand-alone facility.  Sometimes we must transfer a patient when we cannot stop the bleeding.  We might need intervention radiology, for example, where we can put little plugs in blood vessels to stop the bleeding using an imaging technique.  We may need vascular or haematology backup.  We feel very lonely at 4 a.m. when we have a major haemorrhage.</p> <p>  In the new hospital we would be physically linked with the St. Vincent's hospital at theatre and intensive care unit level.  We would not be going outside from one building to another.  We would be wheeling a patient down the corridor to the interventional radiology, the intensive care unit or the theatre.  It is the really critical and brilliant element of the co-location that we will not find on another site.  That is as well as all the other services.  It is one of the really important elements.</p> <p>  We could build a hospital on the St. Mary's site or wherever else.  If it does not have the physical co-location, we would be missing a really important part of what this would achieve.  We want to be in a big hospital setting where we would not have to make transfers down any road because we would be right there and integrated where we need to be, particularly in emergencies.</p></speech>

There are hundreds of women on various waiting lists around the Ireland east area - not just in the Dublin south area - that are awaiting procedures.  We have had big investment in women's health this year and we will have big investment next year.  The Minister keeps mentioning the &euro;9 million programme and it is very helpful for women's health.  It will take more than a few years to get into this hospital but when we do we will have the extra operating facilities to meet that unmet need.  Gynaecology is still secondary to all the other sub-specialties in surgery that are required.  In the St. Vincent's hospital, for example, it is really hard to get theatre time.</p> <p>  We must keep site of what we are trying to deal with just to meet women's health.  It is not just maternity but women's health across a region.  This will be an Ireland east hospital and it will provide an enormous resource for all the women across Ireland and equally in the region of Ireland east, which is all of Leinster.</p></speech>

I am very comfortable that we had a robust debate and that some of the real issues, which are understandable issues, were discussed around making sure that we put in sufficient protections to address this issue of trust, which we have been talking about this morning.  I think that is okay.  It is good now.  The board, collectively, did not share that view with those two colleagues.  Equally, we respect their right to have those opinions.  As a board we were saying that we have sufficient protections, that things have moved on hugely over the last 12 months, that the excitement of having these extra services and greater capacity for reducing the risk, for example at 4 a.m. if something is going wrong, that all of those things remain true, and that we have a much quicker, stronger and coherent set of legal principles now then we even did 12 months ago.

My next question is for Mr. O'Donoghue.  If I was in a position to buy a home out in the country, and if I wished to see that passed on to future generations, or loved ones or relations, I would prefer a freehold title to a leasehold title.  That is just a layperson's view.  What rights does the State have after 200 years or 250 years in extending the leasehold on the new national maternity hospital?  Would that happen automatically or would it be negotiated?  What rights do we have as a State after that period?  I appreciate that it is a long time away and I appreciate that there has been an extension from the original plans with regard to the lease, but I believe that the ownership issue is one of the fundamental concerns that people have.  If the State wishes to renew or extend the lease after 250 years what rights does the State have?</p></speech>

As I said previously, many people may not know that they own a leasehold interest because there is nothing wrong with a leasehold interest and there is certainly nothing wrong with a long leasehold title.  It is seen as a good and marketable interest in property.  Anyone on the market today who is buying an apartment will buy a leasehold.  If they are selling on their apartment it is selling a leasehold.  Banks take a charge over leaseholds.  There is no problem whatsoever in that regard.</p> <p>  With the 299 year lease between St. Vincent's Holdings and the HSE there is a specific agreement within this document that provides that the HSE will not seek to extend the term of the lease or acquire the underlying freehold.  In certain circumstances where money is spent on land or buildings are built, the leasehold owner would have, under the landlord and tenant Acts, a right to acquire the freehold.  It goes back to the fact that this site is specifically being used by the State for the purpose of building a state-of-the-art maternity facility, on foot of a planning permission that was granted in 2017, and not for any other purpose.  There are some restrictions, including that the State will not sell on its interest to a third party.  That is agreed with St. Vincent's.  It wants to operate a public healthcare campus.  In 250 years' time, if the State decided that it no longer wished to carry out public healthcare, it would need to speak to St. Vincent's and hand it back the site.  It is agreed that it will not be seeking to extend the lease, other than by agreement between the parties.  The parties can agree to whatever they want but there is a minimum 299 year period.  The State will not try to use legislative provisions, under the landlord and tenant Acts, to acquire the underlying freehold.</p> <p>  I am very satisfied that the interest the State will acquire by way of a 299 year lease is absolutely protecting the State's interest in that building in order to deliver public healthcare facilities in the future.  If it is decided that a maternity facility is no longer required, in 50, 70, 90 or 100 years' time, and if the parties are happy with that, including the new designated activity company, DAC, that is set up, the State can use this site for other public healthcare facilities.  It does not necessarily have to be used as a maternity facility for 299 years.  That does not breach the terms of the lease.</p> <p>  I wish to correct a point that was made earlier.  The permitted use in the lease is to provide clinically appropriate and legally permissible services for maternity, but also any other public health care services.  It has been argued that this wording could provide a third party with a way of preventing certain services being provided.  It does not allow St. Vincent's to terminate any property rights or prevent the hospital being used by the State.</p></speech>

With regard to the transfer of shares that has taken place since the original board decision on 4 March, was this part agreed to in the Mulvey process?  Was there push back on this or were there protracted negotiations on this transfer?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.1072" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051100002#Z00500"><p>Perhaps Mr. Devane or Dr. Mahony could come in on the Mulvey agreement, but I will make one point.  The idea that the ownership of the land has anything to do with church influence at this point is simply not true.  The church, the nuns, the priests, the rabbis, the imams: none of them are involved.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group is a secular and voluntary healthcare group that we are partnering with.  Whether the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has the freehold, whether the national maternity hospital has the freehold, or whether the HSE has the freehold, has nothing to do with the church.  The church is off the pitch completely.  We really owe it to people to keep repeating that and reminding people that the church is gone.  The order is gone and the nuns are gone.  This is a secular healthcare organisation, with both of the groups involved.</p> <p>  The Senator made a point about where the governance structure came from.  It is my understanding that it came from the Mulvey agreement in 2016.  Dr. Mahony was involved in that and perhaps she will speak to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.1073" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Rhona Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051100002#Z00600"><p>Absolutely.  The legal framework that we are seeing now arises from the heads of agreement that were in the Mulvey agreement.  The Mulvey agreement was a partnership, which was an agreement between three parties: the State, St. Vincent's Hospital, and the national maternity hospital.  We sat down at the beginning of that to see how we were going to deliver this hospital, and how were we going to make sure that we would have a dedicated maternity facility that is totally protected to do all of its services and also protected in relation to budget and operations.  It is not just about termination of pregnancy.  It is about the whole service and having our own funding.  We did not want to be at the end of the line when we were looking for funding in a general hospital setting.  As I said, we had two mediations falling apart because we were going to be a branch.  That really was why we had the Mulvey mediation.  Very early on in that mediation we realised that ethos was not an issue at all and that religion was not a problem.  Actually, as always, the problem was making sure we were not a branch that would be promised ring-fenced funding.  Our colleagues in Cork had had a similar experience when joining a big general hospital and they were told funding would be ring-fenced for them.  It was not so easy for them.  We did not want any ring-fenced funding.  We wanted a proper company structure where we had our own service arrangement and where we had control of our building and control of our staff so we could run our hospital and every aspect of it.  That really was the key of the Mulvey mediation.  As I said, ethos actually was not an issue.</p> <p>  On the share transfer, it is important to make the point that when we were negotiating Mulvey, we knew that the nuns were leaving but we also knew that would be a process.  This is also why we made sure that the board of St. Vincent's could have no impact on the operation of the new national maternity Hospital DAC.</p><p>To make the point again, St. Vincent's is a totally secular organisation.  The current board has achieved that and it is something of which it is very proud.  It is proud to leave the church behind and to move forward into its future strategically as a hospital that provides great healthcare to its patients.</p></speech>

It has been a gruelling session, so I will keep my questions as concise as possible and remove any commentary.</p> <p>  The first is a legal question regarding the proposed 299-year lease.  Under clause 6.5 of the lease, the HSE loses its right of first refusal to acquire the premises on the later of 20 years after the HSE, as tenant, complies with its obligations under the sixth schedule, which refers to the building covenant, or 30 years from the date of the lease.  Why would the HSE forgo this right so soon into a 299-year lease under this clause?  Should the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group decide to sell the premises, will that open the HSE and this model to an unseen vulnerability?  There may be a simple legal response to that, but it is one of those matters that leaps out to the layperson when trying to digest all these complex documents.</p> <p>  My second question is for the Minister.  There is no doubt that this model is bespoke.  Whether one is in favour of it or against it, it is a bespoke model with the golden share element.  If a hypothetical similar arrangement were to come down the line somewhere else and if a future Minister for Health were to ask the current Minister if he would recommend this model to be used again, given his experience, would he recommend it?  I know he has confidence in this particular one but, as a model in the future, would he tell the future Minister to run a mile away from it and to go about it a different way as this was too much trouble legally and politically and that there will always be some concerns and risks inherent in it?  I would appreciate an answer to that.</p></speech>

The golden share in this case is a name but what is important is the legal powers that are attached to it.  There are other golden shares in other situations that may have different legal powers.  Essentially, it means that if for some reason the directors of the NMH fail in their obligations and their duty to ensure all services are provided and are provided without any religious influence, the Minister for Health can direct the board at his or her sole discretion.  It says at the end, for the avoidance of doubt, that the directors must comply with this.  That is very sensible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.1081" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051100002#AA00800"><p>One would have to look at it case by case.  Certainly, I am comforted, as the current Minister, that it is a power that I am not sure will ever need to be exercised because the hospital is going to do exactly what it is being set up to do, but it is useful because ultimately there is a mechanism for the State and for the Oireachtas via the Minister to intervene directly if needed.</p></speech>

The HSE loses its right of first refusal to acquire the premises on the later of 20 years after the HSE, as tenant, complies with its obligations under the sixth schedule or 30 years from the date of the lease.  Should SVHG decide for whatever reason to sell the site, which it is entitled to do, the HSE would lose the right of first refusal in what would be very early into a 299-year lease.</p></speech>

We felt a 30-year period or 20 years from when the hospital would be built would be sufficient.  Second, there are option agreements there.  There is an option agreement for the HSE to acquire the freehold interest where there is a default by St. Vincent's or where St. Vincent's becomes insolvent.  That is still there.  Giving somebody a right of first refusal for 299 years is tying, and we are not seeking to tie the hands of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  That was never part of this and it is the reason it is specific for a certain period of time.</p></speech>

The bottom line is to explain what the facts are.  The public - and I am one of them - want to see the hospital built but they need to understand in their own heads how it is getting to that point.

We need the hospital.</p> <p>  Finally, if this goes ahead now, when will the hospital be built and when will it be in operation for the women of Ireland?

That needs to be made very clear.  I ask the people putting out information about title to tell us why the State needs a freehold, what is wrong with the lease arrangement and, in particular, how a freehold would work without all the rights we have built into this document.  As has been pointed out before, the hospital will be on a shared campus.  There will be shared access routes and shared facilities.  That cannot be done with a freehold agreement, with a two-page transfer of land, with a "there you go".  There will still need to be an agreement between the State and St. Vincent's as to how they operate both those buildings.  That is all dealt with.  I ask anyone, including Deputy Shortall, to go through the document and tell me what is wrong with the State's interest for the next 299 years.</p></speech>

People are talking about a few different constitutions flying around and so on.  What it says in the constitutions of the companies further up the line is irrelevant to the operation of the national maternity hospital DAC.  We are all delighted now, for all the historical and emotional reasons, particularly for people of my generation, that any reference to the nuns or the sisters has been taken out.  Fundamentally, however, whatever is in those constitutions, whether as they are now or as amended in the future, has no bearing on how the national maternity hospital DAC operates.</p></speech>

There were legitimate questions and genuine concerns raised here today.  If we had another four hours, we probably would have brought up a lot more questions as well.  The timing is appalling in this regard.  We are against the clock on this issue.  As a committee, it has been impossible to try to organise witnesses to come in at the last minute.  People are very busy and they are coming from different backgrounds, so it has been very difficult.  We have not put ourselves in that position.  It is a result of whatever schedule the Minister and the Government are working to.  I think it has been very unfair on the committee the way we have been dealt with.  We are meeting now to try to arrange a meeting tomorrow and possibly the next day.  It is literally like that and we are going from A to B.</p> <p>  I have to close the meeting.

I ask witnesses and members to please turn off their mobile phones.  Before we commence, I remind members participating remotely that they must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This meeting has been convened to discuss the State-funded programmes T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme, RSS, which are both administered by the Department of Social Protection in conjunction with the Department of Rural and Community Development, under the leadership of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  I thank members of the joint committee for raising these important State schemes as a priority in our work programme, particularly Deputy Kerrane.  I thank her for assisting the committee secretariat in organising today's meeting.</p> <p>  T&uacute;s is a community work placement programme providing short-term working opportunities for unemployed people.  The rural social scheme is aimed at low-income farmers and fishermen and fisherwomen, especially in rural Ireland.  The benefits of both schemes for participants include stable income, better mental health and well-being, and the promotion of safer working practices, while also providing multiple benefits in their local communities by supporting voluntary, sporting and community organisations to improve amenities and deliver vital local services.  It should be noted that approximately 30% of T&uacute;s participants go on to full-time employment, with a further 30% progressing to further training or education schemes.  The remaining 40% would benefit from the opportunity of an additional year on the T&uacute;s scheme to become job ready.</p> <p>  The rural social scheme, as I said, is aimed at low-income farmers and fishermen and fisherwomen.  The scheme was launched by our colleague, member of this committee and then Minister, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, in May 2004.  The objective of the scheme is to provide supplementary income to low-income farmers and fishermen who would be unable to make an adequate living otherwise.  Not only does it provide a stable income, but, as I said, it has a big impact in terms of promoting better mental health and well-being.  A key element of this particular scheme is that it is self referring.  Thereby participants can have an active interest in developing and improving their local community.  </p> <p>  The secretariat requested a detailed briefing note on both schemes from the Department for members, which has not been received.  I have asked the clerk to write to the Department to express our disappointment, because this is unsatisfactory.  The joint committee&rsquo;s policy adviser has prepared an alternative and useful briefing document, which has been circulated.  I thank Ms Haley O'Shea for her work.</p> <p>  As we continue in this regard, I very much welcome to our meeting from T&uacute;s, Ms Ellen Brennan and Mr. Martin Corcoran, co-ordinator and supervisor, respectively, of the Mayo north east LEADER programme.  From SIPTU, I welcome Mr. Adrian Kane, division organiser of the public administration and community division; Mr. Clem Shevlin, industrial organiser; and Mr. Peter Glynn, sector organiser.  From Galway Rural Development, I welcome Ms Liz Macdonald, joint chair of the RSS national committee and RSS supervisor; Mr. Sean Larkin, joint chair of the RSS national committee and RSS supervisor; and Mr. Sean Broderick, RSS and T&uacute;s co-ordinator.  I welcome all of our witnesses.</p> <p>  In terms of privilege, witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or any other way to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses&rsquo; statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.

I wish to outline the rural social scheme and why it is so important to rural Ireland and draw members' attention to the challenges it faces.</p> <p>  The RSS is a unique programme that provides financial support to low-income farmers and fishermen to sustain a reasonable livelihood and in return, participants are engaged for 19.5 hours per week supporting a broad range of services to our rural communities.  One of the benefits for participants is that it provides a stable income.  With farming being a precarious business, a consistent weekly wage is invaluable to the small farmer.  It also promotes better mental health and well-being.  The increased social contact promotes a feeling of belonging and of making a difference.  Participants share skills and resources.  They forge deep friendships and knowledge of their communities.  Indeed, this element was key to the RSS&rsquo;s ability to provide a first responders approach to the problems presented by the Covid-19 crisis.  It promotes safer working practices, making farms a safer place to live and work.  Participants gain comprehensive health and safety training through programmes such as Safe Pass, manual handling and develop safe practices through ongoing risk assessments and toolbox talks.</p> <p>  There are also benefits to the local communities as the scheme provides a local workforce with a strong working ethos and extensive skill set.  Farmers tend to be jacks of all trades and in many cases are masters of many.  They possess a unique and integral knowledge of their built, natural and social environments, helping to provide solutions to local challenges.</p> <p>  The work carried out by the RSS is far reaching.  It includes Tidy Towns projects, maintenance of community centres, sporting facilities, churches, cemeteries and meals on wheels.  The range of projects supported also extends from research, cultural and heritage projects, such as graveyard mapping and historical book writing, to retail support and charity shops.  Furthermore, the RSS plays a key role in promoting and preserving biodiversity through cultivating and maintaining parks, walkways and woodlands.</p> <p>  The scheme provides supports to the elderly and vulnerable.  Extensive assistance is provided to social service centres and mental and physical health facilities, such as Ability West, the Brothers of Charity and Care and Repair, to name but a few.  The RSS facilitates participants to build long-term relationships and trust with these vulnerable people.  Supervisors also liaise extensively with district nurses and advanced nurse practitioners to establish the service that best fits.  The RSS supports many other rural development programmes and projects.  It would be difficult to find a project that has received funding from Government initiatives that has not relied on the RSS to maintain, sustain and thrive long after the initial investment.</p> <p>  I draw the committee's attention to the challenges faced by the RSS now and into the future.  For many years, the RSS quota was not sufficient to meet the demand for places.  However, due to the age profile of participants and the current policies governing the RSS, for the first time in 18 years we are struggling to fill quotas.  Supervisors are already fielding complaints and feeling the strains and stresses of not being able to supply the services on which our communities depend.</p> <p>  The six-year rule was introduced in 2017, when the demand for places was greater than the number of places available.  This rule means participants must leave after six years.  Therefore, in 2023, many participants will be forced to leave the scheme.  This rule fundamentally opposes the very purpose of the RSS and is nonsensical in the current environment, having negative effects on our communities.  While rumour has it that the six-year rule is under review, it is causing enormous stress to participants who are effectively on notice that they will lose their jobs next year.  We feel strongly this restriction should be abolished immediately.</p> <p>  Means testing is another barrier.  Initially, when the RSS was set up, participants' spouses could have an off-farm income of &euro;300 per week without affecting their payment.  This has significantly changed, having adverse effects on the uptake of RSS positions.  Many participants find, as their families grow, they have reduced means disregards and find themselves no longer eligible to participate.  The onerous stringent means test levels need to be reviewed and recalibrated, particularly for long serving participants.  Means testing should be carried out, on average, over a five-year period.</p> <p>  Consideration should be given to the precarious nature of farming, which has peaks and troughs whereby a good year can be negated by a bad year.  The scheme is also not financially attractive to the 6,000 farmers in receipt of farm assist.  We recommend an increase to the top-up payment from &euro;22.50 to &euro;50 per week, remembering that our participants are not receiving benefits but are working for these payments and offer a huge service to the local communities.  Consideration could also be given to measures to widen the eligibility criteria, such as allowing the following to participate: farming nieces and nephews; carers under reduced working hours; isolated people with underlying health issues; rural dwellers with transport issues; and rurally isolated single parents.</p> <p>  We know there will be an imminent review of the RSS and we emphasise that RSS supervisors are key stakeholders in the RSS.  They possess an in-depth knowledge of the operational and strategic potential of the scheme and are the glue that holds the scheme together.  However, currently the supervisors are not included in any of these forums or the forthcoming review to discuss and seek solutions and improvements to the scheme.  A representative of the RSS national committee should be included in any proposed reviews.  There is also a need for an RSS representative on the Irish Local Development Network RSS-T&uacute;s committee.</p> <p>  I draw attention to the long-standing issue of RSS supervisors' employment terms.  Mr. Adrian Kane of SIPTU will address the committee further on this matter.  However, I would like to highlight that the success of the RSS and the reason it is held in such high regard is largely due to the input and nurturing of the RSS supervisors.  It is an ever-changing role with many exceptional varied demands that range from project management, community liaison, social work, health and safety officers, manual handling trainers and many more, while supervisors maintain a positive and supportive manner for participants and communities to accomplish worthwhile projects.</p> <p>  Despite us consistently going the extra mile, for more than 18 years the Department of Social Protection has refused to engage meaningfully to address our punitive working contracts and bring them in line with other comparative jobs.  There is an immediate need for the Department to re-establish the tripartite forum, as agreed in 2019, whereby we can collectively address our needs, which include an immediate 15% pay rise and implementation of a pay scale in line with comparative jobs in the same industry; the introduction of an occupational pension scheme; paid maternity leave; and the provision of a travel budget to cover the job requirements.</p> <p>  In last year&rsquo;s Government publication, Our Rural Future, the policy reflects on the myriad of opportunities to revitalise our towns and villages.  I hope members can see the RSS is a vital cog in achieving this vision and that we will receive their active support in order to address the issues I have outlined.</p></speech>

They can probably tell from my accent that I am not from Mayo.  I am from the Dublin south city partnership.  I will not go over the same stuff Ms Macdonald spoke about, but I will outline what the T&uacute;s programme is, what T&uacute;s supervisors and co-ordinators do, how the roles have changed, and the impact on the community.</p> <p>  T&uacute;s was launched in 2010.  It is a community employment activation scheme that provides short-term working opportunities for unemployed people.  It is managed by 49 local development companies nationally for the Department of Social Protection, which has overall responsibility for the scheme.</p><p>To be eligible for the programme, candidates must have been on a jobseeker's payment for at least 12 months and be in receipt of jobseeker's allowance.  They are referred from the social welfare offices or can self-refer.  Up to 30% are allowed to self-refer.  As with the RSS, T&uacute;s participants work 19.5 hours a week for 12 months.  That is a difference between the schemes.  There is a limit of a year with T&uacute;s, so we have quite a high turnover with that scheme.</p><p> T&uacute;s plays a key role in social inclusion in rural and urban settings.  We support day centres for the elderly, childcare centres, sports centres, community halls, disability services, environmental groups, heritage services and social enterprises.  We have roughly one to three participants in each community group.  To give the example of Dublin South City Partnership, DSCP, which I work with, we have an allocation of 160 placements.  We work with 80 local community organisations so we have a really wide reach.  That means we are able to provide specific opportunities to the candidates.  We are also able to respond quickly to changing needs in the community.  We run directly projects such as care and repair.  That is a free gardening and handyman service for the over-65s.  We have about 300 regular clients.  We fit safety rails and smoke alarms, set mousetraps and intervene in cases of hoarding, that is, do clear-outs.  These older people do not really have anyone else to help them.  They fall between the cracks.  The model is working in supporting all these local community needs.  The only thing that slows us down a bit is getting the referrals from the Department of Social Protection.  We are ready and well placed to take more people; we just need candidates.  Our placements are key in developing our clients' career progression.  Approximately 30% of participants go on to full-time employment and another 30% go on to further training or schemes, but many of the remaining participants would benefit from one more year on T&uacute;s to become job-ready.</p><p> Now I will talk a little about our roles as supervisors and co-ordinators.  We are responsible for supervising up to 25 participants each, following a recent increase in our quota.  We must recruit the candidates and find the placements for them.  We look after all the HR and administrative stuff, that is, payroll, Garda vetting, HR records and reporting to Pobal and the Department of Social Protection.  On top of that, now that a lot of the service has gone online, we find ourselves helping clients to set up bank accounts, phone plans and Revenue accounts and to fill in social welfare applications.  We are like a one-stop shop for providing all that information and support to remove any barriers to employment, so the role has evolved a lot.</p><p> Not many people know about what the co-ordinating supervisors do.  Not only do we have all the same duties as the supervisors, that is, we look after 25 participants each and do all the HR stuff, but we also line-manage a team of supervisors.  We are sometimes office managers because we have satellite offices apart from the partnership head offices.  We look after data protection, budgets and strategic planning.  It is essentially a programme management role.  For that we get a top-up of only &euro;5,000 a year.  Essentially, the model is working well the way it was set up, but the resources are a bit stretched.  There are a few things that need to be looked at in that regard.  Furthermore, our terms and conditions are totally different from those of the other partnership staff.  We work alongside other community programmes such as the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, and the ability programme.  I went on maternity leave two years ago, as did two of my colleagues at the same time.  They were paid; I was not.  I had to go on State maternity pay.  It was quite unfair and a bit of a kick in the face.  We do the job, however, because we love it and believe in the programme.  There are just a few things that need to be looked at to make it more sustainable and more attractive and to retain the supervisors who know the field well.</p></speech>

SIPTU represents the 400-plus supervisors who work in T&uacute;s and the RSS.  As the committee has heard and will be aware, our members provide an invaluable service to local communities to ensure an effective and professional approach to community employment and social inclusion.  In our written submission we have given an overview of the current services and the necessary structural changes which we believe would greatly enhance the services.  These issues have already been addressed by Ms Macdonald and Ms Brennan in their opening statements.  In my opening statement I will concentrate on the industrial relations framework, or lack thereof, and outline some of the most pressing issues with which we believe the committee may be in a position to offer us some assistance.<br/><br/>As for the industrial relations framework, our members employed as T&uacute;s and RSS supervisors suffer the same fate, unfortunately, as most workers employed across the community sector.  They are employees of private companies, typically partnerships or local development companies.  The funding for their salaries, however, comes directly from Government spending, in this case from the Department of Social Protection.  Our members have not had a pay increase for a significant number of years.  As a trade union representing this cohort of workers, we find ourselves in a very frustrating position.  Employers are, in the main, willing to engage with us.  However, they do not have any funds to meet our claims, be that in respect of pay claims, pension provision, sick pay or maternity leave, as the committee has heard Ms Brennan talk about.  We recently concluded negotiations with the Department on a Labour Court recommendation outstanding since 2008 for community employment supervisors concerning pension provision.  That remains unimplemented to date.<br/><br/>We note that the EU will soon implement a directive concerning minimum rates of pay and collective bargaining coverage.  It will soon be incumbent on all member states to increase their collective bargaining coverage to 80% of their national workforces.  If the Government intends to give effect to that directive, where better to start, we would argue, than in the community sector, the near abroad, as it were, of the public sector?  I stress that our members do not have any great desire to become public servants <i>per se</i>but they do expect their terms and conditions of employment to be fair and to reach a threshold of decency.<br/><br/>This limbo-type situation in which trade unions representing workers in the community sector find themselves must come to an end.  Mechanisms in place previously provided for a more normal industrial relations environment.  Between 1986 and 2008, for example, our members in T&uacute;s and the RSS received pay increases which mirrored the pay provisions of the social partnership agreements.  We have outlined in our written submission some of the most pertinent issues which remain outstanding because of the lack of an effective collective bargaining forum for all stakeholders, that is, the Department, the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, and trade unions to attend.<br/><br/>Most lately, on 23 February, we requested that the Department of Social Protection re-establish a tripartite forum which had been in place since 2017, comprised of representatives from the Department, the ILDN and trade unions.  We believe that that was an important body.  We still believe that the re-establishment of such a body is critical to building relationships between the relevant stakeholders.<br/><br/>As for pay, the RSS and T&uacute;s play a critical role in promoting social inclusion in both rural and urban settings.  It is our firm belief that the roles of both cohorts have evolved in recent years to such an extent that the 15% differential which exists between community employment supervisors' rate of pay and that of RSS and T&uacute;s supervisors is neither justifiable nor sustainable.  We have approached the Department of Social Protection accordingly, seeking the establishment of an evaluation exercise of the role and duties these workers now undertake.  The purpose of the evaluation exercise is to conduct a comparative analysis of the role and duties of community employment scheme, CES, supervisors and those of RSS and T&uacute;s supervisors.  The rate of the additional payment for co-ordinating supervisors needs also to be the subject of that evaluation exercise.</p><p>This is the only objective and fair way in which to validate the basis for any pay claim in reality.  </p><p> We have sought to agree terms of reference and methodology for the conduct of this evaluation exercise.  At our only meeting with officials from the Department of Social Protection to date, they informed the unions that they would liaise with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the issue.  It should be noted that the conduct of an evaluation of the work and roles of grades of employees is a normal process to adopt within the public sector where a union believes there is merit in a re-grading exercise.  We ask the committee to use its significant influence to assist SIPTU and these workers in advancing this request.</p><p> Regarding pension provision, as the committee is probably aware our members have no occupational pension scheme.  This is, quite frankly, intolerable.  The standard defence from the Department is that it is not the employer.  We think it is a tired refrain and a figleaf of a defence which simply does not wash with our members.  We have sought the immediate introduction of an occupational pension scheme.  We have not been prescriptive in our demands and are amenable to discussions around pension models, contribution levels, etc.</p><p> Regarding a worker representation or voice, we believe that workers should be included in the stakeholder bodies that currently exist.  As it stands, SIPTU has no input into the current review being undertaken in respect of RSS.  There is significant unde-rdevelopment in any sort of social dialogue process in terms of the evolution of services and a worker representative or voice on such bodies.</p><p> There is currently a structural problem in the payment of travel expenses for members employed in RSS.  There is an effective cap on travel expenses.  This is the cause of much frustration for members and immediate remedial measures to address same would be welcomed.  Schemes will be funded to a sufficient degree which does not see our members out of pocket, something that is currently the case. </p><p> Ms Macdonald addressed the six-year rule in her opening remarks.  We believe the current rule in respect of RSS is undermining the viability of the scheme's primary function, namely the promotion of social inclusion.  We would again ask the committee to reflect on the six-year rule and recommend its elimination.</p><p> In conclusion, the current situation whereby trade unions are being sent from pillar to post, that is, from the Department to employers, is not now and never was tenable.  Last week, hundreds of community sector workers took to the streets.  They have, on average, not received a pay increase in 14 years.  We have served thousands of claims across individual employments in respect of the very basic terms of building momentum for 3%.  We now live in an economy that is experiencing 7% inflation, something that will be significantly higher by the end of the year.  These people need a pay rise.  I am not just talking about RSS and T&uacute;s, but across the entire sector.  The issue can only be addressed by direct engagement with the Department of Social Protection and a whole-of-government approach.  I ask the committee to take that request away today.  The dysfunctional nature of industrial relations which prevails across the community sector needs to be addressed urgently.</p></speech>

I am interested to hear that the witnesses favour abolishing it.  Another significantly detrimental effect on participants' wages is that they now, net of farm income, get the basic rate.  That means that anybody with a partner or children is getting exactly &euro;25 a week for 19.5 hours work.  They must be the lowest paid people in the country.  Perhaps the witnesses can outline how that is affecting interest in the scheme for people in that cohort.  Is it becoming difficult to fill vacancies in the scheme, given that only a finite amount of farmers and fishermen are eligible for the scheme?  I would be interested in hearing about that because it is it is a significant hit on people's income.  When the scheme was originally devised, once people qualified for the scheme they got the full rate for the job when they were under the threshold in terms of their underlying entitlement to farm assist, jobseeker's allowance, disability allowance or whatever else.</p> <p>  Regarding T&uacute;s participants, it was never intended that it be a one-year scheme by the Minister at the time.  I was the Minister at the time and I know what I intended.  That was a decision made by the Department of Finance.  If anyone can remember 2010, it was an achievement to get it through in that particular budget.  It is not meant to be an activation scheme, as such.  The idea was that people would engage in community employment for three years and if they then failed to get a job they could enter a permanent work scheme like RSS.  </p> <p>  There are people who will work very well and happily on schemes, but are unlikely to get commercial employment.  It is a myth that everybody in the economy will get commercial employment.  Anybody who has worked with schemes like RSS knows that is a reality.  These people are doing huge work in society at an economic cost.  The biggest complaint I and a lot of my colleague receive is that people want to stay on schemes because they will not get commercial employment and do not want to go back to jobseeker's allowance.  They do not want to have the numbing experience of not having a purpose; they want to get up in the morning and go somewhere to do something. </p> <p>  I would be interested in hearing the views of the witnesses on the participants in these schemes and whether there is now a need to reform T&uacute;s and its role to what it was originally meant to be, namely, a follow-on scheme.  People do training and activation and all the rest.  If they failed to get a job, then they go on the scheme.  That would not stop people from moving from T&uacute;s into commercial employment.  If they did not do so, the idea was that they would not be thrown back on the scrapheap.</p></speech>

We addressed this committee last year in respect of local employment services.  The Department has refused to attend the WRC.  I have no doubt that if we ask it to attend the WRC it will refuse to do so.  It has used language to state it would assist the WRC.  I am not really sure what that means, but it has refused to attend.</p> <p>  We had a Labour Court recommendation with regard to the CE supervisors going back to 2008.  We negotiated an agreement only last year.  The process took almost 14 years, and the recommendation has not been implemented.  The issue that will resolve this will not involve going to the WRC.  I would end up having to refer 50 or 60 cases in each individual partnership or local development company.  We need direct engagement in a collective bargaining forum that has some weight and treats us as equals, as normally happens in a collective bargaining forum.</p> <p>  If we go to the WRC or the Labour Court, all we are doing is leading these people on a merry-go-round and nothing will be achieved because the Department will say it is not the employer and is not implementing an agreement.  We are caught in a bind.  The entire sector is broken and needs to be fixed.</p><p>The only way to fix it is through a whole-of-government approach, particularly from the Department of Social Protection.  I will ask my colleagues to answer some of the more specific questions.</p></speech>

We had an interesting insight into the extension of T&uacute;s as we came out of lockdown when contracts were extended.  We have seen the benefits of that in terms of the participants and the service.  It meant so much to people for contracts to be extended and we are seeing the benefits of that.  I would definitely welcome reform in that regard.</p> <p>  One of the fundamental issues here about referrals is the referral system itself.  It seems to vary across the country in terms of the referrals from the Department.  Some offices seem to be better than others.  A bit of creativity and effort on the part of the Department might be needed.  </p> <p>  Youth unemployment, at 15.8%, is quite very, so there may be a possibility for T&uacute;s to engage on that area.  Over the years, we have seen the fallout of long-term unemployment for youth.  I definitely think there is a role for T&uacute;s to play here in looking at solutions to long-term unemployment for those aged under 25.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that we need to start looking at extending T&uacute;s, possibly to two or three years.  A bit of creativity around that would be very welcome.</p></speech>

I am sure everyone here is well aware of travel costs at the moment.  What we are doing is asking people to dig into their social welfare payments to support themselves coming out to work.</p> <p>  The means test has become very stringent for people on schemes.  One issue we have come across involves a second property that somebody might have inherited.  It is the value of the property that is taken into account rather than the income coming from it.  In many cases, it has been passed on to a grandchild.  One outstanding case of mine involves somebody who inherited a house.  The value of the house was taken into account and the participant must now leave the scheme until they can come up with the funding to get the house transferred to their daughter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.1224" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022051100002#E00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for coming before us.  It is important that we hear from the supervisors on the ground about T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme.  All the opening statements contained practical suggestions, which shows the benefit of listening to the people on the ground because they know the schemes best.  I hope this will play into the upcoming review of the rural social scheme.</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned the age profile of participants in the rural social scheme.  Could they elaborate on that?  What is the current age profile?  They mentioned the struggle to fill quotas.  I know their briefing documentation mentioned the national quota being 3,350.  At the end of March, when we raising the issue of the review and asked when it will happen - we still do know when it will happen - the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, confirmed that 2,969 people were on the rural social scheme and that 1,493 of those will not be impacted by the six-year rule.  That leaves over 1,400 people who will be impacted by the six-year rule.  This is almost half of the entire quota for the rural social scheme so that is of significant concern.  In fairness, the Minister of State has said that as part of that review, he is very aware of the issues raised concerning the six-year rule, which is important.  The work being undertaken by this committee is timely and I hope we can feed into that review.</p> <p>  The figures are a cause of concern.  In respect of those figures and the impact of the six-year rule, what do they mean on the ground?  If the figures are correct and the full quota is 3,350, with 2,969 people on the scheme, that means there are 531 vacancies throughout the State.  I imagine the impact of that is that services are not able to run as they should, which has consequences.  I am sure all members agree it is essential for the key stakeholders, namely, the witnesses, to feed into the review and be heard in respect of it.  This is critical.  There is no point in having the review if that does not happen.</p> <p>  Regarding T&uacute;s, could the witnesses speak about the challenge involved in the referrals and the referral process?  I have heard of places that receive a list from the Department and ring people on that list.  Some of them will not bother taking up a place on T&uacute;s and do not actually have to, which is unusual because in many other schemes, people have to take up a place.  Will the witnesses elaborate on that and the level of refusals?  Is this as it seems?  </p> <p>  The idea of going from one year to two years should be considered because one year is not much time.  The organisations represented provide a lot of wraparound supports, as does the rural social scheme, and they are really important.  It is not the case that it is "just a job, any job" for everyone.  People require an awful lot more in some cases and it is not just a job.</p> <p>   Will the witnesses also explain the difference between the T&uacute;s supervisors and the co-ordinating supervisors and the numbers in each?  The independent evaluation is a fair ask and should be undertaken.  I has asked that T&uacute;s be included in the review.  This is not on the table so an independent evaluation of that programme versus community employment would be important.  Given that job clubs are more or less gone now or will be gone in a couple of months and that model is changing drastically, the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s are more important than ever for that community-based model.  That is so important because there will be so few schemes left with a community basis.</p> <p>  Regarding the pension issue, it has been said by both the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s representatives that they do not have an occupational pension scheme.  Does SIPTU seek a deal for the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s similar to the one that has been done for the community employment scheme?  The issue with the Labour Court recommendation has at last been resolved and while the workers in question have not been paid yet, that will happen.  Is it SIPTU's intention to pursue that?  I know it probably pursued it all along but will it pursue it more vocally?</p> <p> All the witnesses mentioned the lack of a forum.  That is important.  Regarding the Department, the Irish Local Development Network, the trade unions and the tripartite forum, what is the issue with the Department regarding why that collapsed or did not work?  What did the Department say to the witnesses when they raised that?</p></speech>

They have gone back into full-time employment and are farming part time.  The older farmers aged in or around their 50s are the people on the schemes and need the schemes more because the chances of them getting back into full-time employment may be far slighter than those of a younger person.</p> <p>  The referral system for T&uacute;s is not getting enough referrals.  We have lots of work placements in which to place people but the supply of referrals coming through from the Department is inadequate.</p><p>As Deputy Kerrane mentioned, many of the people we contact do not want to engage with T&uacute;s, although they declare on the initial letter to the Department that they are interested.  Really, all we are doing is going in a circle in that respect.  There are names coming to us and the people refuse to come out to the scheme or do not engage with us.  They revert to the Department and say "Yes" to the next letter.  We are really going nowhere.</p><p> On the eligibility criteria for the rural social scheme, it would help us quite a lot if they were opened up a little more.  There are many people, especially in counties down the western seaboard, who have the niece or nephew of the original herd owner doing the farm work but because the uncle or aunt has not signed over the place to the niece or nephew, they are not eligible for the scheme.  They need it but they cannot participate.  If the criteria were relaxed a little, more people would be eligible for the rural social scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.1227" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ellen Brennan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022051100002#F00200"><p>I will speak to the challenge with referrals.  We are quite lucky at Dublin South City Partnership because the office we deal with, which I will not name, is really good at sending these over.  Maybe the internal system in the Department of Social Protection is not working as well.  I know it is setting up a completely new office to deal with that, which we really welcome.  We tend to get the same clients referred to us again and again.  They might not be coming on to T&uacute;s because they are not eligible for T&uacute;s; they may be on a disability payment or in full-time education, for example.  It is not that people are refusing but rather that they are not eligible for the programme.</p> <p>  We get a few refusals.  I spoke about the variety of placements that we have.  We get people who initially do not want to come on to T&uacute;s but once they come in, speak to us and see the opportunities that are available, they usually change their minds.  It is just a matter of getting them in the door to meet us and see what are the opportunities.  Our ethos is to look at what they want to do for their own career and find a placement to suit that rather than the other way around.  That works pretty well.  I am not overly concerned about the level of refusals but we definitely need more people.  It was only a couple of years ago it came out that we were able to take on self-referrals.  Until a couple of years ago, we were not allowed to advertise T&uacute;s placements.  Many people do not know about T&uacute;s.  It is only recently that we are starting to promote the scheme around the place.  As the word gets out, we might be able to get more people that way.  Currently, we are really relying on the social welfare direct referrals.</p> <p>  There was a question about the difference between supervisors and co-ordinators.  I indicated what supervisors do in looking after participants, doing the paperwork and everything, as well as developing links with community groups.  The co-ordinators must oversee all that.  As mentioned, we have huge reach in the community and I must ensure that as the role of supervisor develops, our staff are trained to deal with that appropriately.  It is about ensuring all the supervisors get proper training in supervisory management, for example, and data protection because of all the new information we must hold on to.  It is stuff like that.  There is also all the reporting that goes with that.</p> <p>  Self-referrals are also coming in and there is a need to promote and strategise more for the programme.  It is very time-consuming.  It is a dynamic programme but all the management is a lot to take on for the &euro;5,000 per year plus all the stuff that supervisors do.  That is the difference between the supervisor and co-ordinator.  The co-ordinator manages the programme, basically, and oversees it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.1228" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Corcoran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022051100002#F00300"><p>To reply to Deputy Kerrane, the running theme here relates to referrals, which are the key problem.  It is very important for us to have that working well because we need that provision of services.  There are a couple of measures that we see that would improve that volume of referrals, which is key.  For example, a participant may claim for a partner and there is no provision for them to refer to T&uacute;s because they are not accountable to the social welfare system.  They are being claimed for by somebody else.  Therefore, they are not eligible to come on T&uacute;s at any point until they open a claim in their own right.  That would free many referrals and it would really improve the volume.</p> <p>  Another aspect relates to people who are over 55 and that bit closer to retirement.  There should be a provision that anybody on the T&uacute;s scheme should be allowed to stay on, if they so wish, in conjunction with the T&uacute;s supervisor.  That is a key element relating to experience and provision of services because the services provided are fundamental to many end users, such as meals on wheels.  Many people depend on that service.  Much of this is operational and in some cases it may be nearly cost-neutral.  It is something the Department of Social Protection must look at in order to increase the volume of referrals.  It would go a long way to addressing that.</p></speech>

We are a cog but we are being left outside.  There was a forum between the Irish Local Development Network, the Department and the rural social scheme national committee.  In 2017, that failed dramatically because the Department would not engage with us.  We had meetings set up but we were left outside the circle.  The Department does not want us inside that circle.  If anything is to come out of today's meeting, we would like to be inside the circle and put in our tuppence to the review.  It would make for a very good review if we could be inside.  We are the soldiers on the ground and we know the way it works.  We implement the work.  If anything is to come from today's discussion, I would like to see multiparty talks, including SIPTU, starting immediately again on the review.</p></speech>

The pension settlement in respect of the community employment supervisors is less than satisfactory, and that is to use parliamentary language.  After 14 years, people were worn down and we accepted what we got, which is essentially the gratuity that looked very much like statutory redundancy.  It is not a pension scheme; that is the reality.  We are looking for a pension scheme.  This opens the door in that the Department came up with some moneys to address the matter but we are not going to be fobbed off with the idea that the third tier of pensions will come in.</p> <p>  I am very concerned about the uncertain economic space ahead of us.  This matter is typically pushed down for another number of years.  We are certainly looking for a pension scheme.  If it is good enough for community employment supervisors to have something resembling a pension scheme, we need something along those lines.</p></speech>

I am very familiar with T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme, which are vital for communities.  Social inclusion has been mentioned a number of times.  For any community in which our members are involved, both the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s are essential for that.</p> <p>  A number of my questions have been asked already but I will speak to a number of points.  I will first address SIPTU.  When we met this time last year we spoke about the union meeting representatives from the Department.  Has that happened and how many times has the union met departmental officials about this matter?  Have there been specific meetings about the rural social scheme and T&uacute;s?  Will Mr. Kane let us know that because I know it was his wish when we discussed it the last time he was here?</p> <p>  With the T&uacute;s scheme, I am aware of a number of matters relating to referrals, which have been discussed in detail this morning.  There is the particular question of referrals of unsuitable candidates from the Department.</p><p>Is that a serious problem?  It is something I am hearing about from a number of different schemes, where people are coming again and being referred again.  Maybe one of the witnesses could comment.</p><p> I was very taken by Mr. Corcoran&rsquo;s point on youth unemployment.  It is an issue I have brought up a number of times in the Seanad and the wider Oireachtas.  What is Mr. Corcoran's view on how we can target and help that particular cohort of people to get involved with the rural social scheme, but most importantly with T&uacute;s.  The benefit of getting our youth involved with community is essential for the future of our communities.  I am involved with a number of community groups.  There is no doubt we are all of an age where we are looking to the future, and the future needs young people involved in our communities.  Maybe that is a way we can target youth unemployment, which is very important.</p><p>With regard to both the RSS and T&uacute;s, supervisor training has been mentioned.  I am aware of the wonderful supervisors who go over and beyond on a daily basis.  Ms Brennan mentioned it is almost a one-stop shop which is getting comments and questions on every aspect of community life and day-to-day life.  Is there enough supervisor training?  What else would the witnesses like to see in the RSS or T&uacute;s?  I know they would like to see payment for that, which is essential and I would support that.  It is unbelievable we do not have sick pay, maternity leave or adequate travel expenses at this stage.  Is there enough training?</p><p> With regard to the supervisors, it is essential for the future of both of these schemes that the expertise is maintained, so we have to reward that expertise.  One of the contributors mentioned the love of the job.  That is great and there is no doubt about it, but there has to be recompense to go with the love of the job.  That is what all of the witnesses have asked and it is something that we, as a committee, need to address.  It is essential for our communities that that expertise is maintained and brought forward for the future.</p></speech>

We met last year in regard to the Local Employment Service, LES, and jobs clubs but we have had very poor engagement with the Department since and we have not established a mechanism yet to deal with the impending redundancies in the sector.  We had a meeting with the Department yesterday which was far from satisfactory.  We are going nowhere in regard to resolving that, although we are looking at hundreds of redundancies.  The Department is refusing to step up to the mark in terms of trying to fund what is going to come out of that.</p> <p>  To come back to this group, we met with the Department earlier in the year in regard to the RSS and T&uacute;s.  Again, we have not made much progress in terms of a very reasonable request for an evaluation process, which is typical where a grade of employee has evolved, the work has changed and so on.  All we are looking for is an independent mechanism to do that.  Either the claim falls or it has merit, but that objective analysis is something we are up for.  We believe 15% is a huge differential on pay between community employment, CE, supervisors and the people we are representing here.  It is not tenable and it needs to be addressed urgently.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.1234" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2022051100002#G00300"><p>Although I am not a member of the committee, I feel passionate about the rural social schemes and what they do in communities.  I am delighted to welcome Ms Macdonald, Mr. Larkin and Mr. Broderick from Galway Rural Development, which is based in my own constituency, as well as the other representatives.  The impact the rural social schemes have had, since they were first initiated by the then Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, back in time, has been enormous in rural communities, first, for the communities themselves and, second, for the positivity this has created for participants and the network it has created across rural Ireland in terms of the work that is being done, the camaraderie that is there and the benefits people get.</p> <p>  I am going to divide my speaking time between two issues.  My first point concerns the participants.  I believe the six-year rule has reached its end of life, if one can call it that.  That should now be taken out and everybody should be allowed to remain on a scheme for the full duration of their time.  At the time when it was introduced in 2017, it was because there was demand to get into the scheme but, at this stage, the demand is for participants to be allowed to remain on the scheme.  We need to adjust it.  The year 2017 was five years ago and we have to review this and make the change.</p> <p>  The other issue I have come across is that nieces and nephews of farmers are excluded from becoming participants.  In many cases, that is ruling out good people who could be part of the scheme.  If the niece or nephew of a farmer were allowed to come on a scheme, that would enhance the numbers available and would also provide additional participants for the scheme.</p> <p>  We need to look at the participation of people with disabilities in the scheme to make sure we are bringing in people with disabilities and giving them a sense of purpose through an EmployAbility-type arrangement, which would be a first step towards getting work.  It is not that this is job creation, but there is much that could be done for people with disabilities on the rural social schemes, and I know that at first hand.  Those are the things we need to do and if a review is undertaken or if submissions are to be made, they should be considered.</p> <p>  There is an inequality with regard to the supervisors and Mr. Kane mentioned a 15% pay differential with CE supervisors.  I am also conscious of the long road it took to get what was got out of the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which play one off against the other and put us back and over like a tennis ball when it comes to things like this, and that is being honest.  I hear what Mr. Kane is saying.  The direct route is to get somebody to sit down and independently look at the situation.  That would be a highly sensible way to bring this to a head as quickly as possible so this anomaly is not going on for the next ten to 14 years, as the CE schemes were, only to get something at the end of it which was not exactly fair, although it was something.</p> <p>  With regard to eligibility, Mr. Broderick mentioned a case where somebody got a house and, although it could never be rented out, a notional income was put on that house by the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s mechanisms for creating that notional income.  This meant a person had to leave the scheme.  That house will never be rented and it will be passed on to a grandchild and that is in process but, in the meantime, the participant has been penalised.  Overall, that is something we need to look at with the Department of Social Protection.</p> <p>  The big ask I get from participants is this.  They are on the scheme and doing their work, and they are delighted to be at it, but when they sit down and think about it on a Sunday, after having dinner and while watching the match, or whatever, they ask, &ldquo;What is in it for us apart from the participation?&rdquo;  The &euro;25 a week is not real when we think of the benefits that are accruing to every community.  Somebody mentioned meals on wheels and there is the Irish Wheelchair Association, cancer care services and all kinds of services that are benefiting enormously from this.</p> <p>  I do not have any questions other than to offer my total support to everybody who is here today as a witness to present the case.  I will work with them, as will the Chairman and every member of the committee.  What was set up as a very good scheme in 2003 needs to be re-calibrated to make it fit for purpose again for the next ten years.  It would be timely to do it now.  I thank the Chairman and the members for allowing me the time.</p></speech>

We are already having to do "fishes and loaves" on the ground with many groups.  We are just managing to spread it around, particularly because the rural social scheme, RSS, participants, are happy to go to the extra hours.  They do not count 19.5 hours.  They are there and will go to the 35 hours and will do it.  If the day is right, they will come out on a good weather day, be it a Saturday or Sunday.  They own these jobs and take great passion in doing them.  They have a mileage allowance and we are moving them around.  They are asking to be moved more frequently to be able to meet the demands and there is petrol, and so forth, involved in that.  The amount of money they are being paid is completely peanuts relative to what they are doing.  They really need to be paid a great deal more money into their pockets to be able to do the job but also to feel self worth in the work that they are doing.  They view this as a job and not as a social welfare payment and they are doing this work so that they can better their communities.  </p><p> We should look to widening the whole eligibility criteria and there are some areas that need to be looked at.  We have carers out there who are looking after mothers and fathers in the family.  Many of them have had to become carers and to leave the social scheme because they are only allowed to work 15 hours if they are carers.  The rural social scheme asks for 19.5 hours.  It makes no sense.  They are actually leaving work where they are only receiving &euro;22.54 to sit at home and to be more isolated, simply because the Department will not allow them to do an extra 4.5 hours work. </p></speech>

This is, nonetheless, something that needs to be looked at because those people need to be brought out and socialised also.</p> <p>  Generally, a widening of the scheme would be desirable.  My belief is that anybody who has the capacity to work who lives in rural Ireland but cannot move, be that for transport reasons or otherwise, should be allowed to participate in the scheme.  The minimum payment they would be getting is &euro;22.50 and the work is very worthwhile.</p> <p>  I would like to mention the supervisors&rsquo; salaries, and so forth.  This has been on the agenda for a long time.  There was nothing for ten years.  There was a minimum input then in 2017.  Now, where we have such economic pressures, this cannot go on forever.  We have a situation where supervisors rely on their cars to do their work.  The salaries they receive do not even allow them to buy a decent car or even to fix the car, sometimes, if something happens.  There needs to be an immediate input to resolve this situation.</p></speech>

We are all delighted to be here today to put our point across.  We are at a crucial point in the schemes at this time.  We are a third of the way into 2022 and I know that our company has been informed that if we do not fill our quota by the end of the year, our funding will be cut.  If funding is cut, the partnership companies will tend to go away from the schemes because there would be nothing there for them.  If anything needs to be done, it needs to be done fairly quickly and whoever is there, we should have a voice at that table.</p> <p>  From the RSS point of view on participants, the six-year rule is crucial at this point because we have been instructed to issue contracts only to the end of the six years.  That will be next February for us in some of cases.  We have a very short window within which to get things done.  I would like that to be dealt with urgently than to be left on the long finger for a period.  Otherwise, the schemes will die.  If that happens, that is the end of them and they are gone.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

Ultimately, it is back to the Department of Social Protection, DSP, because it has the demographics and the data and it is aware of the exact percentages in the various areas.  One thing that would go a long way in addressing the referrals on youth unemployment would be the one year eligibility.  One has to be on a jobseeker's payment for one year to qualify for T&uacute;s.  If one has been long-term unemployed, a year is a long time for a young person and that can fill up with negative things also.  Early intervention is very important there.  That could be controlled by the local DSP office, where it could handle referrals of participants under the age of 25 but each supervisor or scheme would hold a percentage on their scheme for that under-25 group.</p> <p>  The other aspect of this is that by removing the one-year rule, one could engage with many of the colleges and the training organisations because once people finish on a Friday, and if they have no job to go to, they should be able to come on with us to get that year of experience so that they can avoid falling into this long-term unemployed bracket.  That is a measure that the Department could move on quite quickly.   The removal of that one-year requirement would go a long way in addressing that issue.</p> <p>  Through the Chairman, I will invite Ms Brennan in now as she has a number of points in respect of Senator Wall&rsquo;s question.</p></speech>

There is some kind of a systems issue in the DSP.  It is not the staff as they are working very hard in there, which I know for a fact, but somehow, the referrals system structure needs to be looked at.  There are so many eligible people on the live register but the Department does not seem to be able to get these people in order to send them to us.  I do not know what the issue is but the Department needs to look at this.</p> <p>  With T&uacute;s, we are here and we have a great many jobs available.  We could be integrating the young people but we could also be integrating the new immigrants that are coming in all of the time.  We have many multicultural community groups.  The way to get people integrated into Irish society is by working together.  </p> <p>  The Senator was also asking about training budgets.  Training is very important to ensure that the quality of the programme develops.  Some sort of allocation for that would be greatly welcomed.</p></speech>

We are probably five years into the scheme at this stage.  For every euro that the Government invested at that stage, we had a payback of &euro;2.89.  This was probably part of the collapse of the forum as well because we applied extensive pressure on the Department to carry out another cost-benefit analysis.  The Department would absolutely not hear of it because those figures would quadruple in terms of what we are worth and what we are saving the Government.  As we are around the table here, we are making a big ask in respect of the amount of money we are saving the Government.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

I also appreciate Deputy Canney&rsquo;s attendance here.  We have a serious situation in particular with regard to a significant differential on rates of pay for people who are doing very similar work.  We have outlined a path forward as to how that can be resolved.</p> <p>  There is also the bigger issue across the entire sector where, for most people, there has been no pay increase for the past 14 years.  This really needs a whole-of-government response.  I have spoken about the EU directive on collective-bargaining, of coming to the table and of how we find a way of funding the community sector where people have reasonable terms and conditions of employment.  People do not want to become public servants.  The fear I know is there with every official I meet is that if he or she opens the door that claims will start coming through, etc.  We can create safeguards for the State where we do not want to become public servants but we want to be paid decently, to have security of tenure and to have decent pensions.</p><p>I do not think that is too much to ask for in this day and age.</p></speech>

That is a good way to conclude the meeting.  It is clear from the meeting that the rural social scheme is not an activation scheme and, therefore, should not have a time limit.  We have had evidence that many participants of the scheme work in excess of the 19.5 hours because of the self-worth they derive from the work and the impact in the local community.  Participants see first-hand the impacts it has in the community and they should receive the full rate of payments, irrespective of means.  The current rate at &euro;1.28 per hour is not equitable or justifiable.  This issue needs to be urgently revisited.</p> <p>  Mr. Broderick and Deputy Canney raised an important issue concerning someone inheriting a house.  It is a problem across our social welfare system.  We have a perverse situation in this country at the moment.  We have a housing emergency in every community, yet if anyone were to release or rent that house out, they will be penalised by the social welfare system.  It makes no sense to have the Department of Social Protection actively blocking the release of properties for rental in the middle of a housing crisis.</p> <p>  Regarding T&uacute;s, the 12-month limit on participation needs to be urgently revisited, particularly in the many parts of the country where there is no one willing to take up that position when it becomes available.  The three-year prohibition on going back onto the scheme also needs to be looked at, as does the issue of the referrals.  We have seen this first-hand in our part of the country where we are straddling different counties and social welfare regions and the referrals are not coming through.  There seems to be a lack of joined-up thinking on that.  </p> <p>  The treatment of supervisors, whether CE, T&uacute;s or RRS,  needs to be urgently reviewed.  They are the linchpin in the success of the scheme and in the engagement of individuals in communities across the country.  The evidence from Ms Brennan on the issue of paid maternity leave highlights the discrimination in relation to it.  We have a publicly funded scheme where we engage with people who, sadly, are on the margins of society and try to bring them back into the mainstream, whether it be in terms of social engagement, self-worth or the impact it has on the local community, and we are not prepared to provide supervisors with maternity leave.  We have heard a lot about issues relating to access, discrimination and participation of women in the workforce.  This is low-hanging fruit that needs to be urgently addressed.</p> <p>  I thank witnesses for attending and their constructive and positive engagement with the committee.  It is our intention as a committee to present a report on our deliberations to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, with the hope that the committee's deliberations and recommendations will be taken on board by the Department.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh go l&eacute;ir.  </p></speech>
