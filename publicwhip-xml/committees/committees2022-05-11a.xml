For the purposes of producing the Official Report, it has been requested that members are identified when they are called to speak.  Members are requested to remove their face coverings when speaking to ensure their contributions can be recorded.  Those of us who do not have face coverings should not remove anything.  Apologies have been received from Deputy John McGuinness.  I welcome members and also viewers who may be watching our proceedings on Oireachtas TV to the public session of the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in a committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts, which is in Leinster House, in other words.  In order to participate in a division in the committee, members must be physically present.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, and his officials.  Any Member substituting for a member of the committee should formally notify the clerk now.  No one is substituting for a member yet.  Divisions will be taken as they arise.  Members must attend in person in the committee room for divisions, although they can attend the meeting remotely.  Members attending this meeting in accordance with Standing Order 106(3) should be aware that they may move their amendments but cannot participate in voting on that amendment.</p></speech>

The Minister of State will be familiar with the practice that moneylenders use.  I use the word "prey" to describe what they do to vulnerable people at times of financial pressure, including in the run-up to Christmas and at this time of year as parents prepare children for communion and confirmations.  There is no prohibition on promoting new loans when customers are nearing their final payments.  Why were no further restrictions on advertising put in place when the Minister of State was considering this legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#A00700"><p>Section 2 provides for the terms "moneylender", "moneylending", "moneylender&rsquo;s licence" and "moneylending agreement" to be replaced by the term "high cost credit provider", "high cost credit", "high cost credit provider's licence" and "high cost credit agreement", respectively.  The purpose of this change in language is differentiate licensed providers more clearly from unlicensed lenders.</p><p>The many suggestions relating to advertising are currently catered for either by the Consumer Credit Association, CCA, or the moneylending code.  In addition, the Central Bank has since published the moneylending regulations, which address areas like advertising and targeting.  The requirements of the moneylending regulations should assist customers and consumers in becoming more informed and encourage them to consider alternatives.  These requirements include that moneylenders insert an enhanced high-cost credit warning statement in all advertisements, regardless of whether advertising refers to a rate of interest or a cost of credit.  The following text must be included in the warning statement: "Warning: This is high-cost credit. Consider alternative options before applying for this credit, including alternatives from other lenders regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland."  The cost of credit must be clearly displayed on the moneylender's website, and they are required to provide an information notice on the application stage.  Moneylenders' advertising must be clear, not misleading, and presented in a way that customers will know that it is an advertisement.  Moneylenders can no longer make unsolicited contact on the recommendations of an existing customer, in other words, refer a friend.  This is a very important issue that deals with vulnerable people who might be looking for funding in the run-up to some of the big family events.</p><p> Moneylenders are required to take reasonable steps to identify customers who are vulnerable customers and to ensure they are provided with the assistance that may be necessary.  The essence of this legislation, which was not there before and which is very strong now, is that, before the moneylender gives a loan, they must look at the person's ability to repay that loan and take into account the existing financial commitments the person might have.  There is a requirement for moneylenders to consider that.  The whole tone of this legislation is that when the Central Bank is satisfied that some high-cost lenders are not actually doing that, it can have an impact on their licence.  They could have it withdrawn, suspended or, ultimately, not renewed.  This is the whole tone of the Bill.  It is not just one section the deals with this.</p><p> Since we have spoken, the Central Bank has published its moneylending regulations to address the issue of advertising.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, will have a role in advising consumers on this, separate from this legislation, even though it will also play a key part of it around consumer protection.</p><p> When it comes to granting licences, the Central Bank will take all of these matters into account any time it is issuing a licence or considering taking any action where there is an actual breach.  The conduct standards required by the Central Bank of these licensed operators can be taken into account whereas up to now those factors were not specifically included in the legislation.  There is a raft of areas dealing with consumer protection that perhaps had not existed heretofore.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#B00200"><p>Will there be any prohibition on moneylenders doing leaflet drops in the run-up to Christmas, which target vulnerable households with high-cost interest loans?  Regardless of the fact the moneylenders will have to disclose "We are fleecing you", there remains the fact they are targeting people during that period.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#B00300"><p>There is no specific item in the legislation that deals with a period such as coming up to First Communion, Christmas or any other holiday period.  There is no specific section in the legislation that prohibits the distribution of advertisements in a specific time period.  When one can advertise is not confined to certain days of the year.  As I have said, the interest rate must be clearly displayed and must clearly state that it is a high-cost interest loan.  This must be clearly displayed.  Most people will understand it is an advertisement.   I take the Deputy's point, however, that it is a temptation when people see these advertisements.  I believe we are strengthening the requirements on the industry to make clear what is involved if one takes up the temptation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#B00400"><p>What is the Minister of State's view on that?  It is that type of advertisement.  We are aware advertising takes place in different ways now than it did in the past.  That kind of leaflet drop is still a part of moneylenders' operational procedures.  They are not going to drop leaflets out in Donnybrook.  They target social housing estates and they target areas they believe are lower income areas.  They make it very appealing to people that there is an easy fix.  Given the Government is legislating for warnings around the high costs of the interest rates, does the Minister of State not feel this is a missed opportunity to prohibit that type of practice?  We know of this type of lending.  I am sure everyone in this House would advise people that before they go to a moneylender, they should check all of their other options, including credit unions and loan supports by the State through the credit union movement, and other retail banks.  Allowing them to advertise at times of vulnerability is a mistake.  I believe it is something we will have to come back and revisit in this legislation in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#B00500"><p>I understand.  We were all in the same space on this in protecting vulnerable customers at a vulnerable period in the year just coming up to Christmas.</p> <p>  The Central Bank brought in the high-cost warning requirements, which came into effect on 1 September 2020, and the remainder of those regulations came into effect on 1 January 2021.  Some of those have already come into effect since the discussion started around this legislation.  It is very important that the "refer a friend" practice will be dealt with now under this legislation.  When somebody gets a loan, many may say to a neighbour "This is where I got the loan".  There are no statistics on that but it is a common way for people to hear about a particular moneylender or high-cost credit company.  Provision to deal with this "refer a friend" practice is included in the legislation.</p> <p>  Banning advertising for certain periods of the year is probably a broader societal issue rather than being specific to this issue.  That is something we did not do in the pre-legislative scrutiny with regard to the advertising industry.  That would be a very broad debate that can happen in the Oireachtas, with much wider implications than this exact legislation.  The credit unions have a good product out there.  Some 102 credit unions have an offer called It Makes Sense, which are loans to help customers with household budgetary items.  In many of these communities the credit unions are having an impact.</p> <p>  I would expect a reduction in the leaflet drops because, up to now, a key feature of moneylending has been the door-to-door collection.  It is a key feature.  People were calling to the housing estates, which Deputy Doherty referred to, monthly or weekly collecting money.  Part of that may have been the delivery of leaflets.  Under this legislation, the cost of a door-to-door collection is not facilitated.  The moneylenders cannot charge for a door-to-door collection fee.  We cannot stop them calling door to door to collect money, but they cannot charge for it or include it in the interest rate or a fee associated with the loan.  I would genuinely expect there to be a significant reduction in the number of people calling to houses in housing estates collecting money and possibly delivering leaflets when they are doing the same exercise.  It will be a by-product of this legislation.  They will not be calling around to those housing estates regularly.  There is, however, no proposal to abolish door-to-door leaflet drops.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#B00600"><p>That is a mistake in the context of how they operate and how they target vulnerable customers.  Is there anything in the legislation that will ban the practice of promoting new loans to customers who are nearing final repayments?  We challenge the interest that is being charged to someone who takes out a six-month loan from a moneylender, and we can see that they are paying possibly ten to 12 times more than if they had received the same amount of money from a credit union.  They must pay hundreds of additional euro than if they had got that loan from a credit union.  It sounds terrible that they will have paid &euro;300 or &euro;400 more, for example, but the reality for many individuals who have gone to a moneylender is the practice of continuing to keep them under the grip of the moneylender.  The moneylender advertises a loan as the current loan is expiring, which means the person is in a continuous period of high-cost credit.  This means he or she is paying thousands upon thousands of euro extra as a result of the level of indebtedness.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#C00100"><p>I understand the point made about the people we are dealing with.  There is an item in the legislation that is new and is not in existing legislation.  For the first time we will have legislation whereby the loans can only extend for 12 months.  Up to now there was not a 12-month limit and loans could roll over very simply.  It did not have to be a new loan.  Under this legislation, the loan must be repaid and it must be only a 12-month loan.  A new loan would be required to be taken for a second period.</p> <p>  The Deputy has said that towards the end of a loan term, a customer would be offered a new loan.  The second item in the legislation that did not exist heretofore is the obligation to carry out a review of the ability to pay the loan within the 12 months before issuing that loan again.  In the past moneylenders were piling loans on people and maybe two or three moneylenders were calling to some houses.  Now there will be a requirement to know the total ability of the person taking the loan to repay it through normal credit checks.  They did not have to do those up to now.  There are approximately 40 companies in the country that will rely on the Central Bank of Ireland for approval for the period of their licence and if it finds they are not complying with the obligation and are giving loans to people where it is reasonable to say they are not able to repay the loans, it will affect the Central Bank's view.  With this legislation, it can take such consideration when reviewing or examining the licence.  It is a new element.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#C00200"><p>To tease that out, what are the criteria a moneylender must follow on ability to pay?  Would they include the track record of a customer paying a previous loan or would they be based on household income, such as the proportion of income, as applied by banks?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#C00300"><p>It would be the same requirement as for any commercial or personal loan.  That did not apply up to now in this sector.  The lenders will now have to meet the same consumer credit loan protections and regulations that apply to all other lenders authorised by the Central Bank.  That was not the case up to now.  This will include income and whether a person has the ability to repay the loan.  It will always be the single biggest criterion.  It is not just about historic payments, although such information will tell lenders if there are any outstanding loans to take into account.  It is about the ability to repay the loan.  That provision was not there previously.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#C00400"><p>That is fine.  Taking it one step further, what is the default rate across the industry when it comes to moneylending loans?</p></speech>

The average loan is in the bracket of between &euro;700 and &euro;800.  They are not loans of thousands of euro.  They are quite small.</p></speech>

These include the relationship with the collector and the evidence indicates individuals will prioritise moneylender loans above other types of loan because it is the last opportunity for them to access credit.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#C01000"><p>Yes.  We have had much pre-legislative scrutiny of this, including examination of my legislation, and the fear of illegal moneylenders is not seen as a reason to reduce interest rates.</p> <p>  The point I am making is that moneylenders having to calculate ability to pay is good.  I welcome it.  That misses the real point, however, as the default rate with moneylenders is very small anyway.  People pay these loans and the issue is not the ability to pay.  It is the fact that moneylenders are fleecing these people.  If a person borrows &euro;1,000 and pays approximately &euro;560 in interest, rolling it over by taking out a new loan each year, in four years that person will pay over &euro;2,000 in interest on the original &euro;1,000 loan.  That is the problem.  It is not ability to pay because evidence indicates the people will pay the loan.  The issue is the loan will have cost the family thousands of euro in interest over four years.  That is the problem.  The practice will be allowed to continue where Mary and Joe come to the end of their term and the moneylender might say that Seamus is going to college next year and offer a loan for that.  The lender will offer to work out the paperwork in taking out the new loan.  The &euro;1,000 that people will have "repaid" is still be paid and the lender will take another &euro;560 in interest.</p> <p>  That is the issue and it is immoral that a type of loan such as this is rolled over continuously, and this happens with many families.  It ends up costing an individual thousands of euro and multiples of the capital that was originally taken out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#C01100"><p>That is a very fair description of where we are, prior to the enactment of this legislation.  It is a very fair assessment of what happens in many cases.  It is why, for the first time, we are introducing a limit of 12 months on any loan.  In the past, loans would just been rolled over repeatedly but now a loan will have to be brought to a conclusion at the end of the 12-month period.  There will be a fresh application and the normal consumer credit checks by these companies will have to take ability to pay into account.</p> <p>  What the Deputy describes is exactly the position of many people.  They were given loans that, effectively, they could not repay.  There is almost an assumption the loan will roll over repeatedly.  That will be stopped with this legislation.  There is a 12-month limit for the first time and anybody who wants to get a loan for a second period will be starting from scratch with a fresh application.  The Central Bank must be satisfied and it has the ability to monitor these companies, which will now be regulated.  There are only a couple of dozen of them in the country.  I am satisfied the Central Bank will monitor the provisions in this new legislation very closely.  If it finds that, in effect, people are rolling over loans, the Central Bank will be able to take that into consideration in amending or revoking a company's licence or not renewing it.  That option does not currently exist.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is really missing the point here.  We recognise that a loan cannot be rolled over and a person must make a fresh application.  Taking out a new application will not be a problem for many of these families, who will have already met the terms of the previous 12-month loan.  They may have taken a loan of &euro;1,000 and paid &euro;560 in interest.  They will have repaid the capital and are good for another loan.  That is the problem.  If they take out another loan in the following year for the same &euro;1,000, the process repeats.  The new loans are rolled over.  That is what happens with people who use moneylenders.  There is no prohibition on advertising the new loan to somebody coming to the end of term in the original loan.</p> <p>  Somebody may have taken a &euro;1,000 loan over four years and will have repaid &euro;2,240 in interest in such a case.  Can we stop people from going to moneylenders year after year?  We cannot.  However, the core of my argument is there should be regulation of advertising of new loans to new borrowers as they come to the end of their term.  It is a predatory practice that moneylenders are involved with.  The same loan that somebody takes from the credit union over the same period would cost &euro;240 in interest.  That is compared with &euro;2,240 with a moneylender.</p></speech>

Those people would have repaid approximately &euro;500 in interest and the capital.  If somebody gets a loan and repays it within the specified period, including interest, and wants to start again, they are allowed to do it.  Most people do it with car loans etc.  When the loan is repaid, including capital and interest, they will start a new loan.  That is not rolling over the loan.  It would be for some new item in the house, electrical equipment or next year's first communion for a different child.  It would not be the same loan.</p><p>This will be a new loan from the beginning for a new purpose.</p></speech>

That the Minister of State shrugs his shoulders at that idea means he fails to understand exactly what is happening with moneylenders.  This is the problem.  There are families out there at the minute who are borrowing &euro;1,000 and are paying it back.  They pay the &euro;560 interest.  At the moment they are rolling that over and will not be allowed to do that and will have to take out a new loan for the &euro;1,000 and pay another &euro;560 interest, and so on and so forth.  We cannot stop them doing that but we can and should be regulating the moneylenders to prevent them from advertising that new loan as they are coming up to the term.  If an individual wants to seek out a moneylender and apply for high-cost credit, that is fine, but when somebody knows that Mary and Michael are coming to the end of their term, this gives rise to a predatory practice that should be stopped.  That is my point.</p> <p>  I know what is happening in this legislation and that one cannot roll over, but the reality is that most of these customers will be able to get new loans.  It is a good thing that there will be an extra burden there and most will be able to do this but the problem is that this predatory practice is a problem.  It has been happening in the past and this is probably going to limit door-to-door sales where there were three generations involved and they were looking at Johnny who was turning 17 or 18 in the same way where the moneylenders could behave towards him in that predatory way.  That will come to an end but the idea that these moneylenders can hold and try to keep a data sheet is not good.  The legislation should regulate the advertisement in that regard.</p></speech>

A running account operates similarly to a type of credit card and is a product sometimes offered by catalogue companies.  This technical amendment seeks to update a schedule of references to deter moneylending, following the passing of the recent Act.  One of the purposes of the Bill is to replace the term &quot;moneylending&quot; with the term &ldquo;high cost credit&rdquo; where it occurs on the Statute Book.  Since this Bill was published, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Retail Credit and Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2022 has added another reference to the word &quot;moneylending&quot; in the Statute Book.  The reference to &quot;moneylending&quot; should be replaced by the term &ldquo;high cost credit&rdquo;.  This is only a change of nomenclature or name.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, and amendment No. 6 are grouped together for discussion purposes.  Amendment No. 4 sets out the substantive change while amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 6 are required to be inserted appropriately into the Bill.

They will allow the Central Bank to take account of the conduct of the high-cost credit providers in the same way that the bank treats other regulated financial service providers, for example in the monetary compliance with the Central Bank&rsquo;s regulations or codes of conduct.  This deals with the discussion we have been having here up to now.  I am talking about situations where providers breach financial services legislation by failing to pay the Central Bank levies on time or where they do not submit key information on the central credit register on time, or at all.  With the terms of the licences moving now from one to five years, these changes will bring the high-cost credit providers&rsquo; licences more in line with those of other financial service providers.</p><p>I have read the general note I have been provided on these amendments, which were grouped together for discussion.  I can go into more detail, if required, on the specifics.  As I say, amendment No. 4 is the substantive one.  The other three amendments are only there to ensure amendment No. 4 is properly inserted into the legislation.  </p><p>I will move on to amendment No. 4, which is the substantive one.  Section 93(10) of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 sets down the list of practices which the Central Bank can take into account when deciding whether to grant a high-cost credit provider's licence.  The items added to this list will mean that the provider must satisfy the bank that it will be able to comply with the requirements of being a licensed high-cost credit provider, and a regulated financial service provider more generally, and that it will conduct its business in such a way as to ensure the protection of its customers - which is new - and in compliance with any other requirements considered necessary by the bank for the proper and orderly regulation and supervision of high-cost credit and the protection of the applicant&rsquo;s customers.  This legislation is, therefore, very strong on customer protection, which the Central Bank will have a role in now when the providers proceed to the renewal of a particular licence.</p><p>Finally, section 93 deals with the factors considered when suspending or revoking a licence.  The Central Bank will now be able to take into account whether the high-cost credit provider has failed or is failing to comply with any condition or requirement under the financial services regulation.  The Central Bank will now clearly have authority to be able to amend or revoke a licence during the course of the five-year period.  The other two amendments are minor, relatively speaking.</p></speech>

While the Central Bank, through the Minister of State&rsquo;s amendment which I welcome, is allowed to revoke or refuse a licence midstream, I encourage it to apply this provision where this has happened.  I have made the point before that I accompanied whistleblowers to the Central Bank which led to quite a significant fine - a six-figure sum - against Provident Personal Credit for practices in which it was involved in my constituency.  The company never lost its licence.  The Central Bank has to be feared, particularly when we are moving from a one-year licensing regime to a five-year regime.</p></speech>

The term of the licence changing will bring high-cost credit provider licences more in line with existing Central Bank licensing arrangements for other types of regulated financial service providers.  The Deputy might say that this is a particular case because of the clientele involved, but the reason we have done it is to be consistent with other licensing agreements that the Central Bank would normally issue.  They are usually for five years.  That is the norm that is coming in under this Central Bank regulation now.  We are taking the norm.  That said, I accept the separate point that the Deputy makes.</p></speech>

It would also separate cash loans from loans provided on a running account.  The new interest rate as it applies to cash loans would be as follows: a simple interest rate of no more than 0.75% per week up to a maximum of 36% per annum for a period of three years, to be known as the initial cap; a simple interest of no more than 0.035% per week up to a maximum of 18% per annum after a period of three years, which would be known as the further reduced cap.</p><p>The impact of this cap for borrowers with reference to the interest charged on a &euro;1,000 cash loan by a credit union and by the largest money lender operating in the State is significant.  Currently, on a &euro;1,000 loan over a 12-month period, a credit union charges interest of &euro;60 while a money lender, for the same loan over the same period, would charge &euro;560 in interest.  The initial cap that I am proposing for a three year period would reduce that &euro;560 down to &euro;360 but would substantially reduce it further after the three year period down to &euro;180.  The initial cap would be six times that which the credit union would apply but, as we get to the second step, it would be three times what the credit union would charge.  Crucially for the moneylender, the total interest payable does not include the impact of collection charges, which obviously have pushed up the cost of credit further in the past.</p><p>I argued strongly on this when my own legislation was before the House but unfortunately, the Minister voted against all sections of that Bill.  We have tweaks in some of the sections of this Bill to the licences of moneylenders, which I broadly support, but when we get down to the meat and bones of this legislation, what the Government is legislating for is to allow high-cost credit but with a warning on the label.  It is like phoning people up to tell them that they are going to get robbed in the next half an hour.  The Government is just letting them know that they are going to get robbed but what I want to do is stop the burglar coming through the door in the first place.  This amendment would still allow for substantial profits to be made on these types of loans, which have been described by others during the pre-legislative scrutiny process as immoral.  It would still allow for high interest rates to be charged, specifically in the initial period but I would argue that a step-down approach is the more appropriate way to deal with this and to bring it into line, with reference to credit union lending.  The initial cap of six times the credit union rate and then three times the rate in the further cap is appropriate.  I commend the amendment to the select committee.</p></speech>

I know that Deputy Doherty has a great interest in this legislation and I can see where he is coming from with his proposal.   Lower interest rates are better for consumers.  The key purpose of this legislation is to reduce interest rates.  Deputy Doherty will say that Government is not being ambitious enough, but we have to strike a balance and reduce rates without reducing access to credit.  We can reduce rates right down but we might not have any companies providing credit if it is not viable from their point of view.  We want to make sure that the people we are talking about have access to credit.  If we make it unviable for providers, then people will not have access to credit except through the illegal moneylenders that we all want them to avoid.  There is a balance to be struck between reducing the rate and making sure that we keep lenders in the market.  We are looking at a substantial reduction from where we were previously.  We need to do this in a balanced, responsible way.</p> <p>  There is currently a concentration of loan offerings between 1% and 1.2% per week in the market.  Most of the loans tend to be in that bracket.  An initial interest rate cap of 1% per week will allow moneylenders operating at rates above the limit to revise their business model and reduce their margins to enable them to operate within the legislative cap.  This is not the ultimate destination but it is the right place to start.  The legislation also sets down the principles and policies to guide the Minister when making regulations to set the specific caps going forward.  This provides flexibility to amend the caps downwards while ensuring that there is always an upper limit in the primary legislation.  We are starting with 1% but the legislation specifically allows for that cap to be reduced.  It cannot go above 1%, but it can be reduced.  What we are saying is that at the point of introducing this legislation, we want the rate to be 1% but we are not precluding, after a couple of years when the Central Bank has monitored its operation closely, reducing that further.  That is provided for in the Bill.</p> <p>  Deputy Doherty's proposal is to have the reduced rate now, but I would be fearful that if we go too low too quickly this will lead to fewer people offering credit.  Furthermore, to fix the reduction in primary legislation without any assessment by the Central Bank of how the legislation is operating would not be good practice.  We are starting with 1% per week, with the commitment that it can be reviewed when we get some information from the Central Bank as to how this is operating.  It may be appropriate to reduce the rate at that stage.  This is a maximum cap and represents a reasonable and balanced approach.  I understand where Deputy Doherty is coming from, but we are clear about the way we want to do this.  It is a very big step from where we are to go down to 1%, with the option of going further at a later date, on foot of information from the Central Bank, without the need to revisit the primary legislation</p></speech>

Over a 12-month period, the APR comes down to about 1.57%.  The interest it would have charged on a &euro;1,000 loan was &euro;560.  The Minister of State is proposing to bring that down to &euro;480.  That is an improvement but it still immoral.  The fact that the Minister of State is asking us to legislate to allow for these types of high-cost loans is problematic.  Many moneylenders do not even charge that rate at this point in time; some of them are below that.  It is crazy that the Government is suggesting that we would say that charging this level of interest is legally permissible.  The Minister of State claimed in the D&aacute;il Chamber that this legislation would reduce the APR on a 12-month loan to 48%.  Does he wish to correct that?  </p></speech>

The Minister of State is saying we need to strike a balance; that if we reduce it too much, we could scare people out of the market.  He mentioned Provident has withdrawn.  What calculations has he done to suggest that rate is the appropriate rate?  All of the experts, including the Social Finance Foundation, have told us that this rate should be reduced further.  They have told us that what we need to try and do is funnel people into It Makes Sense loans in the credit union and the basic loans from the credit union as well.</p></speech>

Part of our work here is to encourage people to go to credit unions as well.  Deputy Doherty and I often have discussions on credit unions.  It is something that we would support, but this legislation is introducing a cap at this stage and what Deputy Doherty is calling for is provided for in the legislation.  The rate can reduce to the rate the Deputy is talking about, but we are saying it will just not happen on day one.  We are starting with the 1% per week and it can go down, but the view in the Department of Finance in bringing forward the legislation is that we would like to see the operation of the 1% per week for a period and get information from the Central Bank, and if it feels that the industry could continue to operate at a lower rate, this legislation specifically provides for a reduction to the rate Deputy Doherty has signposted.  Our only point of difference is we are saying we want to stick with the 1% on day one.  It is a reduction from where we were.  None of us like to see the high rates that have been in place, but we are on a road whereby we can reduce the rates at a further date.  The principal point of difference is we are saying we will start with the 1% cap now, which is an improvement for most people who are getting loans, and there is scope for a reduction when we get more information from the Central Bank reporting on how the operators are complying with the new legislation.  There is scope by means of a statutory instrument to make a change at a later date without having to come back with primary legislation.</p></speech>

The view is that if the companies cannot charge 126% APR on a loan over a 12-month period that will scare the horses.  How has the Minister of State come to that view?  Was it the moneylenders that told him?</p></speech>

A rate of 126% APR is immoral.  There is no way I am voting for the legislation, especially at a time of pressure on workers and families.  The Minister of State is saying that instead of them charging &euro;560 interest on a &euro;1,000 loan, we are going to legislate for them to charge &euro;480.  Jesus Christ, this Minister has got your backs, folks.  Interest of &euro;480 if people take out a &euro;1,000 loan is ridiculous.  I tabled this legislation years ago.  I have been frustrated at every stage.  The Government has made a dog's dinner of my legislation.  Every single amendment was deleted, bar the definitions.  The Government has frustrated this and come forward with the argument that it would bring a Bill itself which would be better.  It is absolutely terrible that the Government is going to allow moneylenders to charge this level of interest on people in society who are on very low incomes.  Those people are really pressed now because of all the issues in terms of inflation.  Where is the calculation?  The core of the issue is how the Minister of State came up with this figure.</p></speech>

The majority of loans are above this figure, and we are bringing it down.  That is only part of this debate.  Deputy Doherty has studiously not dealt with the other issue.  The existing legislation allows for the cost of door to door collection to be charged as well.  That is being abolished in this legislation.  What I am saying to people in this situation is that up to now they were paying a very high interest rate and they were also being charged a fee for door-to-door collection, which in many cases was even in excess of the cost of interest.  We are eliminating that cost entirely.  Moneylenders cannot charge for door-to-door collection.  That is a very significant element of this legislation.</p> <p>  The interest rate is a further enhancement for customers.  As I stated previously, this legislation sets the cap at 48% - 1% per week.  That is the maximum in the legislation and there is clear provision for that to be reduced at a further date if the circumstances warrant when we see the operation of this Act and the report from the Central Bank on how it is being implemented.  The legislation provides specifically for reduction at a later date.  I understand that the Deputy is in opposition to the legislation as proposed, but the essential difference between us is that we are saying we are abolishing the charges for door-to-door collection, which is a very significant issue, and we are introducing a cap which will immediately reduce interest rates for the majority of people who have loans from high-cost lenders.  In addition, we are providing for a further reduction in the interest rate to be made in due course, depending on how the legislation operates.  We need to give it a bit of time to see how it operates.</p></speech>

Is there any evidence?  The Minister of State has said half of the moneylenders will not be affected by the Bill because their charges are below the maximum rate and half are above it and they will be affected.  The core point that he made is that this would scare people off.  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party believe that if lenders cannot charge &euro;480 on a &euro;1,000 loan, then there is no market for them in Ireland, so we need to allow these companies to be able to charge that level of interest.  How did the Minister of State come up with that figure?  How did he come up with &euro;480, as opposed to what I am proposing here for the first three years, which is &euro;360 or some number in between?  Where did &euro;480 come from?</p></speech>

What I want to achieve in this legislation is that we have lenders that people will be able to go to, rather than go to illegal moneylenders.  It is essential that we keep the option open for moneylenders to be able to lend money even at the reduced rate we will allow, because if it is eliminated by companies not being in the market, people will only have the option to go to illegal moneylenders.  We want to make sure that we have that option available.  We could bring it down to 20% and have nobody in this market, but that would be a worst-case scenario.</p> <p>  In May 2019, the Department of Finance launched a public consultation process to gather views from stakeholders on whether the Government should introduce a statutory interest rate cap on moneylenders in Ireland, along with other regulatory matters.  The majority of submissions received were in favour of the introduction of an interest rate cap.  These submissions were primarily received from non-governmental organisations and credit unions.  All of the comments and submissions made through this consultation process have been considered and taken into account, as appropriate, in formulating the proposed policy options.</p> <p>  What we did say is we are striking a balance to make sure, first, that we are eliminating the charge for door to door collection, which is a significant feature; second, we are reducing the rate that is being charged on the majority of loans; third, it is a maximum cap that can be reduced at a further date.  We have taken all those factors into account to make sure we have people who will lend money at this rate.  There are only a couple of dozen companies operating in the country.  This is a balanced approach to achieve those three objectives.  It is not only looking at one side of the equation.  I have mentioned the other side of the equation and the reduction in fees the companies can charge in terms of not being able to charge for calling door to door.</p></speech>

He has failed to tell this committee how he came up with an annual percentage rate, APR, of 126% for moneylenders for a &euro;1,000 loan over 12 months.  He has acknowledged that the submissions called for a reduced rate and that the experts in the field are all critical of the level of interest the Minister of State is going to allow to be charged.  There is no empirical evidence to say that, if we go below this rate, businesses will somehow be scared off and will not provide credit in Ireland.</p></speech>

I will not be guided by that body and I do not agree with a lot of what it says but its key point is that it is important to keep this industry and these lenders in the market.  Achieving that is a question of balance.  It is not a scientific issue.  It is about striking a balance and keeping lenders in the market so they can lend money at a rate that allows them to cover their costs.  It is also about making sure those who charge door-to-door collection fees are not allowed to do so.  This 1% is a first step.  We are not precluding a reduction of this rate at a future date.  Let us start with this 1% for now as a balanced and responsible measure.  When we get information from the Central Bank on the implementation and operation of the legislation, we can revisit it.  The 1% can be changed very quickly by statutory instrument when we have that information.  I would not like to make that move without information as to how the new legislation is operating, however.  There is a net point of difference here.</p></speech>

It is my understanding that sections 2 and 3 relate to the deduction by insurers of Covid-19 related State supports for final business interruption insurance claim settlements.  We are all quite aware of how difficult Covid-19 has been for businesses and the impact it has had.  The fact that people had to use that business interruption insurance shows the impact it had.  The Central Bank informed my party in written correspondence in May last year that more than &euro;163 million had been paid out to in excess of 5,000 policyholders through settled claims and interim payments.  Over the course of the pandemic, it became apparent that insurance companies were deducting the value of State supports provided to firms during the pandemic from the value of the business interruption payouts.  That came as a major concern to businesses.  The reality is many of the insurance companies thrived during the pandemic.</p><p>These payments were made to assist the businesses, not big insurance companies.  I am seeking an update on this because this section deals with it.  I also have a question on sections 3 and 4 relating to the database, but perhaps the Minister of State can give an update on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#K00200"><p>This is an important new section in the legislation regarding deducting the value of State supports.  That issue became apparent as the Covid-19 situation emerged.  There is a general misunderstanding among the public because many of the insurance companies had said they would not deduct any payments the State had made from any payments they would be making under business interruption policies.  Many people felt that all that funding was going to come back to the State.  However, what the companies that made those statements did not say is that the vast majority of them had no business interruption policies to start with.  When they knew they had no business interruption policies, it was very easy to make a statement that they would not deduct any State payments from any payments they might be making because they were making no payments anyway.  That point has not been picked up fairly across the industry.  I am putting it on the record now because a narrative about this issue has carried through in that respect.  With regard to the figure the Deputy mentioned, most of that relates to one particular company.  Most of the other companies that have spoken on this in various public venues said they would not be deducting from any of this because they were not providing business interruption policies to start with.  I want to make that clear.  They were correct in what they said, but people did not fully grasp the subtlety of what they were saying.</p> <p>  When this issue arose and it came to our attention during the course of the pandemic that the limited number of insurance companies that had business interruption policies were deducting some of the State payments so that the business or sometimes sole traders, if they were publicans or restaurateurs, would receive the net loss, there was concern in the Department and the Government that the insurance companies might make a profit from the State supports.  We immediately examined this matter closely with a view to dealing with it, but it became clear from legal advice that it was not possible to legislate retrospectively.  Bear in mind that these policies might have been written before the Covid-19 pandemic and these payments happened during it.  When we saw this happening, it was not possible to come back and change a policy that was written 18 months or two years previously because it was a legal document.  It was not possible to look back retrospectively to claim payments in respect of policies that were issued and in existence before that.</p> <p>  The issue that arises then, and I would put this down as one of the big lessons from Covid, is that we saw what happened.  The reason we are introducing these sections is so we can gather information on these supports, and if any other situation arises in the future, we will have a base to work from and to understand how it works.  It might not be related to Covid.  Some other issue could arise in the country where there is an insurance policy and the State is also supplementing some of the cost.  This is a forward-looking legislative measure and it is important that it be seen in that context.</p> <p>  I will make another point.  The reason I looked at this at that stage was that I was conscious that, under the Department of Social Protection, other State payments may be relevant to insurance claims.  There already are processes in place.  We already had legislation in place dating back many years strictly to deal with what is known as the recovery of benefits and assistance scheme by the Department of Social Protection.  I will explain it simply.  Let us say somebody was in a car accident and he or she was out of work for a significant period and received disability payments for a period.  Then the insurance company settles the claim in due course.  It estimates the value of the person's claim at &euro;100,000, for example, but the person has already received &euro;20,000 from the State.  If the company pays out the &euro;100,000 there is a legal mechanism in place for the insurance company to refund that &euro;20,000 back to the State.  That happens currently.  Ultimately, we want to get to that situation across the board, but the first thing we must do is gather information on this.</p> <p>  On the up-to-date figure I have in respect of business interruption policies, the Central Bank has stated that a number of insurers accepted and commenced settling claims as a result of the Central Bank's intervention.  I welcome recent data to the end of February 2022 which show that more than &euro;171 million has been paid to 5,312 policyholders through settled claims and interim payments.  This is up from the earlier figure.</p> <p>  Another point is that this matter is still before the courts, so the matter may yet come to light as part of the quantum hearing in ongoing litigation that remains before the courts.  The approach of the Bill is designed to ensure we do not pre-empt any legal ruling by passing legislation at this stage before the relevant court cases are dealt with.  This issue may be raised during those quantum hearings which are not yet concluded.  From that point of view, I am precluded from saying anything further on this because, as people will appreciate, the matter is currently before the courts.</p> <p>  However, this is really a lesson learned for the future.  We want to have a cross-government approach.  We already have it in the Department of Social Protection and, ultimately, I would like to see this in any Department where a similar situation could arise in the future.  The first thing that must be done is gather the information so the Central Bank will be able to give us information.  When we get that information we can then look at policy implications and draw up legislation in due course.</p></speech>

There is a precedent in social protection legislation which, in my view, is probably the model we should follow, but we need information about what happened during Covid before we can draft any proposal.  We have to gather the information first.  I have an open mind, but my instinct is no insurance company should profit on any State supports, and I believe there would be a unanimous view in the House on that.</p></speech>

Sections 5 and 6 relate to the issue of dual pricing.  Unfortunately, this practice is where companies are identifying loyal but often vulnerable customers who might not have the ability to look around insurance companies and are less likely to shop around, but are also more than likely more sensitive to price changes and so forth.  It is often recognised that price gouging undermines the interests of loyal customers, and this has long been talked about in the House.</p><p>Indeed, it is something a lot of customers talk about a lot as well.  It is welcome that the Central Bank is taking action in regard to banning price discrimination.  This is clearly something Deputy Pearse Doherty has been campaigning on for a long number of years and, in fact, he submitted a complaint as far back as October 2019.</p><p> What is important is that when regulations come into force, they are kept under constant review.  We know that the Central Bank had previously found that 2.5 million customers were paying a combined &euro;187 million more than the actual cost of their policies, which is very significant.  Can the Minister of State advise in regard to keeping these regulations under constant review, if that will be happening and how he sees that going forward?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.158" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1590" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2022051100002#L00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for her constructive comments.  I acknowledge the role of her party colleague, Deputy Doherty, in dealing with this topic over a period of time.</p> <p>  We had complicated issues with price walking and dual pricing, and they were connected issues but subtly different in their own way.  What is happening here is that we are dealing with this issue as part of the programme for Government and the action plan for insurance across all Departments.  To put the insurance plan in context, the relevant committee is chaired by the T&aacute;naiste, so the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is involved, as is the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and I am also involved from the Department of Finance because insurance is a regulated industry.  The committee also involves the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and, in particular, the Minister for Justice because much of the legislation comes from the Department of Justice with regard to insurance.  It is a whole-of-government approach.</p> <p>  In dealing with the action plan for insurance, all the bodies I have mentioned have different roles on different aspects, different legislation comes from the Department of Justice, and State agencies like the Central Bank have a key role in implementing some of the measures.  The Department of Finance has put forward this Bill and we also helped bring forward legislation on the personal injuries guidelines six months earlier than had originally been envisaged.  Right across that committee, different sections of the State are doing different operations.</p> <p>  In this section, what we have is an acknowledgement that the Central Bank has agreed to implement this from 1 July for dual pricing only.  That is in regard to motor policies, whereby people should get a price equivalent to that of a new customer.  We have had what we call the loyalty penalty, whereby people who are with an insurance company and never seek to move to another company may well have been paying too much for not doing that.  After nine years, they would be paying a penalty of about 12% or 14%.  The issue in the house insurance market is even more serious and, after nine years, some people are paying up to 34% over and above what they would be paying if they were a new customer going into the same insurance company to insure the same house for the same value.</p> <p>  That is extraordinary but understandable.  Just around Leinster House, I have asked people which company their house insurance is with and they reply that they got their house insurance when they took out their mortgage, and they are not exactly sure.  Very few people query their house insurance because it just goes through as part of the mortgage payment.  For that reason, I think insurance companies have abused the situation and loyal customers, and they were adding a small percentage, year by year, knowing people would never check it.  I encourage people to find out which company their house insurance is with in the first place, and to make sure they make the phone call at the next renewal date.</p> <p>  From 1 July, this practice is going to be outlawed by the Central Bank.  The amendment in this section arises because the Department of Finance has insisted that the Central Bank will not just do it, because it will do it, but that it will produce a report within a set timeframe of one year after the coming into being of the Act, or as quickly as possible thereafter.  I am sure that report will be published by the Central Bank directly as well.  We have asked for some interim information after a six-month period to see the effect of this change.  There is no point in something happening if we do not have the evidence to track it.  Our role here is to make sure there is a reporting mechanism back into the system.  This practice has been ongoing for ages and it is now coming to an end.  We want the evidence and the proof that it is coming to an end.  That is why we have this section to make sure there is a clear report from the Central Bank in regard to those areas.</p> <p>  We are the first country in the EU to introduce this price walking ban.  Other countries in the EU have been talking about it and England has commenced a similar but slightly different approach, but we are the first country in the EU to introduce this.  This is to ensure the Central Bank comes back to us next year with the hard information and then, like everything else, when we get the information, we will be in a position to take whatever policy decisions are required.  I expect that, given the fact the Central Bank is outlawing the practice straightaway from 1 July, we will see reductions in those cases for loyal, long-standing customers.</p></speech>

Many people imagine that if they are loyal to a company, it will be loyal to them and will support them and make sure they get the best deal.  Unfortunately, we often find out that simply is not the case.  What the Minister of State said in regard to home insurance is particularly shocking.  If an insurance company is caught still doing this, do we know what kind of penalties will apply?</p></speech>

Until now, it has been quite legal for them to do it and there is no provision against this abuse of customers&rsquo; loyalty.  It is shocking that the insurance companies were doing that for years.  That is why this is now coming to a head.  The Central Bank has the regulatory powers to deal with the issue.  In regard to the companies, the Central Bank can seek information, it can do audits and, as with previous issues, it will write to the chief executives to correct this.  It has powers in regard to the licences of these companies to ensure they comply with good practice and consumer protection.  The Central Bank itself would be the sanctioning body with the insurance companies because it is the regulator, not the Department of Finance.</p></speech>

In order to protect consumers&rsquo; interests, section 11 amends the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015.</p><p> These amendments will provide for technical changes in order to address two issues identified by the Central Bank of Ireland and relating to the scope of an insurance temporary run-off regime for UK- and Gibraltar-authorised insurers.  This arises directly as a result of Brexit.  The temporary run-off regime was established to facilitate the orderly withdrawal of UK- and Gibraltar-authorised insurers from the Irish market following the departure of the UK from the EU in order to protect almost 35,000 policyholders.  Those companies provided insurance policies to 35,000 policyholders but are now withdrawing from the market because of Brexit.  The aim was to enable such firms to continue to service their existing portfolio of business for up to 15 years in order to ensure service continuity of those insurance contracts for existing Irish policyholders.  Other EU member states also introduced similar provisions.</p><p> Section 11 provides for the following changes to the scope of the temporary run-off scheme.  First, it amends the 2015 regulation to provide that UK and Gibraltar firms in the temporary run-off regime that are in the process of running off their existing insurance liabilities in the State may provide third-party reinsurance business here.  This change will align the temporary run-off regime with the provisions of the 2015 regulations whereby third-country undertakings can carry on reinsurance activities in the State, provided that they satisfy certain conditions.  This should also assist to preserve reinsurance capacity in the Irish market.   This is to facilitate the wind-down in an orderly manner.</p><p> Section 11 further amends the 2015 regulations to enable firms in liquidation that otherwise satisfy the conditions of the temporary run-off regime but may have had their authorisation withdrawn under the law in the UK or Gibraltar prior to the UK&rsquo;s departure from the EU to enter into the regime and run-off their Irish insurance portfolio in order to terminate their activity in the State.  This is a separate provision to deal with insurance companies that have gone into liquidation and will not be continuing in the long term.  This is necessary as the current wording of the 2015 regulations makes it a condition of entry to the temporary run-off scheme that the entity was, immediately before the relevant date, authorised as an insurance undertaking under the law in the UK or Gibraltar.  However, some firms in liquidation may have had their authorisation withdrawn before 2021 on the opening of the winding-up of the proceedings and, therefore, would not otherwise be able to enter the temporary run-off scheme.  It is important to note that these changes to the 2015 regulations merely reflect what was the original policy intent behind the temporary run-off scheme.  The amendments will not give UK- or Gibraltar-based insurance firms any competitive advantage over firms based in Ireland or elsewhere in the EU or EEA.  As it is an issue relating to dates, we were concerned that these firms would be captured.  It may be the case that some companies that were in liquidation and had their authorisation withdrawn before 1 January may not otherwise be able to fully avail of this temporary run-off scheme.  There is no change in policy; it is just a clarification of an issue relating to dates.</p></speech>

The Minister is joined by Mr. John O'Donoghue, legal representative for the HSE, Ms Mary Brosnan, director of nursing and midwifery, Professor Mary Higgins, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, Dr. Rhona Mahony, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane, chairperson of the HSE board, Ms Ita O'Sullivan, legal representative for the HSE, Mr. Dean Sullivan, chief strategy officer for the HSE, and Mr. Paul de Freine, head of estates for the HSE.  They are all very welcome.</p> <p>  Members and guests are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If, therefore, their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  I remind members that today's meeting concerns the proposed new national maternity hospital and ask them to stick to that theme rather than raise other issues with the Minister and his officials.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.192" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051100002#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend and for the opportunity to discuss the proposal for the new national maternity hospital.  I am joined by Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane, chairperson of the HSE board, Professor Mary Higgins, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, Ms Mary Brosnan, director of midwifery and nursing at the National Maternity Hospital, and consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Dr. Rhona Mahony, who knows the history of this project like few others and who negotiated the initial Mulvey agreement and can speak to that.  I am also joined by Ms Ita O'Sullivan and Mr. John O'Donoghue, members of the HSE's legal team for this project.</p> <p>  While there is good, proper and important debate about this issue, I believe we all agree on many of the important issues relating to this project.  First, clinicians at the National Maternity Hospital, NMH, provide excellent care to women and infants and have been leaders in modernising women&rsquo;s healthcare.  Second, a new and modern hospital building is urgently needed for the National Maternity Hospital and services for women need to be expanded there.  Third, the new hospital should be built beside a major adult hospital to ensure women will have access to the widest possible range of healthcare.  Fourth, the new hospital must be fully clinically independent and there must be no religious influence, now or in the future.  Fifth, the new hospital must provide all services and all procedures that are permissible under law.  Finally, the State&rsquo;s investment must be protected.</p> <p>  The proposal we are discussing meets all of these goals.  This is a partnership between the State, the National Maternity Hospital and St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group.  The National Maternity Hospital will provide all the clinicians, who will move from Holles Street to the new building, and the National Maternity Hospital will run the new hospital.  The State will fund the construction of the new hospital building and retain full ownership of the building as an asset, while St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group will provide lease ownership to the State for 300 years.  Each party will appoint three directors to the new board of the NMH, and the NMH will, in turn, appoint directors to the board of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group.  The two hospitals will be physically connected to ensure seamless access to care for patients, which is especially important for critically ill patients.  Both hospitals will provide shared services to be used throughout the healthcare campus.  Many clinicians will work in both hospitals, as they do now.</p> <p>  A structure was agreed in the 2016, namely, the Mulvey agreement, whereby the shares in the NMH charitable company will be owned by the St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group charitable company.  This provides St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group with some administrative rights relating to, for example, accepting annual accounts at general meetings and approving the appointment of auditors.  The national maternity hospital will be fully clinically, operationally and financially independent.  It will have its own constitution and its own operating licence with the HSE.  All procedures that are currently carried out at the National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street will be provided at the new national maternity hospital.  The new hospital will provide all maternity, gynaecology, obstetric and neonatal services that are legally permissible.  These include, but are not limited to, terminations, tubal ligations and gender-reaffirming procedures.  Religious involvement in St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has ended with the transfer of shares.  Religious involvement in the National Maternity Hospital will also end.  For example, the chairperson of the National Maternity Hospital since its foundation has been the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin.  Religious influence of any kind is expressly prohibited in the new national maternity hospital.  There is no mechanism for any religious involvement, now or at any time in the future, in either St. Vincent's Healthcare Group or the new national maternity hospital.</p> <p>  Ireland does not have a good track record when it comes to religion and women&rsquo;s reproductive health.</p><p>It has a poor and dark history.  Women are, therefore, rightly demanding that when it comes to our new national maternity hospital there can be no religious involvement whatsoever at any point, now or into the future.  Women and, indeed, men are right to demand that.  People for very understandable reasons are demanding absolute assurances that all legally permissible services are provided, and they are right to make that demand.  All of these services are provided in Holles Street today.  The same clinicians, some of whom are here today, are going to provide these new services in the new hospital.</p><p> Concerns are understandably being raised and questions are being asked about land ownership and other issues.  I look forward to discussing these issues with the committee.  I also look forward to hearing from the people who provide the services in Holles Street.  Those of us who campaigned for repeal of the eighth amendment said we must listen to the midwives, nurses and doctors working in our maternity hospitals.  That is what I asked people to do in Wicklow when I walked up and down the streets and knocked on doors week after week.  Some of those same clinicians are with us today.  I hope that on this important issue, we will once again listen to the midwives, nurses and doctors working in our maternity services and providing these services.</p></speech>

I believe this ultimately comes down to a deep-seated mistrust of institutional Ireland based on an appalling track record in our country when it comes to the church and women's reproductive health.  Ultimately, I think that is what this boils down to, and I understand that.  It has, therefore, been incumbent upon four Ministers for Health - my predecessors, Dr. James Reilly, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Leo Varadkar and the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and me - and two Governments to make sure those concerns are addressed absolutely and the new hospital we set up not only provides all of the guarantees and services that are needed, but gives space to expand the provision of those services and many other women's healthcare services, including maternity, obstetrics, fertility and gynaecology.  I ask for a response to the Deputy's question, because it goes to the heart of everything we are doing here, from some of the clinicians who are working and providing the services.</p></speech>

I agree with the Minister.  Ireland has been through a lot.  When we look back at the history of women's health in particular and the interplay between church and State, it has been very difficult for women.  It has had a profound impact on women's health and lives.  We are now moving forward into a different Ireland.  We have seen huge advances in the past ten years.  The campaign for the repeal of the eighth amendment was a real moment for me.  I remember attending a meeting of a health committee, just like this one, in 2013 when I was pretty much a lone voice.  I was not as lonely as all the women who had gone to Europe to fight their cases on their own.  By 2018, we had all come together and we had a movement and could talk about and express what happened to women.  That was a pivotal point in our history in terms of moving forward in women's health.</p> <p>  With this project, we are moving forward again.  We are saying goodbye to the church completely.  There is no religious ethos pertaining in St. Vincent's hospital.  There is a complete separation.  We are moving forward and leaving that behind.  However, we are moving forward in a different way.  The vision for this hospital is a vision of enormous possibility for what we can give to women in this country.  It is not just about the old facilities in Holles Street where women are crowded into tiny wards and long 14-bed wards, where we do not have an intensive care unit, ICU, or high-dependency unit, HDU, where babies are crammed into units in which their parents cannot be with them and where there are no toilets and a lack of showers.  We have heard a great deal about this.  The new facility is going to be magnificent.  We will have a facility where the tiniest citizens in the State, babies as small as 23 weeks and weighing 500 g, will be in a magnificent, dedicated pre-term birth centre and their parents can stay with them and be involved in their care.  A neonatal intensive care unit is a really scary place.  We know this has much better outcomes for babies.  We will have proper labour rooms.  We will give expression to the maternity strategy in terms of having all that choice for women, with midwifery-led birthing units, birthing pools and beautiful rooms.  Women will have dignified, single-room accommodation across the whole building.  We will have proper operating theatres.  The key here is that those operating theatres will link into St. Vincent's hospital, the very place we need them to link into, and also into the hospitals ICU and HDU, which Holles Street does not have at the moment.</p> <p>  It is much more than that, however.  I think the piece we have missed is what is on the campus of St. Vincent's hospital.  Women have been hearing a lot and have been worried that the services available to them will be restricted.  It is quite the opposite.  We will be hugely increasing services.  The St. Vincent's hospital campus deals with 150,000 inpatient and day-patient cases every year.  There are 50 clinical specialties, more than 200 consultants and 5,000 staff delivering a whole gamut of healthcare services which will be available for women.  The hospital already cares for 500 women with breast cancer every year who are treated there.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.199" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Rhona Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051100002#D00700"><p>I absolutely do not, for two main reasons.  The first is the series of protections that are built into the legal framework that has arisen out of Kieran Mulvey's work.  This is a series of documents that creates layer after layer of protection.  The NMH DAC is a separate company and separate legal entity, which is very important.  In the course of our conversation, I would like an opportunity to go through in detail all of those layers that give us those protections.</p> <p>  In parallel, St. Vincent's hospital is now a secular organisation.  There is no link to the church.  That is over and gone.  When the share transfer was completed, it marked the end of any association with the Religious Sisters of Charity and any association with religion.  We are now a secular organisation and the constitutions of St. Vincent's Holdings, the holding company that holds the shares, and the operating company, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, are published in full on the website.  There is no vehicle or mechanism through which any religious ethos, any Catholic ethos, can be imposed.  That is terribly important.</p></speech>

If we look in particular at termination of pregnancy care, the vast majority who attend us are fit, healthy and well.  There is a significant proportion who have medical conditions where I then have to talk to the clinicians in St. Vincent's hospital who give that advice without any issue.  They do so appropriately, kindly and respectfully.  There have been women who have required termination of pregnancy care on the physical campus of St. Vincent's hospital without any issue from the clinicians or management and administrative staff.  I have provided that care.  That is why I am confident we can do it.</p></speech>

We are interested, of course, because we want to provide the care.  We have had to satisfy ourselves.  We appreciate that people want to ask questions because they are concerned and worried.  We are satisfied with the arrangement.  We hope the effect of this debate will be that everybody else in the country will be satisfied as well and that they realise this is the best thing.  It is the greatest investment in women's health that the country has ever made.  It is a massive step forward.  As Dr. Mahony says, it is a massive step forward for midwifery and nursing medicine so we can provide care to women, pregnant people and neonates.  We totally support this.</p></speech>

Depending on who one talks with, the cost may be &euro;10 per annum for a certain number of years, &euro;800,000 or &euro;600,000, or whatever the case may be.  Could our guests shed some light on where that conflicting information is coming from?  Can they tell the committee from a legal point of view, which is it?</p></speech>

The short answer is that the cost will be &euro;10 per year for the next 300 years.  There are conditions on that.  The conditions are that we, the State, remain as the tenant running healthcare services there.  By agreement, that can be changed but essentially once we are running our hospital on the site, that is that.  There is a condition that we do not look to acquire freehold ownership of the site.  We are entering into an agreement on a leasehold ownership basis.  That is securing that in times to come, this will still be a maternity hospital providing great care.  I will ask Mr. O'Donoghue to come in and add to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.210" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Donoghue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051100002#E00800"><p>There is a clause in the lease which, as the Minister has said, provides that there is a commercial rent which will be abated to &euro;10 per annum as long as the HSE complies with certain conditions.  That is clearly set out in clause 4 of the lease and those conditions are very clear.  Those conditions relate to the State continuing to provide public healthcare facilities from that building into the future and for the term of 299 years.  That protects both parties.  It protects St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, which owns the freehold interest in the site, to ensure that the State does not try to change the use of the facility to something else.  This facility will be state-of-the-art but in less than 299 years, it will need to be redeveloped, replaced and refurbished.  There is no guarantee that it will be required as a public hospital facility in the future so there is no reason for the State to have a freehold interest, or an interest into infinity, on that site.  There are other protections in that document to ensure that this facility, once constructed, and which the State, through the HSE, has full rights over is used for 299 years for public healthcare.</p></speech>

Before the Cabinet meeting, there was a lot of discussion.  Between us all, we agreed before the meeting that we all wanted to open the issue up and have these kinds of debates.</p></speech>

Is it paused on the basis that following hearings such as this one, there could be fresh discussions with St. Vincent's Holdings CLG or is it the view of the Minister that he will go back to Cabinet next week, after these meetings, to sign off on what could have been signed off on last week?</p></speech>

However, it is important that we listen.  It is important that this conversation happens.  I would not rule anything out.</p></speech>

Is this an exercise for the Minister to sell this deal?  He has the right to do that.  We were told this was an exercise in scrutiny.  Many people have concerns.  Is this discussion being held on the basis that this agreement is a <i>fait accompli</i>?  I have heard the Minister say he is listening.  It seems that on the basis of what the Taoiseach said in the D&aacute;il and in the media, and on the basis of what the Minister is telling me now, the intention is not to go back and renegotiate or discuss any changes.  The proposal will go to Cabinet next week and will be signed off.</p></speech>

It is his job to stand up for taxpayers and the interests of the State.  We know the view of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group as it has been expressed.  There are some holes in that argument and I will get to those in a moment.  However, my point is that before all of this, and this process has been going on for many years, the Religious Sisters of Charity wanted to gift the land to this entity as opposed to gifting it to the State.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group now owns the land.  It is free to do what it chooses with the land.  Am I correct that there is no legal impediment to St. Vincent's Healthcare Group gifting the land to the State?  If it wanted to do that, it could.</p></speech>

That is not contested, but we cannot then credibly argue that the State owns the land.  The group owns the land.  It could gift the land in its entirety to the State, which would remove the need for all the companies that have to be set up.  It would enable the HSE to build a HSE hospital on the land.</p> <p>  If other clinicians could not shake their heads when witnesses are speaking, it might be helpful.</p></speech>

The two HSE board members who dissented from the decision, Professor Deirdre Madden and Dr. Sarah McLoughlin, stated they "continued to have concerns regarding legal ownership of the site and building, and the governance and control of the proposed new maternity hospital" and this "led to our dissent from the Board's decision."  They go on to say: "The advantages of co-location could be achieved by contractual terms through which both hospitals agree to collaborate effectively[...]."  They then go on to say: "The statement from SVHG that they must retain ownership for the delivery of integrated patient care is unsatisfactory and runs contrary to the argument that the location of the underlying freehold ownership has no bearing on the governance [and] operation of the hospital."  It strikes me that this is about control by that group.  It does not want to give the State the land because it does not want a HSE hospital on that site.  As a result of that, we have ended up with a convoluted process, as I have discussed with the Minister in the D&aacute;il and elsewhere, of companies within companies.  I am not a legal expert but some such experts talk about phrases and language in the constitution that are ambiguous.  All of that is a product of the State not owning the land.  That is a fundamental problem.</p> <p>  I will make a point to the clinicians in the room.  I have no difficulty with clinicians arguing we need a new hospital.  We fully agree.  There is nobody in this room who does not want a new national maternity hospital.  I do not dispute that Holles Street is not fit for purpose.  The Rotunda Hospital is not fit for purpose.  Of course we need a new national maternity hospital but we have wider responsibilities.  We have to protect patients, clinicians and the interests of the taxpayer.  The taxpayer and the interests of patients and citizens are best protected by a public hospital on public land, rather than the convoluted process the Minister is presenting to us.</p></speech>

It is not an accurate characterisation of what is happening.  St Vincent's is not appointing board members to the new NMH because it owns the land.  Let us say a third party such as a developer in Dublin owned the land.  That developer would not be appointing board members to the new NMH.  This is a partnership and, as Dr. Mahony spoke to earlier, the reason the State, the NMH and St. Vincent's are all appointing members to the board is that this is a partnership.  One proof of that is that the NMH does not own the land under St. Vincent's but it is appointing board members to St. Vincent's.</p></speech>

I am stating the fact that we have companies within companies, several constitutions and directors coming from three different sources onto the new company being established.   The Minister cannot credibly argue this is not a complicated legal scenario when he looks at all the documents that were published and which we had to go through.  It is only complicated because the land is being gifted to the State.</p></speech>

It is complex.  Of course, an investment of, potentially, &euro;1 billion in a new healthcare campus is complex but the complexity and the governance structures are not based on the land.  As Mr. O'Donoghue has said, we have leasehold ownership of the land for the next 300 years.  The fact St. Vincent's has freehold ownership of the land and it reverts to it after 300 years is not why it is appointing directors or why we have the corporate structures we have.  We have all of this because we are entering into a partnership.</p></speech>

The HSE board got some publicity today.  Two voices demurred but there are 12 members of the board.  The bottom line is the board has approved this, regardless of why and how many members did so.  We have heard the views of Fergus Finlay as to why he supported it, but we did not get the view of the other eight or nine members as to why they supported it.  We got the views of the two who demurred and I respect them and thank them for making their submission to the committee.  For people watching, it is important to state the board of the HSE supports the move.</p><p>To give some of background on myself, an <i>ad hoc</i>cross-party group was established last year with some members from parties, including, from my party, me and one or two colleagues.  It was set up based on those people who had concerns about the move to the St. Vincent's hospital site.</p><p>I was a member of that group so that was where I was coming from.  I had concerns.  The time, energy and detailed interrogation of all the issues involved between last year and this year have been incredibly valuable.</p><p> I supported repeal of the eighth amendment and strongly supported women's right to choose and investment of trust in women to make the best decisions regarding their own health and bodies.  It is important to state that.  The Minister will agree that if we were starting today, everybody would want this hospital built on public land with public money but this process did not begin today.  It began in 2013 and he inherited it two years ago.  Will he give us a brief two- or three-minute summary of what he inherited and where he has taken it to? </p></speech>

My understanding is people have talked about this for decades.  Doctors hired by Holles Street in the 1960s were asked when they were going to move to co-locate with the adult hospital.  The process as we understand it now began in 2013 when the then Minister for Health, James Reilly, announced the intention to move.  This was on the back of a KPMG report, which he received.  In July of that year, the campus project board was established by the HSE and in 2015 a memo to Government on the relocation of the Coombe and the Rotunda, which we should talk about on another day, noted the recommendation that Holles Street should move to Elm Park, in effect.</p> <p>  In 2016, the Mulvey agreement was brought together.  My understanding is the negotiations were complex and at times difficult so Mr. Mulvey was brought in to chair that.  The Mulvey agreement was put together and, in essence, the corporate structures and what we see today came out of that agreement.  Dr. Mahony was involved in that and she may want to add her comments on it.  In 2017, there was a memo to Government from the then Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, with information on the relocation.  Planning permission was secured in 2017 and in 2018 there was another memo to Government on the relocation and agreement in principle on some of the key areas.  In 2018, the contract for the first phase was announced.  As the Deputy will be aware, significant works have already happened, such as pharmacies, car parks and so forth.</p> <p>  What changes have been made since then?  In essence, we have moved from a 99-year lease to a 299-year lease, or from 100 years to 300 years.  We have moved from one public interest director to three.  It was one-four-four; it is now three-three-three and, critically, we have written the constitution.  All parties have been involved in that.  The constitution is essential to all this because it is the operating manual and the legal instructions for how the NMH will work.  What we have done with it is very important.  We are not only guaranteeing clinical and operational independence through the constitution, which everyone has rightly demanded, we have gone much further, which I am advised by the Attorney General is either very rare or unique.  We are not just saying the new hospital can provide all services; we are saying it must provide all services.  We have said six times in the constitution there can never be any religious influence whatsoever.  The board of directors is obliged under its constitution to ensure all services are provided.  As a final certainty, the Minister for Health has the power to intervene at his or her discretion to ensure that all services are provided without any religious influence at all.  The three big changes are boards of directors, the lease and the constitution.</p> <p>  With permission, Mr. Devane will come in on the matter of the board.</p></speech>

For example, we wanted to see the transfer of shares come through.  We wanted to see some of the details on the duration of the lease consistently written into all the documents across the whole agreement.  The constitution was one of the things for which I pushed very hard.  It is the foundation document around protections for women, the independence of clinical decision-making, and making sure this will be the biggest and most exciting step forward and new hospital the HSE will build for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>  It is not just about moving location but increasing capacity.  Some 100 beds will increase to 150 so there will be more and better capacity.  It is to allow the innovations to take place, including things we do not really talk about, such as gynaecological mesh, menopausal clinics and so on.  Those services will be put in as well.  As a board, we saw all these amazing things we were doing.  We had very robust debates.  The conclusion we came to as a board was that there are sufficient protections for the things people are worried about and a tremendous opportunity to take a major step forward.  That was the decision of the board.</p></speech>

It is as if the ethos piece has been forgotten because it seems to have been dealt with successfully.  Ethos was a big issue two weeks ago for protagonists and opponents.  It seems all the concerns and queries around that have been satisfied.  Dr. Peter Boylan will be a witness tomorrow so I have no issue making this point when he is not here as he will have a chance to answer then.  One of his major points, repeated in today's newspaper, is no Catholic-ethos hospital in the world, including St. Vincent's public and private hospitals, permits terminations.  Do terminations take place at present in St. Vincent's Hospital?</p></speech>

I do not know if we are the first - that is not the point - but specifically in this case St. Vincent's Hospital is absolutely not a public juridic body.</p></speech>

Most of the emails I have had regarding this in the past one to two months, related to the justifiable and legitimate fear of women of church interference, or the interference of a religious ethos, in respect of any procedures they are entitled to under law.  We seem to have forgotten that very quickly because it has been dealt with.  All those fears and concerns that were raised have been very adequately dealt with to the point they are not being raised anymore.  It is now all about governance and ownership, but let us not forget the most significant points raised regarding the national maternity hospital were that all procedures and interventions necessary for women's health would be somehow jeopardised under this structure.  It is too convenient to now focus on saying it is all about ownership and governance.  Up to two weeks ago, it was about ethos, religious interference and no Catholic-run hospital in the world could provide X and Y.</p><p>Terminations take place in St. Vincent's hospital right now.  The public and women need to be aware of that, and not for the conversation to be contaminated by supposition, catastrophising, conspiracy building and all the rest of it.  Those are my questions.</p></speech>

I want to put on record that I dispute the points made by the previous questioner.  There has been a range of concerns that many of us have had for several years about this entire project.  It would be interesting just to get some figures on the earlier claim.  Perhaps they could be provided to us in relation to the provision of termination services.  My understanding is that those services are not provided in St. Vincent's in line with the 2018 Act.  If the situation is different to my understanding of it, perhaps we could be provided with figures in that regard.  I am not looking for personal details, only figures.</p> <p>  I go back to comments the Minister made in a earlier reply about the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday of last week.  He said the decision was taken to open up the issue prior to the Cabinet meeting.  That is hard to understand because I recall very clearly the Taoiseach, on his way into that Cabinet meeting, saying to the media that he was entirely satisfied with the proposals and had no concerns whatsoever.  Indeed, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, made a similar comment prior to the meeting.  At any rate, for one reason or another, the decision was taken to open this up.  Would the Minister accept that it would have been a better way of handling this matter to make the legal documents and all other relevant documents available so that people had adequate time to consider them, rather than trying to rush it through without those documents being available?</p></speech>

Considering the scale of this project and the amount of public money involved, would it not have been better if the Minister, prior to last Tuesday, had made those documents available?</p></speech>

We have had this debate in the D&aacute;il and Members in the Oireachtas, including Deputy Shortall, have very reasonably asked to see the detail.  Obviously, we have published all of the documents and we are now discussing the detail.  It is important though that Cabinet has sight of that as well.  Were we to release documents that Cabinet had not discussed, as I think we have all discussed in the D&aacute;il before, questions could arise around whether they represent the Government view or what exactly the detail represents.</p></speech>

By all accounts, the intention was to sign off on this last week at the Cabinet meeting.  As a result of the public outcry, thankfully the documents have now been made available.  Given the complexity of this whole project, including the documents, and to be fair about this and give people a reasonable amount of time - we have been given one week, not two weeks - to consider these complex documents, I ask the Minister if, in the interests of fairness, he is prepared to extend that period to allow further scrutiny?</p></speech>

I put it to the Minister that the first schedule of the lease agreement states in black and white that St. Vincent's Healthcare Group is the owner.  Section 4 of that agreement outlines that the site and the hospital are being leased to the State.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach says the phrase was inserted by the HSE to make sure it would not be a cardiology hospital, neurology hospital or whatever else.  That is to quote his words.</p><p>However, the so-called "fact sheet" that was circulated among Fine Gael backbenchers stated that the HSE will grant an operating licence to the national maternity hospital at Elm Park DAC to run the new maternity hospital and also to St. Vincent&rsquo;s, which will deliver some other health services in the hospital such as dermatology.  Can the Minister explain what that means because it has been put to us, when we query that phase, "clinically appropriate", that is to clarify that it is maternity related services?

We are just future-proofing for procedures, diagnoses and issues that we do not know about yet.  Forty years ago, the most common form of contraception in Ireland was the Billings method.  Nowadays we have multiple forms of contraception - I am very glad of that - many of which we provide for free for women who are attending for a termination of pregnancy here.</p> <p>  Thirty years ago, I would never have thought we could have done a hysterectomy for a transgender man - in a million years, I would not have thought it - or provide any kind of care-----</p></speech>

We did not think these would happen.  Twenty years ago, if someone had an accreta, she had a hysterectomy.  Now we are doing uterine preservation surgery.  There will be tests, procedures and diagnoses coming up in the future that we do not know about yet and having this "clinically appropriate" means what is clinically appropriate for the time so that we can continue to innovate for women.  For me, it is very respectful for women to have that term.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach is saying something else.  The Minister is saying something else.  It is easy to list the services that will be provided and to qualify that by saying, "but not limited to", which would future-proof the provision of services.</p> <p>  We are told that the HSE insisted on including this phrase in all of the legal documentation.  It is a problematic phrase and the likelihood is it will be challenged in court on several occasions over the next 300 years.  In view of that, is the Minister prepared to revisit that issue?  Is the HSE prepared to withdraw its insistence on the inclusion of that and to come up with a phrase that will be absolutely crystal clear in relation to the services that will be provided?  There are many legal people, and many medics as well, who are seriously concerned about that phrase.  Is the Minister prepared to contemplate the removal of that phrase and replacing it with an agreed form of words?</p></speech>

It matters in terms of services.  It matters in terms of the services provided and protecting those services.  However, if it would be helpful to both the Deputy and the Chair, because I agree with the Deputy that this has become something that people are focusing on and really asking serious and important questions about, I would be more than happy to write formally to the committee - it could be countersigned by the HSE - and lay out formally exactly what is meant by this so that we would have a formal position from the Government to the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

I would agree with Deputy Shortall that what we need is something that relates to the actual documentation.  Correspondence between the committee and the Minister and his officials would not be something that in 200 years or 150 years will be laid before a court as legally binding.</p> <p>  I am incredibly disappointed by the phrase "trust doctors".  When I walked the streets in Dublin Central on repeal, that is not what I said to people.  Our slogan, the Green Party slogan, was "Trust her" - trust women.  The issue around "clinically appropriate" is that it places all of the power in the hands of clinicians and in the hands of those legal professionals who will then interpret what "clinically appropriate" means.</p> <p>  Over the past few weeks, I have spent a long time looking over these documents.  I listened to lots of legal opinions, both of those who want to proceed with the agreement and of those who question it.  Many of them are eminent legal minds saying very different things and the idea that it is not open to interpretation is simply not credible.</p> <p>  I can totally understand how clinicians feel it is important but that does not negate the requirement for more rights-based language here.  That is incredibly important when it comes to reproductive care, and that we centre women in it.</p> <p>  There is a trust deficit here and we have ambiguous language.  There is a trust deficit between the institutions of the State and the people of the State.  Particularly when it pertains to this phrase, what can be done now that does not delay the project but that reaches out to bridge that gap and to close that trust deficit?  What can we do now that is legally binding?</p></speech>

What I had said to people was, "Let us listen to the midwifes, the nurses and the doctors", but I take the Deputy's point and I agree.  The reason we are having this debate is because there is a very understandable deficit of trust because of the history in the State between religion and women's reproductive health.</p></speech>

The institutions of the State, in the Department of Health and in the HSE, have also let down women.  I understand the idea of listening to clinicians but Savita Halappanavar died under clinical care.  Therefore, it has to be more than locating this in religious ethos.</p></speech>

Is there a way for the Minister now, without delaying the project, to bridge that gap in order that he can provide people with some kind of confidence that is not the case?  This should be more than what is there right now, because what is in the documents right now is not enough to do that.</p></speech>

The first is whether there is more we can do.  Let us see.  As I said earlier, we have to be open to this discussion.  One of the things we are doing is clarifying categorically what it does mean on the record of the Oireachtas.  This carries legal weight.  I have also offered to write to the committee to do that.</p> <p>  The second part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question was around there being ambiguity, but the constitution is crystal clear.  It is important to point out that the clause here that matters states that the powers &ldquo;must be exercised by the Directors independently, without religious ethos or ethnic or other distinction, in such a manner that any maternity, gynaecology, obstetrics and/or neonatal services which are lawfully available in the State shall&rdquo; - not may - &ldquo;be available in the New NMH&rdquo;.  The Minister has power whereby the directors have the duty to carry out any direction that is issued by the Minister, including "to ensure that any maternity, gynaecological, obstetrical or neonatal service which is lawfully permissible in the State shall be available in the hospital, without religious ethos".  The phrase &ldquo;clinically appropriate&rdquo; does not appear in either of those clauses.  It only appears in clause 3(1), for the reasons that Professor Higgins, the Taoiseach and I, along with others, have already outlined-----</p></speech>

A correspondence to this committee does not bear that kind of legal weight, as far as I am aware but I am not a legal professional.  It would have to be something that in the 298th year they can still point to.</p> <p>  I want to move on to the business case.  I am aware that the business case is still under review.  I have a number of questions.  First, can the Minister elaborate a bit on that review?  My understanding is that the hospital itself is to be 55,000 sq m.  I am drawing on a previous life when I say that the healthcare build costs are approximately &euro;5,000 per square metre.  That would give us a cost for the hospital of &euro;275 million.  If you add on maybe 25% for VAT and fees, 25% for equipping, that still brings us to a figure that is under &euro;500 million.  Yet, we are quoting a figure of &euro;1 billion in the general ether of this conversation.  How have we got to the figure of &euro;1 billion?  Where is that number coming from?  By the way, I have factored inflation into my figures.  </p></speech>

The full costings have not been put together.  We need the Government decision.  We need the detailed business case.  Then it has to go out to tender.  When the Stat has a view, it will have an accurate view as to what it should cost.  Typically, that figure would not be released, because we want to run a competitive tender.</p></speech>

A contractor who knows that this project will be coming out for tender and will know that the actual costs of the construction build for the building at &euro;5,000 per square metre will be &euro;275 million.  We have now inflated and almost doubled the cost of the hospital ourselves before we ever put it out to tender.</p> <p>  To go back to the business case, can the Minister give us details about why this is under review?  Can he give us details about the enabling works?  As I understand it, the enabling works are something in the region of 20,000 sq m, which would result in approximately &euro;50 million in costs.  Is that what we are looking out for the enabling works and the car park?  </p></speech>

I thank all the witnesses for the work they do and for coming along here today.</p> <p>  I have to say that I feel that we are in the middle of something really weird.  Drip-fed bits of information keep coming at us, as elected politicians.  We are not getting the full truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  For example, the Minister has just told the committee this morning that parts of the new national maternity hospital will be occupied by other elements of St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group that have been displaced.  He cannot clarify for us if that will all be public, all private or a mixture of both.  I find that really upsetting.  We are getting this drip-fed information bit by bit when we have an opportunity to delve down.  </p> <p>  Earlier, Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane said that for the last year they have been debating and robustly listening to queries about this project.  Yet, we have been in here asking questions for the last year and we have been getting no answers.  I do not know how many times most of us in the Opposition stood up in the D&aacute;il to ask for full debates about the future of the national maternity hospital.  We are now getting it, after kicking up a fuss and having been told that we are guilty of a campaign of disinformation or misinformation.</p><p>The Minister has come in today and is remembering the moment of repeal and the seismic shift that was for the women of this country.  Members of the Government engaged in that campaign, whether they were knocking on doors or advocating for it and that was helpful but repeal changed everything.  When you look back at the history of the debate, discussion and negotiations around the new national maternity hospital that go back to 2012 and 2013, it seems to me from what the Minister has told us today that the bones and structures were all agreed pre-repeal.  How much did post-repeal Ireland change that discourse and discussion?  It must have changed it.  A lot of that discourse and discussion took place when the sisters or nuns were still on the field.  We are told that they are gone from the field and we are repeatedly told that no religious influence will be allowed.<br/><br/>I want to put the following thesis to the Minister.  In the same week we got the announcement that the Cabinet was about to sign off on this arrangement the US Supreme Court leak happened.  It was leaked that Roe <i>v.</i>Wade was about to be seriously challenged and possibly taken down.  For me, as somebody who has fought for repeal and abortion rights all of my life, that was shocking.  I understand, as many women in this country do, that for women's healthcare and reproductive rights you make two steps forward and you can take four back.  That happens because there will always be a kickback and a backlash against women's rights.  That is part of the way our society has been structured.  Women's oppression has always involved us making gains and them lashing back against us.  Religious interference does not always appear in nuns with long veils traipsing the corridors in the image of Mother Mary Frances Aikenhead.  That is not what we mean when we talk about religious interference.  We mean a deep-seated and deep-rooted prejudice and an in-built thinking about women's health that goes into the heart of the Civil Service, the health service and the political establishment.  It is something that cannot be seen and it does not wear a veil but it traipses around our bodies and lives all of the time and I am seriously worried that this concern will be dismissed.  The Minister said six times that it is in the Constitution, that there will be no religious interference and that this cannot be true.  That is nonsense and that is not the way it works.<br/><br/>I am delighted that the Minister acknowledged this morning that there is a much more deep-seated sociological reason for the mistrust around this deal and that it is not just headcases like me or others giving out misinformation.  There is a deep-seated reason for it.  We have to deal with that deep-seated reason and to do so we need much more than we have had until now in terms of reassurances from the Minister that there will be no religious interference.  For that we need to know why the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, which will have deep-seated and deep-rooted ties to the religious orders, will have the right to appoint three board directors and to appoint the chair every few years.  Why does it have that right?  If this is to be an utterly independent national maternity hospital for the women of Ireland to deliver all reproductive and maternity care then why does it want that interest?  It seems to really and passionately want it.<br/><br/>Its fact sheet is extremely interesting and it does not provide the sort of facts the Minister gives us when he repeats that we own it.  Mr. O'Donoghue keeps telling us that we &quot;effectively&quot; own it because of these leasehold rights but we do not.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group says that it owns the land and the rights and that it is on the board because of this, that and the other.  I am deeply suspicious of its interest in this project.  The Minister for Health was involved in devising Sl&aacute;intecare and I do not understand why we would use all this public money and this opportunity to create a truly one-tier medical system with no discrimination against people based on the depth of their pockets or the size of their wallets with a clearly publicly-owned and funded national maternity hospital in this way.  Why do we not take the opportunity to have that?  That is clearly not what we have and the plot thickens when the Minster tells me about the private elements that will be in the building and about the clinical independence.<br/><br/>Somebody mentioned Savita Halappanavar.  I think of her every day but I did not want to mention her name.  However, now that she has been dragged up I want to say that as she was dying, somebody took a decision that it was clinically inappropriate to give her the abortion that she and her husband asked for.  Somebody took that decision and even then, pre-repeal, it was legally permissible to do that to save her life.  Clinical appropriateness can be decided by somebody who does not agree with my view of the right to choose and of a woman's control of her body.  That could still happen with that the phrase &quot;clinically appropriate&quot; mixed up with the term &quot;legally permissible&quot;.  It is obfuscating in terms of where women stand.  What about what they want, rather than what the clinicians want?<br/><br/>We need to delve down into this much more and we need more time and reassurance.  If we removed the ownership of the land from the equation, we would get rid of this labyrinthine structure that has been described as Kafkaesque, involving three boards of management with three constitutions and three ways of appointing people and the State would deal directly, once and for all, with the future of women's health.  I would like the clinicians and the Minster to address those concerns that I still have, despite this long debate.</p></speech>

I will make a few quick points as follows.  First, a view has been expressed that we could just own the land and the building and that it could be a HSE hospital.  We could take the current national maternity hospital out of it and it could be a HSE-run hospital.  There are 19 maternity hospitals or units in the country and at the start of the year, ten of them provided services.  By the end of the year 14 of them will provide services, so we are all moving in this direction.  There are 11 maternity hospitals providing services right now and the eight that do not provide services are HSE hospitals.  We own the land and the buildings in those hospitals and there are no voluntary structures there whatsoever.  The hospitals that have led post repeal are the voluntary hospitals and the people sitting with us today.  The idea that has been put forward that if they were just HSE hospitals then that would solve the problem is clearly not correct because the eight maternity hospitals that do not provide services are HSE hospitals.</p> <p>  Second, the ownership of the land is not linked to the appointment of directors.  The land under the National Maternity Hospital, Holles St., is owned by the Earl of Pembroke, whoever that is, and he has no influence.  If the Deputy owned the land and we were getting a leasehold ownership for 300 years from her then she would not be appointing any directors.  The directors are being appointed because this is a partnership.  The national maternity hospital, which does not own the land under St. Vincent's University Hospital, is appointing directors to that board as well.  I might ask the clinicians about this.  Could Ms Brosnan come in on this point?</p></speech>

Everything the Minister says conflicts with the fact sheet from the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  The Minister says we own the land but the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group says that it owns the land.  The Minister asks what interest the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has but it says that it has an interest in it.  The St. Vincent's Healthcare Group asks why it requires ownership of the land and it says that land ownership is essential to ensure the ongoing provision of the best possible care for patients attending St. Vincent's University Hospital and the national maternity hospital.  That is not what the Minister says and it says something different.  The Minister says land ownership is irrelevant but the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group says it is very relevant.  Why does it have this continued interest in it?</p></speech>

The Minister and the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group are singing from different hymn sheets and that does not help.  Could the Minister have a meeting with the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, sit down and ask why it is saying one thing when we are saying another and why it says it owns it when we say it does not?  I ask the Minister to get his act together because it does not bode well for a future partnership in our healthcare that the various parties are saying different things about the structures.</p></speech>

It has been clearly said that the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has the freehold and that for the next 300 years the State will have the leasehold ownership.  That is the position.

There is a question on that fact sheet asking:  &quot;Who owns the NMH?&quot; and the answer to that is as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	The new NMH DAC will be part of St Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group [which is the subsidiary and we have all talked about the protections].<br /><br />The hospital building will be owned by the Irish State and will be operated by the new NMH DAC under an operating licence agreement from the HSE.<br /><br />The land is owned by SVHG [which is not disputed and which is a freehold interest] and is leased for 299 years to the Irish State [which I have previously said is a sufficient length of time for whatever building will be constructed on that land].  This is not unusual and many state institutions are on lands not owned by the government. </blockquote><p>I would say, as a property lawyer, that is not unusual that buildings are constructed on leasehold interests.

I am the director of midwifery for the last 15 years in the National Maternity Hospital.  I am passionately interested in this project as are so many stakeholders.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked particularly about why dermatology is in the building.  There are very detailed maps available for everybody to scrutinise this.  Much of St. Vincent's campus will be disrupted to build this very large structure.  It is around 50,000 m2 of which 35,000 m2 to 40,000 m2 will be the national maternity hospital's business.  There is another part of that campus that will be shared services, particularly all the catering and all the sterile services department.  They will all be shared and quite a lot of other facilities.</p> <p>  The other element is that St. Vincent's current campus will lose a lot of its space.  Procurement, ward areas such as dermatology and transitional care beds all had to be planned into the new service.  There is a very large, long, L-shaped building in the plans.  At the moment it is configured as a red block in the diagrammatic schematic picture.  If you drill down, there is an L shape which is built into five or six different elements, that is, our own big build - hopefully- the shared services and what St. Vincent's needs to build to replace what we are taking over.  It is very complicated because it is a working hospital.  It is the largest campus hospital in south Dublin and Leinster, almost.  A huge amount of work will be required to be done in the middle of a working campus.  It is complicated.  We phased it.  There was originally discussion of doing it in two phases and now it will hopefully be built in one.  We are very comfortable that the language that was put into the document protects maternity, women's health and neo-natal services for the future.</p></speech>

I can only say from a professional perspective that as midwives and clinicians working in the hospital as nurses working and providing all of the services at the moment - we mentioned fertility, termination of pregnancy and sterilisation - all those things are happening without religious influence and we know they will continue to happen.  It is ten years ago that Savita Halappanavar passed away.  It was a tragedy for every person involved and in particular her family and all the community.  The legislation since then has protected women's interests.  Termination of pregnancy is now legal.  It is being provided in many of the hospitals in the country.  That will continue in the St. Vincent's campus.</p></speech>

Fair play to Ms Brosnan for having such confidence that she can guarantee the future of women's healthcare in terms of abortion in this country.  Nobody in the United States can guarantee it for women in America and they have had it long, long before we have had it.</p> <p>  While I have a minute, I want to thank Professor Deirdre Madden and Dr. Sarah McLoughlin for their statement this morning.  They have been hugely courageous in providing that statement to us.  It should be published and everyone should read it.  In the closing paragraph they express their concerns on governance and control.  It noted that: "Although the agreed clause in relation to services will facilitate the provision of all legally permissible services at the new NMH boards also influence the culture, values, and ethics of the entity they govern, and this gives rise to the legitimate concerns for us about the potential influence of ethos".</p> <p>  I return to how we have three sets of appointees on a board of management instead of a Minister for Health - who I do not fully trust at the moment because of everything I have heard that contradicts what I am reading; even if I trusted the Minister for Health - being able to appoint the directors of the boards or some entity that does not have the vested interest of the St. Vincent's Hospital group and others.  I do not trust it and I think that is shared by many others in the country.  We have a statement from these two eminent people who dissented from the decision on 13 March to go ahead with this deal on 14 March.  I think people need to take note of that statement.  The idea that ethos can influence medicine is always there.  We need much more to guarantee that just because the nuns have gone off the pitch, the influence of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group will have much more weight than it ought to.  I want to thank the two women for taking the courageous step of making that statement.  </p> <p>  I am publicly asking the Minister to hold off on making the decision until we delve down much further into what is going on.  I have heard Dr. Mahony repeatedly talk about how bad things are in Holles Street.  I understand that.  I disagree with some commentators who have said it is like a slaughter house.  It is not like a slaughter house.  I have friends who gave birth there in the last year and they got on very well.  We need to calm down a bit.  We need to step back and really delve down into what we are doing here.  We need to give it more time.  If we have given it eight or 12 years, it can take another bit more time to get it right.  We took a long time with the national children's hospital.  That is costing us a load of money but at least it is being built on a campus where they own the land and are sharing the state-of-the-art facilities and medical facilities with St. James's without all this nonsense of three boards of directors and three constitutions and three mixed-up ways of dealing with things.  Why could we not do the same as with the national children's hospital and St. James's with this?  It is because St. Vincent's Healthcare Group do not want it.  It wants a huge influence on this hospital.</p></speech>

They are managing to serve a community of people who are giving birth there.  Today probably 20 women will give birth over the course of the day.</p></speech>

What is the rock on which we are building these guarantees?  It is the constitution of the hospital.  That is what matters.</p></speech>

It is not that I do not trust anybody at all on the planet to do stuff.  I absolutely trust the clinicians sitting here in front of me.  I admire and totally trust the midwives, nurses and doctors.  The problem is that we have weak abortion laws in this country that have allowed for conscientious objection to be used all over the place without giving women access to the rights they should have.  I want to see a national health service in this country, as does the Minister because he signed up to it, which is freed from voluntary, charity and private medicine.  That is where we have to go.  We are certainly not going there with this hospital and this structure.</p></speech>

It is not overt religious influence I am concerned about but covert influence.  The influence of the church is rampant in education and, unfortunately, it is also rampant in healthcare.  Does the Minister not think there is something ironic about the Taoiseach reading a letter from the 19 maternity providers in this country in support of this project into the record of the D&aacute;il while eight of them are not providing termination services?  I believe there is something fundamentally ironic about that.  I have a simple question.  The Cabinet postponed the decision for two weeks but is anything going to change with regard to this project?  Have the two weeks of engagement led to even one sentence of the constitution of the hospital changing or to any change to the structure?  Is all that has happened that we have paused the decision for two weeks?  Will the exact same memo that went to the Government two weeks ago be passed next Tuesday?  Will anything at all be different in light of the discussions we have had here this morning or the engagement the Minister has had over the last ten or 12 days?</p></speech>

I provide termination of pregnancy services and I advocated, fought and put my professional self on the line to ensure that women should, quite rightly, have access to termination of pregnancy services as autonomous women, services that make healthcare safer for women.  That is really important.  There is no way that I would engage in anything that would sacrifice that.  I fought hard enough alongside all the women and I will never forget the abortion campaign, seeing women coming out and telling their stories, the pain we heard of, how women were listened to on that occasion and how we changed everything.

I thank the Senator.  My view is that it is not acceptable that there are eight HSE hospitals that are not providing those services.  I do not believe that is acceptable.  It is one of the things that is being looked at in the review of the operation of the Act.  However, the direction of travel is very important.  With regard to what is happening right now, this year, we will have gone from ten hospitals to 14 hospitals providing termination services.  That is very important.  This is the second year in which the maternity strategy will have been fully funded.  This year and last year, we have been in the process of setting up a national network of new women's health services in gynaecology, menopause, endometriosis and infertility.  I hope to secure funding in the budget to make publicly funded IVF available next year and to begin to phase that in.  We are introducing free contraception this year, starting with young women from 17 to 25.  Women's healthcare, including all of the services we are talking about today, is an absolute priority for this Government.  An entire national network of service provision is being built at the moment.</p> <p>  I do not want to say the word "ironic" but one of the things that is interesting about this debate is that, although some may have, I have never heard anyone question Holles Street with regard to termination services.  Is it not interesting that two of the members of the board of Holles Street are priests?  One of them, the Catholic archbishop of Dublin, is the chair.  That role is agreed as part of the articles of association of the hospital, dating from the 1800s.  What we are essentially doing is moving the National Maternity Hospital, which everyone accepts is a leader in women's health services, to a state-of-the-art building, to which that hospital is contributing because it is selling its building on Holles Street.  We are putting in nine new directors and replacing all of those old structures.  Right now, we do not own the land under the Holles Street hospital and we do not own the building.  The chair of the board is the archbishop of Dublin.  There are elected representatives, councillors, on the board but there are no ministerial appointments to the board.  That hospital is not obliged, under its constitution, to provide all of these services.  We are moving to a new model and a state-of-the-art hospital co-located with an adult hospital.  The new hospital will be legally obliged to provide all services, any religious influence is expressly disallowed and the Minister and State have the power to intervene if necessary.  It is interesting to look at where we are and what we are proposing.</p><p>What we are doing here is taking any religious involvement out.  We are moving from relying on the wonderful clinicians in Holles Street to provide the services to mandating that they must provide them.  That is what is happening here.  It is very interesting to look at where we are and where we are going; we are moving in exactly the right direction.  I do not believe there should be any religious involvement in any healthcare provision in our country and we are actually taking religious involvement out of the national maternity hospital with this move.</p></speech>

Dr. Mahony and I were involved in the model of care and the guidelines.  Indeed, we have written most of them with our colleagues.  We were one of the first providers to provide under sections 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the Act.  We provide care for women in all aspects of legal care and we will continue to do that because that is our ethos as a hospital.  The ethos of the clinical staff of the hospital is to provide respectful care to women and transgender men.  We have a guideline on abortion care for transgender men.  That is how dedicated we are and that is our culture and ethos.  I really dislike this assumption that there are nuns out there who are going to somehow mind influence me to stop me from providing care that is respectful for women and transgender men.  It is disrespectful to our beliefs as doctors, midwives and nurses.</p></speech>

What we are trying to achieve or guarantee here is that there will not be any religious influence at the national maternity hospital.  If Professor Higgins takes offence at being questioned on that, I would disagree-----</p></speech>

It has been suggested that the national maternity hospital being a separate company is a bad thing but it is actually a really good thing.  The Mulvey agreement fell apart for its first two mediations because we were going to be a branch of St. Vincent's and I very much wanted us to be an independent company.  People have described us as a subsidiary but we are a separate legal entity.  I just want to go through some of the layers.  This is a company that is dedicated to the provision of healthcare for women.  It is actually different from the other hospitals in Ireland.  It is different from the HSE hospitals where one cannot mandate for a termination to take place where one does not have all of the layers of protection.  This is a company that has been designed to deliver care.</p> <p>  If I may, I would just like to go through all of the layers because I think it is important.  I would also like to address, again, the fact that the nuns are gone because it is central-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.460" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Rhona Mahony" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051100002#O00700"><p>It is central to our debate.  The first point is that the operation of the hospital is transferring from its charter to a new company, NMH Designated Activity Company, DAC, which is an independent legal entity.  That provides protection of itself because company law means that the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group will, from the outset, have very limited scope to interfere.  On top of that, as the Minister has said, the next really important piece is the constitution of the DAC, which is really and truly enshrining all of the values and principles that we considered so important, when we were designing this, to protect women.  The principle, which is now enshrined in the legal framework, is that the hospital will have clinical, financial and operational independence and without getting too legal, we will be able to provide all legally permissible services without religious ethos or other distinction.</p> <p>  The next layer, and the really big piece, is the reserved powers which cover the independent operation of the hospital.  They are exercised independently by the directors and any service that is legally permissible is available.   We also have the Minister's direction to ensure that those reserve powers are exercised.  People keep saying that this hospital is a 100% subsidiary but it actually has a really special share, called a golden share.  That golden share is held by the Minister and it has very special powers.  It protects the inviolability of the reserve powers and ensures that the director's obligations are provided for.</p> <p>  The next layer is the board of directors.  We have heard a lot of comment about directors and some suggestions that directors coming from St. Vincent's would act against the interests of women's health.  That is very egregious.  When one is a director of a company or hospital, one takes it very seriously.  One has a fiduciary duty to ensure that everything one does is for the benefit of the patients one is serving.  When one is on a board - and I am on a board - everything one does has got to be to the benefit of the patients one serves.  It is wrong to suggest that directors would break their fiduciary duty when we do not even know who they are yet.  That is very unfair.</p> <p>  The operating licence from the HSE is another layer which gives us freedom and independence to protect.  Then we have an ownership lease, which is giving us 299 years on the site, and we have a board and the mastership system.  These are all the layers and that is even before I get to explaining that there is no religious ethos at St. Vincent's.  St. Vincent's is now a secular hospital under the current board.  Again, people are saying that the current board is some kind of proxy for the religious but this is the very board that spent the last number of years separating the hospital from the church because it wants to emerge into the future as a hospital whose only ethos is delivering the best national and international practice of care for the patients it serves.  This is the very board that has removed a religious ethos.</p></speech>

Is there any way of defining that within the constitution of the hospital?  This is a major issue for the people who are listening in to this debate.  While I may be reassured by the Minister's explanation, the public has to be reassured as well.  Can we define "clinically appropriate" in an explicit way within the constitution of the hospital?</p></speech>

At a minimum, what we have already done is to define it explicitly here - what it is and what it is not.  I am not a lawyer but the advice is that Oireachtas proceedings would form part of any considerations were matters to ever go to court.  The second thing I can do, which I said to both Deputies Hourigan and Shortall, is that I can write formally to the committee so that there is a written record that is absolutely unambiguous.  I can engage with the committee on that.</p> <p>  I am going to reflect on this, as is everyone else.  There is a lot of debate, a lot of different issues and many really important matters have been raised.  Obviously, I and others will reflect on the entire discussion.  </p></speech>

I appreciate why the Minister is saying here and on the airwaves, which is that the approximately eight hospitals that do not provide abortion are HSE-owned.  I do not think it is necessarily the "gotcha" the Minister thinks it is.  I think it undermines him as Minister for Health because it seems he cannot get his own State-owned hospitals to provide basic healthcare for women for which he and us campaigned and voted yet he expects us to believe that he or some other Minister with the golden share will be able to intervene in this particular hospital and insist it offers healthcare services that he cannot get hospitals under HSE management to provide.  This is possibly where people are not feeling assured because the Minister's statement is only confirming people's fears that the Minister may not be able to provide for it or step in and insist on it because he does not have HSE hospitals in order.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.469" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1663" speakername="Annie Hoey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051100002#R00400"><p>I am highlighting what I think the public perceives when the Minister says that line.  It is certainly what people have said to me.  I do not think the line is helpful for the Minister in this debate.  The Labour Party position is that we hand over too many projects or State assets to voluntary bodies.  We are moving forward in Ireland.  I appreciate that everyone here is painstakingly explaining to us the different structures, layouts and set-ups but, ultimately, it still seems to boil down to, and this is a public perception, this not being a State-owned building on State-owned lands.  This is the crux of the matter.  People are unable to marry these two things together.  I do not know that we will be able to come out of this committee having married those two things together because I think this is how the public feels and I do not know if a huge amount can be done about that.</p> <p>  I find it difficult to follow some of the companies, set-ups, people and complicated lease agreements.  It is company after company and I feel like we are going to end up in the Cayman Islands.  I am trying to follow these things.  This is not in any way to suggest that anything is going to end up there.  It is a complicated thing for members of the public to follow.  Things that are making it difficult to follow include the fact that some pieces of the paper trail may be missing.  Some of the stuff has been drip fed to us.  It has been a bit of a sprint effort to go through the documents released last week.  Two things are missing.  We are bringing the Vatican back into this so forgive me but in respect of the agreement was sought between the Vatican and the Religious Sisters of Charity, whatever that agreement or paper trail was, we do not have sight of that.  That is a cause for concern for the public because we do not know what was agreed.   Maybe someone here has seen that but I have not seen it.  People have not seen whatever the conditions of the agreement are.  This land is extremely valuable.  It is a valuable asset.  It is hard for people to believe that the Vatican just went "there are absolutely no terms and conditions.  You can just do whatever you like with it."  If it has said that, it would be really helpful for members of the public to see that paper trail.  </p> <p>  Another thing that is a sticking point in public understanding is the fact that what is in the table today is a slightly different agreement to what was touted in 2013.  My understanding is that this change took place around 2017.  It feels as though there was a change in how this would going to look.  We went from public land and public ownership to this agreement.  Has the Minister had sight of or examined the correspondence between the former Minister, Deputy Harris, and his senior officials around 2017 outlining how we got to the current agreement?  Can this be made publicly available because this is something of a sticking point for a lot of people?  </p> <p>  There is a question around the issue of indemnity in the share transfer agreement.  I know a couple of legal experts, and I would welcome the Minister's own legal opinion on this, have said that some of these terms of indemnity are perhaps vague and could even cover the Religious Sisters of Charity holding company, RSC Caritas.  Is it correct to say that the indemnity will extend as far as that?  If so, is it appropriate for the State to give that indemnity to it?  </p> <p>  What happens if the Religious Sisters of Charity ceases to exist?  We have this layered system.  What is the legal follow on if the Religious Sisters of Charity ceases to exist?  Could the Minister elaborate on who owns what because these are the questions that have come into my inbox?  Who would own what if the Religious Sisters of Charity was to cease to exist within the next 300 years, and we do not know what that will look like?    </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.470" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051100002#R00500"><p>The first two questions are around this ask from the Labour Party and others who say they want a State-owned building on State-owned land.  I understand fully why people want that.  The point I was making previously was that this does not provide the guarantee that people may be demanding because when you look at the remaining maternity hospitals or wards that do not provide them, you can see that they are all State-owned hospitals on State-owned land.  By definition, that model does not guarantee what people want.  In fact, it is the voluntary hospitals that have led the way on this.  Regarding the Senator's very reasonable question about why the HSE hospitals are not providing these services, this year, we will have moved from ten to 14 so we are moving quickly in the right direction.  Partly this is because we are directing funding.  I have ring fenced funding for termination services so several hospitals have the money and investment.  We are investing at a level never seen before in maternity services, gynaecology, menopause and endometriosis - a wide variety of areas.  All of this money coming into our services is one of the things helping these hospitals to do it.</p><p>The question was about why we cannot get HSE hospitals to provide services.  I respectfully answer that we are doing so.  We are moving from ten to 14 and I intend to move further.  We are all interested in the review of the Act, which we will debate here.  That is another mechanism that we all want to use to identify the final blockages and to get rid of them.</p><p> On the matter of having a State-owned building on State-owned land, we will build the building and it will be ours.  We hold the operating licence, appoint three directors and the Minister can intervene at any time to ensure that all services are being provided and that there is no religious influence in the hospital.  The State has strong involvement in this new national maternity hospital that we do not have at all in the current National Maternity Hospital, yet it is a leading hospital.  We, as Members of the Oireachtas, have to decide on the land issue.  I would prefer for us to own the land.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, and I asked for that.  The position of St. Vincent's from the first day is that this has never been negotiable.  The original agreement was for a 99-year lease, which has moved to 299 years.  The conditions are essentially that we run a healthcare service on it, for &euro;10 a year, which is basically free.</p><p> There is a question about whether we could try harder to get St. Vincent's to give us the land.  It would say that it is doing so, for the next 300 years.  We cannot get freehold of the land.  Others have very reasonably asked if there could be a compulsory purchase order for the land.  I asked that of the Department.  The answer is that we could try, but I received legal advice that there would be no guarantee of success, because we would have to prove that it has to be built there and nowhere else in Dublin and that 300 years is not enough for us to have lease ownership for a building with a useful life cycle of 50 or 60 years.</p><p> Secondly, this is a partnership.  It would not surprise me if an involved party said we approached it, asked for a partnership and that it gave us the land for 300 years, and that if we are now going to bring it to court, it is not interested in a partnership since that does not feel like a partnership.  It comes down to whether we are willing to move to another site.  Those advocating for it present it as a viable alternative.  Unfortunately, we cannot own the land, but could we build somewhere else?</p></speech>

The Senator asked what would happen if the order ceased to exist.  From our perspective, nothing would happen.  It has no involvement whatsoever.  Finally, any relationship between the order and the Vatican is a matter for them.  People have asked if the Government will release their correspondence.  We do not have that correspondence, because it is not correspondence with us.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group publicly stated that there were no conditions and that no such conditions from the Vatican would ever have been entertained.</p></speech>

It is entirely between the Religious Sisters of Charity, the new company, St. Vincent's Holdings, and St. Vincent's Healthcare Group below it.  The new national maternity hospital designated activity company will have no role or liability.  It has nothing to do with that indemnity.  It only covers any potential liability or risk to the Religious Sisters of Charity, which it is then indemnified for by St. Vincent's Holdings and St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  We looked at those documents to make sure there was nothing particularly unusual or untoward in them, but they are of no relevance to the State.

The site will have a public hospital, a private hospital, a maternity hospital, general practitioner services, screening services, pharmacies, community-based services and many other services.  For the management of the site as a healthcare campus, there should be single ownership.  Many of the shared services for the entire campus will also be provided at the maternity hospital and university hospital.  We are building shared services for the entire campus as part of the national maternity hospital.  I was recently in Texas Medical Center just outside Houston.  I am told it is the biggest healthcare campus anywhere in the world.  It is a voluntary healthcare campus, with a huge variety of healthcare providers.  Despite that, there is one owner of the campus, which is the Texas Medical Center.  St. Vincent's is applying the same logic here.</p> <p>  I am in the realm of speculation now, so forgive me.  All of the debate is about why we should trust St. Vincent's.  People say that it is a fantastic healthcare provider.  There is narrative about whether something is inherently wrong with St. Vincent's, even though it has provided fantastic healthcare for many years.  From St. Vincent's perspective, it has to ask what the long-term motivations of the State are.  It could sell, we could become its freehold owner, then the Government might decide in 70 years that it is done with the maternity hospital, to merge the Coombe and the national maternity hospital, and to build a brand new hospital in Blanchardstown.</p><p>St. Vincent's wants this as a healthcare campus for many years to come.</p></speech>

I think that is putting words in people's mouths.  Our job, as legislators, is to ask questions, including of the Minister.  He is the one who is signing off on the deal on behalf of the State.  It is only fair and appropriate that we do our job and ask him questions.  I do not believe I have cast any aspersions on St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and it is unfair to state that has been done.  Reasonable questions are being asked on this, either as a visceral response in respect of who or what owns this or because people are unclear as to the structure, format and lease of it.  Those are reasonable and fair questions and it is unfair to cast aspersions on people that it is a reflection on provision or healthcare or anything like that.</p> <p>  May I ask a final question?</p></speech>

I followed the debate from my office and while here in the committee room.  As it was going on, it struck me that Mother Mary Aikenhead passed away 164 years ago or thereabouts.  She was a physician.  All the way along, we have been debating something that needs to happen.  We need advanced modern healthcare for the women of Ireland.  I do not believe that physician who has now found her eternal reward, or other such people, would want to put any barriers in front of modern healthcare.  If she could somehow communicate to the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, I do not believe she would say that it is truly representing her beliefs.  Quality of healthcare is what her life was all about.</p> <p>  Like the previous speaker, I will get to asking my set of questions.  Our time is limited.  I have a political question, a legal question and a health question.  My first question is for the Minister.  I am sure he and his advisers have done a hell of a lot of troubleshooting on this.  They have probably modelled different scenarios.  If the Cabinet, the Government and the body politic reject all of this, what is the drawing board to which we will go back that ensures State land, co-location and delivery of a modern hospital in a quick timeframe?  If we go to that other model, what would be the approximate timeframe?  Surely there would be a significant delay.  Have the Minister and his advisers carried out troubleshooting on that and modelled it?  What delays might we face if we all reject what is on offer and go with a plan B that has yet to be even thought of?</p> <p>  Are there cessation or break-out clauses, as Senator Hoey asked, if the Sisters of Charity cease to exist?  A modern building built in the 21st century is unlikely to be still standing in 300 years.  It will have to be demolished and rebuilt.  There are surely some break-out and cessation clauses.  I would like to hear about them.</p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. O'Donoghue and Ms O'Sullivan.  There is an unfortunate saying that doctors differ and patients die.  I am sure it is the same in their world as well.  What do they make of the legal advice that was circulated overnight from the Uplift movement?  It is from Stephen Dodd, senior counsel, and relates in particular to the whole compulsory purchase order, CPO, argument.</p> <p>  The Minister has repeatedly met politicians and stated there are layers of protection.  A question I have been asked, however, is that if each layer is sufficient, why are there multiple layers of protection, up to and including a golden share?  I ask the Minister to explain to those who are tuned in to these proceedings why there are so many levels of legal protection.</p> <p>  My final question is for Dr. Mahony and Professor Higgins.  It is a medical question.  Are their fellow obstetricians and gynaecologists currently limited by any religious, legal, political or ideological barriers in terms of delivering a full suite of healthcare procedures, up to and including abortion, in the current National Maternity Hospital?  Are they limited in any way?  They have probably answered my next question already but I will ask it nonetheless.  Do they believe that, going forward, if they do move - lock, stock and barrel - to the new national maternity hospital, any of the legal protections or political agreements that have been hammered out will be impediments to them carrying out their work?  What do they make of what Dr. Boylan has been saying in recent days?</p></speech>

I will take his first question, in respect of starting again.  I will pass the question on break clauses and the lease to the lawyers.  Dr. Mahony went through issue of the layers of protection.  We can do so again.  She laid it out very well.  The Deputy also asked another question.  We can come back to it.</p> <p>  As regards how long it would take to start again, there is no way to accurately answer that question but my estimate, based on how long it takes the State to build hospitals, is that it would add ten to 15 years to the project.  Some people may say that sounds like a very long time, and it is, but, unfortunately, the State takes a very long time to build hospitals.  We know that from the hospitals in which we are involved.  Would we get another adult hospital to agree to co-locate?  That may be the case.  It may be just a stand-alone maternity hospital.  That would take a very long time.  One must remember that even if we did that and it was a decade on, let us say, and we were discussing a final Cabinet decision on a new hospital, there is no guarantee that we would not be having some version of this debate.  I will be bringing recommendations to the Cabinet in respect of locations for three elective hospitals.  There is debate in respect of where they should go.  All present know there was a big debate in respect of where the children's hospital should go.  No matter what hospital proposal is brought forward to be considered by a government, there always seems to be good and healthy debate because people have different views and they want the right answer.  It would add a very long period to the project.</p> <p>  On a human level, the idea of walking across Merrion Square and into Holles Street hospital to tell the clinicians who work there that we had the most exciting and important investment in the future of women's healthcare ready to go but failed to deliver it and we will be back to them in a decade with another site is unthinkable.  We, as politicians, must not allow that to happen.</p> <p>  Ms O'Sullivan or Mr. O'Donoghue may wish to respond on the break clauses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.489" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Donoghue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051100002#T00700"><p>I will take that question.  The lease is for 299 years.  The only way it can be terminated is if there is a breach by either party.  Basically, the State has to commence construction of the hospital within five years of the date of the lease.  That can be extended by agreement between the parties.  It sets a deadline for shovels to be in the ground and building to start.  We have seen for how long this has gone on so far.  If the State does not do that, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group can take back the site.  That is not in question.  There would be nothing on it.  To be clear, if the State breaches its obligations during the 299-year term, St. Vincent's Healthcare Group can take back the site and the building on it.  The obligations on the State are to build a hospital and ensure public healthcare is provided from that hospital.  If it does not do so, St. Vincent's is entitled to take back the site and the building on it.  As the Minister mentioned, if the building is no longer fit for purpose 70 years from now and the State decides it wants to convert it to apartments or to build a shopping centre, St. Vincent's can take back the site and whatever building is on it at the time.  The commitments in the document are for 300 years.  If in 70 years the parties agree the building needs to be refurbished or rebuilt, that is an agreement they can make.  At any stage during the 300 years, the parties can make alternative arrangements.</p></speech>

It is because of the history of religion and women's reproductive health in this country.</p><p>We cannot countenance a new maternity hospital that would have any religious interference.  I would never bring it forward.  I do not believe the previous Minister, Deputy Harris, would have ever brought it forward.  None of the clinicians here would ever countenance it.  Therefore, it has been incumbent upon all of us to put layers of protection in place to deliver what people are rightly demanding.  Dr. Mahony might speak to some of those.</p></speech>

We have to come back a little bit to the history of the Mulvey agreement because the nuns have gone now, they are out of the picture, but in 2016 they were not.  We knew they might be leaving, but we had to create an entity where it did not matter whether the nuns left or not.  We had to create an entity where we had absolute independence in our company.  That is why we have all the layers.  In the initial mediations we were going to be a branch and being a branch does not give you the same protections as being your own separate legal entity, your own separate company.  We had seen from our colleagues in HSE hospitals where maternity services are departments in large acute adult hospitals that there is almost competition for the funding within the hospital and there are different interests in the hospital such as cancer, anaesthetics and all the different specialties.  Very often, it seemed that maternity services were right at the end of the list.  We wanted our own separate funding as well because when you run a hospital, you need to have control of the building, staff and clinical operations, but you also need to have your own separate funding.  In order for us to achieve that, we had to have a separate legal entity.  We went on a bit of a journey during the Mulvey negotiation.  Two mediations had fallen apart because we were in a branch situation.  We could not accept that because we felt it would not give the right governance structure to provide a dedicated healthcare facility for women.  During the Mulvey talks, both St. Vincent's and Holles Street went on a journey, and we had to understand that it is all about patients.  What we are trying to do here is to create an amazing campus that provides care for women, but also care for adults, one that will elevate Irish healthcare and provide care from birth - from a tiny baby born at 23 weeks weighing 500 g - right up to the end of life.  All the research facilities and collaboration between the two hospitals and the doctors is what is at stake here.  When we look at all the successful academic health centres in the world such as Imperial Hospital and John Radcliffe Hospital, there is a list of the top 10, and we want to be one of them.  That is what this is about.  We are ambitious for women's healthcare.  We want this hospital to be listed in the top 10.</p></speech>

That would not be good healthcare.  The whole purpose of this is elevating healthcare.  Rather than restricting services that are available to women, we are opening up an entire adult campus and adding to the services available to women in the areas of medical, surgical and diagnostic.  It is important to remember the number of women who get transferred over to St. Vincent's.  We have 122 critical care cases in Holles Street every year, and 73 of those women will need to transfer to St. Vincent's.  We have approximately six patients every year who require ICU facilities, but in addition, we have a maternal medicine clinic that sees 500 patients every year that deals with a whole range of issues.  I will ask Ms Brosnan to add to what I have said.</p></speech>

I apologise for the bells in the background.  I am substituting for Senator Black, who would like to be here herself if she could.</p> <p>  We have heard from the Minister that the legal advice is that the expected life of a hospital is 50 years to 60 years.  There is an embodied emissions concern about such a short lifecycle for a building, but we also heard that the requirement is that maternity health services would be continued on this site for 299 years.  This is something important which has not got the necessary focus and it would merit elaboration.  While the rent is currently set at &euro;850,000 per year, which is close to &euro;1 million per year, it is waived to be &euro;10 per year, so long as the permitted use, which is subject to the double constraints of being clinically appropriate and legally permissible, continues.  The Minister tells us the hospital is only to last for 60 years, so what happens after that?  Are we effectively committing to building four or five new maternity hospitals in a row on this site and, if we do not do so, will we become liable for &euro;850,000 or &euro;1 million per year in rent for the site?  It is one or the other.  Either way, both raise significant financial concerns.</p> <p>  There has been talk about the many grounds pertaining to the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, as the landlord, such that it may be able to seek a forfeiture in relation to the lease, but if the State decides 100 years in that we do want to build a new national maternity hospital that is an actual public hospital - publicly owned on public land - where is our exit and what are the liabilities that would come with such an exit from the lease?  I would like the Minister to comment on those legal issues, and he might also come back on the question of permitted use and the terms "clinically appropriate" and "legally permissible".  I will get the answer to the leasehold and rent question first and then I will come back on the question of permitted use.</p></speech>

I will ask Mr. O'Donoghue or Ms O'Sullivan to come in on the clauses and what an exit strategy might look like in 100 or 200 years.  To be clear, the covenants around the &euro;10 a year lease, are not linked to the terms "clinically appropriate" or "legally permissible", they are just linked to the HSE being the tenant, running a hospital on the site and not seeking freehold of the site.  It is not linked to the NMH's constitution.  It is linked to the HSE and the State essentially running public healthcare services on that site.</p></speech>

If the State does not do that, it is at risk of paying market rent and it is at risk of forfeiting the lease in the future.  If, for example, as I mentioned, the State in 70, 80 or 100 years' time decides it no longer wishes to use this site for public healthcare services, it risks losing the site with the building on it, but there is an important protection in the forfeiture obligation Senator Higgins mentioned, which is very unusual in that if St. Vincent's did take back the site there is a covenant that it would continue to provide public healthcare services from that building.</p><p>The Senator asked about the potential liability of the State in the future.  This began as a 99-year lease on the basis that was a sufficient length of term for the building that was to be constructed.  Because of commentary, that has been extended to 299 years, which puts an onus on the State to provide healthcare from that facility for that period or to have that conversation in the future with whoever owns the land or the freehold interest at that time.</p></speech>

I certainly do think that conversation envisaged a market rent of up to &euro;1 million a year to which the State might be liable.  In that context, is the plan to build five or six hospitals in succession?  Are we saying that for the next 300 years, this will be how maternity care operates in Ireland?  Our guests talked about St. Vincent's Healthcare Group's holding if it chooses to terminate the agreement.  If it emerges this is a bad agreement that is not working successfully and we wish to exit it, what will be the mechanisms available to the State?  Will we face liability for the remaining years?</p></speech>

In any event, as an example, if there were no longer a requirement for a public health facility on the site in 70 years, and if St. Vincent's Healthcare Group did not wish to take it back and wanted to charge a rent of &euro;850,000 per annum, the State could decide to use it for something else, such as a shopping centre or an apartment block, because that would force St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group either to terminate the lease or allow the State to do what it wanted for the remainder of the 299 years.  That is a decision St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group would have to take at that time.</p></speech>

Is it to be interpreted case by case by individual doctors?  Is "clinically appropriate" subject to clinical direction, and if so, what are the links between the clinical direction at the hospital and clinical direction from St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group?  These are concerns because, as we have heard, it is not simply about what services might be available but also under which circumstances they will be available.  Ireland has a very complicated history, at times determining, for example, that symphysiotomy was clinically advisable or, in other cases, allowing people to receive tubal ligation but only in certain circumstances.</p> <p>  The phrase "clinically necessary" was used earlier in regard to terminations that have taken place, but that is different from "clinically appropriate".  Where will the latter phrase be determined and will it be done on a case-by-case basis by individual doctors or according to clinical direction?  How will that be reviewed if concerning trends emerge?  As I said, it is not simply about what is available but also when it is available.  Abortion was available in Ireland prior to the repeal of the eighth amendment, but there had to be a determination as to the risk of death.  These were the kinds of decisions that had to be made.  People are rightly concerned, therefore, as to how "clinically appropriate" will be interpreted and that needs clarification.  What is the link with St. Vincent&rsquo;s Healthcare Group in this regard?</p></speech>

The term "clinically appropriate" refers to services that are clinically appropriate for a maternity, gynaecology, neonatal and obstetric hospital.  It does not include procedures relating to, for example, cardiology or neurology.  The term has caused understandable concern and it is something we have been debating at length during this meeting, but that is what it means under the constitution.  Professor Higgins might give a clinical perspective.</p></speech>

I will give a very practical example of what Dr. Mahony was talking about in the context of having beds and spaces dedicated to women.  I recall working in a general hospital, having just come from working at a maternity hospital where there was a dedicated operating theatre.  One night, a lady presented with ovarian torsion, which is where the ovary cuts off its blood supply, resulting in a major gynaecological emergency.  I was used to working at a hospital where I could bring such a woman straight to theatre after, obviously, asking for her consent because she has autonomy.  I could advise her about the clinical necessity and bring her to theatre.  At the general hospital, I had to go to an operating theatre and advocate for this woman against orthopaedic, general and vascular surgery all looking for the same space.  Ring-fencing, therefore, is incredibly important for women&rsquo;s healthcare which, as the Senator pointed out, was not suitably looked after for many years.</p> <p>  The second issue relates to future-proofing.  We earlier gave the example of the Billings method, which is no longer used.  Symphysiotomy was absolutely unacceptable in light of everything we have learned from the women who advocated against it.  The Senator is correct that we have clear legal guidelines and frameworks we can work with now.  They are not perfect and I will, I hope, return to talk to the committee about the issues we have with them, but we can work within them.  It is much easier than it was under the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act and even than before that was law.  We are constantly evolving, and I do not know what procedures we currently carry out that will not be acceptable in 20 years.  That is what the phrase means to me.</p></speech>

As Professor Higgins said, very unacceptable practices have happened in the past and many of them did so on a clinical interpretation, because there is a balancing of what might be most important.  The question of elective procedures, for example, which may not be clinically necessary but which people may wish to have and may be entitled to have, has not been addressed.  Will clinical direction be entirely contained within the new body?  What will be the link between clinical direction from that body and the clinical direction at St. Vincent's Healthcare Group?</p></speech>

Everything we do is evidence-based care.  We can then provide individualised assessment to patients based on their circumstances and on the guidelines for best practice at a given time.  That, to me, is what "clinically appropriate" means.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct about elective care.  We provide that and we are one of the first hospitals to do so, and I am very proud we provide it-----</p></speech>

What we need from the St. Vincent's site at the moment to provide clinically appropriate care is the additional resources it has.  When we move to the St. Vincent's site, and I very much hope we will, we will continue to provide that service because Holles Street will move all the physicians and ancillary staff and everything we provide on Merrion Square will, I hope, be provided on the new site.

It is not a reference to human rights but a reference to dignity.  There is an encyclical from 1965 on human dignity.  We know the Human Dignity Alliance party was founded in Ireland after 2018 specifically with the goal of opposing the outcome of the referendum on the repeal of the eighth amendment.  Human dignity is a term that has been interpreted through Catholic social teaching, whereas human rights are a little clearer in that we all know the associated documents.  With regard to the phrasing in question in the new constitution of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, the question of where clinical direction comes from is extremely relevant.</p><p> The St. Mary's site has not been discussed.  Could we purchase it?  In that context, is it the case that St. Vincent's Healthcare Group would not support or work with us if we purchased the St. Mary's site, which is adjacent?  I have been very concerned by the idea that somehow it is acceptable for the group to say it will not work with the public hospital but only with a charitable hospital.  Could a hospital on the adjacent St. Mary's site access St. Vincent's hospital very quickly in an emergency?  Would that not be a possible solution?</p></speech>

On the question on dignity, I would not cede the word and concept of "dignity" to any individual, religion or philosophy.  I would never accept that just because some group sets itself up and uses the word dignity, its definition of it is the one we should use.  I have a very clear idea of what dignity means.  The clinicians have a very clear idea of what dignity means for patients and, indeed, our workers.  I understand the Senator's question but I would never cede the concepts of dignity and compassion or any such concept to any group set up with a particular agenda.</p></speech>

I, of course, believe in dignity very passionately but I note that the people for whom the interpretation is relevant are those in the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  We have not really got clarity on its interpretation.  Dignity means different important things to different people.  This is not the case with human rights, in respect of which we can refer to relevant, agreed texts.  There are many interpretations, of course, but the relevant question concerns the interpretation that is applied.</p></speech>

It is not directed at the Chairman.  It was agreed that we would have four hours and two rounds of questions.  These are very difficult and complex issues.  We had ten minutes each, which had to include the responses of the Minister and others.  For members of the committee, this does not do justice to the matter.  I am not blaming the Chairman but just stating a matter of fact.  We obviously have to have a discussion ourselves afterwards on what we do next.  All of that is bound up with whether the Cabinet will sign off on this next week.  That is the source of our frustration.  That has to be at least accepted by the Minister.  We are up against the clock and cannot carry out the scrutiny that we were told could be done, simply because of time constraints.</p></speech>

In any layperson's language, that is considered ownership.  You can make many arguments about buildings being fixed to the land &ndash; Deputy Shortall made the point about the first schedule &ndash; but the site being leased includes the buildings on it.  The reason is that if there is a breach by the State and the lease is terminated, one cannot just take back the underlying land without taking back the buildings on it.  That is what is part of the lease for 299 years.</p></speech>

However, because this building could be there for a long time, we do not want to create obligations on the HSE in relation to internal repairs, etc.  Any repair obligations will be passed on to the NMH DAC through the operating licence, which is effectively a 299-year obligation, as long as NMH DAC complies with its obligations to provide all the services it is required to provide from the land.<br/><br/>There is a further provision in that lease, at clause 6.1, quiet enjoyment, which again is a fairly standard provision.  It provides:</p> <blockquote> 	... so long as the Tenant pays the rents [again that is a nominal rent for as long as it complies with certain obligations] ... and performs the covenants ... the Tenant may hold and enjoy the Premises [which includes the land and the buildings on it] and the rights hereby granted peaceably during the Term [which is 299 years] without any unlawful interruption by the Landlord or any person lawfully claiming under or in trust for the Landlord. </blockquote></speech>

That lease contains a right for the State to build a hospital on those lands, maintain that hospital, and grant an operating licence to an operator of that hospital.  There are certain obligations that it continues to maintain it for public healthcare.  That is in the interests of the State and of St. Vincent's.  They want public healthcare.  Again, if this lease is terminated or was terminated or in the unlikely event that the State - we are talking about the State here - does not comply with its obligations, St. Vincent's has to continue to use the building on that land for public healthcare services.</p></speech>

If you told those people they did not own their buildings, they would not accept that.  Likewise, many buildings across this city and country are held under leaseholds and it would not be unusual in this type of structure.  As Dr. Mahony explained, the building being built on this campus is a maternity hospital but it will also have shared facilities for the remainder of the campus and it will have some St. Vincent's hospital areas.  I think it is replacing dermatology facilities in the main.</p> <p>  Deputy Shortall may have made a point earlier about this "clinically appropriate" language.  That language relates specifically to the maternity areas to make sure that is captured.  That is the language used in the lease, the operating licence and any of the documents relating to the maternity hospital.  When we refer to the maternity hospital it is probably the majority of the building but it is not all of the building.</p></speech>

I refer again to the senior counsel's opinion, in which he states on page 62:</p> <blockquote> 	Insofar as the State proposes to compulsory acquire the lands, the appropriate legislation is under the Health Act 1947 which confers on the HSE the power to compulsorily acquire lands.  However, significant issues relate to whether the procedure under Health Act 1947 is constitutional in affording sufficient independence in the process for confirming a CPO. </blockquote> <p>Thus, even the senior counsel's opinion that is circulating is, on the one hand, saying the State should go and compulsorily acquire, yet the paragraph I have just cited sets out that there may be constitutional issues.

I have a few questions and will try to get through them as quickly as possible.  I will ask Professor Higgins about terminations in St. Vincent's currently.  I am aware that terminations are usually carried out in maternity units but are sometimes carried out in non-maternity units.  Have terminations been carried out in St. Vincent's in circumstances where a woman's life was not at risk?</p></speech>

The times we have needed to perform them is when we needed the input of St. Vincent's hospital and the services it gives us.</p></speech>

That is a service we provide at the moment under the current legislation.  The vast majority of terminations in those cases are provided in the community.  That is where the majority of terminations take place at less than nine weeks.  After nine weeks, we perform these terminations in Holles Street either using medication or using a surgical technique, just because the pregnancy has advanced a bit more and there are more risks of bleeding.  We feel, therefore, that it is safer to perform those procedures in the hospital.  We do not do that many, actually, because the majority of the cases happen in the community, which is totally appropriate.  It is where women can be at home instead of having to come into a hospital.</p> <p>  If we look at the experience in Scotland, what we found there was as that service developed and improved, far fewer cases came to hospital because those terminations were being given earlier in the pregnancy when it is safer.  That has been the experience in Scotland and we certainly hope we will follow that.  Even in Holles Street today, we do not perform many procedures under 12 weeks because most are done in the community.  The point about this is that under the legislation, terminations under 12 weeks could be performed in St. Vincent's hospital.  There is no barrier in St Vincent's to performing everything but we have to rationalise services.  At the moment, as regards the kinds of services provided in St. Vincent's hospital, it should be remembered that the hospital has not moved yet so we do all of the routine and normal work, including all of the caesarean sections.</p><p>We do approximately two caesarean sections at St. Vincent's per year because we need additional medical backup.  We must remember the hospital has not moved yet.  There is no barrier at St. Vincent's to doing that.  It is just that with the cases at St. Vincent's now, there is a limited gynaecological service and it is generally devoted to cancer.  We are not going to cancel a cancer patient just to make a political point that we can do a termination at less than 12 weeks gestation.  It would be totally inappropriate.</p></speech>

My next question is for Mr. John O'Donoghue because it is a legal question.  There has been much talk about the option of a compulsory purchase order, CPO, of the land.  Will Mr. O'Donoghue bring us through the legal process and tests used by the court when deciding a CPO application?</p></speech>

I do not know when a CPO was completed under the Health Acts or if a CPO was ever completed under the Health Acts.  I work in different areas of law and in the housing sector I am working with local authorities dealing with potential CPOs of vacant properties for use as social housing.  I know the process that can be undertaken and it is an application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to which third parties may object.  If there is an objection, it can go to court and the High Court may make a determination.  It can go on and on up to the Supreme Court.  If the process of a CPO is undertaken, the party involved is not likely to consent, and it could take a long number of years and many challenges to get that CPO.</p> <p>  My understanding is that under the Planning and Development Act 2000, the provision to substitute the Minister for An Bord Plean&aacute;la was not included for the Health Acts, and that is where the unconstitutionality may arise.  The Minister may potentially decide on whether the CPO is right or not rather than a third-party body such as An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p></speech>

My view is there is every likelihood that if we initiated a CPO, never mind what happens in court, at least one of the parties involved would say "We are no longer interested in this, this is clearly no longer a partnership".  In my non-legal world, I can imagine two people living relatively close together where one has a big old garden.  The other person might suggest selling his or her house if the person gives him or her a quarter of the big garden.  They would be close neighbours and get on very well so would it not work?  The other neighbour might agree and find it interesting but suggest giving a quarter of the garden for the next 300 years for free.  He or she might say, "Let's do this, it is exciting".  The other party may disagree and look to bring the person to the courts, trying to get the garden from him or her, and then believe they will live together in harmony in the two buildings and remain great friends.  The other party would clearly say "Thanks very much but no" to the offer.  It would not sound very much like a partnership but a very difficult way for them to be great friends.</p> <p>  The CPO approach is fraught with risk and, critically, the specific risk of years of extension.  It is also entirely likely it would simply be never put to the test because the concept of the partnership could dissolve.</p></speech>

There is a very high test for parties to reach in circumstances where a very long lease has been offered at nominal rent.  I will touch on the St. Mary's site and building a hospital on the adjacent site.  What would the clinicians' opinion be of that?</p></speech>

The point is it does not achieve the physical integration that this co-location would achieve.  One of the points of the co-location is that in an emergency, where someone is haemorrhaging, with 4 litres of blood loss, for example, we must try to manage such cases in a stand-alone facility.  Sometimes we must transfer a patient when we cannot stop the bleeding.  We might need intervention radiology, for example, where we can put little plugs in blood vessels to stop the bleeding using an imaging technique.  We may need vascular or haematology backup.  We feel very lonely at 4 a.m. when we have a major haemorrhage.</p> <p>  In the new hospital we would be physically linked with the St. Vincent's hospital at theatre and intensive care unit level.  We would not be going outside from one building to another.  We would be wheeling a patient down the corridor to the interventional radiology, the intensive care unit or the theatre.  It is the really critical and brilliant element of the co-location that we will not find on another site.  That is as well as all the other services.  It is one of the really important elements.</p> <p>  We could build a hospital on the St. Mary's site or wherever else.  If it does not have the physical co-location, we would be missing a really important part of what this would achieve.  We want to be in a big hospital setting where we would not have to make transfers down any road because we would be right there and integrated where we need to be, particularly in emergencies.</p></speech>

There are hundreds of women on various waiting lists around the Ireland east area - not just in the Dublin south area - that are awaiting procedures.  We have had big investment in women's health this year and we will have big investment next year.  The Minister keeps mentioning the &euro;9 million programme and it is very helpful for women's health.  It will take more than a few years to get into this hospital but when we do we will have the extra operating facilities to meet that unmet need.  Gynaecology is still secondary to all the other sub-specialties in surgery that are required.  In the St. Vincent's hospital, for example, it is really hard to get theatre time.</p> <p>  We must keep site of what we are trying to deal with just to meet women's health.  It is not just maternity but women's health across a region.  This will be an Ireland east hospital and it will provide an enormous resource for all the women across Ireland and equally in the region of Ireland east, which is all of Leinster.</p></speech>

I am very comfortable that we had a robust debate and that some of the real issues, which are understandable issues, were discussed around making sure that we put in sufficient protections to address this issue of trust, which we have been talking about this morning.  I think that is okay.  It is good now.  The board, collectively, did not share that view with those two colleagues.  Equally, we respect their right to have those opinions.  As a board we were saying that we have sufficient protections, that things have moved on hugely over the last 12 months, that the excitement of having these extra services and greater capacity for reducing the risk, for example at 4 a.m. if something is going wrong, that all of those things remain true, and that we have a much quicker, stronger and coherent set of legal principles now then we even did 12 months ago.

My next question is for Mr. O'Donoghue.  If I was in a position to buy a home out in the country, and if I wished to see that passed on to future generations, or loved ones or relations, I would prefer a freehold title to a leasehold title.  That is just a layperson's view.  What rights does the State have after 200 years or 250 years in extending the leasehold on the new national maternity hospital?  Would that happen automatically or would it be negotiated?  What rights do we have as a State after that period?  I appreciate that it is a long time away and I appreciate that there has been an extension from the original plans with regard to the lease, but I believe that the ownership issue is one of the fundamental concerns that people have.  If the State wishes to renew or extend the lease after 250 years what rights does the State have?</p></speech>

As I said previously, many people may not know that they own a leasehold interest because there is nothing wrong with a leasehold interest and there is certainly nothing wrong with a long leasehold title.  It is seen as a good and marketable interest in property.  Anyone on the market today who is buying an apartment will buy a leasehold.  If they are selling on their apartment it is selling a leasehold.  Banks take a charge over leaseholds.  There is no problem whatsoever in that regard.</p> <p>  With the 299 year lease between St. Vincent's Holdings and the HSE there is a specific agreement within this document that provides that the HSE will not seek to extend the term of the lease or acquire the underlying freehold.  In certain circumstances where money is spent on land or buildings are built, the leasehold owner would have, under the landlord and tenant Acts, a right to acquire the freehold.  It goes back to the fact that this site is specifically being used by the State for the purpose of building a state-of-the-art maternity facility, on foot of a planning permission that was granted in 2017, and not for any other purpose.  There are some restrictions, including that the State will not sell on its interest to a third party.  That is agreed with St. Vincent's.  It wants to operate a public healthcare campus.  In 250 years' time, if the State decided that it no longer wished to carry out public healthcare, it would need to speak to St. Vincent's and hand it back the site.  It is agreed that it will not be seeking to extend the lease, other than by agreement between the parties.  The parties can agree to whatever they want but there is a minimum 299 year period.  The State will not try to use legislative provisions, under the landlord and tenant Acts, to acquire the underlying freehold.</p> <p>  I am very satisfied that the interest the State will acquire by way of a 299 year lease is absolutely protecting the State's interest in that building in order to deliver public healthcare facilities in the future.  If it is decided that a maternity facility is no longer required, in 50, 70, 90 or 100 years' time, and if the parties are happy with that, including the new designated activity company, DAC, that is set up, the State can use this site for other public healthcare facilities.  It does not necessarily have to be used as a maternity facility for 299 years.  That does not breach the terms of the lease.</p> <p>  I wish to correct a point that was made earlier.  The permitted use in the lease is to provide clinically appropriate and legally permissible services for maternity, but also any other public health care services.  It has been argued that this wording could provide a third party with a way of preventing certain services being provided.  It does not allow St. Vincent's to terminate any property rights or prevent the hospital being used by the State.</p></speech>

With regard to the transfer of shares that has taken place since the original board decision on 4 March, was this part agreed to in the Mulvey process?  Was there push back on this or were there protracted negotiations on this transfer?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-11a.634" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2022051100002#Z00500"><p>Perhaps Mr. Devane or Dr. Mahony could come in on the Mulvey agreement, but I will make one point.  The idea that the ownership of the land has anything to do with church influence at this point is simply not true.  The church, the nuns, the priests, the rabbis, the imams: none of them are involved.  St. Vincent's Healthcare Group is a secular and voluntary healthcare group that we are partnering with.  Whether the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group has the freehold, whether the national maternity hospital has the freehold, or whether the HSE has the freehold, has nothing to do with the church.  The church is off the pitch completely.  We really owe it to people to keep repeating that and reminding people that the church is gone.  The order is gone and the nuns are gone.  This is a secular healthcare organisation, with both of the groups involved.</p> <p>  The Senator made a point about where the governance structure came from.  It is my understanding that it came from the Mulvey agreement in 2016.  Dr. Mahony was involved in that and perhaps she will speak to it.</p></speech>

The legal framework that we are seeing now arises from the heads of agreement that were in the Mulvey agreement.  The Mulvey agreement was a partnership, which was an agreement between three parties: the State, St. Vincent's Hospital, and the national maternity hospital.  We sat down at the beginning of that to see how we were going to deliver this hospital, and how were we going to make sure that we would have a dedicated maternity facility that is totally protected to do all of its services and also protected in relation to budget and operations.  It is not just about termination of pregnancy.  It is about the whole service and having our own funding.  We did not want to be at the end of the line when we were looking for funding in a general hospital setting.  As I said, we had two mediations falling apart because we were going to be a branch.  That really was why we had the Mulvey mediation.  Very early on in that mediation we realised that ethos was not an issue at all and that religion was not a problem.  Actually, as always, the problem was making sure we were not a branch that would be promised ring-fenced funding.  Our colleagues in Cork had had a similar experience when joining a big general hospital and they were told funding would be ring-fenced for them.  It was not so easy for them.  We did not want any ring-fenced funding.  We wanted a proper company structure where we had our own service arrangement and where we had control of our building and control of our staff so we could run our hospital and every aspect of it.  That really was the key of the Mulvey mediation.  As I said, ethos actually was not an issue.</p> <p>  On the share transfer, it is important to make the point that when we were negotiating Mulvey, we knew that the nuns were leaving but we also knew that would be a process.  This is also why we made sure that the board of St. Vincent's could have no impact on the operation of the new national maternity Hospital DAC.</p><p>To make the point again, St. Vincent's is a totally secular organisation.  The current board has achieved that and it is something of which it is very proud.  It is proud to leave the church behind and to move forward into its future strategically as a hospital that provides great healthcare to its patients.</p></speech>

It has been a gruelling session, so I will keep my questions as concise as possible and remove any commentary.</p> <p>  The first is a legal question regarding the proposed 299-year lease.  Under clause 6.5 of the lease, the HSE loses its right of first refusal to acquire the premises on the later of 20 years after the HSE, as tenant, complies with its obligations under the sixth schedule, which refers to the building covenant, or 30 years from the date of the lease.  Why would the HSE forgo this right so soon into a 299-year lease under this clause?  Should the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group decide to sell the premises, will that open the HSE and this model to an unseen vulnerability?  There may be a simple legal response to that, but it is one of those matters that leaps out to the layperson when trying to digest all these complex documents.</p> <p>  My second question is for the Minister.  There is no doubt that this model is bespoke.  Whether one is in favour of it or against it, it is a bespoke model with the golden share element.  If a hypothetical similar arrangement were to come down the line somewhere else and if a future Minister for Health were to ask the current Minister if he would recommend this model to be used again, given his experience, would he recommend it?  I know he has confidence in this particular one but, as a model in the future, would he tell the future Minister to run a mile away from it and to go about it a different way as this was too much trouble legally and politically and that there will always be some concerns and risks inherent in it?  I would appreciate an answer to that.</p></speech>

The golden share in this case is a name but what is important is the legal powers that are attached to it.  There are other golden shares in other situations that may have different legal powers.  Essentially, it means that if for some reason the directors of the NMH fail in their obligations and their duty to ensure all services are provided and are provided without any religious influence, the Minister for Health can direct the board at his or her sole discretion.  It says at the end, for the avoidance of doubt, that the directors must comply with this.  That is very sensible.</p></speech>

Certainly, I am comforted, as the current Minister, that it is a power that I am not sure will ever need to be exercised because the hospital is going to do exactly what it is being set up to do, but it is useful because ultimately there is a mechanism for the State and for the Oireachtas via the Minister to intervene directly if needed.</p></speech>

The HSE loses its right of first refusal to acquire the premises on the later of 20 years after the HSE, as tenant, complies with its obligations under the sixth schedule or 30 years from the date of the lease.  Should SVHG decide for whatever reason to sell the site, which it is entitled to do, the HSE would lose the right of first refusal in what would be very early into a 299-year lease.</p></speech>

We felt a 30-year period or 20 years from when the hospital would be built would be sufficient.  Second, there are option agreements there.  There is an option agreement for the HSE to acquire the freehold interest where there is a default by St. Vincent's or where St. Vincent's becomes insolvent.  That is still there.  Giving somebody a right of first refusal for 299 years is tying, and we are not seeking to tie the hands of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  That was never part of this and it is the reason it is specific for a certain period of time.</p></speech>

The bottom line is to explain what the facts are.  The public - and I am one of them - want to see the hospital built but they need to understand in their own heads how it is getting to that point.

We need the hospital.</p> <p>  Finally, if this goes ahead now, when will the hospital be built and when will it be in operation for the women of Ireland?

That needs to be made very clear.  I ask the people putting out information about title to tell us why the State needs a freehold, what is wrong with the lease arrangement and, in particular, how a freehold would work without all the rights we have built into this document.  As has been pointed out before, the hospital will be on a shared campus.  There will be shared access routes and shared facilities.  That cannot be done with a freehold agreement, with a two-page transfer of land, with a "there you go".  There will still need to be an agreement between the State and St. Vincent's as to how they operate both those buildings.  That is all dealt with.  I ask anyone, including Deputy Shortall, to go through the document and tell me what is wrong with the State's interest for the next 299 years.</p></speech>

People are talking about a few different constitutions flying around and so on.  What it says in the constitutions of the companies further up the line is irrelevant to the operation of the national maternity hospital DAC.  We are all delighted now, for all the historical and emotional reasons, particularly for people of my generation, that any reference to the nuns or the sisters has been taken out.  Fundamentally, however, whatever is in those constitutions, whether as they are now or as amended in the future, has no bearing on how the national maternity hospital DAC operates.</p></speech>

There were legitimate questions and genuine concerns raised here today.  If we had another four hours, we probably would have brought up a lot more questions as well.  The timing is appalling in this regard.  We are against the clock on this issue.  As a committee, it has been impossible to try to organise witnesses to come in at the last minute.  People are very busy and they are coming from different backgrounds, so it has been very difficult.  We have not put ourselves in that position.  It is a result of whatever schedule the Minister and the Government are working to.  I think it has been very unfair on the committee the way we have been dealt with.  We are meeting now to try to arrange a meeting tomorrow and possibly the next day.  It is literally like that and we are going from A to B.</p> <p>  I have to close the meeting.  I thank the Minister and the witnesses for the comprehensive discussions with the committee today.  We will now go into private session.</p></speech>
