As the Chairman has named those who are with me this afternoon, I do not need to introduce them again.  The severe challenges in our important livestock sector, particularly our suckler cow sector, include low incomes, Brexit, beef prices which are below the cost of production, a lack of price competition, the proposed Common Agricultural Policy cuts, increased beef imports from Mercosur and other trade deals.  According to the latest Teagasc data for 2018, the average income on cattle rearing farms is just over &euro;10,000, which represents a decrease of 19% on the 2018 figure.  This is not sustainable.  We need a much stronger and more supportive Government policy for the suckler cow sector.</p> <p>  As part of the IFA campaign to secure additional targeted direct payments of &euro;200 per suckler cow, we retained the services of an eminent agricultural economist, Professor Thia Hennessy, who is the head of the Cork University Business School in UCC.  Professor Hennessy and her team undertook a full assessment and overview of the suckler beef sector.  They produced a comprehensive report, The Economic and Societal Importance of the Irish Suckler Beef Sector, in August of this year.  We launched the report at the Tullamore Show and presented a copy to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed.  Further copies were sent to all Members of the Oireachtas.  The objectives of the report were to assess the importance of the suckler cow herd to Irish agriculture, the Irish beef sector and the Irish economy, to examine the economic and social impact of the suckler herd, especially in terms of people and employment, and to explore environmental and policy issues relating to the suckler cow herd.  I understand that members of the committee were given a copy of Professor Hennessy's full report in advance of today&rsquo;s hearing.  This presentation provides a summary of the main findings and conclusions of the report.</p> <p>  This country's very significant beef sector accounts for more than a third of all agricultural output and over 20% of total Irish food and drink exports.  The agrifood sector in general provides direct and indirect employment to over 300,000 people, with over 13,000 people employed in the meat processing sector alone.  The value of beef exports is growing and exceeded &euro;2.6 billion in 2017.  Domestic consumption of Irish beef accounted for a further &euro;230 million last year.  It is estimated that the overall value of the Irish beef sector is almost &euro;2.9 billion.  According to CSO data, the large and valuable beef sector is supported by a suckler cow herd of approximately 1 million cows.  Recent reports based on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's animal movement identification system put the figure closer to 900,000.</p> <p>  The suckler cow herd is distributed throughout the country, but is particularly dominant in the west, which is my own part of the country.  The important regional presence of the suckler cow sector is reflected in the fact that suckler cows account for over 80% of all cows in the west, with the figure in excess of 90% in some counties.  Cattle farmers make a considerable contribution to the Irish local economy through the inputs they purchase and the outputs they produce.  There are almost 78,000 specialist cattle farms in Ireland.  It is estimated that cattle farmers spend over &euro;1.5 billion on agri-inputs each year.  Most of this is spent in the local rural economy.  The considerable economic impact of agriculture, particularly the beef sector, exceeds that of many other sectors in the Irish economy.  This means that an increase in output in the beef sector generates relatively more economic activity than a comparable increase in other industrial sectors.</p><p>Indeed, the multiplier effect for the beef sector is greater than that of the agriculture sector in general, with a &euro;1 million increase in beef sector output generating a further &euro;2.11 million in the wider economy and supporting an additional 16 jobs.  The comparative figure for the agriculture sector more generally is &euro;1.44 million. </p><p> Direct payments made to farmers also make a substantial contribution to the wider rural economy as farmers use these payments to purchase inputs and to generate output that leads to further economic activity.  Research has estimated that every &euro;1 of direct payments to cattle farmers supports &euro;4.28 of output in the wider economy.  In addition to the economic impact, suckler farmers contribute to wider societal sustainability, particularly as they are often located in marginal or economically disadvantaged areas where their presence is vital to the social and cultural fabric.  They produce public goods such as protection of the environment and biodiversity, the preservation of the landscape, and unique features such as stone walls and hedgerows, all of which contribute positively to the image of rural Ireland and to rural tourism.  Research has shown that extensive grass-based farm systems such as suckler cow farming deliver higher levels of public goods.</p><p> Despite being a small island on the edge of Europe, Ireland punches above its weight when it comes to beef exports.  This country is the largest exporter of beef in the EU and the sixth largest exporter of beef in the world.  The national suckler herd is of fundamental importance to Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a major exporter of high-quality prime beef.  Cattle from the suckler herd generally have a superior grading profile and heavier weight for age, resulting in higher saleable meat yield and higher value cuts.</p><p> The prevalence of Irish-owned companies in the beef sector and the relatively low reliance of beef farming and meat processing on imported inputs mean that beef exports make a major contribution to net foreign earnings in the Irish economy.  It is estimated that every &euro;100 of exports from the bio sector, which includes beef, generates &euro;48 in net foreign earnings, while the non-bio sector contributes only &euro;19. </p><p> Consumers worldwide are becoming increasingly concerned about the sustainability of food production.  This provides a unique opportunity for Ireland as we produce some of the world&rsquo;s most sustainable beef.  The carbon footprint of beef production in Ireland is well below the European average.  It is the fifth lowest in Europe and almost one quarter of the Brazilian footprint. The beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, is delivering further carbon efficiencies, with the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation estimating that, by 2030, the genetic gain achieved through the programme will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 14% per kilogramme of beef produced.</p><p> There are many positives around the sustainable system of Irish beef production.  The UN rated Ireland as the most water efficient producer of food globally, with a 0.2% stress rating.  Other international studies have shown that Ireland is the most nitrogen efficient producer of livestock products in Europe.  Animal welfare in Ireland is very high by global standards.  Growth promoters and hormone treatments are forbidden and our clean, green image is a major marketing strength internationally.  Furthermore, grass-fed beef has been proved to be healthier and lower in fat, with two to six times more omega-3 fatty acids.  As such, demand for grass-fed beef is growing, especially in affluent markets.</p><p> The positive attributes of our beef sector and our marketing and promotional campaigns are all built on the back of our quality suckler beef herd.  The economic outlook is for continued growth in the global demand for beef, with the OECD and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, FAO, projecting that global consumption of beef will grow by 9% by 2026.  The recent opening of the Japanese, Chinese and American markets for Irish beef is also a positive development, especially in light of the potential threat posed by Brexit.</p><p>However, those markets must deliver for farmers rather than just promise delivery.</p><p> Notwithstanding the economic importance of the beef sector to the wider Irish economy and its continued success on international export markets, the Irish industry is underpinned by a farm sector facing considerable economic difficulties.  The income situation on cattle farms in Ireland remains challenging, with the Teagasc national farm survey showing an average farm income of just &euro;12,500 for cattle-rearing farms in 2017.  On average, costs of production exceed market prices.  Reliance on direct payments is critical.  Without a substantial increase in beef prices or improvements in efficiency levels or both, the vast majority of cattle farmers will continue to rely on direct payments.</p><p> Furthermore, a number of threats loom on the horizon for the future of the Irish beef sector.  Brexit and other international trade agreements such as Mercosur threaten future trade patterns and, ultimately, farm-level prices.  The impending reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, may also impact on the value of direct payments to farmers.  The impact of climate change policy on the ability of the sector to exploit future market opportunities is a further threat as Ireland is committed to a number of international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  In the context of sustainable food production, however, international carbon leakage is a major concern.  Carbon leakage occurs if Ireland reduces the production of beef to meet international policy commitments but less carbon-efficient countries increase beef production to satisfy growing international demand.</p><p> The very difficult income situation on Irish suckler farms is unsustainable and is already resulting in individual farmers reducing animal numbers, leading to a loss in beef output, export values and employment.  It is estimated that a 10% contraction in the suckler cow herd would lead to a loss in beef output of &euro;145 million and a loss of total output in the economy of &euro;305 million.  A contraction in the Irish suckler cow herd may also lead to land abandonment in marginal areas, causing a loss of natural landscape features, biodiversity and a contracting rural community.</p><p> The Irish suckler cow sector is at a critical juncture.  A number of factors threaten its development and sustainability.  Without positive action, it is likely that these factors will lead to a contracting national suckler cow herd.  This will have implications for the large farming community engaged in suckler farming, the vibrancy of rural areas, the agri-input sector, employment in the beef processing sector, and the value of exports from Ireland.  These negative implications will be most harshly felt in the west of Ireland, particularly in local economies and communities where there may be limited alternative economic opportunities.</p><p> I will now hand over to our livestock chairman, Mr. Angus Woods, who will outline the developments leading up to and since the budget and further necessary action to support and maintain our suckler cow herd.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-18a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Angus Woods" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018121800002#O00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear.  The IFA is fully committed to supporting our national suckler herd and the approximately 75,000 full and part-time farmers involved in the enterprise.  In practice, this means campaigning hard to get the Government to provide additional targeted direct support for sucklers and working to secure a price premium for quality suckler beef.  The most recent numbers from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine show that we are now down to approximately 67.000 farmers, a drop of almost 9,800 over the past ten years.  Cow numbers are down by approximately 76,000 over the same period.  However, suckler registrations in recent years have been falling at a rate of 30,000 to 40,0000 per year, significantly more than is initially apparent.</p> <p>  Following an intensive IFA campaign on sucklers throughout 2018 and with substantial help from members of the committee, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine announced an additional &euro;20 million of national resources to assist the suckler herd in budget 2019.  The new beef environmental efficiency pilot, BEEP, scheme, worth &euro;40 per suckler cow, will be introduced in January 2019.  While it was a clear recognition by the Minister of the income problems in the suckler sector and the &euro;40 per cow is welcome, it is not enough and it is clear that far more needs to be done to help sustain the suckler sector.</p><p> We have met the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the implementation of the scheme.  The Department has outlined that the beef environmental efficiency pilot will involve a simple application in February, weighing cows and calves once during the year and submitting the details to the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation by app, online or on paper.  We have made it clear that the full &euro;40 per cow must be paid to farmers.  In addition, we have strongly emphasised that the measures under the new scheme must be kept simple and be farmer-friendly.  The beef data and genomics scheme, BDGP, which is worth &euro;44.4 million per annum to 24,200 suckler farmers, got bogged down in unnecessary bureaucracy because the Government did not listen to farmers in the design stage.  Payments of &euro;100 per cow on the first ten cows and &euro;80 on the remainder cannot not be ignored considering the low levels of income in suckling.  The scheme has completed four years and has two more to run to 2022.  Now is the time to complete a review of the scheme, work out how it can be changed and simplified, and plan for its future continuation.</p><p> In advance of CAP 2020, the IFA is lobbying hard at national and European level to reverse the budget cuts proposed by the Commission and to seek an increase in the CAP budget.  We want member states to increase their contributions to protect direct payments and farm income and take account of inflation.  CAP direct payments are critical to livestock farmers, and increasing targeted payments under Pillar 2 will be essential.  We must be aware of the fact that originally CAP payments such as the special beef premium, slaughter premium and the suckler cow premium were targeted at livestock farmers.  Many beef farmers have witnessed severe cuts to their direct payments and incomes during recent CAP reforms, and this cannot continue under the Hogan reforms.  Increased targeted support for suckler farmers must come from a larger CAP Pillar 2 and additional national resources.  The IFA has been clear in its view that reform cannot involve any cuts to the basic payment scheme.  Suckler farmers must be properly rewarded with a significant beef price premium to reflect the superior quality and higher production standards and associated costs.</p><p> In recent meetings with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, and the factories, we have proposed a significant suckler-bred bonus for prime cattle coming from the suckler herd.  The meat industry has emphasised the importance of maintaining the suckler herd from a quality and marketing perspective.  Those in the industry must match this with a price premium.</p><p> A strong live export trade to drive competition and provide alternative market outlets is essential for the beef sector and the suckler cow herd.  The Government needs to support the live export trade strongly and increase capacity, especially considering the increase in our dairy cow numbers.  The Minister and the Department must work with the exporters, Bord Bia, the ferry companies and shippers to target a major increase in live exports for 2019.</p><p> There are many challenges to the Irish beef sector and our specialised suckler cow sector.  These include the challenges of Brexit, CAP reform, Mercosur trade negotiations and beef prices below the costs of production.  However, the biggest single issue is low farm incomes.  Incomes on suckler farms are far too low and under severe pressure.  The latest Teagasc figures for 2018 point to an income of a little over &euro;10,000, which represents a 19% income fall from 2017.  This is not sustainable and Government action must be taken to address it.</p><p> We need a stronger and more supportive policy from Government for the suckler cow sector, and we need to maintain our vitally important suckler cow herd.  To do this, we need a targeted direct payment of &euro;200 per cow.  We need a major price premium for suckler beef, and we need a strong live export trade that will drive competition.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-18a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1378" speakername="Rose Conway Walsh" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018121800002#P00300"><p>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, and I thank the IFA for this report.  It is important, particularly in the climate that we are in with Brexit and so on.  My interest stems from the extent to which it impacts on the west of Ireland, with 80% of the cows there being suckler cows.</p><p>I am deeply concerned about the pressures being put on the suckler cow herd and the impact they will have on the wider rural economy and on farm family incomes.  It has been stated that the average income is &euro;12,529, but this is not the average income for farmers in the west.  I know it is based on one survey, but there is another that suggests income is more like &euro;3,000 a year.  We need to be a bit careful with the average figures we are putting out because they will impact on Government policy.</p><p> There are several ways to address this.  There is the &euro;200 per cow.  There is also the possibility the CAP might be cut and the need for basic payments.  Does the IFA understand that basic payments must be weighted in favour of farms in the west?  The IFA has suggested a cap, but I am not quite sure where it suggests that cap should be.  Is it &euro;100,000?  Will the witnesses explain what they mean by labour being taken into account?  Historically, the basic payments have been in favour of the bigger farmers.  We can go back to 2000 and 2001 to look at some of the wrongs done that still need to be righted.  What model does the IFA advocate in terms of the basic farm payment?</p><p> My next question is on areas of natural constraint.  We have the details of the area being extended, but it is obvious we need additional payments to be able to compensate farmers according to the level of constraint on the land they are trying to farm.  These questions are all related.  I am very concerned about people who will come off the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, at the end of this month.  What is there for them?  Has the IFA discussed this with the Department?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-18a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018121800002#Q00200"><p>I thank the IFA witnesses for their presentation.  It is interesting, but there is nothing new for those of us who live in my county.  We know this at first hand because every time we meet farmers, particularly in the suckler cow area, they tell us exactly what is happening on the ground.  The west, as Senator Conway-Walsh has said, is highly dependent on suckler cows.  In the midlands it is a fairly important source of farming activity.  The fall-off will continue, so let us not start codding ourselves.  I have little time for anyone who tries to pretend this will not happen.  Of course it will happen.  In my country a significant level of dairy conversion is taking place.  Farmers are business people.  They are gravitating to where there is a possibility of some sort of a decent income.  It is not just happening in Westmeath or the midlands.  It is happening even in Deputy Cahill's county of Tipperary and in Cork, Waterford and Kilkenny.  We have seen a huge drop in suckler cow numbers over the past six or seven years, and 35,000 or 36,000 cows have come out of the system.  That is huge.  We have lost almost 80,000 cows over the past seven years.  I read Professor Hennessy's full report, which is very good and very useful.</p><p>I would say the IFA itself, at executive level, was not surprised by the findings.  It merely vindicated what it knew what was happening and this report allows it to present the findings to various bodies.  It is quite clear that the current trend is going to continue, with income from suckler cow activity falling.  When the numbers are calculated at the end of this year, we will see significant increases in input costs because of the drought and the fodder shortages that resulted from the very harsh and prolonged winter.  </p><p> I probably am one of the strongest advocates for the BDGP.  While there have been some teething problems with the programme in terms of stars, breeding and so on, those problems can be ironed out by the time we embark on a 2020 programme.  We should start dealing with the various issues now in order to have them ironed out by then.  We must be honest, however, and admit that were it not for that programme, a huge number of farmers would have left the beef sector altogether.  A significant number of farmers are tied into the BDGP until 2020 and while people may give out about the programme, it does yield some benefits.  If farmers were not tied into the programme, the fall in suckler farmer numbers would have been even sharper than that outlined by the IFA this afternoon.  I agree with those commentators who argue that the fall-off in suckler farmer numbers could accelerate further after 2020 if we do not get our house in order.  Apart altogether from its impact in terms of our carbon footprint, we need a new BDGP to prevent the suckler farmer situation from worsening.  </p><p> Four farmers visited my house recently.  They were in relaxed mode and spoke freely.  Those farmers told me that they would be approaching the IFA and others, not in aggressive way, and would tell them to wake up and smell the coffee.  Farmers are getting poor prices, while the beef processors are quite happy to see stock numbers remaining relatively level.  The processors will continue behaving in the fashion to which we have all become accustomed, namely, the free market model of screwing farmers.  I am a member of a party that does not support the absolutist free market model.  We have been condemned by many for expressing the view that the free market model is not the healthy option.  There should be more socialism operating in this area.  In any event, farmers are now saying that they would be better off taking their basic farm payments and giving over some of their land to forestry.  If they set aside 10 acres for forestry, they will get X premium but if they set aside 15 to 20 acres, they will get X plus Y premium.  This is the way farmers are thinking.  The four suckler farmers to whom I spoke are now wondering about the future.  One of them has three sons and he told me that he knows that none of them will succeed him.  If farmers in Westmeath are talking like that, in a county that has a tradition of beef farming, then we must pay attention.  I am not making this up.  One of the farmers has sent me on a list of actions that he believes need to be taken and I will send it on to some of the witnesses here today.  He believes that we must face reality and stop skirting around the issues.</p><p>The equation is simple enough: lower minimal market returns relative to the input costs of production.  Without the basic farm payment system the industry would disappear, as it would not be viable.</p><p> The IFA is right in identifying something I have been talking about for the past two years, namely, the CAP budget and the loss of almost &euro;11 billion or &euro;12 billion from the UK Government.  That is absolutely staggering.  If we do not get EU member states making up the deficit, that could well be the situation.  There are four or five very large member states that have indicated clearly they have no intention of making a contribution to make up the deficit.  We cannot be left alone.  We will not be making up the deficit of &euro;10 billion or &euro;12 billion.  We have to be very careful about that.</p><p> There are good things apart from the impact on rural areas.  It is a highly export-oriented industry; nine of every ten animals we produce go to export with a major earning capacity deriving from that.  There is sustainability and we have the beef data and genomics programme.  The IFA has previously made the argument that given the demand for quality beef across the world, if we do not produce it somebody else will.  The Brazilians are ready to capitalise.  They are knocking down half their forests and then transporting stuff across the world.  That is a double whammy.  They are taking out the sequestration capacity and increasing it at the other end by the transport issues.</p><p> All of that is there.  We have a clean, green, grass-fed image.  We better face up to reality.  I am acutely aware of family circumstances with a suckler farm close to home.  I cannot see my nephews and nieces taking up the suckling enterprise in the current climate.  How could they rear two or three children and put them through college on that income?</p><p> It is a very big job and it is very easy to give out about farm organisations.  For once I will not castigate the IFA representatives in this situation.</p></speech>

There will be protests by yellow vests across the Continent on a different topic because it seems to be the "in thing" now.  We must remember that consumers will forget they are getting a cheap healthy product and they will kick up when the cupboard becomes bare in their countries' exchequers.  It is a big one.  Coming from the county I do, I want to see it not just survive, but thrive.  We have to face up to it.  While I cannot tell farming organisations what to do, there should be a major event focused specifically on this matter in February or March to see what can be done in a constructive way to ensure the future sustainability of the beef industry.  I will certainly support any of the IFA's efforts in that regard.</p></speech>

I am very conscious of the importance of the suckler cow sector.  Leitrim has five marts whose staple is selling weanling calves with farmers coming from other parts of the country to buy them and bring them away because our land generally is not good enough to finish the cattle.</p><p>While there may be suckler enterprises in many areas, many suckler farmers in other counties also finish as well as suckle, whereas that possibility is not there in Leitrim and many western counties.</p><p> Page 16 of the report deals with family farm income on cattle rearing farms, in particular the income from the market as well as from subsidies.  From 2000 to 2016, one can see the income is around the &euro;10,000 to &euro;12,000 mark but, in fact, it is practically zero from the market.  Therefore, if the subsidies were not there, there would be no money at all, which is one of the big issues.  We need to recognise this is an enterprise that is making no money apart from direct payments and payments from other schemes, given nearly all suckler farmers are also involved in GLAS and other environmental schemes, because that is the nature of their farming.  I see pressure coming all the time from the dairy sector to switch over to dairy where the land is good enough, and more and more farmers are getting out of suckler farming and going into dairy because that is where the money is.  That will put pressure on the number of weanling calves and, therefore, the number of beef cattle coming into the marts and going on to be finished.</p><p> I want to tease out with the witnesses the issue of the proposed payment of &euro;200 per cow.  I agree we have to come up with some sort of solution.  The fear I have, and some farmers have said this to me, is that the targeted payment of &euro;200 per cow will simply go to the factories and the price will start to slip back.  We could end up in a situation where farmers get the &euro;200 per cow but, because the subsidy is in place, production will go up and that will be an excuse to push prices down, and the farmer will end up not gaining very much.  That seems to be the trend when we look at the family farm income on the charts, given it has changed very little through all the years, no matter what scheme came or went and no matter how high or low the payments.  It is almost as if it was decided, "We will keep farmers at a certain level so they will survive, we will always get the cheap raw material from them and we will make the money on it."  Every few years the farmer gets a middling good year and it gives them the confidence to stick at it but they then get three or four bad years.  One would think there was some master puppeteer in the background playing this game with the Irish suckler sector in particular.</p><p> I am somewhat cynical about all of this.  I know the farm organisations are lobbied by the farmers and the pressure is coming on from all angles to try to find a solution.  However, the big point is that the suckler sector creates huge economic activity in the micro-economy of the region where it exists, as is the case in Country Leitrim and many other areas.  When the cow calves, a vet is needed, meal is needed and there are all the various inputs.  In addition, there is good husbandry and the farmers are involved in GLAS because it suits their style of farming.  The report recognises that suckler farming has this multiplier effect in rural areas where there is very low income.</p><p> While I did not read every word of the report, I searched it to find the level of single farm payment to suckler farmers in the west compared with other areas.  I expect it is much lower in the west and, with all due respect to suckler farmers in Westmeath, I suspect many of them finish the cattle and that the farming is a little more intensive.  This meant that, back in 2000 or 2001, they got a better basic payment based on that style of farming than the payment to the fellow outside of Ballinaglera who has 60 acres on the side of a mountain and is trying to rear a couple of cows and a few calves.  Such farmers got a raw deal 20 years ago and they are still getting that raw deal today, which needs to be recognised.  I take the point that the IFA does not want to see any farmer lose money.  However, there has to be recognition somewhere that there was a raw deal for those farmers.</p><p>That is the reason many are leaving the sector.  When farmers on better land want to buy decent weanlings in two or three years, they will not be able to do so because the farmers supplying them will be gone.  Then we will see what is going to happen.  This whole sector will disappear.  We will arrive at a crucial tipping point if there is a further reduction of 15% to 20%.  That seems likely to happen in the next few years.  At that stage, the sector will be beyond recovery.  There will then be an emphasis on examining the possibility of getting beef cattle from the dairy sector.  I do not think that is going to happen or that it is possible.  There may be some movements in that direction and perhaps some improvements in breeding and genetics.  However, I do not see how dairy cows can produce the kind of beef cattle needed to retain the quality of the meat Ireland produces.</p><p> This is all about price.  Figure 2 on page 16 highlights that the big problem in this regard relates to the price the farmer gets.  I am referring to the price farmers get at the factory and, therefore, the price they get for weanlings produced down the line.  This is the elephant in the room with which we must deal  I have raised this matter with the Minister on several occasions and he always comes back with the same mantra to the effect that he cannot interfere in pricing.  We know that and that there are various rules.  At the same time, however, the Exchequer and the taxpayer are paying a great deal of money to market this beef all over the world.</p><p> We send representatives from An Bord Bia here, there and everywhere in order to find new markets.  Who benefits from such activity?  There is certainly no benefit to the farmer in Ballinaglera to whom I refer who is rearing a few cows and selling a few weanlings.  That individual is getting very little out of it.  If the taxpayer is going to put money into marketing this product, which has major potential and no one is denying that aspect, there needs to be recognition of the need for some way of ensuring that primary producers get a decent return for their efforts.  That seems to be missing in all of this.</p><p> Reference was made to a payment of &euro;200 per cow as being the golden bullock that is going to solve all of these problems.  I hope this turns out to be the case but I am cynical about it.  I have seen what happened in the context of every previous scheme.  There was always a way in which the taxpayers' money or the European money ended up in the hands of the same people.  Somehow or other it ended up back with the big guys.  I am talking mainly about the processors and the supermarkets.  They end up with all of the money and the producers end up being squeezed.  This is all about achieving balance in the sector and how that can be done.  How can a scheme be introduced that will be ensured to have the impact sought without unintended consequences?  I will work with anyone to do that and make it happen.</p><p> The report, however, is really a cry stating the sector is going down the Swanee if something is not done soon.  There has to be some way of ensuring that pricing is central.  We can talk about subsidising as long as we like and we will need to subsidise.  I understand that concept and there has to be a way of doing it.  The problem we have, however, is that the European consumer is paying a dear price for an excellent quality product but the European producer, here in Ireland, is not getting the return for it.  That disconnect is the big problem.  It will be excellent if the &euro;200 per cow works but please show me how it will work without having unintended consequences. </p></speech>

I welcome the president and his team.  I recognise the work done by the organisation in commissioning this report and the work of those who contributed to it, namely, Professor Thia Hennessy, Dr. Justin Doran, Professor Joe Bogue and Dr. Lana Repar.  It is a valuable assessment of the challenges and difficulties facing the suckler sector now and that will continue to face the sector in the short term.</p> <p>  I would like the witnesses to flesh out a number of matters in more detail.  The first of these relates to the return for farmers.</p><p>There is no doubt that margins in the sector are very low and that beef suckler farmers have had to farm very well in order to make a profit.  However, it has the largest number of farmers of any sector and very many people depend on it.  Figures published in today's edition of the <i>Irish Independent </i>indicate a nationwide drop of 11% in suckler cow figures from 2012 to last year.  In my county of Donegal, the herd number decreased from 45,000 in 2012 to its current level of slightly more than 39,000.  Unlike some southern counties, there is no significant transition into milk farming in Donegal, so the decrease indicates that people are starting to keep fewer cows because, unfortunately, they do not currently perceive a profit margin in the sector.<br/><br/>What impact do the factories have on the margin that farmers receive?  It appears that whenever the numbers go up, the factories squeeze their margins.  The factories defend themselves by indicating that they pay a European average price.What is the IFA's perspective on the role of the factories in the food chain and the passing on of margins?  Is the increasing number of cattle going through feed lots in recent years having an impact on the margins that farmers receive?  Does the beef grid need to be looked at again and addressed, particularly in regard to the many farmers who believe they are missing out on proper payments and also in regard to how the quality assurance scheme is operated and the many instances in which farmers are not paid the quality assurance despite having followed the pertinent rules?<br/><br/>We have discussed on many occasions the need for a &euro;200 payment per suckler cow.  The IFA has campaigned very actively on the issue.  Fianna F&aacute;il has been very proactive and brought a motion proposing that payment before the D&aacute;il early in the summer, as the witnesses are aware.  The payment would be made from Exchequer funds.  In terms of how it should be applied and implemented, what would be the best way to deliver it to farmers?<br/><br/>Climate change is a continuing challenge which will become more significant in the coming years.  What do we need to start doing differently in terms of suckler cow farms in order to address climate change?  The smart farming initiative pilot scheme in which the IFA has been very involved has shown that gains can be made without impacting on production.  What additional measures can be taken in the suckler cow sector to contribute to reaching our climate targets without affecting production?<br/><br/>The unfortunate reality is that unless we ensure a proper margin for suckler farmers, production will drop.  That has been the trend.  Unless that trend is addressed, it will continue.  The need for a premium for suckler cow beef was mentioned.  How much potential is there for such a premium?  In recent years, British multiples in particular have been quite happy to use beef from the dairy herd for steak cuts and shelf cuts.  Some 50% of our beef goes to the British market.  How can we obtain a premium for suckler cow beef?  Is there potential in such a measure and, if so, where?</p></speech>

The Minister was before the committee a couple of weeks ago and there was a fair outburst about the position of the beef industry.  Unfortunately, there is great despondency about this matter.  Farmers just cannot continue with the returns they are getting, so people will begin to vote with their feet and leave the industry.  A kill of 40,000 per week is just not sustainable.  The mantra previously was that once we went above 30,000 per week, we would be unable to sell that number of cattle profitably.  It has been 40,000 per week for two months or more and we are bearing the brunt of that in the returns being received.  The only way that can be reduced and our herd retained is through live exports.  We have had misfortunes with Turkey whereby that market is virtually closed to us.  We hear a great deal about different markets opening up but they will not take a huge volume of cattle.  It is essential that we get a significant number of black and white calves out of the country next spring.  We must emphasise getting 400,000 to 500,000 Friesian calves out of the country if we are to bring any balance back to the kill.  That will take a period of time.</p> <p>  I have a few other observations.  We are focusing here on the suckler herd, and I accept it is under pressure, but if we pit farmer against farmer we will go down a slippery slope.  This should not be about the suckler herd versus the beef produce coming from the dairy herd.  The returns from all systems in beef farming at present are not sustainable, whether it is calf to beef or finishing the weanlings bought in the west of Ireland.  Regardless of the system, the returns are unsustainable.  The figures for the end price being paid and the cost of producing the beef are not balancing.  People are going to get out of winter-finishing and calf-to-beef systems and they will leave suckler farming.  We must recognise that all systems are under pressure.</p> <p>  We must also face up to the problem of the Jersey cross and the lack of meat yield from such an animal.  Some farmers are trying to offload their Jersey calves, especially through live exports, as something other than what they are.  That cannot be allowed to happen.  Teagasc has much for which to answer.  There is no evaluation of the lack of profit for having Jersey in the progeny.  There is the loss in the price of the calf and the loss in the carcass weight for the cow.  Many monitor farms run by Teagasc are promoting cross breeds, but there has never been a focus on the negative aspect of income from the beef returns available.  Every farm has beef returns, whether from the sale of a calf or that of a culled cow.  In my view, that has never been factored into the EBI or the profitability of any system.  That must be addressed.</p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue referred to the grid.  The grid has not done what it was meant to do and must be re-examined.  It definitely will not solve all the ills of the industry.  Where the base is set is wrong.  It should be set at the old level and there should be bonuses from there up.  A huge proportion of the kill is suffering losses on the grid.  The only people who have made money from the grid are the beef processors.  They are doing that with the quality assurance scheme as well.  The number of cattle failing to qualify for quality assurance is substantial, but one never sees that on the package of beef for sale in Sainsbury's in the UK.  One will not see whether it is an O-, O= or O+ steer.  It will be sold as Irish beef.  If one goes into a McDonald's, one sees that it is quality assured beef, but in the vast majority of cases the farmer is not getting any recompense for being in the quality assurance scheme.</p> <p>  We talk about our quality assurance and other schemes and say that we are producing the best beef in the world and that our suckler beef is of great quality.  It is of such quality.</p><p>Unfortunately, retailers and consumers will take all that from us but will not pay us anything in return.  If we set our standards high, the retailers will love it and the consumers will be happy, but unfortunately there is no premium being paid for that.  Beef farmers are in a very despondent mood.  Direct payments are under pressure.  Mercosur is lurking in the background and Brexit is the greatest challenge of all.  It is easy to understand why farmers are despondent.</p><p> The report is welcome, but I repeat that we should not set farmer against farmer.  Our beef industry is not making money for anyone involved in it and we need to resolve that.  I accept fully that suckler herds need help if the industry is going to survive.  Deputy McConalogue referred to the motion we put down early in the year and the industry must get specialist help.  Let us not go down a slippery slope of setting one system of cattle farming against another.  No system is making money and it has to change or our beef industry will disappear.  The figures in the report about what it contributes to the local economy cannot be overestimated.  The contribution of active farmers to a rural area cannot be overestimated.</p><p> People are pushing forestry and Deputy Martin Kenny strongly makes the point that the introduction of too much forestry can be terminal for an area.  We must be conscious of that when we talk about our beef industry.  In large parts of the country, if the beef industry disappears, it will be replaced by trees and, when that happens, the services in those rural communities will also disappear.  </p><p> Our beef industry is at a crossroads and what is there at the moment cannot continue.  No one is going to stay in an industry that is taking hammering after hammering and, as has been said by a number of speakers, the next generation will definitely not go down this route.  We discussed, before the meeting commenced in public session, the amount of young farmers entering the industry and if people see the poor returns and the lack of profitability in the different cattle regimes, whether it is calf-to-beef or sucker farming, those potential farmers will say it is not for them.  They will take other options with the land and once those other options are taken there is no reversing out of that decision.</p></speech>

Everybody knows the situation of the sector and of agriculture in general.  I am a suckler farmer and the proceedings here have done nothing to lift my spirits.  We are all solution driven but where are we going to get the solution?</p> <p>  The report is excellent in highlighting the difficulties with the sector.  There is an elephant in the room and the contribution the sector makes to the rural community has been highlighted.  My neighbours and I are sucker farmers because, as Deputy Penrose mentioned earlier, in the area I come from it is not possible to go into dairy or large-scale tillage.  Suckler and sheep farming are the only two sectors to which the area is conducive.  As has been pointed out in the report, the suckler herd is making a contribution in local, small, rural economies and creating jobs.  In many cases the only thing sustaining the suckler farm is that the farmer holds one of those jobs on a part-time or full-time basis.  The farmer's off-farm income sustains the enterprise.  By the nature of the types of jobs these farmers are taking, it will be a double whammy, a perfect storm, if there is mass abandonment of the suckler herd in areas like those about which I am talking because those little part-time jobs are the first ones that will go.  The people about whom we are talking will be hit on the double and that is a frightening scenario that is totally predictable if we cannot sustain the sector.</p><p>If there is a problem in any sector or walk of life, or inside the bubble here, one is directed towards the solution being education.  On this one, however, a bit of PR and education could be part of the solution, leaving the fiscal answers, the &euro;200 cow and the CAP aside.  The  sector is being damned when one talks about climate change.  It is not being highlighted to the general public that we are an agricultural society.  When one compares it to transport and power generation, we never had an industrial revolution in this country.  It is getting negative press and people are promoting the notion that if we all went vegan, the problem would be solved notwithstanding the fact that we would still be driving around in diesel guzzling cars and lorries while flying across the world.  Collectively in the political bubble and the representative bodies, we must try to get a sea change in the attitude.</p><p> We talk about premiums for our suckler beef, but 99 times out of 100, the housewife shops with her purse, not her eyes.  Suckler calves, dairy calves and dry cows are going into the food chain and it is all being consumed.  How well are we promoting things locally, nationally and internationally?  While we all praise Bord Bia and the export markets, are there questions to be asked about how well issues are being promoted around the good carbon footprint and the high quality by virtue of the fact that it is grass-fed suckler beef?  Is it getting the premium promotion it deserves?  Until it is respected internationally and on the shelves in supermarkets, there cannot and probably will not be a premium.  We might have to go back to basics to start promoting this product again.  It might look like we are reversing the procedure but one might have to go back to the very basics.  I do not have the answers and I do not know where they are going to come from but it might be something as basic as having to go back and readvertise, repromote and rehighlight the quality because it is not being highlighted enough.  There could be a bubble out there.  I do not like saying it but it might be ready to burst.  What promotion have we done on this green grass-fed suckler beef?  Where are the dairy calves going when they are fattened?  Will someone realise at some point that people are not all getting what they think they are getting?  I would like to hear some more opinion on that from the witnesses' side.</p></speech>

I wonder about the increases proposed in the payment under CAP.  How are we going to stop the beef factories?  The prices will not improve in the factories so what is the point of it?  Is it solely that the Government or EU is agreeing the payment so that beef factories will continue to keep prices down?  That is the reality of the situation and I do not know how one gets around it or what one does around it, but we have to find something different in relation to it.  Deputy Penrose mentioned some possible solutions.  Alternatives could include farmers putting some of their land into forestry to get a premium for that.  That is over and above and not directly related to suckler cows and would allow them to increase their incomes.  Bizarrely, it would go some way to meeting the carbon reduction requirements also.  Factories are going to capitalise on whatever farmers get and we may simply have to put up our hands and acknowledge that is the way it is going to be.  For every &euro;100 from CAP or the Government, the same amount will drop in the factories and that is fair enough and we will have to live with it.  If that is the case, we should be saying so.  I do not know how we get around it.</p> <p>  We must also look at the suckler versus the dairy herd.</p><p>Everybody says the dairy herd is causing the problems for the suckler sector now or that the suckler herd is responsible for the extra carbon, or that we are making money out of the dairy herd of whatever.  All this has to be thought out and must not be considered in isolation.  It is a very difficult problem and I do not know how a solution can be found, as is evident from the contributions of the members today.  It will be interesting to see how it develops.  I am interested in hearing whether the delegates have ideas on how any increase from the Government might not result in a reduction in the factories.  The impact it will have has been outlined here.  We will be back here next year raising the same issue and there will still not be any positive outcome, unfortunately.</p></speech>

I was required in the Seanad.</p> <p>  I have just a few questions, which I hope are not too repetitious.  We are all referring to the same themes.  I wish to refer to the weak bargaining position of the farmer in the food supply chain and the efforts made at EU level to address this.  I understand addressing it will have an impact on the multiple retailers.  How do the delegates propose to address the issue of the meat processors and the factories in order to get a fairer price?</p> <p>  A report by Iowa State University was brought to my attention.  It shows that farmers in that state are getting 45% of the retail price of beef.  Our farmers are getting only half of that.  Why is that?  What can we learn from that?  What are the differences that would give rise to beef farmers in Iowa getting more for their animals?</p> <p>  On the issue of the beef forum, from which the delegates removed themselves, is there not a need for the forum to resume and for all stakeholders to sit around the table to discuss the various issues, including the concern over the price beef processors are giving to the farmers, the primary producers?  Can this not be thrashed out?  As the Chairman knows, when representatives of Bord Bia are before this committee, there is always talk of the free market and it is said we have to let market forces operate to an extent.  The market is supported by the Government, however, and the taxpayer pays for Bord Bia finding new markets.  The Minister goes abroad winning new markets.  All this helps the meat factories and retailers concerned.  If they do not acknowledge that it is unsustainable if farmers do not get a better price for their beef, there will be no farmers in the sector.  We are aware issues arise over land mobility, including the issue of young farmers not being able to access land and not being interested in doing so because of issues such as the one we are discussing, especially on the beef side.  Obviously, it is beef we are talking about here today.  I would like some feedback on those comments.  I apologise if there is repetition.</p></speech>

Will the delegates comment on the legislation being introduced in Europe?  How could we make it stronger from our perspective?  I do not believe the legislation proposed is strong enough.  What can we do at national level to ensure it is strengthened?  There was talk about, and the delegates made recommendations on, having a process similar to that across the water, where there is an independent arbitrator in place to deal with difficulties in the sector.  There has been a lot of talk here about the processors.  The large multiples have a large part to play in the overall equation.  That needs to be tackled.</p> <p>  On the point Deputy Cahill made, having farmer against farmer is not a way to go.  It is regarded as a solution to everything.</p><p>Everyone in the entire agriculture sector has a part to play in helping to solve the difficulty.</p><p> There was some talk in the past about the part producer groups might play although not so much in more recent times.  Some other sectors or groups have been talking up that proposition in more recent times.  I am keen to hear the comments of the IFA deputation on that question as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-18a.37" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Healy" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018121800002#AA00200"><p>I will start with the Chairman's comments and then work back.  The Chairman raised several points, including on unfair trading practices.  I was in Brussels yesterday to meet the Austrian Minister, Ms K&ouml;stinger, and we met the Commissioner, Mr. Hogan, as well.  The meeting was mainly around the Common Agricultural Policy but we got to talking about the unfair trading practices because the negotiators failed to reach agreement last week in the trilogue.  Another meeting is due to convene tomorrow.  Those involved hope that, because meetings have been arranged in the background, they can reach agreement on the way to move forward.  That is crucial.  At least discussions are continuing and the Commissioner is keen for things to move on at pace in the coming months because of the European elections and the Commission changes this time next year.  I hope they will reach some sort of agreement on that tomorrow and then the process can be moved on for legal status.</p> <p>  I was asked about some areas that might be improved.  There is provision for a three-year review.  I realise it is three years down the line, but at least we will be able to see what the teething problems are and what areas might need improvement.</p> <p>  As mentioned, there is an absolute need for an independent ombudsman.  In one of these rooms we heard representatives of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission clearly state &ndash; the Chairman will remember this - that the commission's role was to defend the consumer and they had little interest in defending the producer.  They said a different person was needed to do that.  There is a perfect example in the UK with Christine Tacon, who is the UK Groceries Code Adjudicator.  She has stated that the very fact she is in that position almost renders the position unnecessary, but if she was taken out of it for a few weeks we would all see what would happen.  The retailers know she is there and they are afraid of her.  They fund the office and if she does not spend the money doing research into unfair trading practices then they get the money back.  There is a need for such an arrangement here.</p> <p>  Another area where there is major need for scrutiny is the factories.  This goes back to some earlier questions.  Transparency is a major area within the agricultural markets task force proposals.  Everyone knows what the farmer is getting for the beef, more or less.  The base price today is &euro;375 or &euro;385.  People know what the consumer is paying at the other end.  Senator Michelle Mulherin raised this point and referred to farmers receiving 45% of the retail price for beef.  It is difficult to know what happens between the processor and the retailer.  There is a lack of information and knowledge in that area.  Transparency is required.  I hope the proposals passed at European level will give us more room.</p> <p>  There were numerous observations and statements with a fair amount of repetition among people but overall people took the view that the report, which is what we came in to discuss, was good and worthwhile and that Professor Hennessy did a good job.</p> <p>  Senator Conway-Walsh, who is not present at the moment, asked about the capping issue.  That has been put in the proposals by the Commissioner, not the IFA.  Some associated figures have been mentioned.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the areas of natural constraints, ANC, scheme.  We ran a series of meetings around the country in the build-up to the review of the scheme.  We had several priorities but chief among them was that the ANC payments would reflect the natural handicap of any given area.</p><p>We lobbied long and hard for this and lobbied all the members of the committee individually.  I should have thanked members for their support for our lobbying on suckler cow payments.  That was our priority in our pre-budget submission.  We got good support from this committee and many of its members highlighted the issue and kept it to the fore.  We did not get all we wanted but it was a start.  </p><p> We lobbied to get the ANC payments restored to 2008 levels at least and between the budget before last and the most recent budget, they were restored to that level.  However, they need to be increased further.  The ANC scheme review has been done and the proposals in that respect have been set out.  Four thousands extra areas have been included and 1,300 have been lost out.  We are engaged in explaining the position to farmers in a series of meetings around the country.  The first two such meetings were held in Athy and Cavan last week.  </p><p> The Senator also raised the issue of the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS.  It has been more or less replaced by the green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS.  We are lobbying hard for GLAS to be opened again.  Farmers have fully subscribed to the scheme and have shown an interest in being involved in it for a number of reasons.  It relates to another question that was raised regarding the importance of direct payments.  GLAS was not mentioned but reference was made to the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP.  All those direct payments are of great importance.  Any cut to them would represent a cut to more than 100% of the farmer's profits as direct payments make up 113% of the average farm income on sheep farms and 115% on cattle rearing farms.  That shows their importance. </p><p> I attended our forestry meeting and Deputy Willie Penrose raised the issue of forestry.  The Government can do much more for that sector.  We are way below the target for forestry planting.  The target is 7,000 ha per annum and we barely broke 5,000 ha this year.  That shows that not enough is being done to help farmers.  If we do not have farmers planting forestry, we will not get the level of forestry we need.  There is 185,000 ha of enclosed land that could be planted but for some reason it is not allowed to be planted.  Also, the forestry premium needs to favour the farmer planting the land rather than investment funds and so on.  We have put that point to the Minister and the Department on a number of occasions and, hopefully, the penny will drop sooner rather than later.  </p><p> Some people might ask why we should have a suckler cow herd if it is not making a profit and farmers are voting with their feet by leaving the sector.  However, the issues of public goods and the maintenance of the environment arise.  Tourism figures were released this morning.  I do not have them to hand but they were positive.  Some 11.6 million tourists visited the country last year and there was a major spin-off from that.  Much of that tourism is built on the back of farmers maintaining the rural countryside.  People would not be eager to visit the country and look at an overgrown countryside.  There are those public goods.  There is also the beef sector which is worth almost &euro;3 billion and the spin-off from that to rural areas.  Professor Thia Hennessy highlighted two or three of the figures in that respect.  Deputy Charlie McConalogue said that the number of suckler cows has dropped from 45,000 to 39,000, which is a 12% decline, give or take.  Professor Hennessy's report stated that for every 10% drop in suckler cow numbers, there is a loss of &euro;145 million to the beef sector and a loss of &euro;305 million in total output to the wider economy.  That highlights that we cannot simply single out suckler cows and say they are not making a profit on a farmer.  There are many other links in the chain. </p><p> It was stated that taxpayers will inevitably cop on and stop paying in this respect.</p><p>Taxpayers are getting a good deal for their money, whether in the shape of the CAP or the beef price.  Some 50 years ago, 30% of the average household income was spent on food but today it is between 10% and 12%, and that is because the farmer is not getting paid as much as he or she should be.  In the consultation process which the Commission put in place across Europe in the build-up to the CAP proposals, the figures were very positive and it would be interesting for committee members to get hold of them to learn the views of non-farmers about subsidies being given to farmers to ensure they provide an adequate amount of top quality, safe and healthy food at affordable prices.  The statistics showed a clear majority of taxpayers in favour of the CAP being adequately funded to pay farmers to continue in this way.  This was also made clear at a COPA meeting in Brussels.</p><p> There were numerous questions about the possibility of factories gobbling this money up, whether it is &euro;40 or &euro;200.  This was mentioned and Mr. Woods and Mr. Kinsella discussed the issue in meetings of the livestock committee.  The suckler cow farmer needs support but it is difficult to find the ideal way to provide it and to guarantee the factories do not gobble it up.  The feeling we have is that the further away from the finished animal the money is, the better chance there is of it staying with the farmer.  I am not saying it will work out but there is something there to work on.</p><p> The issue of pitching farmer against farmer was also mentioned a few times.  We always try to avoid that.  We represent all sectors of farming and I agree with Deputy Cahill that this should not put one sector against another.  There is significant interdependence between the sectors and the IFA will never pitch one against the other.</p><p> The importance of live exports was stressed and Deputy Cahill rightly pointed to the weekly kill of 40,000.  Last week it was 38,500 and it has been below 40,000 in only two of the past six weeks.  As the Deputy said, it is hard to get a price increase at over 30,000 kills, whether the factories say they can manage it or not.  The markets are quite tough at the moment but in August and September, when the beef price was rising in the UK and the markets were good, all we saw here were factories cutting the beef price by the equivalent of &euro;100 per head.  That was very difficult to take and we met the factories to highlight that.  We have also met the Minister and the Department to highlight the very important role which live exports play, which will be particularly so this spring when we need to get as many dairy bred calves out of the country as possible.</p><p> Turkey was one of the best markets we had for a couple of years but the uncertainty there two years ago, when the exchange rate went all over the place, meant that the weanling which cost &euro;1,000 here cost the Turkish farmer 3,200 lira.</p><p>The following year it was 4,500 lira and at one stage this year it was 7,500 lira.  To get the same value per weanling they almost needed to get a &euro;1,000 for a weanling for which they had paid &euro;400 or &euro;500 two years ago.  That market has really been taken out of the equation.  </p><p> Another issue highlighted was climate change.  We were before this committee last week talking about it.  It is important to recognise that we have a huge role to play.  I talk about climate change at every IFA meeting because it is a key issue.  It is a challenge Irish farmers can embrace.  Climate change is a global, not just an Irish, issue.  We have to produce our commodity as efficiently as possible in terms of its carbon output.  We must use the Teagasc report, research, genetics and science to do it as efficiently as possible and must always aim to do it as efficiently as possible and constantly improve.  Farmers have done that, which is why we are now producing 40% more than we were in 1990, while at the same time producing the same amount of carbon.  We have found via the smart farming programme that there are further improvements we can make which can lead to a win-win.  We can reduce our carbon emissions and also costs on farms.  Teagasc has set out a roadmap and highlighted three areas in which to seek improvements: land use, agricultural use and renewables.  </p><p> We have spoken about farm forestry.  Anaerobic digesters and solar power are two key features.  However, in that regard farmers have experienced a false dawn and been given false hopes in the case of willow and miscanthus plantations.  In other areas such as feed-in tariffs, access to the grid and the development of regional biomass trade and logistics centres, the Taoiseach and the Government must lead the way.  There are areas in which we can make improvements, but it is clear that we need Government support.</p></speech>

The concerns expressed are well known and have been well voiced.  We are here because of the report we commissioned and the questions are being widely asked.  As it was very important to put some structure in place, we hired the best person available to put the report together and deliver it.  She did an excellent job, as anyone to whom I have spoken and who has read the report in full agrees.</p> <p>  A broad range of questions and issues arise continually.  The issues related to dairy conversion arise on a regular basis and it was pointed out at this committee that not all farms were suitable for it.  Farm type, farm land and farm structure are often different.  I argue that much of the suckler cow sector is operating on some of the toughest land in the country, but it is doing a fantastic job in converting grass into edible protein for humans on tough land which is not suitable for tillage or dairy production.  It is often said our dairy industry is ranked at No. 1 and our beef industry at No. 5 in dealing with climate change.  However, the beef industry is operating on the tougher land and pretty good at what it does.  Deputy Penrose spoke about the beef genomics and data programme and we see that the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation is now able to include greenhouse gas and climate change figures with it.  The beef sector is now in a position to make those strong, coherent arguments and better able to defend our position.  Climate change will be an important issue.  </p> <p>  The promotion of the quality suckler cow herd is key.</p><p>We have put significant effort into it and believe there is room to make progress in that space.  I am not saying it will be easy, but there is room to make progress and farmers who are producing quality suckler cow bred animals deserve to be rewarded correctly for it.  On numerous occasions the meat industry has openly stated part of its key branding image is based on green, quality suckler cow herds.  When one walks into a meat processing facility and looks at the picture on the wall behind the desk, it will be of a quality suckler cow herd or the progeny of the suckler cow herd which is being used to promote Irish beef.  That is a positive, but we would like to see farmers being rewarded for it.  It is something on which we are working and there is room to improve.</p><p> I refer to the factories which are taking &euro;200 per cow.  We had an issue here last week with factories that had been found to be illegally trimming carcasses.  One of the key problems in the sector is a lack of transparency, which builds a lack of trust between the parties involved because if there is no transparency, there is no trust.  When it comes to transparency, we have not been found wanting.  During previous takeovers of meat factories we put a lot of time and effort into having reports commissioned on the structures in place within the beef industry and how it worked.  Therefore, we have been playing our part in increasing transparency.  It is a suitable area for the joint Oireachtas committee to become involved in.  Senator Mulherin referenced a report from Iowa State University on the percentage farmers were getting; it was perhaps 43% or 45%.</p></speech>

It would be good to do politically and is an area where politicians could make a really strong difference.  The Minister says he cannot do anything about price, but politicians have a real role to play in increasing transparency.  It is something that could be worked on.</p> <p>  On protecting the money, Mr. Healy is right.  Our opinion is that the closer it is to the primary producer, the farmer who produces the weanling, the better, but live exports also play a key role in driving competition in the marketplace.  The factories will have less ability to manoeuvre the price if there are strong live exports.  That is an area in which there is significant room for improvement.</p> <p>  POs were mentioned.  We have been clear that we are licensed to facilitate produce organisations and have said clearly that if any group of farmers wants assistance, we will help it out in that space.  We are more than willing to work with anyone who wants to talk to us about that issue.  It is mentioned in the context of consumers and we also have to remember that this is an exporting country.  The European marketplace is key for us.  A total of 80% to 90% of what we produce is sold in continental European markets.  Therefore, we have to talk about the European, as well as the Irish, consumer and what the European consumer wants and is willing to pay for.  They are often different messages.  In general, European consumers tell us that they want the highest of standards of production and welfare.</p><p>They want the highest of everything but in Europe, the CAP tells us we need to do more for less and improve water quality and the environment while trade policy is to have free trade agreements all over the place with beef offered up as part of them and let the beef farmers figure it out themselves.  This is why payments to beef farmers and the beef sector have always been important.  Historically, the beef sector has always had strong payments with the suckler cow payment, the ten month and 22 month slaughter premiums and extensification premiums.  There has always been strong support for the beef sector in Europe.  Going back even earlier we had intervention, private storage and export credits, which were built into the price at the time.  The change in the way it has been structured means targeted supports for the beef sector are the way forward and they are key.</p><p> People have mentioned pitting farmer against farmer.  We have deliberately chosen not to do this, which is why we have spoken about targeted payments, as opposed to coupled payments.  There was a drive to push for coupled payments by various people in the media.  We always have been in favour of targeted payments.  We need to reward farmers for doing the work, keeping the animals and farming in an environmentally friendly fashion.  This is why targeted payments are critical.  The sheep and suckler sectors are designated as sensitive in Europe.  If we are going to designate the suckler sector as sensitive but have a trade policy that gives away our European meat market, we have to find a way around it because if it is sensitive we have to support it.  This is why we state that targeted payments are absolutely critical.  There is a range of other issues I am more than willing to discuss.</p></speech>

Surely the IFA is a key stakeholder.  There are complexities with regard to pricing and obstacles with regard to the power of the Minister to intervene in pricing.  Surely the place for this to be discussed is at the table with the stakeholders where the IFA would be well able to advocate for farmers.  This is not happening.</p></speech>

That was the intention.  We have missed only one of the meetings, which was the last one.  We chose not to attend it for obvious reasons.  Farming suffered a long and hard year, specifically in the beef sector.  We had everything from rain, snow and drought.  We wanted key issues put on the agenda of the beef forum relating to price, suckler cows and Brexit.  If the Minister was not willing to put key issues on the agenda, we felt we had to highlight them outside the door.  We would have preferred to have been inside, where we had been for all the meetings bar that one, but not if key farm interests were not going to be addressed.

Every time we raise cattle prices with factories there, the Minister holds up his hand and says "Stop, you cannot raise that issue.  I will not allow you to raise that issue here.  I cannot discuss cattle prices".  We do not accept that and we try to continue discussion and to engage with him, but that has been the Minister's response at the beef forum.  Members should understand that that is part of the frustration that our president and livestock chairman had to endure at meeting after meeting.</p> <p>  Second, we did take very strong action prior to the last beef forum.  Thankfully we got a response with the help of this committee, including the Senator, the Chairman and others.  The pressure was so heavy that the Minister had to respond and he did put &euro;20 million and an additional &euro;40 on sucklers.  That was positive and we take it to be so, but it happened because we put on great pressure and ran a very strong campaign and as part of that, the president decided to pull out of the beef forum.  It worked in getting additional money for the suckler farmers, which should be borne in mind.  </p> <p>  I will make a couple of points regarding today's proceedings.  First, we very much welcome this committee's support for sucklers and for the report that Professor Thia Hennessey compiled, which everyone present has complimented.  It is a clear message to Irish farmers and agriculture that there is broad consensus across the Houses of the Oireachtas in support of the suckler cow herd in this country.  It is very strong IFA policy and a very strong statement from this committee and the Houses.</p> <p>  Everyone who spoke at this meeting has observed, in some way, that the suckler herd needs increased support.  The IFA has a clear policy that we want an additional &euro;200 per cow into the sector.  I did not hear anyone speak against that today.  We take that as a positive thing and that people generally support that.  Members of this committee and the Oireachtas have been very strong and very upfront in supporting that which is a positive development and which we welcome.</p> <p>  This committee has shown a strong sentiment on the important role of sucklers in the Irish beef sector, its exports and perhaps most importantly, regarding the farmers who members represent and how the sector keeps society together.  In a crucial part of her report, Professor Hennessey highlighted the role that sucklers and suckler farming play in their local economy.</p><p>Deputy Martin Kenny highlighted that very clearly in terms of what happens in marts in County Leitrim.  The very positive role of sucklers was also evident in counties Donegal, Westmeath and every other county to which we went.  It is important that we put that on the record of the committee.</p><p> There were many questions on what we can do, how this works and where the factories fit in.  To be clear, the role of Oireachtas Members is as legislators.  As to how they can help on this issue, the first thing that is needed is increased Government support for the suckler sector.  Members of the committee agree that that is required.  We propose that the level of direct payments be increased to &euro;200 per cow.   We need more national resources and funding.  As legislators, members have a key role to play in that regard.  In fairness, they played that card strongly in the lead-up to the budget.  They will have to do so again in terms of future schemes, budgets and reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy.</p><p> Second, we have advocated for additional payments for quality beef.  There should be a quality payment in regard to suckler beef.  Members have a role to play as legislators in trying to progress that issue, along with processors, Bord Bia, the Minister and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and in supporting the case we are making.</p><p> Much of the issue in regard to factories results from a lack of competition in that area.  Members have a key role as legislators in that regard.  The first thing they can do is to strongly support the live export trade, which was a point raised by Deputy Cahill and others.  We ask members to offer us strong support in advocating for the live export trade and trying to maximise our number of live exports.  We are facing a big challenge in calf exports and the increase in the dairy herd this spring and we ask the committee to help us in that regard and to continue to push for the best positive result.</p><p> My colleague, Mr. Woods, addressed CAP reform and international trade agreements in detail.  As legislators, members have a significant role to play on those issues in terms of increasing the level of direct payments to sucklers under CAP, ensuring that direct payments to livestock farmers continue and, of course, in respect of international trade agreements such as with Mercosur, which involves countries such as Brazil.</p><p> We will take many positives from today's meeting, such as members' support for the suckler sector and the strong, unequivocal support of the committee for the campaign to increase direct payments to &euro;200 per cow.  We thank the committee in that regard.</p></speech>

We are &euro;160 short of the &euro;200 payment which is sought.  Are the witnesses satisfied that such a payment of &euro;160 must be linked to an action?  The Minister, Deputy Creed, and others point out that issues such as state aid rules come into play when money is allocated to farmers or other sectors.  Do the witnesses accept that such payments must be linked to actions?  What is their view in that regard?  Advocating for a payment of &euro;200 per cow is fine and it is a lovely tag line, but we need to get into the detail of exactly how it can be delivered in an achievable manner.</p></speech>

Mr. Kinsella summarised the purpose of the meeting and what has been discussed quite well.  We are coming to the end of 2018.   Will the big discussion about where we are going be in regard to CAP and reform?</p><p>The budget will be discussed from a European perspective early in the new year.  In the event that the budget is agreed, it will require a difficult balancing act because if one sector is to receive more on the basis that it is in a difficult position, the additional funding will have to be taken from another sector.</p></speech>

Certain conditions attach to direct payments.  We have always advocated for cross-compliance of good farming and agriculture conditions.  We always meet those conditions and farmers are prepared to meet them.  There are other issues, as Deputy Kenny says, that farmers face.  In the current scheme under which &euro;40 per cow is provided - the pilot scheme the Minister introduced this year - there is a requirement to weigh the cows and calves.  We have met the Department about this and Mr. Woods has addressed it.  While the IFA wants to keep the work involved to a minimum, we did not tell the Department we wanted &euro;40 per cow and that we would not do anything for it.</p> <p>  I want to clarify the issue relating to payment of CAP and national resources because there has been considerable misinformation about this.  The IFA has never suggested that we take one penny from any other farmer to make an additional payment to suckler cow farmers.  The Minister and others keep asking where we will get the money and who we will take it from.  We never suggested at any stage that we should take one penny from any other farmer.  We made two suggestions.  We need additional national resources to make additional payments for suckler cows.  In the context of the CAP, we have been clear all along that any targeted payments for suckler cows should come from CAP Pillar 2 schemes.  Those schemes do not involve having any negative impact on the basic payment to farmers.  We have been crystal clear about that.  Some people have tried to confuse the issue by suggesting we are trying to take payments from farmers.  We want to nail that myth on the head today because that is not the case.  We are talking about targeted Pillar 2 payments under a targeted scheme for suckler farmers.  There are two methods of funding under that.  There is CAP Pillar 2 funding and there are additional national resources.</p> <p>  Confusion has been brought into this by people who do not want to do certain things.  We have discussed this at the highest level in the European Commission and it has been explained to us that we are short only resources in terms of trying to make an additional payment of &euro;200 for suckler cows.  If the committee backs the campaign for resources and &euro;200 per suckler cow, which I understand it does, that would be a great help in getting additional national resources.  It requires a combination of national resources and CAP Pillar 2 funding.</p></speech>

The issue of the decline in suckler cow numbers is urgent.  We acknowledge that new money has been allocated for suckler cows in the budget in the form of the &euro;20 million in funding and through the areas of natural constraint scheme.  This has been a help and it is important to mention that.</p> <p>  It would be remiss of us to finish without talking about the future and the clear and present danger posed to the sector by Brexit and where we sit at this point.  If we end up in a no-deal Brexit scenario, the Irish beef sector is probably the most vulnerable sector in Europe.</p><p>As well as having difficulties getting our product into the UK, if the product goes back to the European market, where 45% of our beef already goes, it will cause major problems with the price of beef there.  As part of the contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit, the beef sector must be right at the top of the Government's and Europe's efforts.  There must be a floor on the price of beef and protection measures to save our members.  As a result of issues with sterling, there is already pressure on the system in terms of price.  There is no doubt that the uncertainty around the corner with Brexit coming on 29 March is not helping confidence in the sector.  That must be put on the record when we are talking about such matters.  There is an elephant and although it is not yet in the room, it is coming straight for us.  Any citizen, farmer or person interested in the sector must be increasingly worried at how things are playing out.</p></speech>

It will be dealt with in detail and we are trying to keep ahead of the posse in that regard, although it is difficult to do so.  As there are no further questions, I thank the members of the IFA, Mr. Joe Healy, Mr. Kevin Kinsella, Mr. Angus Woods and Mr. Damian McDonald, for coming before us today and having a good and open discussion on what is a very important matter.  I also thank members.</p> <p>  As there is no further business and today is our last meeting before Christmas, I wish everybody a very happy and peaceful Christmas.  There is no doubt we will engage again in the new year.  I hope we will not have to reconvene because of some storm or weather event between now and 15 January, when we are due to resume.  I also thank the broadcasting staff behind us, the Debates Office and the secretariat, including Ms Josie Briody, Mr. Hubert Higgins and Mr. Jack Nugent, who is putting the final touches to the Brexit report.  I also thank everybody else involved with the committee over the past year.  It has been a busy one in which we had 36 meetings and published a number of reports.  We have been engaging in Brussels and Croatia.  Next year will be as busy as this year.  In addition to Brexit, the Common Agricultural Policy will be the other main focus of attention.  It is a major issue that was mentioned briefly today.  There are major challenges and we must all work together to achieve a positive outcome for the agricultural sector.</p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting is to consider the draft detailed scrutiny report on the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018, which is a Private Members' Bill.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister of State to give his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-18a.68" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1260" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="12:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018121800002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to today's meeting.  It is my first time participating in this committee which does much important work across a range of topics.  I thank Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith for introducing the Bill.  It has stimulated some very important debates on energy security, the use of fossil fuels and particularly their impact on the climate.  The committee has heard from a wide range of experts on the matters involved.  The topic of climate change is one on which there is almost universal agreement in both Chambers that we need to ramp up our actions and reduce our greenhouse gases as a matter of urgency.  Many members of the committee have been already working on the Joint Committee on Climate Action, the findings of which I look forward to seeing in the near future.</p> <p>  Members will be aware the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is preparing an all-of-Government plan which will set out the actions that must be taken to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate change.  The plan will develop new initiatives across electricity, transport, heat, agriculture and other relevant sectors, building on the previous actions taken by Government, including the national mitigation plan and the national development plan, and is to be completed by early next year.  </p> <p>  In my letter of 26 November to the committee, I set out the energy policy dilemma which requires the balancing of three objectives - energy sustainability, energy security and energy affordability.  Unfortunately, the Bill does not score well on these three dimensions. </p> <p>  In terms of sustainability, the proposed ban on exploration in Ireland would not reduce Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.  If the ban had been already law it would not have helped Ireland reach its emissions or renewable energy targets.  With regard to energy security, the Bill fails to take account of our energy security.  Beyond the Corrib gas field and the soon to be depleted Kinsale gas field, the Bill would make it mandatory for us to import all our oil and gas needs in the future.  This is at a time when the European Union's import dependency for natural gas has increased from 43% in 1995 to 70% in 2016.  The EU's import dependency on petroleum and petroleum products is 87%.  Ireland already has low energy self-sufficiency and a relatively isolated island electricity grid.  Given these circumstances I cannot support the Bill in order to send a message.  Instead we need credible measures that reduce our use of fossil fuels thereby reducing our emissions and improving our security of supply.  The Bill does nothing for energy affordability.  It ensures we would forgo any potential economic or fiscal benefit from offshore resources.  </p> <p>  Many of these concerns about the Bill were raised by several witnesses during the committee hearings.</p><p>When the International Energy Agency addressed the committee, it stated that further oil and gas exploration investment would be required, including when we meet the climate ambition of the Paris Agreement.  This is consistent with the forecasts of the European Commission's recent strategic vision for a climate neutral economy by 2050.  We cannot ignore these facts.  Neither can we ignore the need for further and urgent action on climate change.  There are many other measures and steps to take to reduce our emissions without threatening our energy security or competitiveness.  This is where our focus should be and it is an area on which I look forward to working with the committee.</p><p> I hope the foregoing provides the committee with the context of the amendments I have tabled to the draft report on which we will vote today.  In essence, there are several serious concerns arising in relation to the Bill which must be noted.  I recommend the Bill should not proceed to the next Stage.</p></speech>

I will limit people to three minutes on each amendment, as agreed in private session, to keep within the time.</p></speech>

He is wrong to say we did not discuss a lot of things at the scrutiny stage.  We discussed many of the things he feels are missing from the Bill.  For example, we discussed the savings we would make by minimising the environmental damage that would be done if we extracted more oil and gas from the seas and by reducing our CO2 emissions.  It would force the State to focus on renewable alternatives and stop the fantasy that we can continue to explore in the hope of finding more gas and oil.  More importantly, since the scrutiny stage took place, the IPCC's special report has been published and had a major impact on the discourse.  We must take it into account.  It warns that we have perhaps 12 years to achieve radical reductions to avert a temperature rise of 1.5o or 2o.  That is the background against which we need to consider the decisions we make today.  I appeal to the honour and integrity of all Deputies and Senators attending to prioritise that urgency which has been reiterated time and time again on the future of planet.</p> <p>  Some issues were raised with me on the phone about the drafting of the report.  I have no problem with redrafting it to make it shorter and legally and linguistically correct.  However, the only thing that matters today is whether we agree to allow the Bill to proceed to the next Stage.  That is the real discussion we have to have.</p> <p>  We must deal with amendments proposed by Senator McDowell and the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, himself.  The Minister of State quoted the International Energy Agency's report but this is not aligned with the Paris Agreement.  The agency has said itself that if the report were implemented, it would be far from sufficient to avoid severe climate change impacts.  The report would see global temperatures rise by at least 2o if not 3o.  The Minister of State said the IPCC recommended that countries should expand their production.  However, the IPCC does not advise on anything, it simply reports that the scenarios that may face us in future are very dangerous indeed.  If oil and gas production must decline globally, no country should be expanding it.  In other words, the science settled at Paris and beforehand that 80% of known fossil fuels must remain in the ground remains the case.  Nothing has changed.  The Minister of State appears to be arguing that as long as there is some kind of market for oil and gas, it is fine for Ireland to develop new fields.  That is absolutely illogical given that consumption of the oil and gas fields that are already developed still puts us at risk of overheating the planet.  Our point and effort is to reduce our consumption of all fossil fuels.</p> <p>  The IPCC's recent report does not suggest there is a role for gas given the Paris goals.  Rather, it states that a very low emissions pathway must be part of what we have in the transition from coal and natural gas in the energy sector.  At the detailed scrutiny stage, we had evidence from experts that our Bill would help Ireland reach its targets and that it would be difficult for us to achieve those targets if we permitted further oil and gas exploration.  The Minister of State warns in his amendments of the legal impacts of restricting contracts.  However, this is a good argument as to why the Bill should proceed.  If the State continues to issue further contracts and licences for exploration, it will have incurred legal liabilities at that point in the future when this has to stop.  It places the country at greater legal risk than it is already at.  Exploration industry practices are causing serious damage to marine life.  The Minister of State argues about the threat to potential jobs but at 268, very few jobs are provided by the exploration of oil and gas compared to the 11,000 jobs in the marine and fishing industry which exploration puts at risk.</p> <p>  The major issue today is whether we will make a decision to allow the Bill to proceed to the next Stage.  At the next Stage, amendments can be made to address all of the issues being raised.  It is important to allow the Bill to proceed.</p></speech>

It confused the idea of exploration with the idea of use and it confuses options with predetermined outcomes.  While I accept the international consensus on global warming and fossil fuels, no matter what view one takes of the issue, Ireland will depend on some use of fossil fuels for a very considerable period, whether imported or domestically exploited.  If that is the case, one has to ask the second question, namely,&quot;What is the effect of this Bill?&quot;  The effect of the Bill would be that when the current gas fields run out within a decade, Ireland would be entirely dependent on international imports of gas by sea or pipeline.  It is the primary duty of an Irish Government to keep open the option of having available to the Irish consumer whatever degree of fossil fuel we need to ensure the viability of our economy.  One cannot take a dramatic stance by stopping all exploration and provide that Ireland will now be dependent on others and on international circumstances such that if things go wrong, the country must, in effect, close down.  That is not right or responsible and it is our duty as legislators and Members of the Oireachtas to keep our options open while in no sense abandoning our determination to move from non-renewable to renewable energy sources for the Irish public.</p><p>The amendments in my name seek to prevent the Bill proceeding to the next Stage as it is misconceived in principle.  It is erroneous and it puts the cart before the horse.  It is deeply irresponsible to expose Ireland to being a vulnerable taker of energy prices at risk of any international crisis which might threaten our energy supplies.  It is not consistent with the fact that, on any view of climate change policy, we will continue to be dependent on a degree of fossil fuel use for the foreseeable future.</p></speech>

The report poses the question as to whether sufficient renewables are coming on stream to protect us against future security of supply concerns.  We asked if it is right to use fossil fuels from other countries while allowing no further exploration in Irish waters.  We have posed that question for a reason.  I want to see the Bill proceed but there are a number of weaknesses in that it does not set out direct replacements for fossil fuel.  One cannot stop doing one thing without having a replacement.  Do we continue to import from other states such as Russia?  There is a lack of morality in that and it would make the Bill more of a gesture if it was passed in its current form.  We need to create direct alternatives in the form of biogas, biomass, wind, solar, hydro, etc., and we need to link the Bill to renewable energy production.  The Bill is linked to the monthly mean level of atmospheric carbon dioxide measured at the Mauna Loa Observatory.  It also needs to be linked to our production of renewables.</p> <p>  While the Bill should proceed, as I stated on Second Stage in the Chamber a couple of months ago, it does not make sense to continue producing greenhouse gas emissions using another country's fossil fuels.  To do so would be even more damaging because of the additional carbon miles involved.  We want to stop bringing in oil, coal or whatever else from other countries and we want to accelerate the creation of alternatives, but if we do not put the alternatives in place quickly, we are not just burning fossil fuel from other countries but adding to greenhouse gas emissions because the oil, coal and other sources of fuel will have substantial carbon miles clocked up.  We produced the document, Powering Ireland 2030, about our energy supply, based on over a year's research, in which we set out that we should move from nearly 80% dependency on fossil fuels to 20% dependency by 2030.  That is the direction in which Sinn F&eacute;in wants to go.   The Bill should proceed and I will oppose some of the amendments because they would stop it in its tracks.  I believe the intent behind the Bill is good and it can be amended successfully.</p></speech>

A point which has not yet been made is that we could damage the perception of our country with regard to inward investment by multinational companies, which could be apprehensive about a country with a precarious energy future and disputation about it.  It is worthy of mention that there are currently 250 jobs in this sector, with 500 other people indirectly employed.  While we all pray for and aspire to achieve our commitments on our carbon footprint and work together to do so, assuming we meet all international targets by 2050 and get the job done, which we are not currently doing and the Minister's response and a new programme will be necessary, it is projected that we will still need fossil fuels for between 21% and 56% of our energy needs and will still be working to reduce them.  We then become open to importing through Scotland or in a post-Brexit situation, through Russia, which is also precarious, as is the Middle East.  We are putting our energy sovereignty and security at grave risk and making it subject to political currents abroad.  We cannot afford to do that.</p> <p>  There is a well-made point that imported oil and gas comes with a greater carbon footprint.  These fuels will come from countries with a much less sound environmental policy, which means we would increase the carbon footprint.  The real issue is the worldwide universal carbon footprint and our contribution to that.  We are not some isolated part of that jigsaw.  There is a crucial issue of price.  If we import our energy and do not have a domestic supply and control, we will be subject to international pricing and cartels.  That can have terrible implications for the consumer and the broader economy.  That issue has to be considered.  We could, in a very malign scenario in which political and economic events took a certain turn as a result of policies pursued outside the country over which we have no control, ultimately have power cuts.  Those power cuts could have significant implications.</p> <p>  It is not that we have a difficulty with the principle involved here.  We are all committed to getting climate change right.  There is a universal issue which the Minister will address in a report shortly.  We have to do that collectively and we are committed to it.  Is this a useful tactic or instrument?  It is clearly not when one thinks of our economy, energy security and environmental considerations because we will have no control over matters outside of the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-18a.79" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="12:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018121800002#C00500"><p>This is a significant issue of principle for the Irish political system and people.  Where do we stand on climate action and what is our role in the world?  The principle should be that we would keep four fifths of the known fossil fuels in the ground because that is what we know we have to do to try to maintain a safe climate.  The work that 350 and other organisations have done over recent years has been significant in turning the whole environmental movement to realising that rather than putting the blame on the individual, the problem should be tackled at source.  We should stop the exploration of oil and gas.  That is a critical first step that we need to take.  A young Swedish girl, Greta Thunberg, recently made the point that we all have to pull the emergency brake, including in this country.  It is irresponsible to continue with exploration for oil and gas in a world where we know that it will go into the atmosphere for 1,000 years as carbon, which threatens all our livelihoods.</p> <p>  While we have to look after people's security, this country's security would be far better positioned by reducing our dependence on and use of fossil fuels.  That is currently a substantial cost to our economy in health and due to pollution.  The security that is promised by oil and gas companies is ephemeral and does not exist.  Despite more than 150 exploration attempts in which we have treated the waters close to shore in Ireland like a pin cushion, we have only found two or three pockets of gas and no commercial oil.  The prospect of any major find is minimal, with a huge cost for exploration.  If we find something, it is likely to be far offshore and there is no guarantee that it will come ashore in Ireland.  When one looks at the geography, it is far more likely to be processed in another jurisdiction and does not give us any security.</p><p>We know that, at the same time, there are evolving technologies for the likes of offshore wind where costs are increasingly low and certain.  We have probably the best offshore wind resource in the world and we should be making a principled stand that we will tap into that resource.  Let us go off to the west, south-west and north coasts and get 15 GW of offshore wind power to help power the country and, indeed, part of north-west Europe in that process.  We need political commitment to do that.  We need to direct all our investment funds, rather than the gambling that goes into oil and gas at the present time, and steer money to that known, certain, realisable energy prospect which would have the benefit of reviving the west, north west and south west of Ireland.  That is the principle we should follow.</p><p> Senator O'Reilly said we will be a price taker.  We are a price taker in oil and gas because, in the past 30 or 40 years, we have made sure there are fungible international markets.  It was certainly the case in oil, it was not the case in gas, but Europe has changed the rules so we now have a much more fungible gas market.  In those circumstances, we are just as secure in relying on that international market as we would be thinking there would be any great security here at home.  </p><p> Senator O'Reilly spoke about our reputation being damaged and it is being severely damaged at the moment.  We are seen as the worst country in Europe in tackling climate change.  This initiative, along with a whole range of other initiatives we have to implement, would help turn that around.  It would help to turn this country green which is where we should go and where we should be.  It is the secure economy which would create jobs, particularly in rural areas in the west.  We should invest in that and support this Bill.  It would say a great deal about where we stand on climate if we were not to do so.</p></speech>

I expressed certain concerns on Second Stage which I will address by way of amendment on Committee Stage and I still hold firm to those concerns.  There are issues about whether we start by way of cliff edge or have some sunset to allow an appropriate transition, but those are matters which can be addressed on Committee Stage.</p> <p>  There has been good debate in the preparation of this report.  There has also been some scaremongering from the industry about energy security.  The reality is that, by 2025, the Corrib gas field will only be producing 20% of the gas the country will need.  We will be importing gas if there are not further finds and in any event there is no guarantee we will find any more.  To suggest that the passage of this Bill will threaten the security of our energy is well wide of the mark.</p> <p>  From a political point of view, we have to signal the direction in which we need to travel.  That cannot be for consumers to decide.  It is irrelevant to consumers how the electricity reaches them when they switch on a light switch or use electricity.  That comes from the supply side.  That is why I am convinced we need to condition the investment community away from exploration and, together with Government initiatives, tap the resource that we know is there.  We do not know whether there is additional gas.  There may be some small pockets thereof, but we do not know how beneficial that will be or how much is there.  We know, however, that there is significant wind off the west coast.  Conditions are trying and waters are deep, so current technologies have not reached the point that they can harness the energy in the way that we would want.  However, we should signal to the investment community that it should support our long-term needs.  The passage of this Bill, with significant amendments, would enhance that message.</p> <p>  I flag at this stage that, if we get this legislation to Committee Stage, I will be happy to work with Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and others to bring forward significant amendments that will provide for a staging process.  I do not believe the guillotine should be dropped on day one.  This should be done over a period of time with a recognised sunset, aiming towards the ending of exploration and mapping a direction towards our climate change objectives.  We recognise that we have made significant commitments on milestones for the reduction of emissions by 2050 and, in line with that, we need to transition away from fossil fuels to more renewable sources of energy.</p> <p>  The investment community always wants certainty and, by charting a timeline, we can give that certainty and show there is an alternative sector for investment in alternative energy.  We want to pass this Bill from that perspective.</p></speech>

It most definitely endangers Irish energy security.</p> <p>  There is also the view that the legislation bans any future exploration.  It also has a significant current day impact because it would effectively prevent the commercialisation of a discovery on an existing licence.  That would have implications in terms of claims and would effectively end exploration and render our energy sources completely insecure.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service has calculated that there could be a negative impact on the economy of roughly &euro;1.7 billion or &euro;1.8 billion per annum if the Bill is implemented.</p> <p>  The Bill does not take into account the potential loss of revenue from a ban on future licences, nor would it make a difference to emission levels.  It fails to take into account that there must be a transition to renewables and that the transition must and will be aided by oil and gas.  We must secure energy supply in the long term, particularly in the context of Brexit.  Ireland needs to protect its energy resources and sources, rather than making them more vulnerable, against a backdrop of global volatility.  For these reasons, I am opposed to the Bill.</p></speech>

To address Deputy Stanley's comments, the Bill is linked to CO2 levels.  It states that the Minister shall not issue any further licences for exploration and development as long as the parts per million of carbon are over the safe level of 350 which the figure on which science has settled.  If we managed to get that number down, we could explore for and use fossil fuels.  However, once that threshold has been exceeded, trying to extract more fossil fuels flies in the face of scientific logic.  That is what we are attempting to do.</p> <p>  There have been accusations of putting the cart before the house.  I would put it the other way around.  We must force the State to consider the possibility of investment in renewables and other countries must do the same.  I had an interesting meeting this week with ESB Networks.  The company spoke about the amount of energy that goes onto the grid when the winds are high and we have storms, which we are having increasingly.  There is a dynamic possibility that can be explored and exploited further and we are ignoring it.</p> <p>  I will visit my sister in Copenhagen over Christmas.  There is nothing but wind farms in the seas off Denmark, yet wind levels in Denmark are not even a fraction of what we have here.  We are an island nation on the edge of the Atlantic Ocean and we are not taking this issue seriously.  This is the problem.  </p> <p>  The Joint Committee on Climate Action last week heard from witnesses from Marine and Renewable Energy Ireland, MaREI, that the potential to invest in tidal and wave energy is enormous but no real effort is being made to provide the resources to do that and very little thought is being given to it.  We must stop exploring and stop pretending that we, as a small nation, can continue to extract fossil fuels and at the same time have an impact on climate change because we cannot.  It has to end and if we were to become a world leader, instead of a laggard, we would change our recently acquired reputation for the better by saying we have ended the issuing of further exploration licences.</p><p>I have acquired a legal opinion.  No doubt Senator McDowell and others in the committee room are much better equipped to argue legal stuff, but my legal opinion is from the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisor, OPLA.  It states there is a very slight chance that the State will be liable for preventing the further issuing of licences.  There is a small chance in the case of those who already have leases.  I do not know from where the costings given to us by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service came, but we certainly did not look for them.  Perhaps Deputy Lowry looked for them.  They do not take account of the savings the State would make if we were to attempt to reduce our CO2 emissions by implementing this policy.  We would actually save money.  It is obvious to say, but there is no security, although we all go on about energy security.  However, there is no security for any person or animal or biodiversity on the planet if we hurtle towards a temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius.</p></speech>

I did not say the Bill did not make the link with increasing or reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.  What I said was we needed to link the Bill with renewable energy production.  That is the point I made and it does not figure in the Bill, although it is a key part of it.  The two have to happen in tandem and we need to move on very quickly with the Bill.  We support it proceeding.</p></speech>

We need to be a leader in that regard.  Following research I have carried out and having listened to experts in this area, I am aware that the majority say fossil fuels will play a part in our transition to a low carbon economy.  When we consider Ireland as an isolated island, we have to ensure security of supply for citizens.  As much as Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, I want to see a transition to renewables, but, unfortunately, the Bill does not offer anything for the renewables sector, with which I know that the Deputy agrees and which I know that she wants to see expanded.  The Bill will also not do anything to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.  The work we are doing at the special Committee on Climate Action will be more important.  Fossil fuels, in particular gas, forming part of the transition will be key.  Gas will be important in producing cleaner electricity.  The energy policy of UCC's Centre for Marine and Renewable Energy Ireland, MaREI, states an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050 would still mean significant levels of oil and gas in our energy mix.  We need to gradually reduce the level of oil we will use in the transition to a low carbon economy.  For the sake of security of supply, the cost of energy and protecting the State through the transition, it is important to ensure we do everything we can.  The Corrib gas field will run out in the next ten to 15 years.  At present, 50% of our gas supply comes from it.</p></speech>

Citizens want us to ensure they will have the energy supply they need and to which they have a right.  It is up to us, as legislators, to ensure that supply.  In tandem with that, we have an obligation to meet our 2030 and 2050 targets.  We need to put in place the policy direction to do it through the use of renewable energy.</p></speech>

Tackling the problem of fossil fuels is something we will do over time.  It will not happen overnight.  We talk about the potential of offshore energy projects.  The fact is we do not have anything that is commercial at this stage.  The issue is being looked at and there are projects ongoing, but they are at development stage.  Until we produce energy through these means, we cannot fall off the cliff.  There are support schemes that are helping people who are investing in offshore and onshore wind energy projects.  There is momentum.  The Government and everybody in the House agrees that tackling climate change is the number one issue.  We need to make sure it will happen in a structured way in order that we will not leave ourselves exposed.  I accept that the Bill is well intentioned.  When all of the pluses and minuses are added, we are in a situation where the Bill could cause a hell of a lot more problems than it would solve.</p></speech>

We can proceed with that agenda while recognising the practical need in the interim for oil and gas exploration.  The level of dependency will reduce constantly.  It should be recognised that gas is a relatively benign source of energy in its carbon output compared to most fossil fuels.</p></speech>

Rather than get into a party political row on the matter, my concern in this process is that we are in danger of creating a new legislative stage.  If we go through each of the 12 amendments in turn and vote on them, it might not be the best use of our time and resources.  The committee is clearly split 50:50 down the line.  I am happy to consider the amendment, but it might be better to come to the key issue - whether we want the report to proceed on Committee Stage.  If we do, we can amend it on Committee Stage.  If not, it must be brought to the wider D&aacute;il Chamber.  When there is a 50:50 split in the committee on such a significant Bill, we should avoid creating a new legislative phase.  We should get to the nub of the issue - whether we wish to amend the overall report, given that it has to be amended.  Creating a new legislative phase would not be the best precedent.</p></speech>

We have to go through the amendments and vote on them.  It is up to the committee to decide what the outcome will be.  I do not want to pre-empt it.  Obviously, our decision will be reported to the D&aacute;il, whatever it is.</p></speech>

The amendments of Senator McDowell or the Minister of State would basically kill the Bill at this stage.  The committee is split.  Six members want the Bill to proceed.  While I do not wish to speak for other members, some may agree to the Bill being amended on a further Stage.  It would be a pity for the Bill to be killed off because it is well intentioned.  There is an urgency on this matter in the light of the facts and figures presented at the recent climate change conference in Poland.  We must get on with dealing with this issue.</p></speech>

The report would have to be redrafted for the shortening exercise that was mentioned earlier, but I think it would be better for the committee to take that vote now rather than waiting until January.  We will come back with a further revised report.  Our message to the D&aacute;il in that regard would be that the committee was not able to decide on the adoption of that report.

Following a tight vote, it was defeated under the procedures of the committee.  Perhaps we can get some clarity from the secretariat in due course.  My understanding is that the report falls, unfortunately.  In effect, it has been defeated.  That is the procedure, regardless of whether we like it.  I certainly do not like it because I wanted the Bill to proceed.  I had issues with it, but I was happy to seek to amend it.  Clarity is needed so that we do not give people false hope that the Bill is somehow hovering in a waiting pattern and can be advanced with some other organ of Parliament.  My understanding is that this cannot happen.</p> <p>  This really is a sad day.  It is a sad outcome from all the work we have done.  We should go out the door knowing that.  We have no choice but to accept the democratic legitimacy of the committee structure.  Obviously, we will have an opportunity to address that elsewhere.

Everyone has a different story, regardless of how experienced or inexperienced he or she is.  I understand from a principal officer who phoned me several times yesterday that he will prepare a different kind of report, which will be much more slimmed down and which will contain different language.  In that report, different i's will be dotted and different t's will be crossed.  I would like to see that report.  I would like it to come back before this committee.  We have just got rid of all the amendments, but we still have to get the report from Tom Malone.</p></speech>

We said in that vote that we would not look at the draft again.  It has already been voted down by the committee.  However, I must come back to Senator McDowell's point that the Bill proposed by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith is still before the committee.  It is up to the committee to decide how it would like to proceed in this regard.  The draft report fell here, but the Bill is still with the committee.  I am afraid that is the procedure.  I did not make up the rules; that is just the procedure.</p></speech>

I also welcome members and those who may be watching the proceedings on Oireachtas TV.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind them to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode as they will interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the proceedings of the meeting.  Television coverage and web streaming may also be adversely affected.  I advise the Minister that any submission made or opening statement submitted to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.  After her presentation, there shall be questions from members of the committee.  I call on the Minister to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

When I last spoke to the committee about the Oberstown facility on 24 January, I was pleased to note the positive changes which were becoming evident at the time.  I am pleased to say there appears to be continuing improvement in the operation of the campus.  I would go so far as to say that at the end of 2018 the campus is a different place from what it was in December 2016.  This is supported by the implementation of the recommendations made in the various reviews, including those in the operational review which have been implemented in the past year or two.</p> <p>  Committee members will be aware that I established a review implementation group in March 2017 to oversee implementation of all of the various recommendations made in the reports, including those made in the operational review.  The group produced a coherent action plan to implement all of the recommendations.  The plan which was completed in May was published on my Department's website at that time.  </p> <p>  There is real evidence of positive change in the day-to-day operations of the Oberstown campus.  I have seen it myself and know it through meeting the children, staff, management and board of the Oberstown campus.  It is not just me who believes it.  Most recently the change is reflected in the report of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, on its inspections of the campus.  HIQA is authorised by me under the Children Act 2001 to undertake inspections of the Oberstown Children Detention Campus.  The chairperson of the board of management invited HIQA to read the report on the operational review for its most recent unannounced inspection which was carried out between 7 and 13 March.  The subsequent HIQA report on this inspection which was published on 9 October acknowledges that, having undergone major change in the past few years, the campus is now enjoying a period of relative stability.  Overall, the inspection found that where the focus of campus management and resources had been applied to address identified issues within the campus, improvements were evident.  The HIQA inspection report highlights that many of the recommendations identified by the review implementation group were implemented in full and that work on the remainder was under way at the time of the inspection.  My Department continues to monitor the review implementation group and the second report on the implementation of its recommendations will issue shortly.</p> <p>  The operational review was carried out following a particularly difficult time at the Oberstown centre.  There had been serious incidents, some of which were well publicised, involving young people which threatened the safety of the centre.  The campus had been experiencing extraordinary difficulties in 2016 and there were severe industrial relations issues.  There were also challenges in the structural redevelopment of the campus.  There was a difficult change process following the amalgamation of three well established autonomous schools.  These difficulties were well documented and well known at the time.  Some youths who were under 18 years of age were still detained in St Patrick&rsquo;s Institution and it was agreed that they would, in time, be detained in the Oberstown centre.  This was a very positive development, one that was warmly welcomed in the Oireachtas and beyond, but it, undoubtedly, created anxiety for staff and children alike as the operational environment in Oberstown faced many changes.</p> <p>  Unlike many other detention facilities in other jurisdictions which operate more like prisons, the campus is based on a care ethos in a secure setting.  This is a relatively unique but important approach.  My visit last week has reinforced my confidence in how the Oberstown centre is delivering care and support for the children being detained in it.  While the detention of any child is regrettable, the current atmosphere and operational structures in the Oberstown centre are focused on providing the best environment for children we can attain.  I was, as always, impressed by the dedication and commitment of the staff and the board to ensuring the operation of the campus focused on what was best for the children who spent time in the centre.</p> <p>  Last week I experienced a significantly more stable campus than in September 2016 when the board of management commissioned an external independent review of operations and best practice at the centre.  The review was undertaken by two international experts in this field, Professor Barry Goldson and Professor Nicholas Hardwick.  The terms of reference agreed to for the review stated its aims were to evaluate practice and policy in line with international standards and best practice; to identify obstacles or barriers to achieving greater implementation of international standards and best practice and to make recommendations to ensure greater and more successful implementation of these standards.  The board received the outcome of the review in February 2017.  Its immediate concerns about the review were that it had moved outside the terms of reference that it had developed; that it did not demonstrate any process for verifying the accuracy of its claims; and that fair procedures had not been adhered to in the case of persons referred to in it.</p><p> When I was last before the committee, I advised the members that the board of management of Oberstown had decided that it was not safe to publish the report of that review.  This decision was based on a careful and lengthy process of deliberation, including the commissioning of independent legal advice.  I also told the committee there were several requests for its publication.  I sought legal advice on the matter and the issue was the subject of detailed consideration and discussion involving the chair of the board of Oberstown and my Department.  On foot of the legal advice that I received, I asked the chair of the board of management to confirm that fair procedures had been observed in advance of any decision to publish the report.  At that time, we were still awaiting the chair&rsquo;s final response on this matter.  I advised the committee that further legal advice may have been required to ensure that fair procedures were adhered to and that I would decide whether the report could be released based on the chair&rsquo;s response and any further legal advice that would be received.  I also made clear that the board had carefully reviewed each recommendation made in the report and published those recommendations, together with the board&rsquo;s response in July 2017.  The publication of the recommendations ensured that the supportive and developmental aims of the review were met.</p><p> I wish to emphasise that my Department&rsquo;s focus and that of Oberstown children detention campus is on the implementation of the recommendations to ensure that there is a safe and stable environment in Oberstown which is responsive to the needs of the children detained there by the children&rsquo;s courts and for the staff who work there.  I have been advised by the board that its decision not to publish the report of the operational review was not one that it either expected or wanted to make.  It resulted from a lengthy, careful and extensive process of consideration which weighed up, in light of the independent legal advice, the legal risks associated with publication.  The board had always intended to publish the report and, in taking its decision not to publish it, was exceptionally mindful of the importance of ensuring transparency and accountability in operations.  I have been advised by the board that its aim in commissioning the operational review was specifically to understand how to retain the care ethos within a secure setting.  The review was explicitly intended to be a supportive and developmental process constructed to enable the campus to move on.  Integral to this process was feedback to the board, management of the campus, and staff.  I am advised by the chairperson that this feedback did not happen.  In addition, the findings of the report were never put to the board, the management of the campus or its staff for their response.  This is the fundamental problem and provides the context for the legal risks associated with publication.  It goes without saying that we always, in the legal context, have to ensure that any legal risks presented by publication of reports of this kind are very carefully weighed in the balance.  This was what happened in this case.  A careful process of consideration of the risks indicated in independent legal advice received brought the board regrettably to the conclusion that the risks of publication were too great.</p><p> Having been advised by the board of its decision, I then sought the advice of the Attorney General, who advised me that publication of the report was fraught with legal risk.  In light of the risks and based on the legal advice received, I gave the matter careful consideration and, in July 2018, I concluded that it is not appropriate to publish the full report.  It is imperative that a report of this kind should observe due process and fair procedures so that all persons referred to are treated appropriately.  Where a person is the subject of proposed criticism, he or she is entitled to fair procedures.  Following careful examination, the board was not in a position to ensure to either its satisfaction or mine that fair procedures had been applied before the report was finalised and submitted.  My officials recently raised the question of the publication of a redacted version of the report with the chair of the board.  However, I am advised that the board considered that there were serious flaws that could not be remedied at this stage and that redaction of the report was not feasible.  The board has further advised me that the reviewers have requested a copy of the board&rsquo;s independent legal advice before redactions can be made.  In other words, while the reviewers offered to make redactions, they have always insisted that they would only make them once they saw the legal advice.  The board remains of the view that the report cannot be published.</p><p> In reaching the conclusion not to publish the report, the board and I acted with due diligence, prudence and care to all of the parties affected and with regard, as is our responsibility, to what is in the best interest of the Oberstown children detention campus as a whole, including the best interests of the children under our care there.  The recommendations of the report, all of which are at the kernel of how we move forward to make Oberstown a safer place for young people and staff, are being implemented as part of a significant package of reform in Oberstown, which is now well under way.  The implementation of these recommendations has been my key priority to bring about improvements in standards.  My Department is supporting and, where appropriate, monitoring the changes necessary to ensure that international standards and best practice are observed and to identify and address any barriers or challenges to maintaining our ethos of care.</p></speech>

I will start by saying that the most recent Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, report clearly demonstrates that improvements have been made in Oberstown but that there are still some outstanding concerns about the centre.  The HIQA report indicates that, in terms of ten standards, the centre was found to be "moderately non-compliant".  Five areas of particular concern include the care of children, planning for children, premises safety and security, dealing with offending behaviour, and staffing and management issues.  While I acknowledge that there is good work going on, there is still more to be done, particularly with regard to the issue of single separation, which we discussed with the Minister previously.  The latest HIQA report shows that single separation was used 1,700 times in 2017, indicating that a lot of work remains to be done on that issue.</p> <p>  On the issue before us today, namely, the withholding of the report, I note that correspondence obtained under freedom of information by RTE for the "This Week" programme shows that the chairperson of the board of Oberstown informed the Department of Children and Youth Affairs that the board would not publish the report because of "legal risks".</p><p>We are all agreed on that.  It appears the legal risks were because members of the board were criticised in the report.  Is that true?  Does the Minister honestly believe that withholding the report, which appears to have done what it was supposed to do, namely identify the problems at the campus, is in the best interest of the detained children?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-18a.276" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018121800002#D00200"><p>On the Deputy's first point, on there being more to be done and on concerns over what needs to be implemented in regard to the HIQA report, that is why the reports are produced.  It is always going to be a challenging environment given the nature of the work done.  That is why it is important that there be ongoing inspections, reviews and examinations of the implementation of recommendations of many reviews.  That is work that is taking place.</p> <p>  There was a 56% reduction in the incidence of single separation between 2016 and 2017, and this was verified by HIQA.  A further 22% reduction was achieved between 2017 and 2018.  Overall, this amounts to a 60% reduction in single separation since 2016.  That is one of the aspects of the work being done and the improvements that are being made.</p> <p>  On the legal risks and the associated criticism of members of the board, the legal risks, as I have outlined and identified, are due to a lack of fair procedures.  The fair procedures require that when certain statements are made, they go back to the people concerned &ndash; the campus, board, staff, etc. &ndash; so there is a right of reply.  Reviewers are required to take this into account prior to publication.  That did not happen.  That is the nature of the legal risks.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked me about the best interest of the children.</p></speech>

I refer to the record of the D&aacute;il from last week, when we were in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  It is worth noting that the authors pointed out that throughout the entire process of preparing the final report for Oberstown management, the latter was provided with opportunities to raise anything it considered to be unfair or inaccurate.  This was before the final report was to be submitted.</p></speech>

As I understand it, there was a lot of exchange back and forth over a long period.  If the Deputy wishes, I could read the chronology of this exchange into the record, but the nub of it is that when the report was written and conclusions made, that work and the observations made were not provided to my officials or the board to review them in order that they might have a right of reply.  That is the nub of the fair procedure issue.</p></speech>

They said it was deeply problematic that it was not published.  They said they had very grave concerns about what they learned, about what individuals told them and about what they discovered during the operational review and that they believed it would serve the public interest for their findings to be published.  I am concerned by their statement that, if their report had been published, it might have been of interest to the courts and relevant to the sentencing of children involved in the disputes.  Does the Minister accept that the non-publication of this report might have affected the sentencing of the young people in 2017 and this year?</p></speech>

I am not in agreement with them but I respect their views.  On the Deputy's question, I believe there is no basis for the suggestion that the report would have been of interest to the courts and relevant to the sentencing of those involved.  The courts are completely independent in the performance of their functions.  Additionally, given that the relevant proceedings have not yet been concluded, such statements would risk interfering with an ongoing criminal matter.</p></speech>

This was raised last week during oral questions in the House.  Since then, I have been doing a fair amount of research and have gone back under the bonnet of it, so to speak.  Last week, I said I felt I was working in the dark.  I said so because there are pages of recommendations.  I want to know where they came from.  From what review?  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong in stating the recommendations have five different feeders.  Is it possible for us to know which review made each recommendation?  What came from the independent report and what came from HIQA?  From where was it all pulled together?</p><p>Let me give an example.  Recommendation No. 4, which is on its own, is that girls should no longer be placed in Oberstown.  The comment on this states:</p><blockquote>The Board is not in a position to address this matter, which falls under the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to consider as a matter of national law and policy. It has been referred to the Department for its consideration by the Review Implementation Group.</blockquote> <p>Who made that recommendation?  There are numerous others.  No. 8 is that &quot;Visits should only ever be screened in cases where it is demonstrably necessary following a robust individual risk assessment.&quot;  This contradicts recommendation No. 9: &quot;In accordance with the Oberstown policy, visits should never be stopped as a punishment.&quot;  There are contradictions in some of the recommendations and it is important for us to know where some of them came from.  Which reports do they fall under?</p><p>Have the recommendations of Professor Barry Goldson and Professor Nick Hardwick fed into the recommendation document?</p><p>Have we used the good bits from it?  I ask the Minister to answer some of that.</p></speech>

It is the response by the Oberstown children detention campus board of management to recommendations of the operational review, which was launched by Oberstown itself in July 2017.  That is how it is referred to and it was signed off on by the chair of the board.  I am trying to figure out the various lots of recommendations contained there along with the commentary.  There are recommendations and comments.  I am trying to understand the operational review.  It refers to the operational review, recommendations and comments.  I am trying to figure out who made the recommendations and what parts of the review fed into this.  I know the comments come from the board but who fed into the recommendations?  It is a fair point.</p></speech>

The board produced the document.  This is its bible so that when one visits Oberstown, one can see that X, Y and Z have been ticked off.  I am sure the culture and atmosphere is part of it but this is its bible to determine whether it is making progress when reporting to the Department with responsibility for youth justice or to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  This is its bible to say what it found at the time and what it is working on.  I am trying to unpack what is behind it.  Who fed into it and what recommendation came from where?</p></speech>

I have read the report in great detail and have placed pages and pages of my own post-its on it.  Something I found glaring was the fact that the percentage of staff with up-to-date training declined between the 2017 inspection and the 2018 inspection.  The dip related to child protection and safeguarding.  At the time of the 2017 inspection, 88% of staff were trained but as of March 2018, only 63% had trained.  In March 2017, 48% of staff had first aid training whereas in March 2018, 28% had first aid training.  Is there a reason for the dip in training and safeguarding for staff?</p></speech>

I raise the report because HIQA had sight of the full operational review, which is what we are here to discuss this afternoon.  As is usual in its inspections and having looked at the operational review, HIQA has identified an action plan and agreed a timeframe on it.  That is happening.</p></speech>

I share the concerns of other members about the report not being published.  One must ask what the purpose of commissioning a report is if it is never seen by the public.  It is in the interests of transparency that people are seeking to see the entirety of the report.  Not even a redacted version has been made available, even though the authors were willing to redact anything considered sensitive or unfair.  However, they were not taken up on that offer.  One of the points made by the two professors is that the failure to publish the report means the right lessons will not be learned by the many individuals and organisations which have had some involvement in the campus unless there is a full understanding of what happened in the past.  What is the Minister's view on that?  If we do not publish the report and delve into the details of what happened, how do we learn the lessons from what happened in the past?</p><p>I would have thought that was the purpose of preparing a report in the first place.</p><p> Has the Minister seen the legal advice, not the advice she would have obtained from the Attorney General, but the legal advice made available to the board?  She has seen that.  Was that legal advice made available to the authors of the report to explain to them why their report did not met with that legal advice?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-12-18a.332" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018121800002#F00200"><p>I think I have answered the Deputy's question about fairness.  She made the point that if the report is done, the public should see it in the interest of fairness.  I absolutely agree.  In my opening statement I said that was the board's intention and hope as well as mine.  I have indicated in terms of the legal advice as well as the experience of the board, the staff and my officials, that fair procedures were not followed.  Therefore there is a lack of fairness there, which leads to the legal risks, which is why there is not a publication.  Whereas I respect that the Deputy has raised the issue of fairness again, I believe I have already answered that question.</p> <p>  I absolutely agree that we must learn lessons from the past.  It is a great disappointment to me and to the board that this report cannot be published for the reasons I have outlined.  That is not to say that lessons are not being learned; they have been learned.  I have indicated all the ways that is the case from the perspective of the recommendations being published, the pulling together of those recommendations with recommendations from a number of other reviews, the HIQA report, the HIQA inspection and the action plan that has come about as a result of that.  That is the basis of the lessons being learned from the past.</p> <p>  I have not seen the legal advice that was given to the Oberstown detention campus.  The Oberstown legal advice was made available to the Attorney General.</p> <p>  Did the Deputy ask another question?</p></speech>

I can only assume that there was a threat of defamation proceedings from staff.  We do not know what was threatened.  Deputy Mitchell asked a very good question as to whether the Minister believed that non-publication serves the interest of children.  The Minister said "Yes".  How can she say that?  On the one hand she is saying she is very disappointed that we cannot publish and that she wanted to publish.  She is not publishing because of legal threats from people named or dealt with in the report.  That is not the children.  That is clearly other persons.  How can she say it is in the interest of children not to publish?</p> <p>  If fair procedures are not followed - I know this has been rejected by the authors - should we not start again and have another review?  If it was not done properly the first time, surely we should not just sit back and accept that.  The purpose of a review and report is to give us, the elected representatives, an opportunity to scrutinise the report on a very serious issue.  This all came about because of a UN anti-torture committee and very serious allegations that children were being detained individually.  I am not surprised that some individuals really did not want this report to be published.  However, if it was not done properly the first time, are we supposed to accept that or should we not try to do it properly a second time leading to a report that can be properly scrutinised?  I share the Minister's disappointment and it is not satisfactory to give up.</p></speech>

I have given answers here and in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  I do not accept what the Deputy has just said as a conclusion.  Should we do it again?  As I have also indicated, there are ongoing reviews and inspections of what goes on in Oberstown.  A HIQA inspection took place subsequent to that review.  If the Deputy's concern and interest is whether there are ongoing monitoring, inspection, assessment and evaluation, I can say they are happening.  That is the overall objective and I am satisfied that is the case.</p> <p>  Why do I say that the interest of children is served at this stage by the non-publication of the report?  I accept the advice is that there are legal risks.  The content of the material is such that it would not be good for that to be published.  It is important to ensure and support an environment in Oberstown that is conducive for the care of the children and that is supported by ongoing good working relationships between the staff, management and children.  It is my assessment that the legal risks with publication could potentially disrupt the stability that I have witnessed and the incredible improvements that have been made.</p></speech>

In fairness to her, she did not prepare the report.  She did not complain about it being unfair.  She is relying on legal advice from the Attorney General, based on legal advice from another legal firm.  I fully accept her bona fides in this regard.  I understand she is defending work that she did not carry out.  I accept that HIQA will consistently review the operation of the facilities and we will always look to make improvements.  The focus of every member here is to ensure that the children are looked after and cared for and that the infringements on human rights that we have witnessed never happen again.</p> <p>  We have a specific report that was commissioned on the back of a UN committee identifying serious breaches, including 3,000 incidences of single separation in one year, which is an incredibly large number.  What is the purpose of the report if we do not get to read it?  If it was done in such a poor way as has been alleged by some and if fair procedures were not followed, do we need to conduct that review again following the fair procedures that are necessary in order to facilitate publication so that we can then read and assess it?  Otherwise I am not sure why it was done in the first place.</p></speech>

We have all received most of the freedom of information legislation material based on the work of Justine McCarthy of RT&Eacute;.  I also have correspondence dated 17 November 2017.  The report was received in February 2017, almost a full two years ago.  I am reluctant to name people, but there is correspondence from the chairperson of the board to a senior person in the Department which states the board's view remained that it was not legally safe to place the report in the public domain and that it could see no basis for deviating from the position or distinguishing between different types of publication.  I understand some of the reason for the use of the phrase &quot;legally safe&quot; on the basis that, in giving it to certain stakeholders, it could be deemed to be legally published.  However, I am confused and worried about the Minister's submission, in which she stated:</p><blockquote>When I was last here I advised the committee that the board of management of Oberstown had decided that it was not safe to publish the report on that review.  This decision was based on a careful and lengthy process of deliberation, including the commissioning of independent legal advice.</blockquote> <p>The board has its own independent legal advice, while the Minister has the advice of the Attorney General.  Is there a conflict between the advice of the Attorney General and the board's legal advice on whether the Minister could or could not safely publish the report?</p></speech>

What are the risks?  Was the advice received from the Attorney General clear on the publication of the report?  Did the Attorney General hedge his position?  I understand the Minister will not go into the detail of the content of the Attorney General's advice, but it would be helpful if we could be given the sense that it was the Minister's intention to publish the report.  There is always a risk, but there does not appear to have been a <i>prima facie</i>case against the report's publication from the Government's point of view.  Is there a statutory entitlement on the part of the board not to publish?</p></speech>

The relevant date is 13 November 2017.  The correspondence states the Department is of the view that the following are mechanisms to progress matters to ensure the matters raised are addressed in respect of the board and principal people within it.  The first mechanism is a response to the authors of the report pointing to the existence of concerns about fair procedures and suggesting a further process of engagement with staff and management at Oberstown to ensure persons criticised in the report have been fairly heard.  The alternative mechanism would involve a submission by the board and management of the Oberstown campus on behalf of the persons criticised in the report to be disclosed to HIQA and the Oireachtas joint committee, with the report.  The officials sought to arrange a meeting between the relevant people and the Department to discuss the matter since the Minister was due to appear before the Oireachtas joint committee on 22 November.  As I recall, the issues did not arise at that meeting, but the Minister did anticipate that they would arise.  They are arising now.</p> <p>  On what we are strident - I think the Minister is seeing unity across the members of the committee in that regard - is the fact that I would not be doing my job if I left here with questions on my mind about the content of a report from eminent persons such as Professor Goldson and Professor Hardwick.  I am not a conspiracy theorist, but is there some cover-up of practices at the Oberstown centre about which we need to hear in the public interest?  Are people being protected unduly?  The conflict I have in my mind is that I must always take steps to protect the good name of individuals and due process, but there is also the matter of the public interest.  Notwithstanding the facts that the recommendations are being implemented, that HIQA is now in Oberstown and that there is a clear pathway in the improvements being made, we still have the sword of Damocles of the report hanging over our heads as an Oireachtas committee and I do not believe we will be satisfied until we receive clearer answers on its publication.  I do not believe the public will be satisfied until it is published.</p></speech>

What is the level of risk inherent in the Attorney General's advice to the Minister?  There was possibly more than one piece of advice.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify the matter.

Frankly, I do not think the Attorney General said to the Minister of the day that it was the advice of the office not to publish the report.</p></speech>

As Chairman, I believe there is a question about this document.  It has been shared with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the board of the Oberstown centre, HIQA, the Attorney General and the Minister.  It has been shared with these four institutions and their relevant heads.  The committee is responsible for the scrutiny of governance and budgets, etc.  Does the Minister believe an overview of the document should have been provided for the committee, even in a confidential set of circumstances?</p></speech>

This represents progress since the incidents in 2016.  The facility has shown a clear pathway to improving standards.  Following my visit not long ago, it was clear to me that some of the security changes made at the facility made it far more user-friendly in the creation of a secure environment.  The position, as the Minister rightly points out in her opening statement, is that the facility is not a prison.  It is an environment in which the children must be treated fairly.  Does the Minister have confidence that the unpublished recommendations made in the reviewers' report have been taken into consideration by HIQA and followed up since it was provided for HIQA?</p></speech>

The Minister has said she believed HIQA was fulfilling that function.  I am alluding to her answer to the last question.  My only observation is that there may be certain elements of the unpublished report that received the attention of those responsible for the independent legal advice provided for the board of the Oberstown centre and the Attorney General.</p><p>Are there sections in the report that have not been subject to recommendations from HIQA in particular?</p></speech>

Members of the committee and Oireachtas Members in general who have queried this matter would feel a lot more confident.  Deputy Sherlock is perfectly entitled to ask the questions he has asked and to leave this room without having further questions which, I suspect, is unlikely.  A mechanism should be created and I ask that the Department consider such matters in future.</p></speech>

I suspect, given the look on his face, that may prove to be the case.  Rather than the Minister having to field constant questions, freedom of information requests, segments on RT&Eacute; radio and everything else that has taken place in recent months, if members were provided with a rundown on the unpublished report, we would have avoided all of this.

We are reading these recommendations, which have been published, and I would like the Minister's perspective on a few of them.  Recommendation No. 79 states that a young person's clothes should only be removed in exceptional circumstances authorised by the director and that a dignified safe alternative should be provided.  Prior to the report, was this happening?  Is this a change of policy?  Recommendation No. 82 gave rise to a lot of alarm when we saw it.  The recommendation states that internal cavity searches of young people should never be undertaken unless authorised by a doctor for medical reasons.  The Minister can understand why we are concerned.  Was this happening?  When did it happen?  Is it still happening?</p></speech>

The questions on publishing the report constitute one issue.  There is also the committee's obligation and responsibility to scrutinise, as has been outlined very clearly, and I accept this.  This is different to putting something into the public domain that has legal risks attached, and perhaps there is a mechanism.  These have been my answers to the questions on the basis that I understood it was the committee's belief that it should be in the public domain and published, which is different to the committee's job of scrutinising a report and asking questions in light of it.  It relates to some of the questioning and people wondering about other mechanisms, the basis of some of the recommendations and the actual terms of reference.  Members are stating that they need more information in this regard.  I hear what they are saying.</p></speech>

The report was provided to the board of Oberstown and at that point legal advice was sought, which led to further legal advice from the Attorney General, which led to the Minister making a decision based upon the advice, which all of us respect.  However, this does not undermine the fact we have a job to do in scrutinising it in a reasonable fashion and the Minister has a job to do.  Not being provided with a background on the decisions leaves us all a disjointed position, whereby the Minister is fielding questions elsewhere in the Oireachtas and at this committee.  The manner in which it has been approached, and I do not believe this is the fault of the Minister-----</p></speech>

This is not casting any aspersions on anybody reading freedom of information requests and putting them together.  The truth is that unless people have the whole story, they have none of the story.  That is my take on it.</p></speech>

I will return to the questions I asked on the previous occasion.  Were any of the recommendations of Goldson and Hardwick, the authors of the report, not included in the 95 recommendations?</p><p>When I spoke at our previous meeting, I stated that the response of the board of management to the recommendations of the overall operational review 2017 was not just one review but was made up of five independent reviews: a review of security was completed in December 2016; two reviews in regard to health and safety took place in 2017; a review of behaviour management was completed in July 2017; and the reviewers conducted their field trip in October-November 2016.  When February 2017 came around, the board of management sought independent legal advice to clarify any legal risks associated with publishing the body of the report.  The advice received by the board was that the risks were too great and, so, it regrettably decided that the body of the report could not be published.  Notwithstanding this, 95 recommendations were published.  To go back to my initial question, of those 95 recommendations, which emanated from the security part, which relate to health and safety, which relate to the behavioural management part and what were the other recommendations?  I am trying to unpack it.  The Minister can appreciate from where I am coming.</p></speech>

If there is respect for due procedures, then there is an entitlement on the part of those who are the subject of the report to due process.  Given that there was no further interaction between Professors Goldson and Hardwick, and notwithstanding the fact Oberstown is implementing the recommendations and HIQA is across that, does this mean this report is still, arguably, in the Minister's or the Department's interpretation, not a full but a draft report, and incomplete in that sense as per the terms of reference?</p></speech>

I refer to a document of 15 August 2017 in this regard.  I have a full set of the documents through FOI.  The source is RT&Eacute; and this is in the public domain.  There is a letter in the Department which states that there is confusion generally as to the status of the report and that, while the reviewers consider the report to be the final report, this was not necessarily the view of the Department or Oberstown.</p></speech>

However, notwithstanding the advices of the Attorney General in the context of risk, as I understand it, the Minister still has full discretion, based on those advices, as to whether she wishes to publish the report.  I am only one Member of the Oireachtas.  I note the Minister's earlier comments in respect of the mandate of this committee but we are all also Members of the Oireachtas and we speak to the public interest and can question anything at any time.  Notwithstanding the mandate of this committee, it is my view that the Minister should publish and be damned, as they say, and put it all out there in the public domain.</p></speech>

I am not discounting what the Minister stated in respect of the recommendations and progress being made.  I understand the spirit of what she is saying.  However, in scrutinising this, when we see discrepancies highlighted, conflicting opinions and procedure that has not been followed in line with the terms of reference, although I am not saying that is definitely the case due to the legal implications, it leaves committee members in a difficult position.  I have reservations and I feel insecure about this, and that is just from listening to others.  That is what we are trying to put on the table.  Like Deputy Sherlock, I do not want to walk out the door and wonder whether we missed this or that or whether we should have done this or that.  I have to take the Minister's word and I respect what she is saying in this regard.  However, those are my reservations.</p></speech>

On the face of it, there seems to be a contradiction between the Minister and the Department's position and that of Goldson and Hardwick in this respect.</p></speech>

On that basis, at this point, I am not asking for the report's publication because of the legal risks involved.  I have indicated that.  The Deputy's question has to do with the fact that the reviewers say they offered those opportunities whereas the board is saying they did not.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked earlier whether this is a draft as distinct from the final report.  I could say in the sense of what we are arguing here that it is a draft, or that it ought to be a draft because they ought to have had the opportunity, which does not seem to be-----</p></speech>

The document was provided only once to the board but it occurs to me that if a review of a report is provided to its paymaster, namely, those who requested it, there would be a to and fro.  That would of course depend on the report but in this case, because it was dealing with individuals, there would have been a to and fro.  We now have a conflict.  The board says there was not and the authors say there was.  We will have to revisit this.</p></speech>

We can do that.  I will give an overview of the progress we have made.  It is acknowledged that in the absence of a dedicated Tusla-owned or Tusla-commissioned Irish language service, the quality of services provided through Irish is varied.  There are examples of areas in which services of a high standard are provided and of areas in which our obligations are not being met in full.  Tusla has demonstrated a strong commitment to ensuring the availability through Irish of services, documentation and reports in its early years inspectorate, its educational welfare service and its communication unit, as well as in some local areas, including those in the Gaeltacht.  While competence in Irish is not one of the criteria used when staff are being recruited to Tusla, we have identified 24 staff across our services who are competent in the language.  We are conscious that a staff audit needs to be undertaken to reflect accurately the actual number of staff who have competent levels of Irish for the purposes of service provision.  We intend to undertake such an audit in 2019.  Twelve of the 24 staff who are competent in Irish are based in the Galway-Roscommon area.  They are involved in ensuring services can be provided through Irish in areas like child protection, children in care, prevention, partnership and family support.  Among the services they provide are Meitheal, individual parenting sessions, social work assessments, inter-agency meetings and information briefings.  Tusla staff in the Louth-Meath area have established a quality improvement initiative to review how better to respond to the needs of children who are referred through Irish.  Irish-speaking foster carers are available in some areas for children whose needs are best met in the family setting.  Tusla also funds three family resource centres in the greater Donegal Gaeltacht area where services are provided through both English and Irish.</p> <p>  The role of Tusla's early years inspectorate is to promote and monitor the safety and quality of care and support provided to children in early years provision in accordance with the Child Care Act 1991 and the 2016 early years services regulations.  The aim of these regulatory inspections is to determine the extent to which services are well governed, the health, welfare and development of each child is supported, children are safe, and premises are safe, suitable and appropriate to the care and education of children.  Some 259 Irish-language services are registered with Tusla, 110 of which were inspected in 2018.  Reports were provided in Irish to those services which requested them.  A further 94 services were inspected the previous year and Irish reports were again provided when they were requested.  The early years inspectorate is committed to supporting early years services where Irish is spoken.  Formal written communication in Irish between services and the inspectorate is arranged.  There is one inspector in the inspectorate with high-level proficiency in the Irish language.  A specific Irish language inspector with expert proficiency in both oral and written Irish is being recruited to enhance and increase the service delivery to na&iacute;onra&iacute; and Gaelscoileanna.</p> <p>  The policy of the inspectorate is that while formal written communications are offered to services on request, inspection reports are available in Irish, as is the quality and regulatory framework, which was published recently.  The inspectorate continues to explore initiatives which would make translation more accessible and affordable.  It is constantly looking at ways to deliver services through Irish.  To enhance this work, the inspectorate engages with external stakeholders and Irish language representative organisations, including Comhar Na&iacute;onra&iacute; na Gaeltachta, which is an integral member of the early years inspectorate regulatory support forum, and Gaelscoileanna Teoranta, which is a member of the Tusla early years consultative committee.  These organisations offer information, advice and input on engaging with senior management in Tusla's early years inspectorate.</p><p>Our communications unit is committed to publishing as much content in Irish as possible.  It is expected that the amount of such content will increase significantly in the coming year.  I will mention some examples of the steps that will be taken.  Irish versions of press releases will be drawn up and we will be communicating in Irish across social media platforms.  I am personally committed to improving the quality and quantity of the service provided by Tusla through Irish.</p><p> I would like to mention some of the steps that are planned for 2019.  We are required to prepare a draft language scheme.  We have a scheme in the western area at the moment.  That is to be extended to the other areas in which we are involved with providing services.  As I have mentioned, we are looking at the recruitment of an Irish language officer, or the procurement of the services of such an officer.  As part of the creation of Tusla, we have worked with the HSE on many of these services under a memorandum of understanding.  To a large extent, our reliance on that has made it difficult to advance our Irish language services.  We are reviewing our publications in line with our obligations under the Official Languages Act 2003.  As I said, we are recruiting a dedicated additional Irish-language early years inspector.  Staff information systems are in place to assist in responding to communications received through Irish.  I have mentioned that we are undertaking a staff survey to establish the number of Irish speakers within our services.  We are looking to identify additional spokespersons to speak in Irish on broadcast media.  We already have a number of people who can perform this function for us.  We are going to undertake an audit of Tusla's estate portfolio.  We need to draft business cases around the extension of bilingual signs.  Historically, the HSE has undertaken much of this work for us because many of our buildings are shared with that organisation.  Tusla will take up much more of that work as it moves forward.  We plan to promote Irish-language upskilling and training through our workforce learning and development programme.</p><p> In summary, since its establishment Tusla has focused on its core services, which involve the protection of vulnerable children and their families.  It is only since 2016 that increased investment has allowed us to develop supports in other areas.  This has enabled us to adhere to the highest administrative standards in compliance with our legislative requirements.  As we move into the next stage of maturity and sustainability, there will be an increasing focus on developing and investing in the corporate spine of the agency, including increasing and improving the quantity and quality of services provided through Irish by Tusla.</p></speech>

I think there is no doubt that the true figure is much higher.  The Deputy is right when he says there is a need to survey that.  We have undertaken to do so next year.  Many of the staff employed in our educational welfare services are former teachers.  We definitely have access to people with good Irish language skills in that area.  However, this element of our service is not focused on the front end of child protection.  When we are recruiting people to work at the front end of child protection, we tend to look at the skills first.  That has been the case in the past.  While Tusla has been able to recruit a large number of social workers in recent years, it has struggled insofar as there has been quite a turnover in social worker skills.  We must try to address the need to have good social workers in place who have solid language skills in addition to the necessary skill set for working in child protection.</p><p>Our first case in recent years has been to try to get the social workers with those protection skills in place, but I take the point.  We have a lot more staff within Tusla who have those skills.  Part of our process is to try to put the plan together, make it attractive and have a survey of staff done, but it is also to encourage and support staff who have Irish language skills to move into service areas where they can support children who are brought up through Irish.</p><p> I reference the point we made about the early years inspectorate, whose job it is to look at the na&iacute;onra&iacute; and the early years education services and inspect same.  We have inspected quite a number of those in recent years and the communication is rarely with the children in those areas.  It is usually with the management.  The capacity to do those inspections through Irish is there, but we are conscious that we need to invest more and bring in a number of extra people for that.  What we have not done and what we plan to do next year is to have an Irish language officer or someone who has that work attached to them who can co-ordinate, make that a focus and allow us at least to put a plan in place, but who can also be somebody who is a central point in supporting Irish language service delivery.</p><p> We are aware of the capacity in terms of speaking to the media.  My colleague, Mr. Breen, can give some more information on our plans in that area.</p></speech>

We will take our team from three to 14, it is hoped by the end of February, because we are cognisant of the fact that we have in excess of 4,000 employees at more than 400 locations around the country delivering a full suite of services in child protection and welfare.  One of the priorities is to put the strategy in place.  We have a communications strategy, part of which is directly related to our obligations under the Irish language legislation.  In the context of conducting a communications baseline audit, in our internal communications service and workshops, two of which we have conducted already, we have been looking to ascertain if we can identify additional proficient Irish speakers.  Obviously some training comes with that.  If, as is the case with any large organisation, we are identifying spokespersons to speak with some degree of authority on a particular area, they will need training and some of them will sometimes be speaking on areas on which they need to be brought up to speed.  It certainly is a priority for us in 2019 to ensure that we have identified more spokespersons with a view to having them available to deal with broadcast media such as Raidi&oacute; na Life, Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta and TG4.</p></speech>

We have a lot of work yet to do in this area.  We are committed to the Irish language and we have representatives on our consultative forum and our regulatory support forum from the Gaelscoileanna and Comhar Na&iacute;onra&iacute; na Gaeltachta, CNNG.</p> <p>  On inspections, we only have one inspector in place who is fluent in the Irish language and that inspector is placed in a Gaeltacht area.  We are just finishing a campaign to have an additional inspector in another Gaeltacht area, and we intend that over the next three years we will have Irish language speakers as inspectors in all Gaeltacht areas.</p> <p>  On the campaign that we undertook, we did not have large numbers applying for the job.  This was not because of the Irish language requirement but because there was also the requirement to have an early years background for inspections and so forth.  That is limited so that is something that we have to work on.</p> <p>  On when we inspect services and na&iacute;onra&iacute;, many of our inspectors would have the basics to be able to talk at a basic level of Irish so they are conscious that the majority of the interaction is through English.  In 2019, we intend to undertake training assessment and training need and to try to identify people, in the Gaeltacht areas in particular, with whom we can expand and improve on that.</p> <p>  On inspections reports, we translate them when requested.  We are conscious that it is just when we are requested to do so.  We publish many documents in Irish and we publish a lot of documents.  This includes our quality regulatory framework.  We intend to publish every single document we have in Irish, but we have linked very strongly with our member representation from the Irish language community, particularly through our consultative forum, and they give us advice on which documents are more important to them.  However, we see that within five years we should be in a better position and we will be able to facilitate inspections, maybe not wholly or absolutely but to a better level than we have done, and we will put more expertise within the Gaeltacht areas.</p></speech>

One of the services and areas that the Chairman correctly identified that we were involved in was the Irish language services and we operated within the HSE's framework for that for the first number of years.

It is similar to many other corporate-type services or strategic pieces and it is only over the past two years that Tusla has had the resources and the control over those spaces.  It was not done as part of the initial setup.  Like many of the other pieces we came across in 2014, we just took what was in place and accepted that, and it was really only over the past two years that an identification of these different elements has come to the fore because there was no resource prior to that.  This represents another area in which we are trying to develop and create a service.  Our commitment to that is much stronger now than it had been previously.</p></speech>

As time has gone on, it has become increasingly difficult for Tusla to recruit foster parents across the whole spectrum, regardless of language proficiency.  That has certainly been much more pronounced in urban areas.  The closer one gets to Dublin, the harder it is to recruit foster parents.  However, the example of Galway-Roscommon would be quite strong in the numbers of foster parents that they have.  In that area there are a number of foster parents that I am aware of who have proficiency in Irish.  It depends on the part of the country one is looking at.  On the western seaboard, it has always been a bit easier to get access to foster parents.  As the economy has improved and available time has reduced, we have found it much more difficult to recruit foster parents in the eastern part of the country.  The Deputy's point is correct.  It is certainly a problem if children who have a proficiency in Irish are with foster parents who are non-Irish-speaking.  I am not aware of it being a major challenge but we can check this out and come back to the Deputy with some detail on that.</p> <p>  On the first question, on the assessment of child protection issues if the child's first language is Irish, I will ask my colleague, Mr. Noel Kelly, to give some insight on that and what we can do in those areas from a schools or educational welfare perspective.</p></speech>

We have one group of staff who are directly employed by Tusla, which are our educational welfare officers.  There are 89 of these, of whom six are proficient in Irish because they have come from a primary school teaching background.</p></speech>

We also have line management responsibility for the home school community liaison scheme.  There are 460 home school community liaison co-ordinators nationally.  More than 270 of those are based in primary schools and are qualified primary teachers with a proficiency in Irish.  While they are not direct employees of Tusla, that is a resource that is available to us as well.  Our service development and delivery at the moment is all about integration.  We have integrated those services together within Tusla and we are working very closely with our colleagues on this.  That is a resource that is available.  Colleagues in other services, if they need to, have access to talk to our colleagues.  In particular in relation to children in schools, we have a home school liaison teacher on hand who is available to the parents and to the child.  That is another support that we are using more and that we need to capitalise on further.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, but fortunately as well, the remit of the home school liaison scheme did not cover early years services, but we have a new circular in development with the Department of Education and Skills which will be putting an emphasis on involvement in early years services.  That is something that we should be able to offer as a support to our colleagues, that is, where necessary or possible, the home school liaison teacher could provide support and interpretation as Gaeilge.</p></speech>

I have recruited one senior communications officer who is proficient in Irish.  Since we have taken him on, we have started doing some more communication through Irish.  To give one example, in our public awareness week for child and family support, we had activity across our digital side in Twitter and Facebook, we sent out press releases in Irish also, and we offered availability of spokespersons through Irish as well to talk about that week.  To answer the Chair's question, currently we have one out of seven who is proficient in Irish and I am recruiting to a staff of 14.  I am not certain at this point, because we have some competitions to hold yet, who among the remainder to be recruited will have that level of proficiency.</p></speech>

It would be very difficult to recruit people if we put that in as a condition.  It would certainly limit the pool and skill set that we require across the different areas the communications team covers, such as brand identity, graphic design, content and digital, internal engagement and content curation, and senior communications people who deal with the press.  This would prove to be quite difficult and probably would limit the number of applicants who could apply.</p></speech>

We have actively taken steps to bring the directorate and the wider agency into line with the Act and have put plans in place to continue developing, for example, different publications that we produce and initiatives to build on that work that we have done.  To that extent we have taken a number of steps and perhaps I should point out a number of those to the committee.</p> <p>  I mentioned where we have begun with our social media approach and we propose to continue with that.  Any media queries we receive in Irish we respond to in Irish.  We arrange that these and the responses to them are translated.  We arrange similarly for the translation of emails and our responses to them. This includes a number of other publications like our annual reports and business plans, the publication of some of which is in train at the moment.  We also have the Irish language prominent across all of our branding, to include email signatures in the agency letterheads and presentation templates, as we would be presenting regularly to other agencies and organisations throughout the country.  We also have a number documents that are available in Irish.  These include all of our Children First documents and guidance documents under the Children First legislation and documents for mandatory reporters etc., all of which have been produced bilingually.</p> <p>  I am very conscious of our obligations to comply with the Act.  I was recruited a year and a half ago and my first goal was to build a communications strategy.  Within that strategy, a priority was to ensure compliance with Irish language legislation.  We are coming from behind and I fully acknowledge that, but we are also very conscious and committed to our obligation to ensure that we are in compliance with the Act.</p></speech>

Part of the positive aspect of this process has been a realisation by us about the fact that while we are desperately focused on the challenging role that we have in the provision of child protection welfare services and family supports, we need to be conscious in the delivery of those services to children and in terms of the education piece in which we are involved of the need, which I accept and see clearly, for an organisation like Tusla to be focused on their provision through Irish, where appropriate and required.  Part of our experience, like many of the things that we are trying to put together, has been that this has allowed us to focus on what we need to do, and what we need to get in there are the basics.  There are many standard pieces of documentation and so on in the organisation that we need to have in Irish.  The challenge for us is much more about how we provide services that interact on a human level with children, foster carers and families so that we are seen as an organisation that can provide Irish language services.</p> <p>  This is somewhat reflective of the Chairperson's questions to us on what we are doing to support the training of staff as an ongoing exercise.  That is something that we will look at to see if it may be an area in which we need some assistance, either through other organisations in the public service that do something similar, or we may need to look at how we do that in our own organisation.  Until we have done that, there will probably be gaps in our knowledge of things that we think may or may not be possible.  That for me is the take-away message from the process that we are in.  I appreciate the Deputy's offer of support, and we may come back to the committee on that.</p></speech>
