Apologies have been received from Deputies Deering and Aylward.</p><p>Are the minutes of the meetings on the meeting of 20 June, 27 June and 4 July agreed?  Agreed.  I do not think there is any matter arising from the minutes that we will not deal with during the course of the meeting.</p><p> In regard to correspondence category A, the committee received Nos. 2310 A and 2313 A from Mr. Peter Finnegan, Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas Service.  They are his opening statement and the briefing documents for today&rsquo;s meeting, which we note and publish.</p><p> Category B is correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow up to meetings of the committee and other items for publishing.  No. 2301 B is from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 5 July 2019 providing clarification in regard to information previously provided to the committee regarding the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.</p></speech>

Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; is qualifying what he said previously.  This goes back to the last Committee of Public Accounts.  I would like to hold this correspondence until September and deal with it then.  There are a number of issues around analysing what he said at the committee versus what is said in this letter.</p></speech>

We asked about the difference in remuneration for social workers recruited by Tusla as opposed to those employed via agencies.  He supplied a table, which includes a social worker on the first point at &euro;778 per week giving net weekly pay of &euro;556.  He said the difference between directly employed staff and agency staff is &euro;91.24.  Nowhere do I see a detailed breakdown of agency staff at an hourly and equivalent rate.  I do not follow the correspondence.  We need clarification.</p><p>The second matter relates to the Five Rivers agency, a private fostering agency operated in Ireland.  It has approximately 42 staff and operate nationally with a head office in Dublin.  He confirms payment to that organisation in 2018 was &euro;8.457 million.  I would like clarification as to whether that figure includes payment to staff and fostering families, and a breakdown of what it costs to run the Five Rivers agency <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>what is paid to the fostering families.  Presumably the &euro;8.457 million also includes the cost to the fostering families but I do not know and it is not clear from the letter. </p></speech>

I know there is an issue in Tusla around procurement and non-competitive procurement for services that could or should be competed for.  That figure certainly sounds very high.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-11a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019071100002#B01300"><p>We need clarification on that.</p> <p>  We also asked Tusla for a breakdown of the &euro;18 million budget for the 121 family resource centres around the country.  That has been provided.  We asked for a breakdown of the family resource centres by county, which has been provided in the appendix.  We sought a note on the operation of children and young person services committees, CYPSCs, which is provided.  We were given a note on that.  We will note and publish this documentation but we need to write back.</p></speech>

We all receive representations and I have heard from foster mothers who are at the end of their tether due to lack of back up.  Then we have these private companies where there is no procurement and lots of money.  My question is on the procurement.  Tusla is following up on the Five Rivers agency because that is what we asked about but are there other agencies in addition to that one?  We asked for a note on the Five Rivers agency contract to include details of remuneration paid to it and so on.  To be fair, that is what we asked for but it begs the question as to whether there are others and what is the value of that.  More importantly, what is the value of that to mothers on the ground who are struggling?  I could not let that go because I will be meeting the foster mothers again on Monday and I have met them every week as most of us have.  They are at the end of their tethers looking for the most basic help from the health executive.</p></speech>

I do not know, but we will ask for further elaboration.  We will note and publish the correspondence and seek further clarification on those items.</p> <p>  This may be a good time to note that we want to put a procedure in place in relation to correspondence received during the summer.  We cannot have a situation where correspondence is sitting here for a couple of months and would like some method by which to circulate it.  I will make one suggestion.  I note that the last day for submission of parliamentary questions is 23 July and further parliamentary questions can be answered by 6 September.  What are members' views on that?  I am not suggesting that we do it too often during the summer but we could circulate correspondence to members at the end of July and perhaps the end of August or the first week of September.  It is not that we will not have to deal with it when we return in September but some of it refers to current issues which we have asked about.  If information arrives in next week, it would be dreadful if we, as members of the committee, would not see it. </p></speech>

We are not talking about category C correspondence from individuals, which we never publish.  We are talking about items that would be in the public arena arising from our public meetings, namely, category B.  We will do it around the end of July and the end August and we will give the secretariat some flexibility in getting it to us.  It would be dreadful if we asked questions today and the answers came in next week but we would have to wait two months for them.  I thank the secretariat and we will ask it to do its best on that.  There is a system in place for parliamentary questions during recess, so we are not setting and new ground.</p> <p>  No. 2312 B is from the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, dated 5 July 2019 providing his response to our report on the examination of matters in relation to receipts from corporation tax, which we will note and publish.  The Minister sent a note during the week.  The committee issued this report in June 2018 but I think the ministerial response probably got lost in the mix in the Department.  We have received responses from our other periodic reports, Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, and the Department probably spotted that this was not there.</p><p>We can make a quick note of it but much of it relates to items in the public domain.  We will continually come back to issues such as corporation tax.<br/><br/>Our first recommendation was on the concentrated nature of corporation tax receipts.  We had asked for a special report but the Minister stated that one had been conducted by Revenue over the course of finance discussions some time ago.  He said the matter was under review and we will all be keeping it under review.  We will note that.<br/><br/>We asked for details of PAYE paid by participators in close companies.  The Minister said:</p><blockquote>To a large extent the close company provisions are designed to modify behaviour by preventing certain activities.  Revenue statistics provided to the Committee indicate that approximately 4% of close companies paid the surcharge in 2015 and approximately 4.3% of close companies paid the surcharge in 2014.  These figures indicate the effectiveness of that provision and Revenue is satisfied that the application of close company rules is achieving its intended purpose.</blockquote><p>The Minister has given a two-page response but I am only reading out his concluding paragraph.  We will note and publish this.</p></speech>

If any member wants to take up this issue, that would be useful as we approach the next budget because this information can be used in discussions of tax matters.  It is not exclusive to the Committee of Public Accounts.</p><p>We recommended separating the carry-forward losses for corporation tax between losses forward and capital allowances.  We asked Revenue to distinguish between those and have a separate line on tax returns to capture that information.  The Minister does not think this would provide much additional information.  However, Revenue has since written back to us to say it is a legislative matter.  It has separately told us that it cannot seek information to which there is no legislative basis, so if members want to achieve that, it would require an amendment to the Finance Bill.  The committee has taken this issue as far as it can.  It is now up to individual Deputies to decide if they want to bring it to the Oireachtas as part of the Finance Bill.</p><p>We made another recommendation on the sustainability of corporation tax.  The Minister had previously prepared a paper on this for the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, which he has attached.  It is a live issue, and we note that.</p><p>On double taxation agreements, we concluded: &quot;The Department of Finance should ensure mechanisms are in place to verify any claims for double taxation relief made in Ireland  by companies that are non-resident In Ireland.&quot;  The final paragraph of the Minister's response states:</p><blockquote>While Revenue do have information from corporation tax returns on the number of non-resident companies who file returns in Ireland and the amount of corporation tax paid, they do not have available information in relation to any claims for double taxation relief made by these companies in their country of tax residence.  In practical terms it would be difficult to obtain such information and, as it is the country of tax residence that would be granting relief for Irish tax already paid on the same income, it would primarily be a matter for that country to verify the claim before granting the relief.</blockquote> <p>These companies are non-resident in Ireland for tax purposes and the Minister says the onus is on revenue authorities in the countries in which they are tax resident.  We made a fair point and that is probably a legitimate answer.</p><p>We asked about the effective rate of corporation tax and recommended: &quot;The Department of Finance should examine this matter such that there is general agreement on a single most appropriate method for calculating the effective rate of Corporation Tax on company profits.&quot;  In his response, the Minister refers to about five different methods of calculation.  Two or three of them are from the OECD but every international body has a different definition of the effective rate of corporation tax.  The Minister says each report can add value because they all have different nuances.  He does not agree that there should be one effective rate because there is no international agreement on the matter.</p><p>We referred to real estate investment trusts and stated: &quot;The Department of Finance should carry out a review of the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) regime to ensure that domestic and EU ownership is being encouraged appropriately.&quot;  Our concern was many of these REITs are from outside the EU.  The Minister's conclusion states:</p><blockquote>REITS provide a number of benefits for investors when compared to direct property investment, including diversification of risk, increased liquidity, lower entry costs, and regular income streams.  They were designed to provide investors with access to investment in real estate without buying property directly.  This reduces the risk to both landlords and tenants that results from the more common model, in the Irish residential property market in particular, of an individual landlord owning one or two heavily-leveraged rental properties.</blockquote> <p>The role of REITs which come into Ireland to buy up entire blocks is a big political debate.  Local people cannot buy anything because everything is being bought by REITs.  We will note the Minister's response and put it on the record.  These are all policy issues, which we will be discussing. </p></speech>

While I accept this is a policy area, we will return to this issue in time and ask if the REITs were value for money.  Rather than seeing it in hindsight, we can see forward with 20:20 vision.  If one could make that prediction now, we would say the REITs are clearly not value for money.  It is extremely frustrating that we can see that and that it is happening in real time.</p></speech>

Some might agree that is a good policy and some might not, but it means there is an incentive for a large number of properties coming on stream to go into the long-term rental market as opposed to being owned by people.</p></speech>

It is a detailed response and I thank him for it.  It is a good example of being on top of one's brief, as were the representatives of the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, who were here last week.  They were very professional in answering questions and the meeting went off without a hitch.  I ask all Departments to follow suit in order to make life much easier both for themselves and the committee.</p><p>Parts of this response from the Department of Finance relate to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, which we will be discussing in private session this afternoon.  Mr. Moran provides a note on the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  He also gives details of the two sets of litigants in the cases taken regarding the liquidation of IBRC, including a note on the cost of defending these cases.  He provides a history of the case taken by Mr. David Hall and also mentions that Mr. Paddy McKillen has issued a second plenary summons in relation to a different matter.  That is on the public record.</p><p>Mr. Moran provides details on the advice of KPMG in relation to the IBRC liquidation, including terms of reference and dates of contact.  He confirms the following: &quot;As part of the preparatory work leading up to the Special Liquidation of IBRC, Kieran Wallace was consulted on a confidential basis as set out in the engagement letter dated 7 February 2013 between the Department of Finance and KPMG.&quot;  That was around the time the special legislation went through.  Mr. Moran further states: &quot;A copy of this letter was provided to the Committee on 19 January 2018 and sets out the services provided to the Department in relation to general restructuring advice and acting as Special Liquidator.&quot;</p><p>The next issue we asked for information on was the Minister's decision not to follow the recommendation of the Committee of Public Accounts to establish a committee of inspection on IBRC.  Mr. Moran gives a detailed response stating, essentially, that the purpose of a committee of inspection is to protect the unsecured creditors.  He confirms that, ultimately, the only unsecured creditor in this case will be the State and that the Minister for Finance, as the shareholder, will deal with that.  The Department of Finance is<i>de facto </i>the only unsecured creditor and Mr. Moran believes nobody else could be on an inspection committee, as there is no other unsecured creditor.  Only the State and the taxpayer will be at a loss.  Special legislation was enacted to set aside the normal provisions in the Companies Act because, ultimately, only one unsecured creditor was to be expected at the end of the day.  It is a policy matter, as the issue arises from the legislation and that is the essence of what we will be discussing this afternoon.  Our concern is the lack of oversight by the Department, which is not doing as thorough a job as a committee of inspection would normally do, as we have highlighted.  It is not providing adequate resources and is only monitoring what comes in.</p><p> I will read on.  A note on the Exchequer borrowing-----</p></speech>

I have had a glance of this only in the last 20 minutes.  Essentially, in a liquidation the unsecured creditors, which can include trade creditors, come together and employ the liquidator - Revenue is regularly involved - to look after their interests and recover as much money as possible for them.  The Minister is saying that when the Department came to the IBRC it had been nationalised.  The Government decided to liquidate it, and it was clear at that stage that the only unsecured creditor likely to be standing at the end of the liquidation process was the State, which is now the case.  The Minister is saying there is only one unsecured creditor, namely, the Minister for Finance acting on behalf of all the citizens of Ireland.  The Government is therefore saying it disapplied the Companies Act committee of inspection provisions that would apply in a normal liquidation because this liquidation was different in that there was only one unsecured creditor, namely, the Minister for Finance as the shareholder.  He is therefore saying he is the committee of inspection and the only one looking for money at the end of this process to come back to him on behalf of us.  He is saying the Department took over the job of the committee of inspection.  That job would normally be done by a committee of several creditors.  I am explaining this as best I can.  I am not defending the Minister's position but outlining it to Deputy Connolly as I read it.  The Oireachtas agreed to this, which is the other point.</p></speech>

In fact, the very point that was made was that we were missing things in the Bill by virtue of the fact that we did not have the time to scrutinise it properly and we were advised that it had to be adopted before the markets opened in the morning.  It is very easy to miss things in such a scenario, which is important to say if we are saying the Oireachtas passed the legislation.  In the normal course of events it is a court that supervises a liquidation.  This is the biggest liquidation in the history of the State.  The point the Chairman made is the point we have been trying to make, that is, that it is a matter of scrutiny and oversight.  Let us consider the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  The Comptroller and Auditor General audits NAMA and has a number of people within the agency with oversight of what is happening.  This was Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  While we are probably getting the best return available from anything that was disposed of, we do not have sight of that to the same extent as we have sight of-----</p></speech>

It was an enormous amount of money.  The Minister is certainly not going to accede to a committee of inspection - I see the point - but there remains a deficiency in the oversight.</p></speech>

When one stands back and looks at this it is clear that, as a result of the banking crisis, we put most of the debt into NAMA for it to manage and to get the best return for the taxpayer.  NAMA is a public body audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It has come before this committee and the finance and public expenditure committee.  There is total public scrutiny of NAMA's activity.  This was part of the same exercise.  There were bank debts but a special liquidation process was set up without public scrutiny, auditing by the Comptroller and Auditor General or oversight from the finance committee of the Houses or the Committee of Public Accounts.  In hindsight, perhaps there should have been a subsidiary of NAMA set up to oversee the liquidation.  It is too late to have that conversation now but, in retrospect, I think all the oversight we have over NAMA could have been achieved in the case of this body had we taken a different route from that of the special liquidator.  However, that is a policy matter.  At this stage, one of the biggest criticisms is probably that we took the liquidation of IBRC away from public scrutiny and transparency.  We did not do so with the other bank debts.  We put them into NAMA.  That was a big call, and that is probably the essence of the reason we continue to debate this issue.  There is a lack of transparency and oversight.</p></speech>

I would not be involved in an audit carried out in the normal way, whereby there is a commercial trading and a commercial activity.  That is the standard.  There is an expectation that market disciplines would drive commercial decision-making.  Therefore, it is not necessary for the audit to be carried out by me and for there to be oversight by the Committee of Public Accounts.  I think that is the logic of the distinction that is made between my auditing State-supported activities on the one hand and, on the other, commercial or quasi-commercial activities such as the ESB, Bord G&aacute;is, Coillte and so on.</p></speech>

That is really where the driver is expected to be - the trading or the disposal of assets on a market basis.  That is the obligation in the law.

The Minister had some documents out there well in advance.  It was highly teased out.  I am sure there are still flaws in it.  We spotted the flaws in section 172 here as a result of our work ten years on, or perhaps it was known much earlier in the Department, but the D&aacute;il did not seem to pick it up.  This was emergency legislation that was rushed through.  We can see the consequences now, but my recollection is that the Department was willing to come in and talk about that.  Kieran Wallace, I think, was due to come before the committee as well.  However, the initiation of court proceedings stopped the meeting from going ahead.  One could argue that the reason we do not have the level of scrutiny at the Committee of Public Accounts is the court case.  The Department said it was most anxious to come in, and the liquidator was most anxious to come in and speak as much as he could.  However, once the court case was initiated, it stopped them coming in.  It is a pity there is not public scrutiny here.</p><p>We will have a private meeting this afternoon with David Hall and others specifically on this topic.  Our concerns have been well ventilated here.  The next notes in this correspondence are 5 and 6, which relate to the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, which will be noted and published but we will discuss it in private session.<br/><br/>Note 7 is the Exchequer borrowing requirement to refinance the commercial Irish Water loans.<br/><br/>Note 8 is the year-on-year decrease in loans to the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, between 2013 and 2017, to include details of any impact on the ability of the HFA to deliver new housing stock.  We will note this.  People can comment on that and use this information.<br/><br/>Note 9 is on the possible fines that can be levied against Ireland by the European Commission in respect of missed climate targets, to include details of the availability of carbon credits and their potential to offset fines.  We will note this and specifically cover it in our periodic report during the week.<br/><br/>Note 10 is on the &euro;14.5 million recovered from Aughinish Alumina, to include details of the deposit account in which it is being held and any fees or interest applicable.  There also is a detailed note on that.  A hearing took place on this on 2 April 2019 and a judgment is awaited.  The money - approximately &euro;15 million - has been left in a general zero interest account, or thereabouts, and is lodged with Danske Bank after a recommendation by the Comptroller and Auditor General some time ago.  Note 10 is on the internal scoping exercise being carried out by the Department, to include details of the start and completion dates.  This relates to the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on Ireland's transactions with the EU.  That is all noted.<br/><br/>The following notes, 11 and 12, are schedules and breakdowns on categories and grades of staff set out.<br/><br/>Note 13 is on the public interest directors as appointed to various banking bodies by the Minister, to include clarification of the role, structures, recent appointments and when any outstanding appointments are due to be completed.  Members can read that information.  We covered that subject generally at the meeting.<br/><br/>Note 14 is on the surge in corporation tax receipts in recent years and the development of GNI* to include the effect of multinational activity on Ireland&rsquo;s EU contributions.  There is a detailed note on this and the figures are given for 2016, 2017 and 2018.  The correspondence refers to the budget contributions and a paper that has been commissioned in this regard.  Mr. Moran stated in his correspondence: </p><blockquote>Finally, it should be noted that the Minister for Finance has commissioned a paper to highlight some of these in-built vulnerabilities and to quantify where possible, the impact of such a shock. [This is a reference to the corporation tax issue] Potential solutions to this are presented in order to prompt a policy discussion around how best to mitigate against this emerging over-reliance [on corporation tax].  It is the Minister's intention to give consideration to these - and possibly other suggestions - with a view to making recommendations to Government in the autumn. [That obviously means before the budget] </blockquote><p>This review of the potential over-reliance on corporation tax is being reviewed and we would expect to see information on that published before the autumn.  Members should note that for the end of September.  We need sight of that before the budget.<br/><br/>Note 15 is on the projected changes to Ireland's EU contributions and money received in the event of Brexit.  Mr. Moran does not give the figure because he said it is sensitive information currently, but I believe a figure was mentioned by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade yesterday.<br/><br/>The final item in Mr. Moran's correspondence is note 16 on An Post National Lottery Company entering voluntary liquidation after the sale of the franchise to include details of the winding-up process, the transfer of unclaimed prizes and any difficulties encountered.  The board has liquidated all of its assets and cash in hand, but the transfer of expired unclaimed prizes did not impact on the matter because they were now defunct.  That fund of unclaimed prizes is managed and controlled by the Regulator of the National Lottery.  While Premier Lotteries Ireland - the private operator - sought these expired unclaimed prizes to supplement lottery prizes to supplement its lottery prize money the Department considers that the proper and legal course is that these moneys should be returned to the Exchequer, in support of the subvention of good causes, and Mr. Moran's Department has written to the national lottery regulator accordingly.  The regulator has sought some additional information from the Department, which has recently been provided, and the Department currently awaits the regulator's decision.  That issue of unclaimed prizes is being dealt with by the Regulator of the National Lottery and the Department is looking for the money to be returned to the Exchequer for good causes.  They await a final outcome from the regulator on that.  I apologise for all of those long documents but it is good to clear them.<br/><br/>We will move on to category C, which is correspondence from private individuals and other correspondence.<br/><br/>No. 2253C is from an individual, dated 16 May 2019, requesting the committee to make an inquiry regarding the University of Limerick student records system.  A significant level of detail is provided in this correspondence and at our committee meeting on 20 June 2019 we decided to hold it over for further consideration.  We had previously requested the University of Limerick for a response and the reply from the university stated there was no record of a submission from the individual concerned.  It goes back a number of years to 2011 and 2012.  As the matter is highlighted the individual has come forward stating that the grades she received in 2011 and 2012 were not adequately recorded.  The individual has written again to the committee and it appears that she brought the matter to the attention of certain individuals at the college but not through the normal proper structures to have a regrading looked at.  The individual is now saying that the college is not going back to 2011 and 2012.  This matter is not within the remit of the committee and I do not see how the committee can help any further.  We have exhausted this with the university directly.  I propose to advise the individual that if she believes she was not treated fairly, she should contact the Office of the Ombudsman, if she has not already done that.  We have taken it as far as we can.  We are disappointed we did not get satisfaction but we cannot take it any further.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.<br/><br/>No. 2299C is anonymous correspondence in respect of Maynooth university.  At our meeting on 27 June, the committee considered the 2018 accounts and statements of the National University of Ireland Maynooth and noted a provision of &euro;750,000 relating to impairment of a loan to a loss-making subsidiary company that was set up to commercialise intellectual property and to provide consultancy and training services.  Will the Comptroller and Auditor General indicate whether it was a provision or a write-off?</p></speech>

The university had extended a loan to the subsidiary and the university was recognising that &euro;750,000 of the amount loaned was unlikely to come back.</p></speech>

We are not getting into the essence of the details of the correspondence No. 2299C.  Yesterday I received two other anonymous letters in the same vein, which I have given to the secretariat.  All three of them were essentially on the same issue with regard to National University of Ireland Maynooth solely as result of us raising the matter here last week.</p> <p>Related correspondence No. 2315C is another anonymous document on this and No. 2299 also poses some questions on the matter.  Essentially the individuals say that the matter was well known for a number of years and ask why it was not highlighted before now.  The correspondents ask why the governing body of the university did not know about it, why the Comptroller and Auditor General did not know about it and why was it not made known long before now.  No. 2315C also alleges an issue of some 800 part-time staff being employed on zero-hour contracts and with no proper employment rights.  These are three letters following on from the &euro;750,000 provision query.  I propose that we ask the secretariat to write to the college summarising the points of the three letters and to ask for the college to deal with these before it replies - we had written to the college asking for an explanation around the &euro;750,000.  The committee has now received additional information in the recent days.  We must write a second letter summarising the points made and asking the college to deal with the issues raised in this correspondence as a result of us highlighting the matter last week.  Is it agreed to allow the secretariat to proceed?  Agreed.  We will circulate a copy of the letter that issues to the university to the members if they wish.  They will be up to speed on the matter if it arises.</p></speech>

They then made the provision.  I understand that the subsidiary was established only in February 2016.</p><p>It has not been up and running for long.  It was anticipated that it would take some time before it came into a situation where it made a surplus or a profit.  It is fully consolidated into the university financial statements anyway, so the outgoing has already been taken and presented on the consolidated side.  It is only a question of the position as between the university and subsidiary.  I understand, as the Chair has said, that the committee has written to the university and it is really for the university to provide more detail on the matter.  I have not presented a report on it.  I drew attention to it.  I am constrained in being able to say anything more about it at this stage.</p></speech>

Many of them are tutors.  It is quite shocking that there is such precarious employment.  Would that become obvious in a set of accounts?</p></speech>

My understanding from the documents that have been provided is that it refers to part-time casual employment.  These are people who may be hired to tutor for a couple of hours a week or it may be on an episodic basis.  There may be other colleges where a similar practice arises.  A number of years ago, there was concern about contracts of indefinite duration on which people were being hired, usually on contracts for specific research projects.  That position was regularised as a result of legislation in 2013 or 2003.  I cannot recall offhand.  Legislation has resulted in a number of employees of third level colleges being given permanent contracts with the entitlements that come with that.</p></speech>

That is the individual's view.  I propose that we send the individual the copy of the sixth periodic report in which we made our recommendations on broadband.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I propose that we deal with No. 2302C in private session.</p> <p>  No. 2303C is from Deputy Catherine Murphy and relates to properties such as embassies owned by the State outside the country.

The association states that more than 1,000 appeals are waiting to be heard and that service station members have no faith in receiving a fair decision on appeal.  It states that the Valuation Office is refusing to release any data on the external audits carried out in 2017 and 2019 following freedom of information requests.  I propose, with the committee's agreement, that this is circulated with normal correspondence.

I will put them in writing to committee members so that I do not take time here and I would appreciate if the Chairman forwarded them on.  I think that the submission sent to us does not deal with the questions that we asked.  I have drilled down into the companies.

I want to make some suggestions.  I will explain how this works practically.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report will be out at the end of September.  We will have to give people at least a week to come in.  We might speak to the Comptroller and Auditor General closer to that time about who we might invite in.  Maybe that will happen in early October.  We will probably have three meetings around the end of September and the beginning of October before we have a chance to deal with the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  I suggest that in the meantime, pending the Comptroller and Auditor General's documents, we should hear from certain organisations that have not been here before or have not been here for a long time.  I think it could be very useful.  Maybe we will ask the secretariat to arrange such meetings for dates around the end of September.</p> <p>  I suggest that an invitation be sent to the Data Protection Commissioner because data protection is a big issue in Ireland now.  We have big European responsibilities here.  We want to check the Data Protection Commissioner's governance and arrangements.  I do not think An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been here for quite some time.  People might want to see how An Bord Plean&aacute;la is being operated.  The Charities Regulatory Authority has not been here for quite some time.  Having gone through a list, I have decided to suggest those three organisations for early invitation.  We are not waiting for the Comptroller and Auditor General's report in those cases.  We will ask all three bodies to have up-to-date financial information.  It will not look good if they do not have their 2018 accounts audited and available to us.  If such accounts are not available, we will go ahead with the meetings anyway.  The bodies in question will be required to provide draft information or something on which we can have a meaningful discussion.  We need up-to-date information, even if it is awaiting publication or final sign-off.</p> <p>  It has been mentioned that Bord na gCon will be in at an early stage.  When we get the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, we will see if there is anything on Bord na gCon in it.  There are some other items that have been on our work programme for some time, but are not specifically listed for a meeting.  We have said we will come back to the issues of capital projects, procurement and public private partnerships.  The issue of protected disclosures is hanging around across many Departments the whole time.  I think we will try to start with the Data Protection Commissioner, An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the Charities Regulatory Authority.  We will consider those types of subjects.  As soon as NAMA is ready with Project Nantes, officials from NAMA will be asked to come in as well.  When we get the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, we will be able to move into other areas in early October.  We want to let the secretariat make some arrangements over the summer so that meetings will have been arranged for us when we come back.  I went through a good list before settling on the organisations I am suggesting.  I think it would be useful to invite them in.</p></speech>

Things have changed somewhat with regard to An Bord Plean&aacute;la's finances since it was given a slightly different role in strategic planning applications.  There is probably a larger amount of money involved now.  It would not strike me as an organisation that is screaming out to be interrogated from a public accounts point of view.  Maybe something is showing up in its accounts.</p></speech>

An Bord Plean&aacute;la receives &euro;17 million of taxpayers' money directly from the State.  I think that is a big threshold.  It is a bigger threshold than the Charities Regulatory Authority, which receives approximately &euro;4 million.  The Data Protection Commissioner receives State funding of-----</p></speech>

I am probably making my point very badly.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's reports throw up anomalies and things that really need to be interrogated.  That is where the first call is.  Sometimes, there are very big amounts of money that probably do not get the same level of scrutiny as relatively big amounts of money that are small by comparison.  I am more inclined to think we should go back and look at the report to make sure we have covered the things that stand out as-----</p></speech>

Obviously, there is a threshold in relation to the volume of spend here.  While we cannot go outside our remit, there is an issue here in relation to how that spend is dealt with.  Very few people here in the committee know that there was a review done of An Bord Plean&aacute;la which has been published, but as far as I remember has never really been looked at or received any airtime.  It was a review of the way in which An Bord Plean&aacute;la operates.  It was nothing to do with decisions.  I accept that we can never go there.  I agree with that principle.  We must ensure there is transparency in relation to how it operates, not in relation to how it comes to its decisions or anything to do with that.  People do not know how it operates.  I think we would do the public a service by fleshing through how An Bord Plean&aacute;la works, why it has to exist and why it has to operate in the manner in which it operates.  There is a significant threshold of money here.  People need to see how transparently it is being spent.</p></speech>

We have gone through every chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for last year.  The only chapter that has been held over relates to the Courts Service.  We had to postpone it because we brought forward the HSE the other day.  Only one chapter is left.  We are up to date with every special report the Comptroller and Auditor General has issued, with the exception of a small report on education capital projects.  We will deal with capital projects.  We have gone through Votes systematically.  Last year, we picked out groups that had not been brought in before.  We brought in the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is in today.  It was never in before.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General had never been in before.  We brought in the Office of the President and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.  We have done a very comprehensive trawl of all the big Departments.  The only non-departmental agencies with big spending issues are bodies like IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  They were here less than a year ago.  We can put them on the list.  They would be the biggies among the bodies that are spending large amounts of money.  It is important to let An Bord Plean&aacute;la and every other public body know that it is liable to be brought in here at some stage if there is a case for doing so.</p></speech>

If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>Members are reminded that, under the provisions of Standing Order 186, the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.<br/><br/>While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour, they can, and should, expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.<br/><br/>I invite the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The commission operates under the framework established by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003.  The commission's accounts are a cash-based record of receipts and payments compared to the Estimates.  Funding for the commission is provided for statutorily every three years, with Estimates proposed annually to draw a tranche of the three-year budget.  The overall funding approved for 2016 to 2018 amounted to &euro;369 million.  By the end of 2018, a total of &euro;363 million had been used.  The balance of &euro;6 million is no longer available to the commission.</p> <p>  The commission's 2018 account recorded gross expenditure of &euro;134.4 million, distributed among service areas as indicated in the diagram on screen.  Pay-related expenses are distributed across a number of the categories and amounted to approximately 65% of total spending in 2018.  Further expenditure related to the operation of the Houses of the Oireachtas in 2018 was borne by some Votes and the Central Fund of the Exchequer.  This includes spending by the Office of Public Works, OPW, on the premises used to accommodate the services, totalling an estimated &euro;11.6 million; parliamentary activities allowances paid to political parties and Independent Members, totalling &euro;8.6 million; funding for political parties related to their share of the vote in D&aacute;il elections, totalling just under &euro;6 million; and pensions and retirement gratuities of retired staff members, totalling &euro;4 million.  Payments in respect of the pensions of Members of the Houses are accounted for in the appropriation account in the form of an annual grant to Ciste Pinsean Thithe an Oireachtais.  This amounted to &euro;11.8 million in 2018.  A separate account is prepared in respect of the ciste.</p> <p>  Receipts of the commission in 2018 were just under &euro;2.8 million.  This included just under &euro;200,000 remitted to the commission under an agreement governing the operation of the Houses catering and bar services.  Those services are accounted for separately from the appropriation account and a summary of the transactions is included as note 7.3 to the account.</p> <p>  Members will be glad to note that I issued a clear audit report in respect of the 2018 account.</p></speech>

A Chathaoirligh agus a chomhalta&iacute;, f&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh an deis seo teacht os comhair Choiste na gCuntas Poibl&iacute; agus cabhr&uacute; le scr&uacute;d&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar chuntais Choimisi&uacute;n Thithe an Oireachtais don bhliain 2018.  Is &eacute; seo an ch&eacute;ad uair dom a bheith i l&aacute;thair mar Oifigeach Cuntasa&iacute;ochta Sheirbh&iacute;s Thithe an Oireachtais.</p> <p>  I welcome the opportunity to attend before the committee to assist in the examination of the accounts of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission for 2018.  This is my first appearance as Accounting Officer of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am joined by members of my management team, who are sitting alongside me, and some senior colleagues who are sitting behind.  In this statement, I propose to give the committee a brief overview on the funding allocation and 2018 appropriation account, some key activities during 2018 and beyond, our corporate governance system, and our strategic goals for 2019 to 2021.</p> <p>  The commission is funded on a three-year statutory cycle basis, as approved by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and paid out of the Central Fund.  The 2016-2018 allocation was &euro;369 million.  The total outturn for the period was &euro;363 million, or 98.5% of the allocated budget.  The unspent allocation of &euro;6 million was not carried over to the 2019-2021 funding period.</p> <p>  The accounts under consideration relate to 2018, which is the third year of the current D&aacute;il and the final year of our three-year allocation.  The audited accounts of the commission show that the gross expenditure for the Houses in 2018 was &euro;134.4 million against an Estimate provision of &euro;135.9 million, representing a 1% underspend.  Salaries, pensions and allowances accounted for &euro;97.4 million, or 73% of total spend, which can be classified as non-discretionary spend.  Interparliamentary activities, broadcasting services, committee expenses, parliamentary printing, legal costs and essential consultancy and administration costs, including office premises, facilities, basic ICT equipment and services, and postal and telecommunication services, amounted to &euro;26 million, or 19% of total spend.  This was also non-discretionary.  The remaining budget of &euro;11 million, or 8%, provided for ICT, Library and Research Service project spending, and training and development costs.  This was the discretionary element.</p> <p>  The committee should note that the Houses of the Oireachtas Service is now a large organisation.  We have a total payroll in respect of 2,027 people, catering for the salaries, allowances and pensions of Members and former Members, political staff, MEPs, former MEPs and Civil Service staff, including some former State industrial, officeholder and catering staff.  On 31 December 2018, the commission employed 564 full-time equivalent, FTE, staff, comprising 511 Civil Service staff, 17 State industrial and officeholder staff and 36 catering staff, at a cost of &euro;31 million or 23% of the budget.</p> <p>  I will draw the committee's attention to some of the key activities in 2018 and beyond.  The expenditure for 2018 reflects the considerable changes implemented in the D&aacute;il reform programme agreed in response to the needs of the Houses and Members.  These include the establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office; the development of the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Advisers to include drafting and advisory services on Private Members' Bills; the increase in the number of parliamentary committees from 15 to 28, including eight specialist committees to date during this D&aacute;il term; the extension of services by the Library and Research Service, Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in, the Debates Office and House services; the establishment of the Business Committee, which members will know has become an important support for the running of the Houses; and some incidental and ancillary costs arising from sitting hours, security arrangements, etc.</p> <p>  One of the key areas that we focused on in 2018 was our ICT investment programme.  The service made a significant financial investment in new technology and systems in 2018 under its digital transformation programme.  This key strategic decision for the service was taken by the commission in 2016.  We have invested in our key business processes, systems and in-house ICT expertise, and have mapped more than 1,000 business processes.</p><p>We are now developing a parliamentary procedural system and this is being delivered on a phased basis.</p><p> Some other notable outputs from our digital transformation programme include: the upgrading of the Wi-Fi system across Oireachtas buildings; a new website to facilitate greater public engagement; and the roll-out of Microsoft Outlook to replace Lotus Notes, which was the email system for many years in the Oireachtas.  We have also upgraded the Chambers and committee rooms, adding in simultaneous translation to allow us to host meetings conducted in Irish in any of the four committee rooms.  The commission will continue with its investment in digital technology in the coming years to advance the modernisation of the processes and systems.</p><p> Another major feature of the spend in 2018 was the Leinster House restoration project, which is coming to an end.  This involved essential restoration and structural works to Leinster House and was managed by the Office of Public Works, OPW, on behalf of the commission.  I am pleased to be able to report that the sittings of the Houses and their committees continued uninterrupted during this work.  The work will be completed in time for the return of the Houses after the summer recess.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-11a.156" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Finnegan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019071100002#M00300"><p>Absolutely, and I will provide an update on that point.  The OPW briefed the commission on Tuesday and the handover of the building takes place on 2 August.  All is on track.</p> <p>  Another notable feature of the spend in 2018 was expenditure on legal proceedings.  During 2018, the O'Brien and Kerins Supreme Court cases were managed by the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers.  The judgments were delivered in 2019.  Liabilities arising from the Kerins case remain to be quantified and should fall due for payment during the current three-year funding allocation period 2019 to 2021.</p> <p>  A major feature of our work during the past three years has been our public engagement programme.  When the Ceann Comhairle took up his position he spoke about a Parliament of the people.  We have pursued that during the past three years.  Part of this involves the V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 commemorations during 2018, which provided the opportunity to increase public understanding and improve perception of the Oireachtas, especially the role of women in our national Parliament.  The programme of events reflected positively on both the Oireachtas and on the service and provided an appropriate platform for the D&aacute;il 100 programme, which is ongoing.  In addition, our public engagement programme included a significant parliamentary education programme which is delivered by our education officer, Conor Reale.  This has been strengthened significantly following Conor's arrival in the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  In 2018 we published a new policy on dignity and respect.  The parliamentary community, which comprises Members, their staff, civil servants and service providers, have signed up to the dignity and respect statement of principles and policies which developed over the course of the past year.</p> <p>  I will turn briefly to corporate governance.  The main policies and procedures for corporate governance of the service are outlined in the governance framework.  This includes the assurance framework that sets out the key sources of assurance, internal and external, underpinning the governance arrangements and activities of the service.  A review of the management committee was completed in 2018.  A new structure of management board and strategic committees evolved that focuses on providing strategic direction to oversee and account for the performance of the service through collective leadership.  The board reviewed the risk and corporate governance controls of the service.  We are now in the process of further professionalising our governance functions to include a chief risk officer, chief financial officer and a qualified internal auditor.  Our new chief financial officer is due to start at the beginning of September.  The commission's audit committee advises me on financial matters relating to my functions and advises the commission on matters of corporate governance relating to its functions.  The reports are published in the commission's annual reports.</p> <p>  For the next three years up to 2021, the budget allocated for running the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is &euro;422.3 million.  The commission adopted its strategic plan last Tuesday and has identified four key strategic goals.  These are: the development of an effective Parliament; an open and engaged Parliament; a digital Parliament; and a well-supported parliamentary community.</p> <p>  I wish to acknowledge the support and assistance provided by the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach and members of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  My colleagues and I in the Houses of the Oireachtas Service take immense pride in serving our national Parliament and its members.  We look forward to contributing to its development during the period 2019 to 2021.  I am now happy to take any questions members of the committee may have.</p></speech>

That is probably not a surprise but I wish to compliment the officials on the centenary celebrations of the Oireachtas because they have been exceptionally well performed or pulled off or whatever one calls it.  In particular, the D&aacute;il 100 events were well managed and some of the finances for this were expended in 2018.  There have been some well-put-together programmes, especially in respect of public engagement.  As this is the only opportunity I will most likely get to note that, I think it appropriate to do so.</p> <p>  I will turn to a somewhat less important matter but it is probably as important for the persons who use the bar in this establishment.  There has to be some pun thrown into the debate this morning about rats.  There was mention of a certain dish being on the menu today.  I will put it out there.  It would be interesting if the canteen put on ratatouille.  Equally, with a slight element of seriousness, I appreciate the building is old and various works have been undertaken.  It is a concern to all those individuals who are on the payroll, including this one, in respect of expenditure on pest control and so on.  I have a genuine concern about it and I imagine the officials share this because of the proximity of all the services provided by the catering unit and bar and so on.  It is not a question but a badly-performed pun on my part.</p> <p>  I will comment on the information and communications technology side of things because it is probably the only really point in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that is worth discussing.  I note that the commission has come in under budget.  The commission is consistent in that regard.  I understand the commission was significantly under-budget in the previous year - the figure was &euro;13 million.  This year the figure is &euro;1 million.  I am citing the figures from memory - I read the material yesterday.  One thing that jumped out at me was the provision for certain expenditure programmes compared with the actual expenditure.  There was a significant disparity.  The figure that jumped out was for ICT.  There was provision for &euro;14.6 million but the commission spent &euro;22.7 million.  I appreciate a great deal of work has been done.  My office was reissued with new laptops for the first time since I was elected in 2011 and I thank the commission for that.  There was expenditure on software licences and so on.  Can Mr. Finnegan be specific about where the overrun came to pass?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-11a.159" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Finnegan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019071100002#M00600"><p>Before I answer that question, I thank the Deputy for his kind words on the commemoration.  I will pass that onto the team.  It was truly a team effort.  It was a great privilege to be involved and to be in Leinster House at the time of the centenary of the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  The ICT expenditure has exceeded the budget but this was due to a conscious decision taken by us in the first quarter of 2018.  We track our expenditure carefully.  We have monthly management meetings and it became apparent to us that we were going to have a significant underspend in 2018, which was the last year of our financial cycle.  Under the funding regulations that apply under the Act, we cannot carry forward the allocation to subsequent years.  We took the view that the most appropriate thing to do was to invest &euro;8 million further in services and essentially bring forward expenditure that we had planned for later years.  That is why we did that.</p><p>We consider the ICT programme to be very important.  The background is that there was significant underinvestment in ICT in the Houses, probably for 15 years.  Statistics indicate that one should spend in the region of 10% of one&rsquo;s annual budget on ICT, but we hovered around 6% or 7% and that dropped during the downturn.  Our systems were quite old and outdated and we needed to significantly upgrade them.  One of the things of which we are conscious in terms of ICT expenditure is our ability to support Members.  We have a new generation of Members within Leinster House, with 70% having spent fewer than ten years here.  All of our Members use modern ICT in their work and we need to be able to support that, particularly things such as mobile devices.</p><p> The second big issue relates to what we discussed earlier, namely, public engagement.  ICT is a key strategy in our engagement with the public because it allows us to reach out and it allows the public to reach in.  It is about having a Parliament that is accessible to the people.  That has been a strong objective for us over the past year.  Understandably, there has been criticism of the Oireachtas from time to time, but our view is that unless people experience it and see the work being done by Members, such as at committees, it will be impossible to change that perception.  People who come to Leinster House are invariably impressed.  The type of ICT investment we are making will allow people to do things they do anyway on their phones.  If one is going home on the bus in the evening, one will check the news and weather and one might look up real-time passenger information for the next bus.  One can also look at what is going on in the Oireachtas, including the committees.  It is very important to be able to showcase the work that is going on in the Oireachtas and allow people to form an independent view of it.</p></speech>

I cannot remember for how long Lotus Notes was used in the House of the Oireachtas.  It was a very clunky system.</p></speech>

On some mornings, it took an hour before the computer started up and one could get into it.  The upgrade was desperately needed.</p> <p>  On personnel and payroll, I wish to specifically address overpayments.  It is a problem across all Departments and I am sure it is commonplace elsewhere also.  There are payment plans in place for a number of overpayments to personnel, with the exception of in six cases.  Has progress been made in that regard since the end of the 2018 financial year?  A sum of &euro;12,122 was carried forward on 1 January 2018 in regard to six overpayments for which recovery arrangements were not in place.  It is a very small sum, but the principle is important.  I ask Mr. Finnegan to enlighten me.  If he does not know the answer, he can revert to the issue.</p></speech>

I would have thought that overtime would be fairly consistent in respect of those employment categories.  By looking back at previous years, one could probably extrapolate the sort of expenditure to expect in any given year.  A cumulative sum of &euro;1.5 million or &euro;1.6 million is significant.  The report states that the estimate relates to pay increments and overtime.  Obviously, the staff are on a scale and, as such, I would have thought it would be fairly easy to predict the increases.  Why was that prediction not accurately made?</p></speech>

During the downturn, the overtime for secretarial assistants was reduced.  Many of them qualify for a payment based on six hours overtime per week.</p></speech>

Approximately two thirds of secretarial assistants work at least eight hours overtime per week, which is a significant amount.  They are a hard-working group of people and it is the nature of the job that they are required to be flexible and so on.</p></speech>

I will move to a slightly more concerning matter related to something referenced in the 2017 accounts.  An allegation of fraud was made in respect of salary increments over a period of 18 months.  It was to be classified whether it was a matter for the Garda to pursue.  Is there any update on the matter?  I assume that Mr. Finnegan put in place a more robust arrangement to ensure that increments are carefully reviewed.</p></speech>

Following the emergence of that issue, we carried out a detailed examination and now have six or seven additional controls in place which apply to that system of incremental credit.  They were agreed with the relevant associations and I am satisfied that we have the appropriate controls in place to avoid a reoccurrence of that issue.</p></speech>

On expenditure, unusually, there is a nil expenditure for the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association.  Only &euro;51,000 was set aside for it, but nothing was spent.  Is that due to the fact that the Stormont Assembly is not operating?</p></speech>

One of the great tragedies of the fact that the Assembly is suspended is that that association, which had very much begun to find its feet, is not currently functioning.  The Ceann Comhairle is very anxious to keep North-South links alive and has taken several initiatives.  He regularly contacts the Speaker of the Stormont Assembly, Mr. Robin Newton, and hosted a talk in the Members' restaurant in May on Edward Carson to reciprocate a talk which took place in the Assembly in January to commemorate the First D&aacute;il.  We hope that the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association will be back up and running once Stormont is.</p></speech>

I am the head of the delegation for the OSCE, for instance.  I am also involved in the parliamentary friendship group.  I compliment the Ceann Comhairle and Mr. Finnegan on the supports that have been provided because we cannot sit in these offices and learn about the world.  Sometimes we must physically be there.  The group is very beneficial and many Members engage in the process.  The supports that are provided are appreciated.</p> <p>  On the obvious impacts that Kerins and O'Brien cases will have, my only question relates to provision for future expected liability that will befall the commission and, from an accounting perspective, whether it is being ensured there is adequate provision for that in future budgets or the budget for this year, next year or whenever it might be.  Is it possible for the Oireachtas to quantify that as of yet?  I know it has been mentioned in the accounts that it is not.</p></speech>

We did a review of that recently - our managed IT service.  That review demonstrated that there was value for money.  It brought forward recommendations in terms of how we might approach the service next time around.  I feel, overall, that it is a good service.  The feedback from Members on the technical support - it is Fujitsu Siemens that is the company concerned - is very positive.  It provides a good service nationwide to Members.</p></speech>

I cannot fault it, to be quite frank.  In terms of the upgrade of Leinster House and all of the work that has been done over the past year or so, which I know is being managed by the Office of Public Works, did the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission or OPW incur the cost for the movement of the Seanad Chamber to the National Museum?</p></speech>

One of the big costs that was incurred in that related to the arrangement that was made between the Houses of the Oireachtas and the National Museum.  In return for facilitating the Seanad, we agreed to provide funding towards the provision of a lift within the National Museum.  We transferred that amount - it was &euro;500,000 - at the end of last year, and that will be used now in terms of the capital programme for the museum.</p></speech>

I compliment the Houses of the Oireachtas on the work that it has done in the establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO, and the legal services that have been provided.  It is important to note that.  There was a time in 2011 when I started drafting a Bill.  It was only through the assistance from the Library and Research Service, which I believe was beyond the normal scope, that I was able to put a Bill together.  That was very strange.  I was brand new to the building and I thought it was very odd that there was no direct support.  I had to go to the Law Library to get additional assistance.  The situation is different now, which should be noted.  I compliment Mr. Finnegan on it, particularly the Parliamentary Budget Office and the periodic reports it issues, because they are very helpful.  Again, without the normal opportunity to raise these things, I use this opportunity to do so.  As Mr. Finnegan has been given a clear audit and nothing of major significance jumped out at me from the pages, I am very pleased with the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and thank Mr. Finnegan for appearing this morning.</p></speech>

In terms of the programme itself, the programme came in at &euro;11.36 million.  Software maintenance, which would include things like Microsoft licences, came in at roughly &euro;2.6 million.  Our managed serviced support with Fujitsu was &euro;1.37 million.  On printing equipment, we replaced our printer and the print unit came in at approximately &euro;1.3 million.  Hardware was approximately &euro;864,000.  Our sound contract came in at &euro;678,000.  That would be the sound contract in the D&aacute;il, Seanad and four committee rooms.  Our network expansion, which would be our Wi-Fi and so forth, came in at &euro;618,000.  The final items within that overall figure of &euro;22.7 million would be things like consumables and stationery for the Oireachtas, the cost of our website, servers and backup units, our managed print service, office equipment, and some kinds of minor miscellaneous costs.</p></speech>

I do not have a quarrel with a decision being made to upgrade the systems.  Where it needs to be done from an ICT perspective, it should be.  I am looking at the outturn for the headings and most of them are either under budget or on budget, so this heading is one that jumps out and where there is a significant overspend.  If we could have a detailed note of the exact breakdown and what exactly the money was spent on, that would be useful for us.</p></speech>

We all look forward to that being completed and opened.  If there is a grand opening, we will all be there.  I just want to look at the costs.  While I do not believe everything I read in the newspapers, no more than anyone else, the initial reports on the  project in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>of May 2017 were that it would cost &euro;8 million.  The article stated:</p><blockquote>While the final cost of the work has yet to be determined, the OPW said last December that it would be at least &euro;8 million.</blockquote> <p>At what point were the initial costs worked out?  Was that figure accurate and was the OPW accurate in saying it would be at least &euro;8 million?  Was that an estimate or what was that based on?</p></speech>

The costs on the refurbishment project - the total project spend, including construction fees, design team fees, VAT and various bonds, etc. - come in at &euro;14.87 million.  That is the key figure.</p></speech>

We will get to that in a moment.  I am going back first and we will work towards what the actual cost was.  Back at that point, a number of newspaper articles were talking about a cost of &euro;8 million.  Mr. Finnegan says there was a very rough estimate by the OPW of &euro;8 million.  It would be better if we did not have rough estimates because once figures are put out like that, if it costs more, we are into the cost overspend territory.</p></speech>

It is under negotiation between the OPW and the builder but it is in the public domain at the moment that the final project cost will come in at roughly 15% above the figure of &euro;14.78 million.  That is attributable to the fact that some of the items that resulted in additional cost could not have been foreseen when the tender documents were being done.

I will not name the individual because I do not think he is in the role he was in.  It was the Superintendent of the Houses of the Oireachtas and he was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i>when it was asking about the costs.  He said &quot;As Michelangelo said to the pope, 'It will cost what it will cost'.&quot;  That is not really an appropriate response when somebody is asking genuine questions about how much a project will cost.  I put it in the context of all the other cost overruns, which are outside of Mr. Finnegan's control, involving State money.  People take these issues seriously so when a question is asked and the response is &quot;As Michelangelo said to the pope, 'It will cost what it will cost',&quot; that is a very flippant response and almost sounds like saying &quot;Whatever it is, it is.&quot;  However we are talking here about our money - taxpayers' money.  Did Mr. Finnegan see that quote in the first instance?</p></speech>

We have been particularly conscious of cost control on this project.  We have our own internal team that works on it.  That team meets every month.  The commission is getting progress reports from the OPW and the management of public money on the project has been a key priority for us.  Of all institutions, the Houses of the Oireachtas must ensure that public money is spent appropriately and that there is proper management of resources.</p></speech>

My first question in that territory is on the funding for political parties.  It is something that is largely misunderstood.  There is an obvious logic to it as it reduces the dependency on corporate donations, which we have very strict controls on, thankfully, in the State.  I am personally in favour of State funding for political parties, groupings and Independents.  How does it work?  As we do during the so-called silly season, we will have any number of articles on expenses for politicians and how much political parties and Independents cost the State.  That is all grand as we all have to be held to account.  Sometimes, however, the facts underpinning it are not always put out there.  How does it work?  How are political parties funded and what was the total cost for each grouping in 2018?</p></speech>

I refer to page 4 of Mr. Finnegan's opening statement.  He referenced the Kerins Supreme Court case, which involved this particular committee, and the ramifications of it.  Additionally, Mr. Finnegan wrote to all the members last night setting out his thoughts in respect of the establishment of a working group that would examine this particular Supreme Court case and the need for Oireachtas committees to have clear terms of reference and to remain within them.  One of the points he made in his letter to us was about the conduct of meetings, the conduct of hearings by the committee as a whole and the supervision of such hearings by the Chair.  In terms of the implementation or scope of these changes, who will be policing who?  My fear would be about the ethos of the group and how far it would be prepared to go in terms of the implementation of changes.</p> <p>  In recent committee hearings we saw the Irish Greyhound Board, which is in receipt of huge amounts of public money, and the need for proper scrutiny of the expenditure of that public money.  We have seen, in recent committee hearings, witnesses from the Football Association of Ireland stonewalling in respect of questions and citing legal cases in that particular week as a defence.  In the end, it lost its State funding but the fear is that this working group would go so far in trying to rein in committees that we would not have that proper scrutiny of public expenditure.  In the context of the letter he sent us last night, I ask Mr. Finnegan for his views on the ethos of this working group and how far it is prepared to go.</p></speech>

They were remit, clarity around invitations, the conduct of meetings and remedies.  Following the issuing of the Supreme Court judgment, the Committee on Procedure of the D&aacute;il met and established a working group which reports to it.  That working group is chaired by Elaine Gunn, who is on my left.</p> <p>  The purpose of the working group is to consult with all relevant parties within and outside the Oireachtas.  The group has written to all the party leaders.  My letter last night was to alert individual members to the work of the group.  A key part of the group's work will be to undertake a broadly based consultation of all the stakeholders involved.  Having done that, it will take the views of people within the Oireachtas and people who come before Oireachtas committees.  It will do its analysis.  It will take its advice and report to the Committee on Procedure of the D&aacute;il.  The Seanad Committee on Procedure and Privileges will also be involved in the process.  Any decisions in respect of the matters concerned are a matter for the committees on procedures of both Houses.</p> <p>  Across the Oireachtas, people are acutely aware of the need to find the correct balance.  People have spoken about the issue of a chilling effect on Oireachtas committees.  That is not what this is about.  This is about addressing issues that have been highlighted to us by the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court has essentially said to the Oireachtas that it has a wide margin of appreciation in how it conducts its affairs but it must safeguard the constitutional rights of third parties.  That is what this is about.  It is finding that balance, working with people who sit on committees and with people who come into committees and bringing forward recommendations.</p></speech>

These are major constitutional cases that required very senior legal teams.  To explain the representation for the Oireachtas in the courts, on the Angela Kerins case we had two senior counsel, namely, Paul Gallagher and Brian Kennedy.  Paul Gallagher is a former Attorney General.  We had two junior counsel.  We did all the in-house solicitors' work ourselves in the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, so there was a considerable saving on that.  We also had two senior counsel in the Denis O'Brien case.  That is in recognition of the important constitutional dimension to both of those cases.  Where we are involved in normal litigation cases, the costs would be nothing like that but such were the issues at stake we had to ensure that the position of the Oireachtas was well argued by some of the top legal brains in the country.</p></speech>

Having been in Leinster House for the duration of the work, having walked the site on many occasions, having been up on the roof and in the basement, and having seen every part of the building, I know that an enormous amount of work was involved in the project.  It is detailed work.  At any given time, 80 construction workers were on site - everybody from electricians to stonemasons.  It is good value for money.  The building was constructed in 1745 and we are coming up to its 275th anniversary next year.  The sum of &euro;17 million has been the only major capital expenditure on the building and its restoration.  If that is averaged out over 275 years, it is outstanding value for money.  One nice aspect of the project is that there will be a building for the people at the end of the project.  We want people to come in and see the building because the work is to a very high standard.  Ultimately, we say it is the people's Parliament and it is their building.</p></speech>

There are some consultancy services for information and computer technology, while there are procurement services for facilities.  There was some spend on communications around the time of the D&aacute;il 100 and V&oacute;t&aacute;il 100 programmes as well as some spend on the library, human resources and internal audit.</p></speech>

What is the full yearly cost of the operation of Oireachtas TV?</p></speech>

That is over and above the normal day-to-day spend.  In the broadcasting area, 75% or 80% of the spend would probably arise in any event because we televise the in-House proceedings.  On any given day, six studios cover the two Houses and four committee rooms, and the feed is fed to all the major broadcasters.  Somewhere in the region of 35 people work on it.  The issue with Oireachtas TV is that the content is there in any event and the additional expenditure arises from some of the transmission costs we incur.  There is also a small element for programme-making.</p></speech>

I refer to regional newspapers and local radio stations.  Proceedings in the Chambers were broadcast every week on local radio in order that, as Mr. Finnegan noted earlier, there could be public engagement and the Parliament could be accessible.</p></speech>

The Ceann Comhairle met people who availed of and benefited from the service time ago and listened carefully to the points they made, which were valid.  It was subsequently brought to the commission, which decided to go in a different direction for local media.  The issue with the local media service was that it worked for a category of Members.  Our estimates are that 27% of Members were covered by the previous contracts.  On the local media platforms, only four of 19 local radio stations were covered.  We now seek to design a service that has much broader coverage for Members generally, where there is more equal access to the service.  We are also trying to get nationwide service on the local radios and so on that pick up the service.</p></speech>

Local radio and newspapers are an important part of democracy in allowing people access to what happens here.  Rather than allowing the contract to end, the provision should have been rolled out to the full 19 local radio stations and the local newspapers.  On behalf of Members and for local media, I reiterate to Mr. Finnegan that it should be pursued.  Local media is under significant pressure in an age when social media, which is not subject to proper kinds of press regulatory mechanisms, effectively skews the news.  The Houses need local media engagement and I ask that Mr. Finnegan seek to provide it.</p></speech>

To reassure him in respect of the local media element of the new strategy, there is a considerable local media element and it will involve engaging with local media organisations every quarter and bringing them to Leinster House at our cost.  We will facilitate meetings with Members and allow radio stations that wish to broadcast from Leinster House to do so.  We will provide them with training on the web in order that they can access much of our material, given that so much of it is now online.</p></speech>

I accept that Mr. Finnegan will not have had a chance to read it, nor have I.  Nevertheless, the headline figures are extraordinary.  Of 21,000 members of staff, 3% have a competency in Irish.  I do not know whether Mr. Finnegan had a chance to hear that but they are the headline figures.  Some 550 of 21,000 have a competency in Irish.  I, too, have yet to read the report but the figure is 3% or less.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will know, we have tried to promote the use of Irish around the Houses and we adopted an Irish language strategy a year ago, which we have been implementing.  On our own organisation, bilingual staff in Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in provide a translation service, bilingual staff work in the Debates Office, and Irish language skills are required in individual areas such as the committees-----</p></speech>

Most of the 550 people are in the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht or other areas specifically associated with Irish.  The question is unfair, in a sense, given that the report has just been published but it would be remiss of me not to mention it.  Is the figure of 3% not a huge problem?</p></speech>

If people are not taking up the classes, we need to look at that.  There is an inverse relationship between the amount of empathy and sympathy for and delight in the Irish language and the rate of its decline.  We have a serious challenge but I will park the issue for the moment.  On the rats, I take comfort from the fact that they have not deserted us.  The ship is not sinking yet.  It looks like we might be back and there is no election looming.</p> <p>  On the accounts, I will address the fraud issue first.

As the Deputy rightly points out, there have been messages out there about this chilling effect on parliamentary committees, which is absolutely incorrect.  The court is at pains throughout the decisions in both the Supreme Court judgments in Kerins in this regard.</p><p>As the Secretary General said, the court is asking Parliament to set up a system that will rebalance the rights of non-Members when they appear in front of committees.  It is stating that if we put procedures in place to provide an avenue of redress for people who believe they have been unfairly treated in front of committees and that if such a system includes remedies that will come into play when a Member or a committee acts unlawfully, the rights that need to be given to non-Members will have been rebalanced.  It is stating that when such a system is in place, the Judiciary and the courts will give Parliament a very wide margin of appreciation in how it runs its business.  It is far from a chilling effect.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, a number of errors occurred in that case in terms of remit, the letter of invitation and how the hearings were actually run.  When the working group has finished its consultations and reported back to the Committee on Procedure, a system will be put in place.  We hope Standing Orders will be amended to allow for a redress system.  In such circumstances, things should operate much more smoothly in the future.</p></speech>

It might be helpful to do this on a more regular basis.  I thank the witnesses for setting out the functions of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.  The efforts to make Parliament more accessible are very welcome.  I would like to know more about the key performance indicators, to use the jargon we have learned from the Comptroller and Auditor General, that will be used as efforts are made to make Parliament more effective.  Money messages come to mind, but we will leave that matter for another day.  However, I welcome the efforts being made to make Parliament more effective and open.  Oireachtas TV has been an eye-opener for me.  Many people watch it.  We are empowering people and it is money well spent.  Those who watch Oireachtas TV can see for themselves what is going on in their Parliament without having to rely on social media.  It is important for them to be able to learn directly.</p> <p>  Before I refer to specific legal cases, I thank the staff on the ground.  If the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is to learn anything, it must listen to the staff on the ground.  When I leave here, my abiding memory will be of the ushers.  Any visitor I have ever brought to the Oireachtas has spoken about them and the staff in the restaurants.  They sell the D&aacute;il to the people and us.  In addition to officials like Mr. Finnegan, they made us comfortable from day one.  If Oireachtas officials are to avoid misunderstandings and cases in the future, they should listen to people from the bottom up.  There should be a mechanism for reporting issues that are arising and the things happening on the ground.  That would help to improve matters.</p> <p>  I would like to ask about the extraordinary amounts paid out in compensation and on legal cases.  I am referring to note 6 on page 25 of the briefing documentation.  Will Mr. Finnegan explain why there were legal costs of &euro;547,000 for six claims by employees and three by members of the public and that no legal fees were awarded?  I am looking for clarification in that regard.</p></speech>

We discovered late last night that the cost of &euro;62,000 for claims made by employees, as set out on the page in question, included a cost that should have been included in a figure further down the page.  The cost in question arose in a case in Rann&oacute;g an Aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;in that involved the non-translation of Acts.  The correct figure for legal costs for claims made by employees is approximately &euro;10,000.  I apologise for the discrepancy.</p></speech>

The overall figure is correct, but the breakdown is incorrect because approximately &euro;50,000 was included in the figure at the top when it should have been included in the figure at the bottom.  Claims made by employees are typically human resources-related that arise when people exercise their rights under relevant circulars.  Sometimes cases end up in the Workplace Relations Commission, which means that costs have to be met for the representation of the Houses of the Oireachtas Service.</p></speech>

I refer to the &Oacute; Murch&uacute; case, which was settled around Christmas time.  As part of the settlement, we committed to eliminating arrears over a five-year period and ensuring that all Acts are translated effectively on a current basis.  We recognise that it would take us time to put in place the resources to do this and we have been doing that in recent months.  It is not easy because there are a lot of very attractive options available to translators out there.  I refer to jobs in Europe, etc.  The other issue we are contending with is that for legislative translation we require an exceptionally high standard of Irish.  We are undertaking recruitment.  As part of that process we are looking at options if we cannot get people recruited through the normal means, so we will look at issues-----</p></speech>

It is a significant body of work.  They are all translated but they are not edited and finalised for publication.  The recruitment is aimed at trying to go current.  The objective is to treat 2019 as year one and to go current, so the publications should start hitting the shelves from next year.  However, we have to get the staff numbers up to a critical mass.  At this point we have 18 staff out of a target of 39, so we have a way to go.</p></speech>

Many of the areas have been covered.  As a member of the commission, I know that we are briefed continually on the building works in Leinster House.  Not only that but visits of the House are available and there are photographic updates and so on.  What surprised me were the risk of collapse and the risk of fire that were discovered.</p><p>That was discovered and it was inevitable that work had to be done.  At least, it is not being done because of a catastrophic event.  We must get value for money.  The project comes within the remit of the Office of Public Works.  It jumps out at me how impossible it is to estimate accurately the cost or produce a tender because the contingency is limited to a certain figure.</p></speech>

It is important to learn from this, not on the side of the Houses of the Oireachtas Service but rather in terms of how the OPW has a profile of appearing to underestimate figures when it is almost impossible to be right in a scenario involving an historical building.  It is an important point and an amendment should be made in that regard.</p></speech>

It is a standard contract and, as the Deputy correctly notes, the OPW has had to work with a contingency figure of 10%.  The reality is that for a project such as Georgian Leinster House which has seen major restoration, the contingency figure could be up to 40%.  It is very important to have realistic contingency figures built into the contract as otherwise they can be very misleading.  I take the opportunity to acknowledge what I regard as the absolutely outstanding work of the OPW.  We have had a superb team of architects, led by Mr. Ciaran O'Connor, the State architect.  It has been a labour of love for them and I have seen the level of commitment and hours invested in the project by the team.  Sometimes the public sector is criticised correctly on projects, but this is an example of a project that has gone well and been well managed.  It will leave a lasting legacy for generations of Irish people who will come to Leinster House.</p> <p>  On a personal level, I am really looking forward to the building being opened in order that people can come to Leinster House to see the outstanding work that has been done.  We will have tours at weekends in the autumn once Leinster House is reopened as I anticipate a very high level of interest in coming to see the refurbished building.</p></speech>

It is hosted, first and foremost, on Saorview, which is a free service.  That is important as many people have it as a second service within their household.  We also have it on Sky.  The signals are transmitted to the satellite and down again.  It is on what is now called Virgin Media and also available on the web.

It is due to a number of factors, but I would like to think part of the reason is what we are doing in opening the Oireachtas to the people in order that they can see for themselves what is going on.  A very strong objective is people should be able to access the Oireachtas on whatever platform they choose.  Younger people will use their mobile devices and look at proceedings on their way home on the bus or in the evening, but older people are in the demographic who predominantly watch television.  We are trying to create an offering for all segments of the population in order that they can see the work being done in Leinster House.</p></speech>

Witnesses get invitations.  The Secretary General will know that over the decades no member or Chairman of a committee has ever seen the invitations that went out to the witnesses.  We have never had sight of that.  That needs to be addressed among other things in terms of the content.  There clearly was a failure, which I am acknowledging.  I accept the Supreme Court ruling that the issue of the invitations needs to be dealt with.  The Supreme Court felt it was a sufficiently significant issue to deal with.  Every committee Chairman in this D&aacute;il and previous D&aacute;ileanna must have felt, "What are we talking about?  We never saw an invitation."  Clearly that issue needs to be dealt with, not only making sure members are familiar with what is in the invitation but also that it is clear in what it says.

In the Oireachtas we have all been collectively remiss in not having any programme for training Chairpersons.  The Supreme Court felt it was such an important issue that it specifically highlighted it.  It is good.  We will do it now.  Having heard from the Supreme Court it is blatantly obvious we should have done something about Chairpersons getting some training.  I am sure that if somebody within the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Service is promoted to a role he or she never held before, there must be some element of training of what the new role is about.  We accept that that is long overdue and very necessary.</p> <p>  Is it correct that there were no remedies in place where there was a problem for a particular witness?</p></speech>

Given that the Oireachtas has been told to deal with these four issues, we could take a very restrictive view and deal with the four specific issues or use the opportunity of the Supreme Court ruling to see if there is anything else we need to do.  Rather than taking a very restrictive reactive approach to the Supreme Court decision, perhaps we could take a more proactive approach in terms of issues that need to be dealt with because we do not want to deal with these four and find in eight years' time another four are mentioned that we should have picked up on at this stage.  I am saying we should learn not just the specifics but the broader lessons.</p></speech>

This project started at whatever it started with and now it is whatever it is.  OPW officials have appeared before this committee and there is a special report by the Comptroller and Auditor General on moving the Department of Health from Hawkins House to Miesian Plaza.  We found the procedures were not as good as we would have expected.  I can understand some people saying that the OPW is very competent, but the Committee of Public Accounts has not always found that to be the case.  I would not be able to share Mr. Errity's 100% confidence.  That is not a reflection on him; it is a comment about the OPW in respect of what we find when its officials appear before this committee.  Just because it is the OPW it does not mean it is right in everything it does.</p> <p>  Leinster House is exempt from the normal planning process, which is fine.  Would the same apply to a fire certificate?  In the same way that all public buildings need a fire certificate from the local authority, would each of the buildings in this complex have a fire certificate?</p></speech>

It has a parallel process to, what one might call, the private sector fire certificate.</p></speech>

We are back to the same moot point.  I am not saying there is a problem, but I am pointing out the difference in approach.</p> <p>  What is the energy rating of the building that we have just spent &euro;17 million on refurbishing?</p></speech>

As recently as Tuesday, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission agreed to a biodiversity plan for Merrion Lawn which is going to be implemented over the coming months.  We are acutely aware of the need to make progress in this area.  We are in discussions with the OPW about installing electric charging points for cars.

A key focus of the energy-management activities of the Oireachtas has been the participation in optimising power at work.  There is an energy-awareness campaign in place in 300 buildings owned or leased by the OPW.  It aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by reducing energy consumption in the public sector.  </p></speech>

I will ask Mr. Finnegan to send on a note in regard to the energy rating of the building that is being fully refurbished and the form of fuel used to heat or cool it, as the case may be.  There is a lot of hot air.  We could generate quite a bit of that sometimes but it has to be cooled as well.  Consider all the talk about climate change, bearing in mind that we have had a climate change committee and are setting up a new climate change committee.  Representatives of the Department responsible for climate change were here and we asked them what changes were made in their head office.  The answer is a bit like Mr. Finnegan's.  There was not an answer.  I am just saying that, somewhere in the public service, we have to begin to practise what we are preaching.  That is all I will say about saying that.</p> <p>  With regard to the security of the building, last year and whenever, there was one or two occasions when Members could not get out through the front gate.  Any national parliament should be able to have guaranteed access.  It has not happened on every occasion.  Sometimes the protesters were allowed up to the gate.  Maybe the numbers were higher than expected or maybe there were not enough personnel on duty outside.  I presume that is on the risk register.</p></speech>

What training has been offered to the staff in order to upgrade them?  Was it in-house?  How was that done?</p></speech>

I will have to send on the note on it to the Chairman.</p></speech>

We do not need it now.  When I saw the 2,000 figure, it just did not gel with me.  The big issue I want to raise over training &ndash; I am making a practical suggestion that I do not believe would cost much at all &ndash; concerns staff.  There are two categories of staff: the Civil Service staff, which Mr. Finnegan looks after, and the Members' staff.  The latter are not civil servants and can kind of toddle along as they like.  The group I am most concerned about comprises the Members' staff who operate in constituency offices.  They have zero personal contact with Leinster House, other than when they ring extension 4444, if they want to avail of an IT service.  An assistant goes down, wires up what is required and then leaves.  I suggest it would be a big help to the operation of the Oireachtas if a programme could be put in place, even for half a day per year, to visit the constituency offices to train the Members' staff there.  They have no access.  They will not come here from all over the country for a day's training twice per year.  All it would take is one of two of the people doing the training to create a programme.  As Oireachtas staff install the equipment, all it would take would be for someone to give a few hours' training a week later.</p></speech>

Staff will say a service was on the old system but not on the new one, for example.  What I suggest does not represent a big cost.  Staff are being sent around with the hardware and should also be sent around to give a bit of help with the software.  The constituency staff are Oireachtas staff and are making the whole system work.  They are the utterly poor relations when it comes to training.  I realise Mr. Finnegan will say emails go out offering training but I am more interested in the take-up of training.  The delegates might consider that.</p></speech>

I thank the Library and Research Service for giving me yesterday the research document I asked for a couple of weeks ago.  How many staff are involved in research by comparison with the Parliamentary Budget Office staff?  We regularly get very good updates from the Parliamentary Budget Office.  The committees could do with some dedicated research resources across the board.  I feel the Parliamentary Budget Office and the committee it works with have a very high level of research staff available.  We see material emerging weekly or sometimes much more often whereas many of the committees could possibly do with a slice of that research facility.  Could Mr. Finnegan talk to me about that.</p></speech>

Its director is Ms Annette Connolly, who is at assistant secretary level.  It has one principal officer, Ms Denise O'Connell, who is just behind me.  There are five assistant principal officers, five administrative officers and one clerical officer.  The office provides a service for all of the Oireachtas.  It works with the budget oversight committee on budgetary matters but its publications are available to all the Members.  On committees, the overall number is about 81.</p></speech>
