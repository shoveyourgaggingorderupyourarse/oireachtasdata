Deputy Colm Burke may be a little late because he has business to attend to in the D&aacute;il.  I welcome you all to our first engagement of 2022.  Due to the current situation regarding Covid-19, only the clerk to the committee, the support staff and me are present in the committee room.  Members of the committee are attending remotely from within the precincts of Leinster House.  This due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Parliament.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee.</p> <p>  This morning, we engage with officials from Raidi&oacute; Teilif&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann, RT&Eacute;, to examine Exchequer funding of RT&Eacute;, which is now provided through Vote 33 - Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.  The following conditional matters are included in the letter of invitation and may be examined during the course of the engagement by members: RT&Eacute;'s 2020 annual report and group financial statement; RT&Eacute;'s financial sustainability and capacity performance role as the national public sector broadcaster; the television licence fee; the investigation undertaken by the Department of Social Protection in respect of contract staff; the sale of lands; the Willis Towers Watson organisation-wide role review, including remuneration of Irish-speaking workers; and any gender pay gaps at RT&Eacute;.  RT&Eacute;  has also been made aware that the committee might wish to follow up on matters relating to it that were raised with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media on 25 November 2021.  </p> <p>  We are joined remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House by the following officials from RT&Eacute;: Ms Dee Forbes, director general; Mr. Richard Collins, chief financial officer; and Ms Fiona O'Shea, group financial controller.  The following officials are also attending remotely from outside the precincts of Leinster House from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, which is a big Department: Ms Patricia Murphy, assistant secretary, corporate division; Ms Tr&iacute;ona Quill, assistant secretary, broadcasting and media division; and Mr. Stephen Ryan, principal officer. broadcasting policy.  They are all very welcome.  When we begin to engage I ask members and witnesses to mute themselves and they are not contributing, so that we do not pick up any background noise or feedback.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to make sure that their mobile phones are on silent or are switched off.</p> <p>  Before we start, I wish to explain the limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence that a witness who physically present, or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts, is protected pursuant to both Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  However, today's witnesses are giving their evidence remotely from a place outside of the parliamentary precincts.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Such witnesses have already been advised of this and they may have thought it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the provision within Standing Order 218 that a committee shall refrain from enquiring into the the merits of a policy or policies of Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  To assist our broadcast and debate services I ask that members direct their questions to a specific witness.  If the question is not being directed to a specific witness, I would ask that each witness statement name on the first opportunity that they contribute.</p> <p>  I now call on Mr. Seamus McCarthy for his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-20a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022012000002#A00600"><p>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  I have a couple of remarks on the Vote.  Gross voted expenditure on broadcasting in 2020 totalled &euro;271 million, which was up 4% on the gross expenditure incurred in 2019.  The largest element of the programme expenditure in 2020 was grant funding provided to RT&Eacute;, totalling &euro;197.6 million.  This was slightly up on the grant funding of &euro;196.5 million provided to RT&Eacute; in 2019.  Grant funding to Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge amounted to &euro;39.1 million in 2020.  That was an increase of 8% year-on-year.</p> <p>  The broadcasting fund, which is managed by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, is used mainly to grant, assist the development and production of programmes for radio and television.  The fund received &euro;21.8 million from the Vote in 2020, representing an increase of 47% on the 2019 contribution.  The notes to the appropriation account explain that the additional funding in that case was provided to support enhanced programming as a response to Covid-19.</p> <p>  A substantial part of the programme is funded by television licence fee receipts into the Vote.  In 2020, such receipts totalled just under &euro;223 million.  This was about the same as aggregate licence fee receipts in 2019.</p> <p>  Members may recall that, while I audit the financial statements of Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge and of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, I do not have responsibility for the audit of the financial statements of RT&Eacute;, which is classified as a commercial State body.  Consequently, it is not appropriate for me to comment on RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s financial statements.</p></speech>

As detailed in the letter of invitation, Ms Forbes will have five minutes.  We have received her opening statement.  I invite her to proceed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-20a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022012000002#A00800"><p>I thank the Chair.  I thank the committee for the invitation to speak with members today on a number of topics, many of which are important to the future of Ireland&rsquo;s national public service media.</p> <p>   First, with regard to RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s financial statements, 2020 was a transformational year in Irish life, and for Irish business.  It was a hugely challenging time for everyone and for every sector, but it was also a year in which RT&Eacute; demonstrated our purpose and our value as a public service for the people of Ireland.  Despite the logistical, financial, and human challenge of the early stages of the pandemic, Ireland&rsquo;s media, both local and national, played a critical and leading role in keeping people in Ireland informed, engaged, and safe.  Naturally, today I want to highlight the very particular contribution made by RT&Eacute; during this time.  Along with public service media all over Europe, RT&Eacute; informed and empowered the people of Ireland.  In research conducted at in the first six months of the pandemic, 90% of people indicated that they turned to RT&Eacute; for information, while a further 76% said that they placed their trust in RT&Eacute;.  This confidence and trust has been earned over many years, and in many ways and we never take it for granted.</p> <p>  Alongside comprehensive and in-depth news coverage, RT&Eacute; was and is a source of companionship, diversion and connection for millions.  People turned to story in all its forms; from documentaries, to drama, to comedy, to investigative journalism.  The nation joined together in helping RT&Eacute; to bring light to darker days, with events such as RT&Eacute; Shine a Light.  New original Irish drama, like the hugely acclaimed &ldquo;Normal People&rdquo;, got the nation talking, laughing and connecting more than ever.  With connection comes community.  RT&Eacute; rallied around Irish businesses, Irish artists, producers, front-line workers and those in need.  Together with the people of Ireland, we raised more than &euro;12 million in 2020 for Irish charities.  These achievements came against the backdrop of extreme and continued financial uncertainty.  RT&Eacute; is funded through a combination of public funding - the TV licence - and commercial income.  An immediate result of Covid-19 was a sharp drop in licence fee revenue, and a decline in advertising revenue.  Although income stabilised towards the end of that year, we witnessed the precariousness of the financial system underpinning public service broadcasting in Ireland.   </p> <p>  RT&Eacute; has highlighted for many years that the licence fee system on which Ireland&rsquo;s national public service media is a reliant, is utterly broken.</p><p>In 2019 RT&Eacute; committed to a range of cost-efficiency measures, and in 2020 we made good progress in achieving our agreed targets.  This strong focus on cost management is reflected in the surplus achieved in that year, aided by the exceptional circumstances of that year when expenditure on coverage of live events and sport, among other types of production, was suspended.</p><p> The core structural funding problems remain and, in fact, are deteriorating quickly.  Losses to national public service media funding are now estimated to be &euro;65 million annually.  RT&Eacute; cannot continue to deliver on its remit for the people of Ireland without adequate public funding.  We welcomed the formation of the Government-appointed Future of Media Commission in early 2021, and we await with interest the urgent publication of the recommendations of that commission.  As we await meaningful reform of public funding, RT&Eacute; has been focused on its own programme of reform.  This has included: the critical upgrading of studio and broadcasting infrastructure; the appointment of a diversity lead to help improve representation within our workforce and our output; a large-scale organisational restructure to help us achieve greater collaboration and synergies; and we are investing more in digital services and content.</p><p> To help ensure that RT&Eacute; evolves, we commissioned a number of different reviews of how we work.  The review of role and gender equality in 2017 offered an in-depth analysis of gender equity within RT&Eacute;'s workforce.  To begin with, RT&Eacute;'s staff body is almost evenly male-female, which in itself is notable when compared with the private or the semi-State sectors.  The review also found that RT&Eacute; is both a fair and equitable employer, with good terms and conditions of employment for its people.  The review found that RT&Eacute; equals, and in various cases exceeds, national policy objectives and targets for gender related employment.  The review found that the pay differential at RT&Eacute; is approximately 4%, which is significantly less than the 14% for the economy as a whole.  While these findings were encouraging, they leave no room for complacency, and gender balance within our overall workforce, within roles, and within our output, remains a high priority.  RT&Eacute;'s journey on gender pay and general employment continues and is supported by the Willis Towers Watson project, which is looking at an updated job and career framework for all staff.</p><p> RT&Eacute; is also focused on complying with reporting requirements on gender pay.  This will help us develop more plans to address any gaps.  A consistent, methodical, and universal approach is now captured by the requirements under the Gender Pay Gap Information Act 2021.  This is a welcome development on a national level, which will provide further transparency across all employment within the State.  Following on from this review, we proactively undertook a review of the organisation's use of contractors.  The resulting report found that the majority of those reviewed, that is, a list of 433 freelancers or contractors providing services across the organisation, were appropriately engaged as contractors.  It also found that some contractors appeared to have some attributes akin to employment, and highlighted 157 individuals as being in need of further review.  A total of 82 contracts of employment were issued, with 79 acceptances.</p><p> In accordance with the Eversheds review recommendations, we have also updated the relevant RT&Eacute; policies for engaging individuals, and implemented training and awareness for all managers within the organisation.  Arising from the review into the engagement of contractors, RT&Eacute; also engaged in dialogue and co-operation with the Revenue Commissioners, and a settlement amount to the value of &euro;1,223,252 has now been paid to Revenue in respect of identified liabilities.  Alongside this audit, RT&Eacute; has also been in dialogue and co-operation with the Department of Social Protection's scope division, and is one of 500 organisations in Ireland currently under review for potential PRSI classification liabilities.  This is a substantial and complex process, involving the investigation of the contractual and employment arrangements of approximately 500 individuals.  The precise duration of this investigation is unknown, but it is conservatively estimated to be active until at least 2023.</p><p> Arising from one of the recommendations of the original role and gender equality review, and as mentioned earlier, RT&Eacute; has engaged with an external partner to carry out a full evaluation of staff roles and grades in RT&Eacute;.  This will enable RT&Eacute; to control costs and make decisions on the best shape and size of the organisation so that we can successfully face the future.  This will involve a full evaluation of the role and grading structure across every area in RT&Eacute;.  The original research clarified that RT&Eacute;'s existing structure, which comprises 164 different grades, is overly complex and is no longer fit for purpose.  It is intended that this review will create greater levels of transparency, parity, and agility within the organisation.  All staff and services will be included within this review.  All of these measures will allow us to plan how RT&Eacute; will evolve as a Ireland's national public service media.  We and our staff have already embraced hybrid working, and the past year has resulted in a number of innovations in terms of our broadcast services.  In spite of its many challenges, Covid-19 has accelerated change across the working world, and it is essential that RT&Eacute; keeps pace.  By comparison with many of our international counterparts, RT&Eacute; offers a considerable range and quality of programmes and online services, on a very cost-efficient basis.  We have a highly dedicated, experienced and qualified workforce, we are a highly trusted organisation and we continue to play an essential role in Irish life.  Covid-19 has shown us the importance of public service media to the proper functioning of countries and democracies and to the nurturing of cultural vitality, unity and community.  Whether it be in moments of celebration or in times of crisis, it is RT&Eacute;'s privilege and unique responsibility to be the place to which people turn and the place that brings the nation together.</p><p> We urge all members of the committee to engage with the work of the commission, when its recommendations are published, and to consider those recommendations with urgency and shared purpose.  I extend apologies from our head of human resources, Eimear Cusack, who, unfortunately, is unavailable today due to personal circumstances.</p></speech>

The lead speaker today is Deputy Neasa Hourigan, who has 15 minutes, followed by Deputy Colm Burke, if he is out of the Chamber by then.  Everyone else will have ten minutes.

I am watching the clock.  I welcome everybody this morning.  I am pleased that we found time for this session.  I know we are going to talk a lot about the licence fee and the justification for it.  I am very proud of the fact that we have a publicly funded national broadcaster.  That is incredibly important.  We are all trying to reach a sustainable long-term approach for RT&Eacute;.  In other countries we have seen a state-supported free media as a target to be undermined and de-funded.  The only people that suits is populists, conspiracy theorists and the far right.  Any questions I ask in the next few minutes are to be viewed within that context.</p> <p>  Could I take it from Ms Forbes's statement today that RT&Eacute; will not be publishing information on the gender pay gap in the foreseeable future until the Bill is passed by the Government.  The reason I ask is that the National Union of Journalists asked for that information in February 2021 and RT&Eacute; said in June last year that it would not be providing it.  Is there any reason RT&Eacute; has not provided it, considering that groups like An Post have not only provided it but closed the gap?  There was a reference to 4%.  Is that number from 2018?</p></speech>

We have been engaged in a number of processes which were started by this review.  The gender and pay review sparked a number of reviews around contractors, which led to the Eversheds review, the scope division inspection, etc.  A lot is going on within the organisation which we are very committed to dealing with on a case-by-case basis.  It would have been great to have been ahead of the curve in terms of having this data to hand but unfortunately we do not.  We will have to engage on that quickly in line with the need.</p></speech>

We did not manage to do it in that timeframe.  We are working towards it for the ruling that is coming our way.  We will have that information and be as open and informative as we can with it.  We have always published our information by salary band and we have also been proactive in monitoring the way in which we are recruiting.  We have ensured that, where possible, we have maintained a 50:50 gender balance in recruitment.  We have a lot going on but I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point.  I would have liked to have been able to do more in this area.

At that time, I committed to looking at it and it was from that point onwards that we carried out the Eversheds process.  I am not clear if there was a process before that or not but my commitment to the trade union group and the employee base was that, following the rolling gender review, we would carry out a detailed assessment of our contractors.  That is what we have been doing, as I outlined in the opening statement.</p></speech>

That is all ongoing.  The important point, as I outlined at the outset, is that we are looking at legacy issues which we will need to address.  We quickly put in place a go-forward policy, which was employment first.  All of our policies were changed and training was put in place, etc.  All of this is tied up in a complex process, started by Eversheds, which moved into Revenue and is now in scope.  That is where we will handle all of that.</p></speech>

I am the chief financial officer.  In note 2 on page 110 of the annual accounts, we set out how the licence fee is allocated.  In summary, the licence fee is first allocated to cover the cost of the activities that are not capable of generating commercial revenues.  It is then spread across the other channels that are capable of generating advertising or other commercial income.  For instance, the cost of running Lyric FM is approximately &euro;5 million per year and &euro;5 million of licence fee funding is allocated to it instead of-----</p></speech>

Last year, a number of organisations that concern themselves with eating disorders and health issues made the point that programmes such as "Operation Transformation" are damaging.  For an organisation that has a public mandate and is explicitly mandated to operate in the public interest, where is the test of how RT&Eacute; is doing that and who decides what is in the public interest?</p></speech>

The principles of public service broadcasting are a blend of those three areas.  Every year, the BAI assesses how we deliver on our remit.  It is our regulator.  We have a lot of commitments we have to deliver on, and the BAI is ultimately the arbiter of how we deliver on that and how we spend our money.  Again, it is that broad spectrum.  We are a public service broadcaster with an obligation to serve the people and we commercialise that as a secondary objective.  That is how we look at everything we do.</p> <p>  The programme the Deputy is talking about has evolved over many years.  I hope she has watched this season and seen some changes.  It is now a more holistic programme and it takes into account the wider area of health, not focusing on just one area.  We get a huge positive reaction from the public to the programme.  I appreciate there are possible triggers for people within it but, in the context of the overall health of the nation and the overall benefits taken from it, we get strong feedback.  The creators of the programme, in conjunction with us, are very aware of the issues the Deputy mentioned.  We have evolved the programme and it has changed, and we hope it fulfils a more holistic approach to the overall health issue she raised.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-20a.71" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022012000002#D00900"><p>I apologise that I was not able to join the meeting at the start because I was making a contribution in the D&aacute;il.  I thank the director general and the other representatives of RT&Eacute; for coming before us and dealing with our questions.</p> <p>  I might start with the appointment of Willis Towers Watson review and the fact there are more than 164 different pay grades within RT&Eacute;.  The report is awaited and I am not sure what the timescale is, but has a process been started, even at this stage, as to how the broadcaster will reconfigure the fact there are 164 pay grades within RT&Eacute;?  I presume the review will not be made available for some time.</p></speech>

The very purpose of engaging with Willis Towers Watson is to look at that and to look at how we can simplify it to a much more workable and modern way of working, and that is all part of the process.  We engaged Willis Towers Watson last year.  It is a thorough and complex process that will involve a lot of elements.  We expect the report to be finished roughly around September of this year, and all the way through that there will be ongoing engagement with Willis Towers Watson on the process.  It is all under way.  The company, which came through a public procurement process, has also worked with the BBC.  The BBC carried out a similar review a number of years ago, so Willis Towers Watson has a lot of experience in the sector.  The BBC had similar issues to us as regards legacy numbers and a complex grading structure, and all of that is included in the review that is under way.</p></speech>

I was involved in a company a number of years ago in which it took us 11 years to make progress on an issue like this.  I am bit concerned, given there are 167 different grades, as to how RT&Eacute; can put in place a simpler process.</p></speech>

We need to await the outcome of the process but, judging from that experience, we want to implement this as soon as possible, and I would expect that to be quarter 1 of 2023.  That is very much in line with how the BBC process was worked through.  It is a complex process and I very much hope we will stick to those timings.  That is our plan at the moment.</p></speech>

Of that 1,866, how many earn under &euro;100,000 and how many earn more than that?  There seems to be a significant variation, given there are 167 different grades.</p></speech>

Those figures are as at 31 December 2020.</p></speech>

My understanding is licence fee revenue accounts for 59% of the total, while the figure for non-licence fee revenue is 41%.  Does RT&Eacute; foresee an increase in how much money can come in from sources other than licence fees over the next three to four years?  Is there any plan in place to deal with that?</p></speech>

Advertising used to make up the bigger proportion but that has not been the case for the past number of years because of what I outlined.</p> <p>  We have committed in our strategy that we need to diversify revenues.  That plan has been put a little on hold because of the pandemic.  We had a plan to look at events and raising other revenues.  Having said that, it is fair to say advertising will continue to be a dominant part of our funding.  It is a large pot of money to pay for.  Obviously, as we deliver audiences, advertisers want to get to them.  Towards the end of last year, as the country reopened a little, the demand for advertising was much stronger than we had anticipated, given the pent-up demand for advertising.</p><p>Diversity is needed.  We are doing that.  We are also looking at other areas where down the line we could blend our free-to-air offering with what we call "over-the-top offerings", which would lead to subscriber models.  We work with the GAA on the GAAGo product, which is available outside Ireland and in Ireland, for the delivery of GAA games.  We have recently launched a product with United Rugby Championship, URC, the rugby tournament - again, a similar offering.  We are looking at a number of places, but underpinning the very notion of public service broadcasting needs to be a strong and fair public funding system.  We look forward to the results of the media commission to see where that stands.</p></speech>

Ms Forbes has spoken on a number of occasions about an increase in the licence fee and value for money.  An Post is involved in the collection of fees and approximately 15% of people now say that they are not accessing the service.  Can there be a better structure put in place for the collection of licence fees than what currently is there and has that been discussed with An Post at any stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-20a.82" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022012000002#E00300"><p>First, if I may, we have never asked for an increase in the licence fee.  What we have always called for is reform of the existing system.  It was probably the last time we spoke to the committee that we had identified &euro;50 million was being lost through a combination of evasion and the no-television home scenario.  That has now increased to &euro;65 million.  The system, if you like, is not getting access to &euro;65 million.  Therefore, any increase in the licence fee would be unjust on those who are paying.  What we are asking for is reform of the current system in the first place.  That is hugely important.</p> <p>  As the Deputy pointed out, the collector of the licence fee is appointed by the Department.  In the case of ourselves, An Post is the collecting agent.  I cannot speak for An Post but I think it has some issues with the system.  There is a database that is very out of date.  It needs updating.  The collection system, with licence fee collectors on the road, is a costly one.  That needs looking at but what needs to be looked at seriously is the future funding model.  Whatever model that comes into play, it needs to be fair, independent and empirically set, not by us or by anybody in the Houses but by the regulator, to ensure it is a fair system for all.</p></speech>

As the Deputy will be aware, one of the key purposes of the commission was to look at the future funding of both public service media and media generally in Ireland.  We are awaiting the publication of that document.  My understanding is that it was made available.  We are awaiting the publication of it, I would hope, very soon.</p></speech>

The Eversheds Sutherland report, which has been discussed, identified 157 people who had what were described as  "attributes akin to employment" or "attributes akin to both employment and self employment" that resulted in 82 people being offered contracts.</p> <p>  This report then served as the basis for a voluntary disclosure to Revenue that we learned about at our previous discussions.  In that discussion, Ms O'Shea described an initial settlement of &euro;1.22 million.  In her opening statement, Ms Forbes describes this as "a settlement".  I would like clarification, in the first instance, as to whether any additional payment has been made to Revenue since we last met and whether Ms Forbes expects that additional payments might have to be made.</p></speech>

I am the group financial controller at RT&Eacute;.  At our previous session I had used the phrase "an initial payment" because the matter of a Revenue audit was ongoing at the time and it was not clear to us at that point whether any further payments would be due in respect of the audit investigation by the Revenue Commissioners.  We received confirmation of the conclusion of that audit in June 2021 subsequent to our meeting and I believe we shared that communication with this committee.  No further payment was made.  The settlement payment that was made to Revenue is as we had outlined.</p></speech>

In our governing principles, which we included in the members' briefing pack, the matter of retrospection, or anything on that level, would feature at the end of the process, as we outlined to the TUG.  As the Deputy knows, the process that we thought was the Eversheds process has now turned into Eversheds, Revenue and scope; it has become a more complex process.  We began the discussions with the TUG before Christmas and they will continue.  We are very committed to looking at this to determine the impact down the line, but we are not there yet.</p></speech>

Therefore, there is potentially quite an amount of expenditure yet to be determined and paid.  I want clarification on the financial planning framework for that at a time RT&Eacute; is seeking additional funding from the State, Exchequer, taxpayer or licence payer, or however we want to describe it.  We have a period in which there is an undisclosed amount that will have to be paid.  How is that planned for in RT&Eacute;'s strategies and financial frameworks?</p></speech>

In our business, we assess all the risks facing us.  On that basis, we look at the risks, their likelihood and how easy it is to quantify them.  Beyond the risks pertaining to the scope investigation, there are many other risks facing the organisation.  We create provisions against those risks.  This case, as members have heard, is a very complex process.  It is still at a relatively early stage.  It is very difficult to quantify exactly what the exposures are.  We are a prudent organisation and have made provisions, but those provisions are general provisions.  It is impossible to be specific on this but we have made some general provisions.  It is an evolving process.  As the director general said, it is planned to finish in 2023 but it could go on further.  It is something we will have to keep under review each year.</p></speech>

Obviously, there is a lot of focus here on the licence fee.  I see in the briefing material the witnesses provided, for which I thank them, that there is a strong focus on the licence fee and the threat to Irish programming generally if there is no action and so on.  I want to consider the other side of RT&Eacute;'s revenue - the commercial advertising side.  RT&Eacute; has a dual funding model.  There is no other media organisation of which I am aware that gets State support.  The <i>Irish Independent</i>, <i>The Irish Times</i>and Virgin Media, for example, do not.  Therefore, it is very significant to have received &euro;1 billion in the period 2015 to 2019.  On commercial advertising, can the witnesses explain to me what is RT&Eacute;'s advertising unit rate?  For example, what is the cost per thousand eyeballs?  Is that not the advertising unit?  What is that here?  How does it compare to an equivalent unit in the UK?</p></speech>

The advertising rate, or the cost per thousand eyeballs, as she referred to, depends on the audience being targeted.  We have a wide range of audiences, including all adults, young adults, ABC1s, men, etc.  The cost per thousand is based on the audience.  I can happily furnish the Deputy with some broad outlines of that.</p></speech>

I am not asking about other Irish markets.  RT&Eacute; has such a dominant position in the market.  Its strategy on pricing and commercial advertising has an effect on the rest of the sector, which is very important to note.  What is the unit price and how does it compare with an equivalent unit price elsewhere?  If, for example, Procter &amp;amp; Gamble wants to sell washing fluid to adults and to advertise on either prime-time ITV or prime-time RT&Eacute;, what is the difference?  Are both pitching at the same level, or would it be cheaper for Procter &amp;amp; Gamble to advertise to Irish audiences than audiences in the UK?</p></speech>

Another important difference here for us is that we have half the minutage of most commercial broadcasters because we are funded by both licence fees and commercial broadcasting.  Comparing markets is interesting.  We are competing with an overspill of UK channels come into this market, but what we do is deliver a premium product in the market.  We deliver the most eyeballs, as the Deputy rightly pointed out.  The cost of that within the market is, therefore, more expensive.</p></speech>

The market comparisons were valid when we talked back in April about the risk of talent flying to other markets, for example.  Therefore, they are relevant.  I am just looking for the unit price of advertising and how it compares to that in the UK.</p></speech>

The world is changing continuously.  There are a lot of risks out there and inflation is coming at us now.  We are on track with that although I think it is going to be difficult to achieve it.  What I would say is that RT&Eacute; has a very good track record of achieving cost savings.  If the Deputy looks back over the previous ten years, she will see we have managed to keep our operating costs around &euro;335 million.</p></speech>

There is a huge focus in the RT&Eacute; materials on the &euro;65 million and how much RT&Eacute; needs that.  There is a cost-saving project of &euro;60 million, which is important, yet in the RT&Eacute; materials, beyond the realisation of non-evasion of licence fees as being plan A, I do not see a plan B or a plan C.  Maybe it is happening but I do not see efforts to consolidate production staff, or a serious move out of Donnybrook to periphery centres, as other television stations have done, or co-ordinating with other production facilities to try to consolidate costs on that side while maintaining editorial difference.  Does RT&Eacute; really still need RT&Eacute; 2 or can it change the model entirely to protect RT&Eacute; 1 as an entirely publicly funded channel with no ads?  There does not seem to be a plan B or a plan C.  I am worried about the implementation of the cost-saving mechanisms, which are nearly equivalent to the difference in the licence fee.  I wonder what plan B is.</p></speech>

We put a plan in place in 2019 and there were three elements to that plan.  The first part was stabilising and diversifying commercial revenues, the second part was controlling our costs and reforming them and the third part was additional public funding.  The first two elements of that were under our control or substantially under our control, and I would say we have delivered on those.  If we look at commercial revenues, I know we are talking about 2020 here but in 2021 we have grown them and they are nearly back to where they were in 2018.  On the costs, as I have just said, we have delivered most of those cost savings, albeit in a different manner from how we had planned to do it.  It is the third element that is outstanding, the public funding element, and that is a big part of the plan.  If that is not delivered, we will still have a big gap in the bottom line going forward.  That is where the issue is.  For the parts that are under RT&Eacute;'s control, we have a plan or are working to those.  Closing RT&Eacute; 2 was not part of the original plan so it is not something we are looking at.</p></speech>

I and my party are significantly supportive of the idea of a publicly funded broadcaster.  Throughout the pandemic in particular, we have seen key programmes on RT&Eacute; like &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; which have been crucial in communicating important public health messages, and programmes like &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; with regard to debating the different restrictions.  It is very important that we have that debate and although it is not often supportive of the Government position, it is important that the debate happens in public.  I want to outline my commitment to the idea of a publicly funded broadcast model.</p> <p>  I also want to thank RT&Eacute; and those in RT&Eacute; for the work they have done through what was a crucial time.  It is no mistake that in a revolution, the first thing somebody does is take over the television station.  There is a reason for that.  The fact RT&Eacute; is not controlled by any one political outfit and RT&Eacute; is not an instrument of the Government or the Opposition is very important, and it is important for us to remember that in the context of this discussion.  I will be questioning RT&Eacute; nonetheless but my comments are set in that framework.</p> <p>  In 2021, RT&Eacute; made a decision to no longer use the digital audio broadcasting, DAB, format, which was a programme initiated in 2006.  Has there been any review of the expenditure on that or any review of the money spent on the learnings that might be taken from that for other platforms?</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for those comments.</p><p> It is important to make a couple of comments on DAB.  The DAB trial operated for more than ten years.  There was no take-up from industry around that.  Neither was there an ongoing plan to have a wider policy in respect of DAB.  Hence, we took the decision to close it, really as a future cost-avoidance measure rather than anything else.  There was also the fact that, in the main, listenership to FM in this country is strong.  It remains the key area.  It is also important to say that broadcasting generally, both radio and television, is now moving to an Internet protocol, IP, base anyway.  Our focus now is very much around how we can create an audio product for the future that will serve the needs of the audiences in that way.  DAB was put in place many years ago.  There was no take-up from industry or the audience.  Hence, a decision was taken to shut it down.</p></speech>

Again, the point of the player is that viewers can view whenever they want, they can catch up, they can watch live, etc.  There has been significant growth in the area the past two years.  That is also an area of growth for us in the commercial world.  As it grows, we can monetise it.  As regards the social media platforms, in the main, what we see there is more promotional or snippet-driven.  It would be highly unusual to see-----</p></speech>

We are seeing that RT&Eacute; 2XM is fertile ground for new music.  However, as we evolve into what I would call a digital audio strategy, we will be keeping all of this under review.  This will include reviewing what is the best way to provide that variety of music as the platforms emerge.

One of my greatest criticisms of RT&Eacute; is its complete lack of any sort of effective regional radio or television coverage for the Dublin market.  The BBC managed to maintain two local radio stations on this island.  RT&Eacute; does not do that for the main capital city.  Given that Ms Forbes has provided details around platforms, which allow local content or specific content to be provided through 2XM or Radio Gold, I cannot see why an RT&Eacute; Dublin station could not be provided.  As a politician, I am envious of the local radio stations that my colleagues have right across the country.  RT&Eacute; seems to believe that coverage in Dublin is national and that regional is everything outside of the M50.  There is almost no Dublin-specific content.</p></speech>

We have a number of regional correspondents.  We are always filing stories every day into both the news bulletins and importantly into the digital space.  If one looks on the app, one can localise within provinces.  For example, one can look at Leinster or Munster.  One can get more local there.  We try to have as much of that in there as possible.  However, the Deputy can appreciate that our role is the national broadcaster.  We try to bring the national picture.  However, of course, we do hone in on particular areas at different times.</p></speech>

John Kilrane is a fantastic reporter, but he is one man.  We have 1 million eyeballs in Dublin.  The national broadcaster is seriously letting us down by not providing more Dublin-focused content.</p></speech>

I might have a different view to Deputy McAuliffe on the amount of content that people in the regions perceive that is attributed to Dublin.</p><p> I will begin by saying "well done" to RT&Eacute; on its latest partnership with Virgin Media Television in respect of the Six Nations Championship.  That is a wonderful example of collaboration.  Speaking as a proud Munster man and a Munster rugby supporter, I also commend RT&Eacute;, TG4 and the independent sector on the provision of United Rugby Championship, URC, output.  I strongly believe that model has provided excellent content for the average punter sitting at home who wants to view rugby or sporting output at the highest level through the terrestrial channels.  The URC is a great example of where the licence payer sees the best of the utilisation of that fund.  Are there plans to expand that further?  Can we expect to see more of that?  Does the director general perceive that RT&Eacute; will do more collaborations of that nature and exploit further opportunities so that more and more people can enjoy - because that is what it is about - the output that is coming through collaborations of that nature?</p></speech>

In serving the people of Ireland, we always want to showcase our national teams and our national athletes in the best way possible, where possible.  We are delighted with the two collaborations the Deputy mentioned, the URC and the Six Nations Championship, for a number of reasons.  They mean that, number one, we can bring those very important sporting events back to RT&Eacute; and, more important, they allow us to keep the entire tournaments free-to-air.  That is a real objective of ours in the current marketplace, where sports rights have become so competitive.  We are very pleased to be able to do that.  Collaboration in this area is exactly something that we are pursuing.  It will not apply to everything because it simply cannot.  I have said a number of times that it is a combination of simply not being able to afford to do these things on our own any more, as a practical reality, so our collaborations in that respect have worked for both parties, where we can share that cost.</p> <p>  We are also very committed to the diversification of sports on RT&Eacute;.  We are very proud of the inroads we have made, especially around women's sport in the past couple of years where, again, we should be and are showcasing that.  Certainly, collaborations are something that we will actively pursue.  They will not always work, for various reasons, but we are very happy and proud that these two have come to the table and are showcasing the grassroots, it could be said, in the URC and the national and international game in the Six Nations Championship.</p></speech>

She spoke about the diversification of sport and, specifically, gender, which is absolutely vital, but what is in pipeline that will embed that model further?  From the ordinary punter's point of view, and I am an ordinary punter in this regard, when I look at the URC coverage I see the best of RT&Eacute;, TG4 and the independent sector collaborating.</p><p>Looking at the <i>Irish Examiner</i>model of delivering sport at the most local level through a streaming package, I can tune in to my local team at a county final from the comfort of my living room.  Should we go down to that level of granularity?  Should the national broadcaster be getting on that wagon to see where the opportunities lie to further embed itself into that collaborative model so that there is more output and RT&Eacute; is taking feeds from a more diverse range of venues across a more diverse range of sports?  The technology allows us to do that now.  Presumably, RT&Eacute; does not need to have an outside broadcast unit at every single venue because it can implant technology at the venue and take the feed from that.  I would love to see more of that from our national broadcaster: more localised, more regionalised and more diverse output.  If Ms Forbes can tell me it is now part of a policy in RT&Eacute; to continue with that, it will give many people a lot of confidence.</p></speech>

It is also highly competitive and hugely confidential.  As I said, we absolutely want to continue the principle that we are working with here, in varying shapes.  Will they always work out?  Possibly not, for various reasons, but the spirit with which we went into both those discussions was to enhance the opportunity for the viewer.  That is what will always drive our collaboration and our engagements at this level.  Certainly, it is something we want to continue to pursue.  I cannot get into detail because that is the nature of negotiations, but it is something I hope the Deputy will see more of.</p></speech>

I will move on to the independent sector.  My understanding is that there is a statutory requirement for RT&Eacute; to spend in respect of it.  For instance, in 2020, the statutory requirement was to spend approximately &euro;40.2 million - Ms Forbes might correct me if that is wrong.  My understanding is that RT&Eacute; spent approximately &euro;36.5 million, which is about &euro;3.7 million under target.  I understand that the Covid pandemic was a deciding factor in that because of cancelled productions and so on, but the underspend is then required to be spent within two years.  Will Ms Forbes elaborate, or educate us, on how RT&Eacute; plans to spend that underspend?  Again, I speak specifically for the independent sector, which is starved of funding at present, has plans afoot to deliver content and is anxious to get going again.</p></speech>

We have made that up throughout 2021.  It is worth saying that the independent sector is hugely important to RT&Eacute;.  We are partners in so many areas.  I have to commend the sector on its resilience throughout the pandemic in doing everything it could to stay up and running and to put protocols in place that allowed the majority of productions to happen but, of course, some fell by the wayside.  That was just the nature of the beast we were dealing with.</p> <p>  I have said that we want to spend more with the independent sector.  It is something we would love to see and I know it would love to see.  Again, this is something that could be rectified if reform of the licence fee happened.  As the Deputy knows, there is money already through the BAI sound and vision fund but, likewise, if more money was to come into RT&Eacute;, we would want to spend that in the independent sector.  It is hugely important to us.  We have made up our commitment; the Deputy is correct that there is a two-year period where we can make it up.  We were very keen to make it up as quickly as possible, given the health of the sector.  We have done that and, again, we have a very big programme of work under way for this year, which right now has stops and starts, given where we are with Covid.  We want to do everything we can to both meet and over-deliver on that commitment, if at all possible.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses.  Obviously, it is a good opportunity to address some of these issues.  I will start with the misclassification of staff.  We know there is a power differential between employee and employer, that SIPTU and the NUJ were very active on this for a very long time and that it went on for far too long.  Due to people's employment status being misclassified, there will be an obligation to pay both employer and employee PRSI contributions.  Certain people will have lost out badly on things like pensions and maternity leave and there may be liabilities and other actions taken as a consequence of that.  I know this is not the first time this type of issue has arisen in RT&Eacute;.  It happened in the late 1980s.  Where will the accountability rest?  Will that be factored into this?  We know that about 80 people have seen their employment status change.  Why is there no commitment to dealing with issues other than Revenue and PRSI issues?  Why would this not be automatic when these employees were treated this way?  Where is the accountability regarding the person or people who decided that this was the employment status that would be offered to these people without understanding that this was really bogus self-employment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-20a.216" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dee Forbes" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022012000002#L00300"><p>I do not agree with the statement that RT&Eacute; has been involved in bogus employment practices.  I agree that changes to employment legislation might not have been kept up to date with.  We are dealing with legacy issues for many years.  The important thing is that we come to a resolution, which we are working on through a very complex process involving Eversheds, Revenue and SCOPE, so we are committed to working through that.  The important thing is that the measures are put in place to ensure this does not happen in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-20a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022012000002#L00400"><p>I take it that Ms Forbes does not see that accountability.  She talks about legacy issues.  I will leave it at that but I must say that I do not accept that it is not bogus self-employment because people's employment status was changed, there was a review by SCOPE and there was a Revenue payment.  I do not know what Ms Forbes would call it.  If another semi-State company was in front of "Prime Time Investigates" or some other really superb really good programming RT&Eacute; does such as "Crimes and Confessions" and this was the profile, it would be held to account.  It is our obligation to hold RT&Eacute; to account on this.  I will leave it at that but I did not hear what I wanted to hear in terms of accountability.</p> <p>  I will move on to the RT&Eacute; Player.  There has been a significant change in how people consume content.  It probably ties into the number of non-TV households.  Much of that has to do with people struggling with the cost of living and putting a roof over their heads.  Younger people in particular will fall into that category.  How much has RT&Eacute; spent on the RT&Eacute; Player in terms of getting it to where it is at the moment?  Does Ms Forbes use it herself?  There is an ongoing discussion among people who use it.  I have used it myself and have given up on it on several occasions because all you get are ads and then it drops out.  Is Ms Forbes satisfied with the RT&Eacute; Player and if not, what kind of investment will be put into it?  </p></speech>

I take her point that there have been issues and I am very committed to doing as much as we can to iron out those issues.  Advertising is a fact of life in our world and must be facilitated within that environment because of our remit and objective to commercialise our output.  We have allocated moneys to continually upgrade the RT&Eacute; Player.  I will be honest with the Deputy.  We do not have the resources or money of some of the streamers or the likes of Channel 4, which has invested significantly in this.  In terms of our future proofing, we want to spend more and we are spending more.  It has stabilised significantly in the past year recognising that we have work to do but it is a very important focus for us for the future.</p></speech>

We want to have a world-class product.  It is what is expected now.  One thing about us that is quite different from Netflix or Amazon Prime is that we are dealing with the complexities of live television and on-demand, which requires quite a different investment compared to somebody who is not taking advertising or providing live television.</p></speech>

The area I represent, which would be described as the commuter belt, although people do not feel like they are economic units or just people who are on the move all the time, is probably well represented in the non-TV household cohort and the younger age cohort.  It is a missing area in terms of coverage.  We are not the midlands but we are classified as midlands.  We are not Dublin because we are not Dublin, which is a missed opportunity.  There are probably a lot of areas that are missed as a consequence of that.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Hourigan regarding gender.  The lack of transparency in terms of RT&Eacute; being able to give us that information has not been good.  It is important information.  Obviously, RT&Eacute; sets the standards for other people and the fact that it is unable to give us this information means it is falling down on this standard in terms of transparency.</p><p>I have to agree with the Deputy on that.  </p><p> On the orchestra, will RT&Eacute; keep the funding it was provided to cover the cost of the orchestra now that the orchestra is being moved to the National Concert Hall, NCH?</p></speech>

The outcome of that was the recommendation that RT&Eacute; could no longer fund both orchestras.  The Government decided that additional funding would be made available for the National Symphony Orchestra, NSO, to become part of the NCH.  Yes, that money will remain with RT&Eacute; and additional funding has been provided for the transfer of that orchestra to the NCH, which will take effect from Monday of next week.</p></speech>

We have been waiting some time for this meeting to happen, but all the same, it is welcome.  I welcome Ms Forbes and Mr. Collins.</p> <p>  I have a couple of issues that I would like to raise and questions I would like to ask.  First, I would like to focus on the financial circumstances within RT&Eacute;'s organisation.  I refer to advertising.  Could Ms Forbes or Mr. Collins provide a quick breakdown in terms of sporting advertising, that is, advertising from sports events that RT&Eacute; operates?  How much revenue is generated from doing that?  I will follow up with a subsequent question.</p></speech>

Again, advertising is commercially sensitive.  We provide the full figure as opposed to breaking it down by any particular genre or any particular programme etc.  That is the way we report our advertising.</p></speech>

We have seen from viewership figures that it is one of the areas where RT&Eacute; successfully manages to attract a large viewership of the television audience.  Has RT&Eacute; ever considered having a separate sports channel for broadcasting GAA, horse racing, soccer, the IRFU and other sports across male and female participation in Ireland?  Why is RT&Eacute; not doing the same as what other jurisdictions and countries are doing?</p></speech>

It is of growing importance to us, particularly given it is a live viewing experience for audiences.  We regularly look at the amount of content that we have in this area.  Currently, we maximise what we have across RT&Eacute; 1 and RT&Eacute; 2.  In terms of another channel, that is something we obviously have to look at in detail and see if there are enough rights out there to be able to afford to put on another channel.  We continue to look at if there is more opportunity in getting other rights.  Certainly, we try to optimise between the two channels.  We are very committed to a wider number of sports, be it women's sports, be it broader codes etc.  For now, the way that we can treat that content is across the two channels that we have.</p></speech>

There is enough sport going on in Ireland and we have a sports-mad culture, therefore this is something that should be considered.  RT&Eacute; is in very serious financial circumstances, arguably down to the television licence.  On behalf of the taxpayers in the country, one could also argue that the content that we are getting in return is not up to standards.</p> <p>  First and foremost, I want to be positive.  Particularly, RT&Eacute; Radio's current affairs section and RT&Eacute;'s documentaries are excellent.  Those are definitely things that the station does better.  However, from a content creation point of view, whether it was the new year show on RT&Eacute; - which many people found deeply frustrating and disappointing - one of the many lifestyle shows or reruns of old dramas, content creation is lacking in an era where it is so important.  RT&Eacute; is nowhere near where it needs to be as a station and as a national broadcaster, particularly with the growth of online content.  </p> <p>  Just to go back to the point that Deputy Catherine Murphy made, the RT&Eacute; Player is a disgrace.  It is just not where it needs to be.  These issues have been identified to RT&Eacute; by many people.  For a station that is in receipt of so much State support, what proactive measures will RT&Eacute; undertake over next 12 months to deal with the issues with the RT&Eacute; Player?</p></speech>

That is down to, quite frankly, the funding situation.  We do the best we can with the funds we have available.  Nobody sets out to make a bad show.  That is just not the case.  I spoke before about our commitment towards Irish drama.  We will have up to 60 hours of Irish drama in the coming years.  Ideally, if we had more funding, it would be spent on content and on capital, to the Deputy's earlier point on the RT&Eacute; Player.  Our capital budget is &euro;7.5 million per year.  That number is a result of the persistent and consistent underfunding that the organisation has found itself in.  Quite honestly, we would not have been able to get through Covid if we had not had the investment that we put in from some of the land sale into infrastructure over the past couple of years.  A combination of content and capital is what we need to get this organisation to a place that is viable and is future-proof.  I might ask my colleagues-----</p></speech>

Has RT&Eacute; come forward with a concrete business plan to the relevant Departments that need to provide it with this additional funding to bring it out of that hole?  Is that something the station is proactively doing?  The drama, "Normal People", for example, was extremely successful.  It was an original drama and obviously had assistance internationally.  Extraordinary things can be done when minds are put together and new talent is brought in.  RT&Eacute; has demonstrated with "Love/Hate" and other shows that it has created in the past number of years that it can be very successfully done.  I am at a bit of a loss as to why that is not done more by the station.  In terms of coming to the Government with a concrete business plan for support, taking away the television licence issue for one moment, is that something the station is doing, undertaking or has done already in the course of the past five months?</p></speech>

We outlined very clearly what was needed, particularly in terms of capital and content for the future.  Just to give the Deputy an idea on the cost of something like "Normal People", it cost &euro;3 million per episode to make.  It is a huge investment.  We could never have afforded that.  Therefore, the deal that we did was a different deal, where we got to be the Irish broadcaster.  We put some money in but we could never afford that.  Hence, the approach we have taken with drama now is to try to increase the amount of drama we are getting, but we are a minority funder.  We are bringing in third-party funding all the time.  For example, "Hidden Assets", which was recently on, was a co-production between a number of parties, from Belgium, France and here.  "Smother", which is on air at the moment, has got money from the BBC, Screen Ireland and the western region audiovisual producers, WRAP, fund.  Again, we absolutely should be doing those things but the way in which we can partake in content creation is no longer one where it is us alone, given the scale that these productions are now commanding because of the wider market.  That is the reality.</p></speech>

I wish to compliment the current affairs aspect of what RT&Eacute; is doing; it is excellent.  The public get good value for tax money in that regard, particularly with radio.  The figures internationally are very impressive.  Coming back to the content creation side of dramas with home-grown talent in Ireland, is Ms Forbes at liberty to divulge how much RT&Eacute; is investing in this on an annual basis or how much money it may need on an ongoing basis?  The public is willing to support RT&Eacute; as an entity as long as it sees a return for that investment.  RT&Eacute; has proven that it can be done successfully, through a very limited scope in recent years and with certain shows that it has worked on.  For the survival of the station, that is an area that deeply needs further investigation and, obviously, investment.</p><p>From an annual expenditure point of view, what is RT&Eacute; currently spending on its own content creation, looking purely at the lifestyle and arts side of the station, rather than current affairs and sport?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct.  We should be investing more in drama.  We wish to do so and the way we are doing it is by bringing more parties together.  Even at that, however, we should be spending more and it is an area on which we would love to spend more should the funding come our way.  It is the place where we see ourselves-----</p></speech>

My apologies for being so rude.  I am sure she understands.  The figures she compared are telling.  Some &euro;67 million is being spent on current affairs, while &euro;17 million is being spent on the whole area of production of shows in RT&Eacute; outside that scope.</p></speech>

The sum needs to be drastically increased.  Obviously, that will require support from the Government.

How can RT&Eacute; become a more nimble public service broadcaster?  In terms of delivery of services, are there opportunities to pare back services?  Is that something that RT&Eacute; is reviewing?  In regard to the ongoing concerns around RT&Eacute; 2FM, how can RT&Eacute; justify the station's public service credentials and have the wider offerings of RT&Eacute; been looked at?</p></speech>

On the first point around sustainability, when we published our 2019 revised strategy we outlined three areas that needed to come together to prove that RT&Eacute; could be sustainable for the future.  The three areas were: commercial income, which needed to be increased and diversified; costs, which needed to reduce to the tune of &euro;60 million over that three-year period; and licence fee revenues, which needed to come to the level that the BAI recommended a number of years ago.  In terms of the two areas under our control, on which I will ask Mr. Collins to elaborate further in a moment, we are increasing our commercial income and we are in a programme of cost containment.  What has not happened through any of this process is any change to the licence fee funding.  As we pointed out in our submission, the system is losing &euro;65 million that should be coming in.  I will ask Mr. Collins to elaborate on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-20a.294" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richard Collins" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022012000002#O02700"><p>As stated by Ms Forbes, there were three pillars to this strategy.  Two of them were under our control, that is, the commercial revenue and the cost containment.  We have delivered on those.  The outstanding matter is the public funding.  There is a big gap.  In terms of television licence fee income, for the past three years it has been running at approximately &euro;196 million.  The BAI recommended that it go to &euro;220 million, which means there is a &euro;24 million gap.  If that is not closed, when the world returns to normality again RT&Eacute; will be back to running deficits if it continues to provide all of the services it provides currently.  That is the main issue that is hanging over us at the moment.</p></speech>

Mr. Collins mentioned an expected increase in the 2021 figures.  I would like an understanding of where that increase will come from.</p></speech>

Commercial advertising was in decline for a number of years up until Covid.  When the pandemic hit in March 2020, we saw a severe decline in advertising revenues.  We were down approximately 30% at that stage.  Those figures stayed down until about July.  As the economy started to open up, they started to recover.  By November, because there was a lot of pent-up demand in the economy, advertising revenues came back.  We still ended up &euro;11 million below where we were in 2019 but there was a recovery at the end of the year.</p> <p>  In 2021, the country was in lockdown for the first four months so advertising revenues were sluggish but we saw the same trend that we had seen in 2020.  Once the economy opened up again advertising took off.  We had Euro2020 in June and July, which gave us a big boost.  As we came into October and November, again, because there was huge pent-up demand, we had a very strong November.  The figures were among the highest we have had in November since 2008, November being the best month of the year for commercial advertising.  We ended the year in a good position.  The question now is how much of that will continue; was it pent-up demand; has there been a change in attitude towards television advertising; and have advertisers realised there is still value in television advertising, whereas they had doubted that before the pandemic?</p><p>Advertisers have realised there is still value in TV advertising whereas they had doubted that before the pandemic.  We have plans.  This year, we have ambitious targets.  We have more sporting rights and there will be advertising revenues coming off them.  Digital revenues in the past have been sluggish.  In 2021, we made good progress there.  In 2022, we have ambitious budgets in that area as well.  We will see them growing and contributing. </p></speech>

Not every service has a commercial aspect.  For example, Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta is a public service channel.  It is important to say that we would not be able to sustain all of our services if we did not have commercial funding.  It is the blend of both that allows us to fulfil our objects.  Over the past number of years, our revenue has fallen but our obligations have not.  We are maintaining the services to fulfil our public requirement.  The Deputy mentioned 2FM.  The very principle of public service broadcasting is that it should be a universal offering for all ages and 2FM fulfils a particular role in that younger demographic.  Without it, quite honestly, we may have a severe disadvantage.  Therefore, 2FM fulfils a unique and specific purpose and an age demographic that is engaging with RT&Eacute; on a daily basis and is very valuable both to us as an organisation and to advertisers.</p></speech>

From the information supplied, I understand wages amount to &euro;123 million, social welfare payments, PRSI and so forth amount to &euro;13 million, pension costs are &euro;13 million and &euro;23 million is paid to self-employed contractors in RT&Eacute;, giving a total in the region of &euro;173 million.

I was not too far out.</p> <p>  I have a question on the overall financial position, which Ms O'Shea may wish to answer.  It has been stated that income has fallen more than &euro;100 million in the past six years and costs have gone up in the region of &euro;30 million.  The yield to the company from the sale of land was approximately &euro;100 million.  I listened to the replies of witnesses on the potential bill arising from the Department of Social Protection investigation.

Given that a statute of limitations does not apply to an investigation by that Department, I find it hard to understand that RT&Eacute;'s financial section at this stage would not be doing some calculations as to the possible implications of that.  We are talking about a substantial sum of money.  In the context of a decline in income and the organisation running a deficit in five of the past six years, I ask the witnesses to indicate whether RT&Eacute; is doing any financial calculation on that at this point?  While I understand it would not have a definite figure, surely the financial controllers in RT&Eacute; are doing some kind of assessment of that at the moment?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, we carry provisions.  Given the nature of this investigation, which is complex, we do not really know where it will go at the end of the day and it is difficult to make a very specific provision.  We are carrying general provisions.  In terms of making them specific and linking them to individuals, that is not possible at the moment.  The process has to work its way through and the scope investigation has to finish before we can do that.</p></speech>

As I said to Ms Forbes last April, some of them are in low-income households and are dutifully paying that &euro;160 every year.  The licence fee makes up 57% of RT&Eacute;'s funding.  The fee is not being collected from 14% or 15% of households and then there are 15% of households without a television.  I am surprised to hear that figure is so high.

I know the fee is collected by the Department and collection is contracted out to An Post.  Is RT&Eacute; in favour of improving the database?  I have suggested this a number of times over the years.</p><p>I have suggested improving the database by having registration at the point where people would be connected to a service by the companies, such as Vodafone, that provide television signals.  The same thing could happen when a television is purchased.  When someone purchases a car, it is necessary to register to pay motor tax and the purchaser becomes the registered owner at that stage.  The same thing could happen when people sign up with a television signal provider.  The database would be improved by using that method, although I am not saying such an approach would solve all the problems.  Would such measures give us a comprehensive database and would RT&Eacute; favour such an approach as a way of spreading the load?</p></speech>

It needs major reform, rather than just an improved database.  We have gone beyond the point of going down particular paths in that regard.  This situation requires major reform in respect of the collection method, as well as consideration of the way in which people are now viewing television programmes.  The last time I was before the committee, we spoke about people in households without televisions watching or listening to RT&Eacute; through our online player.  The Broadcasting Act 2009 states that is okay.  The ways and means of viewing and listening that exist have changed this whole context, so the entire system of collection and the Broadcasting Act 2009 need to be reformed.  That is the important point that must be examined.  It has been said for many years by many people.  We await the outcome of the Future of Media Commission report to see what its recommendations will be and where we will go from there.</p></speech>

The figures come from TAM Ireland, which is part of the Nielsen data, and that is the recognised unit of measurement for television viewership.  It is recognised throughout the market.  The reports are issued by TAM Ireland, and the figures concerning homes with no television have increased significantly during the past decade.  It has grown from 3% in 2011 to just over 15% in January 2022.</p></speech>

Ms O'Shea stated that this is a recognised measurement, but the public would have a job accepting it.  I certainly question that figure.  I accept that more people are viewing programmes online.  Generally, however, households viewing programmes online also have televisions.  The game here must be to try to improve the collection rates without increasing the licence fee.  We must spread the load to be fairer to the households I mentioned.  That is important.  I reiterate that I seriously question that figure for non-television households.  RT&Eacute; and the Department - and we have people here from the Department with us - should look again at where this figure is coming from.  There may be a dual system in operation, where people are viewing programmes online but also have television sets.  We do not want to penalise anybody, but we must be fair to those low- and middle-income households.</p></speech>

It is possible to have a television that is connected to a box or it might involve a box and IP delivery.  Hence, again, the definition here is also out of date.  That is why that figure may seem unbelievable, but it is a definition issue.</p> <p>  It is also worth stating that we have seen significant increases in the viewing of live television via the RT&Eacute; Player.</p></speech>

Those people, however, are watching through the RT&Eacute; Player on a laptop or mobile device, generally.  This whole area of the non-television homes has been exacerbated by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Many younger people, especially, are not buying televisions.  They are using their laptops, desktop computers or mobile devices as their viewing mechanisms.</p></speech>

I will start with some questions concerning the opening statement.  I apologise as well if some of these questions have been posed already.  I welcome Ms Forbes and her team.  It is good to see everybody again.  Turning to the opening statement from the Comptroller and Auditor General, concerning the additional funding provided to support enhanced programming during the Covid-19 pandemic, I am aware of the educational programmes that were broadcast.  I commend them, because they were very informative and beneficial, given that schools were closed at the time and there was online learning.  Those programmes were good productions and really well done.  I praise the people behind those programmes.  What other types of programming were funded from that additional allocation given in 2020?</p> <p>  Regarding the licence fee, I noticed that roughly the same amount of money was collected in 2019 as in 2020.  Ms Forbes said that there was a rate of a little over 15% for non-payment of the licence fee.  What steps are being taken in that regard, or what kind of review of the process is underway, to try to reduce that figure?  It has climbed year on year, if I am not mistaken.  A similar figure is provided in Ms Forbes' opening statement concerning more than 15% of people who classify themselves as having no television, if I am not mistaken on that aspect.</p> <p>  Moving to the mention that was made of the critical upgrading of studio and broadcasting infrastructure, what kind of percentage of RT&Eacute;'s overall spending is being spent on replacing that equipment?  Those are my questions for now.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for his comments regarding &quot;Home School Hub&quot; and the other content.  We created all that content within the existing budget.  Any additional content that was produced came from within that budget.  We had no additional funding <i>per se</i>to cover any Covid-19 issues.<br/><br/>Turning to the licence fee and the whole process there, as I have outlined and as was outlined by the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment in 2017, is that the current system is not fit for purpose.  As the Deputy is probably aware, the collection of the licence fee is done by An Post.  There is an agreement between the Department and An Post in that regard.</p><p>The Department can comment on measures being taken to amend or change any of that.  The Future of Media Commission was established to try to come up with a future-proofing method of collection, recognising what has been said in the past about the current system not being fit for purpose.  That is my comment on that.</p><p> What was the third part of the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

When we did the land sale, the proceeds were ring-fenced for strategic projects.  Part of that was capital expenditure, with &euro;35 million ring-fenced for capital expenditure.  In 2018 and 2019 we were able to divert another &euro;7.5 million to capital spend.  I am giving rounded figures, so we spent about &euro;15 million a year on capital.  Obviously, the onset of the pandemic slowed things down in the last two years, but they are the sort of figures we are running at.  However, that fund is going to run out and we will be back to the &euro;7.5 million.  The business needs to be spending &euro;15 million a year into the future to refresh our existing infrastructure but also to prepare us for the digital world or the digital roadmap of the future.  This all links back in with our funding issue.</p></speech>

I note the issues regarding gender pay.  I understand RT&Eacute; is participating in a working group with the Department as one of 500 other organisations.  Specifically regarding the large-scale organisational restructuring in RT&Eacute; and given the challenges Ms Forbes just spoke about in the media sector, particularly public service broadcasting, can she point to any other organisation similar to RT&Eacute; anywhere around the globe that she would like RT&Eacute; to emulate in respect of digital content, news and current affairs and other general programming, or is it a unique challenge here?  If one looks across the water to the BBC, for example, and what has happened there with the licence fee and the challenges it faces, it is quite similar for public service broadcasting, but can she point to any other jurisdiction where she would say there is a good balance and a good mix and it is something she would like to replicate here?</p></speech>

It is the nature of the time and of the obligations that go with that.  If we were to look at particular markets that have a well-functioning system and as a result have strong services, one has to point to the Nordic countries.  Perhaps Finland is comparable with us in terms of size and population, for example, but it has more revenue and a lot more people employed.  Likewise, Norway is a very strong hub for content creation, as is Denmark.  Again, the funding mechanism there has changed over the years and they have moved much more to a tax-based system to ensure that the public service broadcasters are funded.  The Nordic countries certainly would be a place to consider.</p></speech>

The first refers to note 18 of the 2020 financial statements, and this relates to our previous conversation.  Other payroll-related accruals are up from &euro;7 million in 2019 to over &euro;15 million in 2020.  That is a substantial increase.  The footnote states that other employee-related accruals consist of employee benefits such as employee remuneration and holiday leave provided for in accordance with IAS 19 employee benefits.  That is a substantial increase.  How is that accounted for and does it relate to our previous discussion about the historical misallocation of people as being self-employed?</p></speech>

It is to do with the wages subsidy scheme and the reconciliation of that will wash through this year.  It is quite complicated, but it is just that the way the system was being reconciled at the end of the year created a large accrual or liability.  There was also an accrual there for increments that had not been paid for a couple of years.  There were various other accruals, including holiday pay that had built up where staff had not taken all their holidays.  We accrued for the cost of that.</p></speech>

We know that RT&Eacute; publishes the ten high earners annually.  They are usually household names.  When is it intended to publish those figures pertaining to 2021?  Considering the discussion we have had about RT&Eacute;'s precarious financial situation, have there been negotiations with the highest earners to reduce their level of remuneration?</p></speech>

We outlined in the 2019 strategy that we were seeking a reduction of 15% in that number and that has been achieved for 2020 and also for 2021.  In respect of the publication of the 2020 numbers, they are still being audited.  Once they are available, which we hope will be in the coming month, we will publish them.  Our obligation is that we publish two years in arrears, so we will be publishing the 2020 numbers as soon as we can.</p></speech>

We are carrying out some upgrade works.  We need more modern studios, more radio studios.  In fact, they are in the process of being finalised at the moment so we will have some new studios in what we call the TV building.  They will be visual radio studios so will allow both audio and video to come from the same studio, which we do not have right now.</p> <p>  As we go forward we have to assess, I suppose, what work that Radio Centre will need in terms of further future proofing.  A lot of the infrastructure is very old hence we are upgrading the studios in a different place.  The future use of it will be determined as we go forward in that face.  It is a core part of RT&Eacute;.</p> <p>  As the Deputy said, studio 1 is unique.  It plays a very big role for the orchestra and I do not see that changing, certainly in the short term.</p></speech>

We have many radio shows that come from there.  We have "The Today Show" and we have a lot of other shows that come out of there.  So, it certainly is important to us to remain in Cork.  Again, like all of our infrastructure, we have to review it.  Is the building fit for purpose?  Again, there is analysis going on on that one.  We are certainly not leaving Cork any time soon.</p></speech>

By and large, there was some good coverage and the programme was informative, particularly for a young audience.  There was fairly balanced coverage but I have two little criticisms.</p><p>First, on the re-enactment of the media coverage around the signing of the treaty, I query the setting.  Mr. David McCullagh did very well but he was in a very modern studio and more modern than the one we are in now.  The programme did not catch the atmosphere as well as it could have because a modern studio was used.  However, in general, the content was good.</p><p>I have another small criticism or suggestion as last weekend the programme was repeatedly broadcast.  I received a number of complaints and phone calls that the programme was repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>on the RT&Eacute; channels as a commemoration of the weekend when British troops left Ireland.  That was inaccurate in the sense that, obviously, for the people who live in the North they know that British troops have not left Ireland.  People currently, looking back over the last four decades, have lived in one of the most militarised parts of the world.  I am just pointing out that there was a huge inaccuracy.  In the round I can say that the coverage was good.  In future it is important that RT&Eacute; is mindful that when talking about Ireland there are 32 counties on the island.</p><p>As no members have indicated a wish to comment then that concludes questions.  I thank Ms Forbes and her staff from RT&Eacute; and all the witnesses from the Department for joining us today.  I thank all of them for the work involved in preparing for this meeting and the substantial documentation that was supplied prior to this meeting was useful.  I also thank the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, and the staff for attending and assisting with today's committee meeting.</p><p>Is it agreed to request the clerk to the committee to seek any follow-up information and carry out any agreed actions arising from this meeting?  Agreed.  Is it also agreed that we note and publish the opening statements and briefings provided for today's meeting?  Agreed.</p><p>The meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts is suspended until 1.30 p.m. when the committee will resume in public session to consider correspondence and any other business of the committee.</p></speech>

We will go into private session before adjourning.  The first item is the minutes of the meeting from 16 December, which have been circulated to members.  Do members wish to raise any matters relating to those minutes?  If not, are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  As usual, the minutes will be published on the committee's website.</p> <p>  The second item relates to accounts and financial statements.  At this point we usually consider accounts and financial statements but as these are derived from the Order Paper of the D&aacute;il, which returned yesterday, we will resume consideration of accounts and financial statements next week on 27 January.</p> <p>  We can move to correspondence.  As previously agreed, items not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated.  Decisions taken by the committee relating to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee meetings and published on the committee's website.  The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers and follow-up of Committee of Public Accounts meetings.</p> <p>  The first is No. 967B is from Mr. Ken Spratt, Secretary General at the Department of Transport, dated 9 December 2021.  It provides the information we requested during our meeting with representatives of the Department on 11 November.  We held this over from our previous meeting in December because there is a substantial amount of information in it.  The detailed response runs to 22 pages and addresses 19 specific requests for information across a wide range of areas, including the operation of the port tunnel, the number of electric vehicles in the State and steps towards the 2030 targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport by 51%.  Before I open this to debate on the floor, I should say that it is proposed to note and publish this correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  This has been flagged for discussion by me and Deputies Catherine Murphy, Matt Carthy and Imelda Munster.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-20a.389" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022012000002#Z00300"><p>I will probably hold off on making a contribution on this because we will have representatives of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the National Transport Authority, NTA, before us and some of the information would be useful in that regard.  On that basis, this item is fine.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-20a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022012000002#Z00400"><p>As Deputy Murphy has said, we will have those witnesses before us in the next fortnight so I can raise any matters then.</p></speech>

I am not sure if he is on the call.  I have a similar perspective.  There is much information in this and we will have representatives from the NTA before us, with representatives from TII in the following week.  It would be better to deal with some of the points in it then.  We will send a response to the correspondence and bring to the Department's attention that matters in the correspondence will be raised at that committee hearing.</p> <p>  No. 968B is from Mr. Eamonn Quinn, head of the major capital projects unit at the Department of Health, dated 10 December 2021.  It concerns information requested by the committee relating to the national paediatric hospital.  The substantive response to this query was provided by the national paediatric hospital development board back in December and it was No. R0974.  It was circulated for that meeting because it was relevant.  It is proposed that we note and publish the item before us today from the Department of Health.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Again, this has been flagged for discussion by me and Deputies Cormac Devlin and Catherine Murphy.  As Deputy Devlin is not on the call, I call Deputy Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-20a.392" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022012000002#Z00600"><p>Essentially, what we have been told is that the Secretary General will not be engaging further on this and the national paediatric hospital will deal with us if we have queries.  The Department of Health is not a disinterested party, however, and if there are escalating costs, they will come through in the budget at the Department of Health.  I want to flag this and none of us will be fobbed off with an argument that this is nothing to do with the Department of Health.  At the end of the day, that is where the Vote will be relating to any escalation in cost.  When we engaged on this before Christmas, it was very clear that the &euro;1.7 billion cost may not stay at that.</p></speech>

Of course, we will get the information from whatever source we can but we must be confident there will be robust oversight by the lead Department.  On a number of occasions we have discussed the huge increases in costs of which we have already become aware.  We are now in a position where it seems neither the board nor the Department can provide us with an estimated final cost for this project.  Therefore, Deputy Murphy's point is absolutely valid and we should follow up on it.</p> <p>  I apologise for coming in late but I take it the committee has dealt with the correspondence from the Department of Transport.  If it has, I ask for us to return to it briefly in order to make a point.</p></speech>

My point relates to the figures we have seen on the targets for electrification of passenger cars.</p><p>Obviously, there is a broader debate about our climate action obligations and that is all well and good, but the Committee of Public Accounts will have to have a view over a period, including with a review of this in the form of a report at some stage with regard to the value for money of this aspect.  There is a suggestion that, between 2025 and 2030, 670,000 electric cars will be sold, a key plank of our climate action targets.  That suggests that 134,000 cars will be sold on average every year.  Given the total number of all cars sold in 2019 was 117,000, there are questions as to whether that will be possible.</p><p> Even if it is possible - I return to the issue of value for money - the information we have on where electric vehicles are being purchased suggests they are being purchased predominantly in areas that are well serviced by public transport.  There are up to 46,000 electric vehicles on our roads and 21,000 of them are based in Dublin.  If that trend continues, we will be subsidising the provision of new cars in areas where there is adequate public transport - I am not saying that cannot be improved; of course it can - to the detriment of areas in more rural-based counties that have virtually no public transport.  Over the coming months, this committee will have to have a view on the value for money, where money is being expended and whether it is delivering for the taxpayer, as well as whether it is helping us to achieve our climate action obligations, something other committees will deal with the specifics of.</p></speech>

It will involve about 80,000 or 90,000 electric cars being sold each year.</p></speech>

From 2025 to 2030, the figure will increase to 845,000 vehicles, or an average of 134,000 per year in those five years.</p></speech>

In County Laois, only 210 electric vehicles were purchased last year, while the figure for County Offaly was 167 and that of County Monaghan was low as well.  I suggest we write to the Department of Transport to highlight the point.  The difference between the number sold in Dublin compared with that in the more rural counties jumped out to me as well.  Even the figure for County Cork, a very large county, is relatively low, with a total of fewer than 5,000.</p> <p>  If the committee agrees, we will write to the Department of Transport to ask about the cost of the subsidy and the fact that - this is not to penalise anyone in Dublin - it seems lopsided that the bulk of the funding and subsidies would go to the people who have the shortest journeys, while those who have the longest journeys are stuck with diesel or petrol.  There is a total of 21,519 electric vehicles in Dublin, which is obviously good but the same is not happening throughout the country.  If the committee agrees, we will write to the Department of Transport to seek figures on that.  We need also to ask about the first point the Deputy made, regarding how the figures will be met.  The average over the seven-year period, and particularly the increase over the final four years, as he pointed out, seems unachievable given the number of new-car sales in the State.  Is that agreed?</p></speech>

The committee might carry out long-term work on the value-for-money aspect of the State or Exchequer subsidising somebody who, perhaps, has access to public transport to purchase a brand new car while people in other parts of the country cannot afford a brand new car and have no access to public transport.  They are, essentially, paying towards those new vehicles.  In the context of our remit to ensure value for money, it is something that warrants work on our part.</p></speech>

I agree that work needs to be carried out.</p> <p>  To return to the correspondence relating to the national paediatric hospital, there was a substantive response, which members will see in their copy of the correspondence, from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board in December, namely, No. R0974.  I agree the response from the Department of Health is disappointing, which is the best I can say about it.  If members agree, particularly those who raised the issue, I propose we write back to the Department of Health to express our disappointment with the response and to point out, as members have said, that the Department is not just a bystander in this but rather is the line Department with responsibility for the matter.  We might ask it for a comprehensive response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 970B, from Ms Aileen Healy, director of administration in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, dated 14 December 2021, is a response to correspondence the committee received from the Department of Justice regarding GSOC's resourcing.  Members may recall this being raised last year.  GSOC remains concerned regarding its workload but is working with the Department to ensure it has the resources to deal with its increasing workload and the draft policing, security and community safety Bill, which, if enacted, will increase its workload.  The correspondence also addresses an industrial relations dispute in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its impact on GSOC's work.  The committee considered the information provided on a confidential basis in respect of that dispute from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in December.  GSOC is on our draft work programme for early this year.  It is proposed to note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  This item was raised by me and Deputies Devlin and Catherine Murphy.</p></speech>

This is not the first time we have had something drawn to our attention by GSOC or Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring, who gave us quite a lengthy response on a previous occasion.  A couple of paragraphs in the response before us are of concern.  GSOC is being reformed and we are told in the reply it is important to note this level of resourcing will allow GSOC to deal only with the current workload under the existing legislation.  It goes on to state these resourcing levels do not take into account the additional requirements consequent on the intended transition to the successor complaints body provided for in the draft policing, security and community safety Bill.  That is pretty serious stuff, given we know there are already significant delays and backlogs.  While it is positive that resources are being allocated to deal with that, we need that successor organisation to be fit for purpose.</p><p>We are being told that the resources are not being provided to do that.  We should express our concern to the Department of Justice on that.  I do not believe that we can criticise an organisation in the full knowledge that we know it is not being resourced.</p><p> My second point is about the pay dispute involving the senior Garda officers.  On the last page of this reply we are being told that senior Garda officers have withdrawn from work they consider outside their core duties.  Can we check with GSOC whether this is deemed to be a core duty, and if this is something they are obliged to do?  I do not see how GSOC can function without this co-operation.  I believe that this dispute has been going on since last July.  We must check again with the Department of Justice exactly what exactly is the plan of action to deal with this, and to find out if this is regarded as a core duty.</p></speech>

Aileen Healy, the director of administration in GSOC stated: "We have been informed that, since July 2021, as result of a dispute over pay and allowances, some senior Garda officers have withdrawn from work they consider outside their core duties."  The question arises as to whether some Garda officers were not taking that line.  We do not know.  The reply also states: "Such duties include the investigation of complaints referred to them by GSOC under section 94 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005."  It is very serious if complaints that have been referred to the senior garda&iacute; to investigate are not being investigated.  Even more serious is the following statement: "These are complaints involving alleged breaches of discipline and do not include criminal allegations."  If senior garda&iacute; are refusing to investigate complaints alleging breaches of discipline, that would be a very serious matter.  Deputy Murphy has suggested that we write to GSOC to ask if this is correct and if these duties are outside the core work, which would be surprising.  We will see what GSOC has to say about that.  We will seek that clarification from the ombudsman.</p> <p>  Deputy Devlin is not with us.  Is it agreed to that we should seek that clarification?  Agreed.</p></speech>

Every group of workers is fully entitled to take industrial action.  I do not believe there is anything that we would like to do to undermine the workers' rights to take industrial action, but it is my understanding that there are other implications.  For example, the appointment of sergeants in the force is also being impacted by this.  Perhaps we should also seek information from the Minister for Justice on the matter.</p></speech>

When I see the term "consider outside their core duties", I am a little concerned about that and whether people are defining what are core duties and what are not.  We will seek the Secretary General's take on it, and GSOC.  Deputy Carthy wants to come in on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-01-20a.411" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2022012000002#BB00700"><p>I agree with everything that has been said.  I believe the dispute is incredibly serious.  Of course, any group of workers can take a stand when required, but essentially we have an indication from GSOC that senior garda&iacute; are refusing to engage with it on alleged breaches of discipline within the force.  I concur entirely with Deputy Murphy that this would put a serious question over how GSOC can operate in those instances.  I agree with everything that has been said, including Deputy McAuliffe's proposal that we would seek clarification from the Department.  While the Department is probably aware of this, I suggest that we share this correspondence with the Oireachtas justice committee, which clearly has a role in the operation of this matter.  Given the overall tenor of the correspondence in considering the challenges that have been outlined by GSOC around to its ability to do its work in an effective and timely manner, as a result of the increasing complaints and other issues, we need to bring its officials before this committee as quickly as possible to tease these matters out.  I am often critical of GSOC and the way it does its work, but these delays have a real impact.  When GSOC spends several years investigating a particular complaint, it has wider implications.  I have previously referred to the case of Shane O'Farrell.  The time that GSOC took to carry out its investigation meant that every other agency and individual involved was able to say: &quot;We cannot deal this because GSOC is conducting an inquiry.&quot; This led to several years where, essentially, nothing happened in the family's pursuit for justice.  We learned last week through <i>The</i><i>Sunday Times</i>Ireland journalist, Mark Tighe, that in the findings of GSOC in that case, the Garda Commissioner had revoked the findings of negligence in respect of two of the three garda&iacute; who were cited.  That report was telling in its omissions as opposed to its findings, and yet even those findings have not been implemented.  These delays have real impacts on real people, real cases and the real pursuit of truth and justice.  We need to pursue this matter further.  When we are dealing with our committee work plan I will urge that we expedite our hearing with GSOC.</p></speech>

I am wondering if, with the agreement of my colleagues and the Chairman, we can ask the Department for further clarification on questions Nos. 3 and 4 and whether there is an obligation for specific reference to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Circular 13/2014.  We should ask how the Department has asked questions and satisfied itself that An Taisce is fully compliant with that circular.  It seems that the Department has merely said it accepts the response from An Taisce.  That is my interpretation and I am open to correction on that and to guidance from the Chairman.  I would like to interrogate that further to satisfy my mind.</p></speech>

The Secretary General stated:</p> <blockquote> 	there are robust arrangements in place to monitor funding from the Department to An Taisce and to ensure that such funding is in compliance with the conditions of Circular 13/2014.  This includes service level agreements, ongoing engagement, reporting and vouched expenditure. </blockquote> <p>I am still not satisfied that the 2019 accounts were as they should have been.

There is clearly a policy issue here.  We can see that some counties are being particularly badly served in terms of foreign direct investment, FDI.  My home county of Monaghan, across 2019 and 2020, saw the creation of an additional ten jobs through FDI, which compares badly to almost every other county, notwithstanding those that suffered significant job losses.  An additional ten jobs is a dismal return.  There is a wider issue around the regional breakdown of the creation of jobs.  Government representatives all always at pains to say that two thirds of jobs created by the IDA are outside Dublin.  That still means that one third of all FDI employment is in one county and regardless of whether that county contains our capital city, it still points to a strategy that is badly balanced in regional terms.  I look forward to dealing with that matter further when representatives of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment are before us again.  Is the IDA under the auspices of the Comptroller and Auditor General?</p></speech>

It is new information for us to learn that the IDA had engagement, face-to-face meetings, in relation to some of these companies.  I presume the desktop evaluation was the only evaluation the HSE did.  Presumably the HSE had engagement with the IDA on that if they met directly.  There was one transaction that has been very problematic and did not work out.  It is difficult to see how due diligence was carried out on that.  Maybe we need to check what dialogue the HSE had with the IDA about that particular transaction, which we talked about, in regard to the ventilators.</p></speech>

We were previously told that the IHRB had given an undertaking to complete it prior to the commencement of the 2022 season.  At that time, I got the impression that it would be good to go for January.  We were previously told that it would be completed by the end of 2021 and that was when the tender was at an early stage.  I read recently that the IHRB was complaining about the use of drones and people live-streaming races and that sort of thing.  People can set up personal streams for races using drones.  Yet, the IHRB cannot organise installing cameras in 25 sites.  It seems to be the case that the IHRB is prolonging the situation.  I do not find this acceptable and I would like that expressed to the IHRB.  Can we write to the board about the constant delay?  It is hard to fathom at this stage.  Each time the IHRB was before the committee it gave a commitment that it would be ready, there was no issue with it and it was only too happy to do this and all this sort of thing.  It is delay after delay.</p></speech>

We can request that.  There are 25 tracks.  Two were not provided.  It defies me as to why it is taking so long.  We will seek an explanation for the delays.  We will outline our concerns about the ongoing delays and ask for a timeline for putting cameras in place and the progress in that regard.</p> <p>  No. 1008B is from Mr. Maurice Buckley, chairman, Office of Public Works, dated 12 January 2022, providing one of the quarterly updates requested by the committee in relation to negotiations regarding Miesian Plaza, Baggot Street.</p><p>The chairman states: "Discussions are now at a critical stage in terms of reaching a solution that is acceptable to both parties.&rdquo;  It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence.

It is an important update to recognise given the discussions we have had with the OPW on this previously.  If I am not mistaken, it was December of 2020 that we were told there would be a resolution to this early in the new year and, obviously, Covid-19 got in the way of that.  It is in all our interests that this issue be resolved as soon as possible.  It looks like there seems to be a resolution now, which is to be welcomed.</p></speech>

The Chairman mentioned that it will require goodwill.  It will also require common decency.  The State is overpaying, essentially, and, at the end of the day, the people who foot the bill for that are ordinary workers and taxpayers.  We need to continue to monitor this because, as Deputy Devlin said, this has gone on quite a bit longer than any of us would have expected or liked.</p></speech>

There is a bit of good news there, hopefully.</p> <p>  We will move onto category C, correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence.  No. 1001C is from our own Deputy Paul McAuliffe, dated 3 January 2022, and requests that the committee makes inquiries with the HSE regarding media reports that it bought a building adjoining Beaumont Hospital for &euro;800,000 more than its asking price when it was listed on the market six months ago.  Does the Deputy wish to speak to this?  He is not present.  To be fair to him, we can hold this until next week and take it then.</p> <p>  No. 1006C, from an individual, dated 17 December 2021, is further correspondence to the committee regarding Screen Ireland.  I propose that the Committee of Public Accounts requests Screen Ireland to provide details of any loan payments it has made to the board of Screen Ireland from 2017 to present and to clarify its oversight and governance of the arrangement.  It should provide details of any loan payments it has made or committed to applicants or members of the board.  It is proposed to advise the correspondent of this and to clarify that the committee does not have a role in legislation or policy and that he might wish to consider contacting the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media in that regard.  Are the proposals agreed to?  Agreed.  It is really for that committee.  This was flagged by Deputy Munster.</p></speech>

Certainly, when I looked at the financial statements, there is a board member who is associated with companies that has received very significant levels of grant funding.  As to whether there was anything missing from previous correspondence, I would need to do an exercise.  I am willing to do that and perhaps come back to the committee on the next occasion regarding this item.  If the Deputy wants to hold it until then, I can give her a fuller response.</p></speech>

There should be procedures in place whereby they are not involved in the decision-making.  To my mind, however, it is something that has to be managed very carefully.  It is important that there are full declarations of interest and so on in advance and that there is not any potential for influence over the allocation of resources.</p></speech>

The site is proposed to be used for the expansion of Beaumont Hospital.  I have a few concerns around it.  I would like the HSE to respond to the suggestions made in the article, and to the concern that public money was allocated to the purchase of a site which might in all likelihood be very well placed to serve as an expansion of the hospital site.</p> <p>  The difficulty is that it is currently zoned for housing by the local authority.  The question is whether it will require a change of use.  Has there been any interaction with the local authority on that?  Were there any interactions in advance of the purchase of the site?  There are a number of questions on which the committee could benefit from receiving answers from the HSE in advance of us pursuing the overall issue any further.  I ask that we get the HSE to respond to the article and to the idea that the site is currently zoned for housing.</p></speech>

Rezoning may not be the problem but the cost might be.  I thank the Deputy.  We will seek that information.</p> <p>  We will move onto the work programme.  Over the next two weeks, we are scheduled to engage with the National Transport Authority, NTA, and the following week then with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to examine their respective financial statements for 2020.</p> <p>  The NTA and TII were both advised that the following matters are of particular interest to the committee: the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area; expenditure on MetroLink, BusConnects, the all-island strategic rail review, and DART expansion and underground; and public private partnerships, PPP.</p> <p>  If anybody has any other issues they wish to raise, they should flag it up with the clerk to the committee today or by tomorrow at the latest.  People should really have a fortnight to give them time to prepare.  Obviously, when witnesses come in, members start thinking of issues they perhaps want to raise.  I ask members to give that a bit of thought in the meantime.  I suggest, perhaps, that the ask for TII is to put the Ballybrophy to Limerick rail line on the agenda and that we discuss with the NTA its correspondence regarding its purchase of buses to serve bus routes.</p> <p>  Other than the all-island strategic rail review, which is the responsibility of the Department of Transport, all of this falls within the NTA&rsquo;s remit.</p><p>On that basis, I propose to engage with the NTA first.  Is it agreed that we engage with the NTA next week on 27 January and the TII the following week on 3 February?  It is a better follow-on order.  Agreed.</p><p> As set out in R0989, the TII does not have responsibility for the areas listed, other than public-private partnerships, and is the sponsoring authority for the MetroLink.  If there are other areas of interest to members, they should please let the clerk know so that the TII can be made aware and be asked to provide a briefing before the meeting.</p><p> On 10 February, we are scheduled to examine the expenditure of the national broadband plan with National Broadband Ireland, NBI, and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  As agreed on 25 November, we have a series of housing-related meetings scheduled after that with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Residential Tenancies Board and Home Building Finance Ireland.  To allow for arrangements to be made, is it agreed to proceed with those meetings, which will take us up to the first week in March?  Agreed.</p><p> Does anyone wish to raise any other matter in respect of the work programme?  It is important that we plan in good time so that not only do the bodies and witnesses being called before us have the time to gather their information together, but members themselves can flag items.  It also assists the secretariat in planning the work programme.</p></speech>

The CEO's starting salary was initially set at &euro;137,356.  Reportedly, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine successfully advocated in favour of a salary and car allowance worth in excess of &euro;203,000.  This is a matter of public interest.  HRI receives a substantial package of taxpayer funding annually.  Therefore, it is imperative that we get a sense of the basis on which this decision was made.</p></speech>
