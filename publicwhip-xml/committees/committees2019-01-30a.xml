It is proposed that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation to the petitioner and close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P00046/18.  It is proposed that we correspond with the Department of Justice and Equality seeking an update on this issue when work is finalised and leave the petition open.  We will forward a copy of the reply from the Department to the petitioner and inform her that we are leaving the petition open.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

The visa is issued to the spouses or partners of workers who have come to Ireland in response to a critical skills shortage and are effectively facilitating the growth of our economy and in many ways keeping the economy going.  There is a very strong case for allowing those with a stamp 3 visa the right to work without having to go through the work permit system.</p><p>That would do justice to the families coming to Ireland and remove some of the related burden from the work permit system.  I agree with the recommendation of the committee that we should keep the petition open.  I note that the responses from the two Departments involved in this matter have been quite positive in terms of seeking to do something about it.  It is important that the committee maintains its interest in this petition.</p></speech>

I am happy to await the update from the Department.  It would be appropriate for the committee to keep the petition open on that basis.  I think we are agreed on that.  I acknowledge the visitors in the Public Gallery who I understand may be guests of Deputy Brendan Ryan.</p> <p>  The final petition for consideration is Petition No. P00048/18 relating to motor tax issues.  It is proposed that we forward a copy of the response from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to the petitioner and close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the non-publication of the operational review report on the Oberstown Children Detention Campus.  In the first session today, the committee will hear from the authors of the report, Professor Barry Goldson and Professor Nick Hardwick.</p><p>In the second session the committee will hear from the chairperson of the board of management of Oberstown Children Detention Campus, Professor Ursula Kilkelly.<br/><br/>I would like to advise the members of the committee that while there have been reports in the media in connection with the operational review, it is important to note that the committee cannot discuss individual cases and members should avoid naming individuals, whether those names are in the public domain or not.  It is also important that we do not discuss anything which is likely to be the subject of court proceedings.  Members are reminded that there are ongoing legal cases and they should avoid saying anything that could have an impact on these cases or be seen to interfere with them in any way.  Members are advised that the contents of the operational review report cannot be discussed and that they should be mindful of the legal issues surrounding the report.<br/><br/>I welcome Professor Barry Goldson, who is a PhD and is the Charles Booth chair of social science in the department of sociology, social policy and criminology in the school of law and social justice at the University of Liverpool; and Professor Nick Hardwick of the school of law at Royal Holloway, University of London.  I thank the professors for appearing before us this morning.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the joint committee.  If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>The opening statements will be published on the website of this committee after the meeting.  I understand that witnesses will make a short presentation, followed by questions from members of the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Barry Goldson" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019013000002#C00200"><p>I will make a short statement on behalf of us both.  We welcome the opportunity to address the committee.  Members will appreciate that it is impractical for us to attempt to cover every aspect of the events that have unfolded in the past two years.  Instead, we will aim to capture the key issues and will provide the committee with a more detailed written statement that we have entitled: Synopsis of the Operational Review of Oberstown.<br/><br/>In September 2016 we were appointed to undertake an operational review of Oberstown, in recognition of our international expertise in the fields of youth justice and penal detention.  The operational review took place against a backdrop of substantial change and during a period of acute instability at Oberstown.  The terms of reference for the operational review are attached as an appendix to our written statement.<br/><br/>The core aims of the review were threefold.  First was to evaluate practice and policy in line with international standards and best practice principles.  Second was to identify obstacles or barriers to achieving greater implementation of international standards and best practice, and the third was to make recommendations to ensure greater and more successful implementation of these standards.<br/><br/>On 10 October 2016 we sent a detailed memorandum to the chair of the Oberstown board of management setting out our understanding of the operational review, indicating the design and methodology that we intended to adopt in order to undertake it and identifying the key data and information that we planned to examine.  The design and methods of the operational review are elaborated at paragraphs 8 to 12 of the written statement and the memorandum is provided as an appendix to the same statement.<br/><br/>In the time available, the design, methods and data analysis were rigorous and robust.  Throughout the entire process of designing, undertaking and reporting the operational review, we consulted consistently and closely with the chair of the Oberstown board of management and the director.  Illustrative detail is set out at paragraphs 15 to 32 of our submission to this committee.  At no time prior to the submission of our report did either the chair of the board of management or the director raise any concerns with us about any aspect of the review process.  On 24 February 2017 we submitted to the chair of the Oberstown board of management what we considered to be the final version of our report, together with nine annexes and a summary report.  In the same correspondence, we provided a document tabulating, in forensic detail, how we had responded to the written feedback on earlier drafts of the report offered by the chair of the Oberstown board of management and a further document offering similarly detailed explanation as to how we had responded to the director&rsquo;s written feedback.<br/><br/>The body of the report comprises 285 substantive paragraphs, extending over 67 pages, and it includes 95 recommendations.  The body of the report does not identify named individuals other than the chair of the Oberstown board of management and the director.  We do not believe that there are any other individuals who can be personally identified in the report whose role is subject to direct or implied criticism.<br/><br/>On 13 March 2017 we received a written communication from the chair of the Oberstown board of management in which she stated, &quot;I have formed the view that legal opinion may be necessary prior to publication&quot;.  On 17 March 2017 we submitted our report to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs as we were obliged to do in accordance with our terms of reference.  On 29 May 2017 we were informed by the chair of the Oberstown board of management that the board had decided not to publish our report in light of unspecified legal opinion.  The chair confirmed that the intention was to publish the report's recommendations as a standalone document.<br/><br/>On 11 June 2017 we wrote to the chair of the board of management expressing our concern and disappointment regarding the decision not to publish, pointing out that this was contrary to the explicit written undertaking to publish and disseminate the report that we had been working with from the outset, recalling the detailed processes of consultation and accuracy checking that we had engaged in throughout the process, restating our belief that the publication of the report would enable progress at Oberstown and serve the public interest, objecting to the publication of our recommendations abstracted from the underpinning context and rationale that is presented in the body of the report and pointing out that to do so would be misleading and, finally, stating that we would be willing to consider redactions to the report in light of legal advice, but that we would first prefer to see the advice that might be deemed to make redactions necessary.  Notwithstanding this, the recommendations were published but, as members will be aware, the report is yet to be published.<br/><br/>On 19 March 2018, a year after we first submitted our report to the Minister, we wrote to the Minister asking to be informed of progress being made towards publishing the report.  We were aware that the Minister had appeared before this committee on 24 January 2018 when she reported that she was about to &quot;seek additional advice to ensure due process has been completed&quot;.  The Minister assured the committee that &quot;when that happens, I will ask for the report to be published&quot;.<br/><br/>On 12 July 2018 we received a letter from the Minister that included the statement: &quot;I consider that it would be misleading to publish the report now, having regard to progress that has been achieved in the interim&quot; and the statement that:</p><blockquote>I have sought assurance from the Board that it is satisfied that fair procedures were applied.  The Board has not been in a position to provide such assurances to me to date.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to publish the full report.</blockquote> <p>In the period between the time that we first submitted our report and the Minister's appearance before this committee on 18 December 2018, four quite different rationales for non-publication have been mooted and it is our submission to the committee that each is flawed.</p><p>First, there has been reference to legal opinion and risk.  The precise nature of such risk has never been made clear to us, however, and we have never had sight of the legal opinion.  At the point when we submitted our report, our reading was such that four of the 285 substantive paragraphs might need to be redacted in view of legal cases that were ongoing at that time.  In fact, we suggested redacting the four paragraphs in correspondence with the chairperson of the Oberstown board of management as early as 25 February 2017.</p><p> The second reason for non-publication refers to due process and fair procedures.  At various points the Minister has referred to concerns regarding due process and fairness, most recently during her appearance before this committee on 18 December 2018.  Taking account of the fastidious attention that we applied to processes of consultation and factual accuracy in undertaking the operational review and in preparing the report, we find it difficult to understand the basis of such concern.  Furthermore, we have not been provided with any specific instances or examples where we have allegedly compromised due process or fair procedures.</p><p> The third point relates to the passage of time and progress that has been made at Oberstown since we undertook the operational review.  It almost goes without saying that we welcome the news that progress has been made at Oberstown.  We note the Minister's submission to this committee on 18 December 2018 in which she reported that the recommendations that we made following the operational review have been at the kernel of such progress.  Nonetheless, we strongly believe that our report should be published, whether or not the situation at Oberstown has improved.  We do not believe the right lessons will be learnt by the many individuals and organisations who are involved in the campus unless there is a full understanding of what has happened in the past.  Moreover, we note that alongside positive signifiers of progress contained within the HIQA report published in October 2018, following its unannounced inspection in March 2018, the same report provides that child protection requires some action and that care of children, planning for children, premises safety and security as well as staffing and management require priority action to mitigate the non-compliance and ensure the safety, health and welfare of the children using the service.  Such observations resonate strongly with the serious concerns that we raise in our report of the operational review.</p><p> The fourth and final point relates to straying from the remit.  In appearing before this committee on 18 December 2018, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs claimed that our report strays from or over-extends the specified remit of the operational review.  She referred to the fact that we make recommendations that pertain to national policy and, as such, are beyond the immediate powers and responsibilities of the Oberstown board of management.  Yet, it would have been impossible to undertake a robust operational review without situating Oberstown within the wider context of national youth justice legislation and policy.  Moreover, from the outset we made it clear to the chairperson of the board of management and the director that we would be considering the wider national policy context as part of the operational review.  This is explicitly specified in a detailed memorandum that we sent to the chairperson of the board of management on 10 October 2016.  We have attached the memorandum as an appendix to our more detailed written submission to the committee.  At no time was it ever suggested that taking account of national policy issues lay outside the terms of reference.</p><p> We strongly believe that the rationale for each of the four reasons for non-publication was seriously flawed and that our report of the operational review of Oberstown should be published for at least four principal reasons.  The first is to honour the terms of contract issued to us before we undertook the review.  The second is to provide transparency and accountability.  The third is to serve the public interest and the common good.  The fourth is to enable learning.</p><p> I wish to be absolutely clear.  Our unwavering objective has always conformed to the conception of the operational review as a supportive developmental process framed within the context of international standards and principles of best practice.  We can only reiterate our concern to the committee that the right lessons will not be learnt by the many individuals and organisations who are involved in Oberstown unless there is a full understanding of what happened in the past.  We believe that such understanding can only be realised by publishing our report.</p><p> Article 9 of the terms of contract that we were issued with at the outset of the operational review provides that all disputes between the board and the consultant as regards the application of the contract shall be submitted to arbitration if a mutual agreement cannot be reached between the parties.  If the decision not to publish our report continues to stand, we appear to have reached a point where mutual agreement cannot be reached.  On 5 August 2018, we wrote both to the chairperson of the Oberstown board of management and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs expressing our view on invoking Article 9 of the contract and moving to arbitration.  On 12 October 2018, we received a reply from the chairperson of the Oberstown board of management declining that request.  To date, the Minister has not responded to the same request.  We have not had any further communications either to or from the chairperson of the Oberstown board of management or to or from the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Yet, we remain of the view that the report should be published and, if necessary, we remain open to the prospect of arbitration as a means of resolving a dispute that is not of our making as a mechanism for ensuring that: the terms of the contract are honoured; the imperatives of transparency and accountability are upheld; the public interest is satisfied; and the lessons that might derive from the operational review are put to best effect.</p></speech>

At no point has it been said to us that we have not fulfilled our contractual obligations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1300" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019013000002#D00800"><p>Thank you, Professor Hardwick.  That was exactly the answer I was looking for to a question I had not asked.  You have made your position clear in respect of straying into matters of policy and your interpretation of the terms of reference provided.  Do you have an understanding of the difficulty that presents in terms of what the Minister said to us in December with regard to straying from the terms?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Nick Hardwick" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019013000002#D00900"><p>I am rather surprised by that because when we made it clear what the issues we were going to look at were, it was the case that all the information we used was obtained from Oberstown itself.  Other parties could not have been confused by what we were looking at.  If we should not have looked at some of these wider policy issues, then it is surprising to me that the recommendations addressing those wider policy issues were published.  If a party can publish the recommendations, why can that party not publish the material that supports those recommendations?</p> <p>  At the request of the Minister, I had a telephone conversation with her on 21 December 2016 because she wanted a heads-up on what the review found before it was published.  At that point she specifically asked me about our views on some of the national policy issues we addressed in the report.  At no time did we get any indication that there was concern about us addressing those issues.  Of course we accept that some of those were not things that Oberstown itself could deal with, but they were altogether relevant to the difficulties that Oberstown was exposed to at that time.</p></speech>

I had many questions but many of them were answered in the submission.  The failure of Oberstown Children Detention Campus to publish this review is something that I have made my displeasure known on.  It is important that we have this review, we need to know what was going on there and we need to know what the lessons to be learned from it are.  I have a few questions around the procedure.  What sort of working relationship did Professor Goldson and Professor Hardwick have with the board during the review process?</p></speech>

Our relationship was with the chairman and the director and we met lots of staff members.  I felt we had a cordial relationship.  It was conducted on friendly terms.  If one rereads the correspondence and the memorandum it was all conducted in a friendly way.  After the report was completed we realised that they were not happy with some of what we said and we had two very lengthy meetings with them to discuss the report.  On each occasion I was looking at the emails we had sent each other and we thought that we had resolved it and sorted it out.  We are genuinely really saddened that is has come to this pass.  We do not want to be sitting in this position.  We had a cordial relationship and we thought we had a mutually supportive and constructive relationship while the review was ongoing.</p></speech>

We tried very hard to meet their concerns.  Many of their suggestions were that they wanted us to refer to policies and developments that took place after the review was completed.  We said that we were prepared to say that had happened but we could not really make an evaluation of it because we had not seen it.  I have done this a lot in other contexts and we would expect to get some facts back that we had probably not understood and there were a few of those but we were quite surprised that there was not anything substantial.  I had a conversation with Professor Kilkelly and she spoke to me about her concerns on the phone.  She said to me that the concern was not really about the factual accuracy of the report.  It was more the case that they had not expected something that would be critical in some ways.</p></speech>

It is very difficult to run these establishments.  The report points out that there are many difficulties and there are things that could be done better but I am quite surprised at their reaction.  There are issues of concern that need to be addressed however.  What is really clear to me is that simply looking at the recommendations will not help.  It has to be understood what problem the recommendation is trying to fix.</p></speech>

We were given 95 recommendations.  I will be honest that I was really concerned about some of the recommendations when I read them.  I refer to recommendation No. 82 about cavity searches.  I need to know in what context this recommendation was put in.  Since then, the board has given us information that this does not take place and so on in the context of the recommendations but I am an outsider looking in at recommendations and I do not know what they refer to.  I have to ask on the record, were the practices referred to in these recommendations in place in Oberstown when this review was being carried out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.40" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Nick Hardwick" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019013000002#E01500"><p>It has to be looked at and of course it was different in some cases.  Some were things that were being talked about.  Our view is that it should be the Oberstown board that publishes the report and we have been very consistent on that.  We will keep our side of the bargain, we will not say what is in the report until it is released and I would not want to do that.  I will say that in common with many establishments of this type, there is a distinction between what the policy is - and indeed often what managers think is happening - and what is really happening on the ground.  We found a number of examples where that difference was there.  We saw examples of what was clearly happening as opposed to what management thought was happening and there was a gap between the two.  That is certainly not a problem that is unique to Oberstown.  That is very consistent with that sort of closed establishment.  In some cases, simply saying that the response to a recommendation is that a policy on X will be produced does not really address the issue unless what was not happening before is clear and is accepted in order to be able to do something different in the future that will address the issue.  Quite often, what is happening in Oberstown was that the written policies were great but that was not what we found to actually be happening on the ground.</p></speech>

Professor Goldson and Professor Hardwick have indicated that they were not allowed back to debrief the staff and it is really important that the staff in Oberstown are supported and know what was going on.  Were they given any reason?</p></speech>

A series of delays are outlined in our written submission to the committee that were pursuant to the chairman of the board of management and the director wanting additional time.  The date that was originally scheduled to return to campus and meet with the staff had to be pushed back.  At the point at which we submitted the report, it was very clear that the chairman of the board and the director were raising issues so that raised the question of what would be reported back.  We kind of assumed that we would be able to report back on what was contained within the report but if the report was effectively being suppressed, it would be difficult to address the staff group.  We retain that commitment, however, and we have stated that on several occasions in writing.  If I may say so, that includes on 17 March 2017 when we wrote to the Minister, restated our commitment to return and said that we were awaiting an invitation to do so.  That invitation has never been forthcoming.  An event was organised by Oberstown in May 2017 in which the report was discussed with various stakeholders across the country but we were not invited to attend that event.</p></speech>

They have not had that opportunity.</p> <p>  The witnesses undertook a root-and-branch review in Oberstown.  They should have included policy in that if we are to learn from it.  The recommendations have no context unless there is a consideration of policy and outlining who is responsible for what.  The report contains 285 paragraphs.  Of that, perhaps four might have to be put aside for the report to be published.</p> <p>  When the authors first spoke to the Minister, she understood where they were coming from.  What was needed in Oberstown at that point was a root-and-branch review.  When the authors spoke to the Minister in December 2016, did they get the impression that this was what she wanted?  It is was what the Joint Committee had requested and what the board and the chair of Oberstown had bought into.  Had the authors any involvement with Tusla during the process?</p></speech>

I made a contemporaneous note of my conversation with the Minister.  Among the policy issues we discussed was whether in addition to Oberstown there should be some smaller units elsewhere for some of the most vulnerable children.  We discussed the use of remand, the moving of 17 year olds who were not in Oberstown then- I am not sure if this has happened since - and the detention of girls.  All those were national policy issues.  The Minister also spoke to me about governance structures within Oberstown.  We had quite a wide discussion.  She wanted to know what the review would say and we discussed some of the things that were internal to Oberstown and some of the wider issues.  Not only did I not get a sense that she was surprised that we had covered that, but my sense was that she wanted to know what we thought about those issues.  For it to be said from that that it was outside our terms of reference, I do not follow that.</p> <p>  On the paragraphs that we offered to redact, something about which we were unclear from the start and we are not really clear about it now was what the legal issues were about.  It was not spelled out but our first impression was that it seemed to refer to the trials of some of the boys who had been involved in disturbances.  We recognised that perhaps we should not include that.  The paragraphs that dealt with that were the ones we thought we should take out.  Then it seemed to be about the process of consultation and whether the procedure was fair.  There seemed to be a shift in what the legal issues were but we remain unclear as to what they were.  If we knew what they were, we might be able to address them, but we do not.</p></speech>

It is quite extraordinary, and two years later we are still dealing with it.</p></speech>

We have used taxpayers' money to pay for a root-and-branch report into a unit that is supposed to look after our young people, which is also funded by taxpayers' money.  There is what may be a good piece of work that would be a valuable tool.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, report was mentioned in the opening statements and I have it before me.  There are pages where I cannot see any improvements, despite what we are led to believe.  There have been some improvements but they are not in the areas in which I would like to see them, such as mental health, pathways for children and reporting mechanisms.  Take the latest HIQA report.  Why and how was a child left in separation for 12 consecutive days?  I want to hear more of what is behind it.  Maybe the witnesses cannot tell us.  Surely if we are to move forward, the report by Professors Goldson and Hardwick would be the tool that we should use and how we gauge things.</p></speech>

People might have told us then that they did not agree with our findings and we could have discussed that.  They could have told us that we had got certain things wrong, but instead we ended up floundering around trying to guess the problem so that we could put it right, which has been very frustrating for us.  To emphasise Professor Goldson's remarks, in issues such as Oberstown, if one does not understand and accept what has gone wrong, one will not do what is necessary to put it right.  What we are interested in is putting this stuff right and learning from it.  One cannot learn if one does not accept where things have not worked as one would like.</p> <p>  I was responsible for this area in the UK and would always tell my teams that they should never forget that it is much harder to run these places than it is to monitor and evaluate them.  I accept entirely that the people running Oberstown have a very difficult job.  Our intention, and what we had hoped that we had done, was to produce something that would help them in that process.</p></speech>

At any stage of those, did either Professors Goldson or Hardwick ask if there were any problems?

There was a day-long meeting before we started the review where we discussed how we would address it.  Members will be aware that we visited Oberstown on two occasions.  Each time, at the beginning and end of the meetings, we met the chair and director.  At the beginning, we would explain what we intended to do during the period of the visit, and at the end, we would share preliminary findings and observations.  The principal message we received was that nothing that we had found was particularly surprising.  We came across some very concerning issues, but the director and the chair assured us that they were aware of them and that they were being addressed.</p> <p>  We working to a fairly compressed timeframe.</p><p>When we prepared the first draft of the report, that was submitted to the director and the chair, and we invited their comments.  We had a day-long meeting in Liverpool with all the data set out in our written documentation.  We had a day-long meeting in Liverpool with both the chair and the director in which we went through and discussed, in close detail, the report after which they submitted their comments.  We took account of those comments and provided the second draft of the report.  We had a further day-long meeting with the chair of the Oberstown board of management to discuss those.</p><p> At the end of that process, this is the second draft, we prepared our final report.  To accompany our final report, we also submitted to the chair and the director very detailed written documents explaining, in forensic detail, precisely how we had taken account of the issues that they had raised with us.  There were some relatively minor factual inaccuracies, which one might expect in a process.  They were put right and we addressed every single other point.  That is not to say we revised the report in precisely the way that was being asked of us because we were there as independent reviewers.  We were not there to collude with the process at Oberstown and those views but there was some divergence in our views.  </p></speech>

In the process of doing the review, we had this detailed discussion with them and an exchange of correspondence about what the review would cover.  Every bit of information or person we met, in the review, we arranged principally through Mr. Bergin.  So we would say to him that we would like this information or to see that person and he or his staff very efficiently arranged it for us.  At no point did they say, "Why are you seeing him or what is that about?"  For instance, there was an occasion where one of the Minister's officials wanted to meet us.  We were asked whether we wanted to meet her and we said, "Yes."  Our reply was that we did want to because we were particularly keen to discuss and deal with some of the national policy issues here.  We flagged what we were looking at and what we were doing.  There was never any suggestion that we might be going off track.  As I said, we met Mr. Bergin and Professor Kilkelly at various points in the review and told them about what we were finding.  Their view was, that it was consistent with their own concerns at that point.</p></speech>

Obviously there would have been toing and froing and inconsistencies, and they shifted.  Did that progress as things went on?  Do the witnesses know what I mean?  It has been said that things shifted.  Did the amount of those inconsistencies increase in volume or did they just move from one inconsistency to another?</p></speech>

Before calling on Deputy Clare Daly to make her contribution to the committee, I seek a further clarification.  The board has stated that they believe that fair procedures were not applied during the process of compiling the report yet I understand that the witnesses were not permitted to follow up matters with individuals cited in the report.  Have I interpreted that correctly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.66" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Nick Hardwick" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019013000002#G01300"><p>We are not clear about in what way or purpose; we do not understand what that means.  There are two things.  First, no individuals are referred to in any way that we think can be interpreted as critical in the report, apart from possibly the chair and the director, and we had detailed meetings with both of them.  If there is someone else they think might not have been given an opportunity to respond, we do not know who that person could be.  If we were told, we would be happy to consult with him or her.</p> <p>  There is a second issue.  Our contract made a commitment for us to share our findings.  It was not to consult about the report but to tell them what we had found, with the staff and other stakeholders at Oberstown.  We repeatedly said that we could not do that yet that needed to be arranged through Oberstown.  Of course we could not share our findings if our findings were not in the public domain.    </p></speech>

They have been incredibly forthright, consistent and clear in all of the reports that they have given.  In their testimony today their independence and professionalism is apparent.  Our job today is to get to the bottom of the reasons for non-publication.  As the witnesses have said, four different reasons have been given at different times, none of which stand up to much scrutiny.  We are here to scrutinise that situation but that will probably happen later in the meeting rather than now.</p> <p>  I will not repeat points that already have been made but I seek clarification on a couple of points.  A lot of play has been made about the fair procedures issue, both in the D&aacute;il Chamber and in correspondence that was released under freedom of information, FOI, legislation.  I refer to fair procedures, concerns about people having the right of reply and all that sort of stuff.  The delegation last visited Oberstown prior to publication on 8 November 2016.  Had they expressed at that stage concerns to either senior management or anybody on the board about what they had uncovered during visits?</p></speech>

They cannot have been in any doubt that we were concerned about things, and we fed back.  The visits were very concerned with the review process itself.  We did not have a very long feedback process at the end of a visit because Professor Goldson and I needed to put our heads together, go through the material and come to our conclusions.  They cannot have been in any doubt about what we were concerned about.</p></speech>

The chairperson is on record as saying that when she got the report it landed like a bombshell.  It was a total shock when she got the report.  That does not seem to tally with what the delegation present is saying.</p></speech>

The reason it was longer than they expected is because we were told, learned of and observed practices that troubled us to a significantly greater extent than what we had originally anticipated.</p></speech>

I do not think the fact that our report came as a bombshell, if it did, to people at Oberstown is a reflection on us in respect of the process of producing a report.  It is a reflection of what was happening at Oberstown.  While the chair and director told us they knew about this and that, that is a different thing.</p><p>When these things had been set out in some forensic detail, with the supporting evidence that does that, there would have been bits in that that would have made for some pretty hard reading.  I am sure about that and I am sympathetic to that.  One can sit on top of it and generally say one knows one has some problems but then something spells it out that perhaps one thought one had fixed something but it had not been fixed.  No doubt that made for some hard reading but that was not a reflection on our lack of consultation.</p></speech>

What Professor Hardwick is saying is that it could have been shocking if the people reading the report were disconnected from the reality of what was happening in the organisation.</p></speech>

One of the things I am really clear about is the quality of our methodology.  The more serious some of the concerns we identified were, the more care that we took.  We used the classic multiple evidence triangulation process.  We looked at data, at what people were saying to us, at what the boys were saying to us and at what the staff were saying to us.  We pulled the evidence and looked at what we were observing.  Some of the stuff we saw with our own eyes.  We are very confident about the accuracy of our report which is why at the end, they did not raise any significant issues of factual accuracy.  We are very clear about the accuracy of what we said.  If that came as a shock to people, that is revealing and is an issue that Oberstown needs to address.  Why did it not know this stuff, if it did not know it?  It is not a reflection on our report or on our methodology.</p></speech>

Professor Hardwick has dealt with that point very clearly.</p></speech>

While we are grateful to the committee, this is our first opportunity to put our account of what we did.</p></speech>

I do not buy that or, in any way, accept it is a reason for non-publication of something that is in the public interest.  If the work was being done, that was great.  It should be been admitted and shown.  How would Professor Hardwick respond to that view that publication would impede that good work, that the witnesses were just there for a bit during hard times and the people in Oberstown were getting down to the job of work?</p></speech>

All of that is explicitly laid out in the introduction of our operational review.  We explicitly stated that these were exceptional times.  Notwithstanding that, it is extraordinarily complacent to assume that it can all be fixed and that it has all been fixed.  I have looked at the HIQA report of three years previous to the operational review and at the HIQA reports that have been published subsequent to the operational review and there are some very consistent problems.  These are the lessons that have to be learned which we believe our report will assist in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.88" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019013000002#H01200"><p>That leads to my next question.  It was said, and was said again today by the witnesses, that the review Deputy Rabbitte referred to in 2018 resonated a lot within the report.  We have not seen the report but we are deeply concerned about what the HIQA report said.  The Minister said that HIQA report was a great success and shows the progress being made but it found that only three standards out of ten were compliant.  Five were non-compliant, including care of children, safety and security, dealing with offenders offending behaviour and staffing and management.</p> <p>  Of particular concern is that, very unusually, HIQA singled out an individual for criticism in its 2018 report.  Can the witnesses give us a bit more information on the parts of the HIQA report that resonate with theirs, without compromising information that they do not want to give us?  Does the HIQA report reassure them that the issues they flagged in 2016 have been addressed because that is critical?</p></speech>

I refer to this argument that we were only looking at what was happening in the two or three days we were there.  That is not correct.  In terms of what we observed, that was happening only when we were there but what we were getting systematically in different ways from staff, from young people and from external stakeholders was what had been happening over a period of time.  The data we examined went back over a considerable period of time so we were not simply looking at that snapshot of that particularly difficult time.  We were looking at a wider period of time, using a range of evidence, much of which was supplied by Oberstown itself, that gave us a longer term picture.  This idea that it was different the day before and the day after we were there is not correct, as the HIQA report demonstrates.</p></speech>

We have been given an impression that observations were made by the witnesses that were outside the terms of reference of the report.  What are their views on that?

We included in our submission a very detailed memorandum in which we spelled out what we would be looking at.  At no point was there any pushback.  As every bit of information we looked at was obtained through Oberstown, they knew what we were looking at.  The recommendations have been published and indeed the Minister asked me about some of those wider issues.  Personally I do not understand what that is about.  Frankly, if there is something outside the terms of reference perhaps it should be redacted.  However we cannot deal with it if we do not know what it is.</p></speech>

I answered Deputy Rabbitte's question about observations made that were outside the terms of reference and which went into policy issues.  It was not provided for Oberstown House for people to review.  People may have been named.</blockquote> <p>People are named within the report.

If we put in something which might be interpreted as a critical reference to someone that we did not understand could be interpreted that way, we would be happy to consider redacting it.

I asked her &quot;Was the process designed in such a way that if findings were made against persons or the entity, there would be a right of reply?&quot;  The Minister replied:</p><blockquote>Yes.  They were asked to provide the report for the people concerned before there was a final report.  That is what I am saying.</blockquote> <p>From what I have heard so far, the witnesses are satisfied in their own minds that this actually took place and that they openly said that if anybody wanted to discuss the findings of the report, they would make themselves available to do so. </p></speech>

The single omission to which the terms of reference refer is returning to Oberstown to share our findings with the staff and key stakeholders.  With respect, although I am happy to repeat it, we have addressed that question.</p></speech>

However, the reviewers maintain that it would not have been possible to provide feedback until the final report had been completed.  Is that what the Deputy wants to have published?  The reviewers consider it to be final.</blockquote> <p>I acknowledge the witnesses are repeating themselves.  What I am trying to reconcile is that while we have not had access to the report, we do have access to the recommendations and we know that HIQA has had access to the report and there is a process of working through it.  Ultimately all of this is to ensure that Oberstown is fit for purpose and there are robust procedures, protocols and standard operating procedures.  </p><p>If there is still a sword of Damocles hanging over Oberstown in respect of this report, we are trying to tease out the fair procedure the Minister told us about in this committee.  As she has not published the report, she must have received advices against publishing it.  We are trying to reconcile that with the fact that to our minds, the public good is not being served by not publishing the report to date. </p></speech>

If there is, we would be happy to consider that.  It is very frustrating because after we submitted the first draft of the report we had two lengthy meetings that practically lasted a full day each, first with Mr. Pat Rooney and Professor Ursula Kilkelly and then with Professor Kilkelly alone.  At no point did they say to us that our procedure was flawed and we needed to do X, Y or Z to make this a fair process.  They did not say that to us.  We got very detailed comments back from them, which were largely about post-review events, and we sent our reply.  At no point did they then say that we had not given X or Y a chance to reply.  It was only months later that this issue arose.  I should also say that we have kept every bit of correspondence.  We are happy to make any of it available to the committee if there is some doubt about what we are saying.</p></speech>

They were not saying it was all fine there.  Clearly the people with collective responsibility for Oberstown will be looking in that report and as I have said, it will make some quite uncomfortable reading.  We have not named individuals.  If I was on the board of Oberstown, my reaction would be to find it uncomfortable and I would want to quickly get to grips with trying to sort it out.</p></speech>

Professors Hardwick and Goldson are both academics and most of us in this House are not, although we have interfaced with academics.  Can the witnesses give us confidence that the methodology they used was in line with international best practice?  I am not questioning their bona fides.  There may be others who would come before this committee and question the methodology.  I want to be sure in my mind that the methodology is robust.</p></speech>

Prior to that I was Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons in England and Wales, responsible for inspecting youth custody.  The inspectorate was the lead body in the UK's national preventative mechanism, established under the optional protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which Ireland is considering.  Part of my academic work now is teaching and acting as a consultant to governments and bodies around the world on precisely these issues.  I have expertise in this, without meaning to sound boastful.  I am very confident about the process we used in this review.  Looking across the world, some of the concerns we have run into here happen elsewhere.  People think they know what is going on and they do not.  I do a lecture about the process whereby poor practice becomes normalised.  It becomes "the way we do things around here" and it takes someone from outside to say that it is not right.  There is a distinction I talk about at home about the virtual prison, by which I mean the prison the governor thinks he or she is running, and which is very different from the prison that is actually happening on the wings.  There is a distinction between the policy and what is actually happening.  When someone reads that, it can be uncomfortable if he or she is responsible.  However, those responsible will not address it unless they accept it.</p></speech>

I have been working in universities for 25 years internationally.  I have sat on review committees for research methods at very high levels in universities internationally.</p><p>If the committee requires assurance, I can give it absolute assurance that in the time that we had available, the review design, method and performance of analysis were rigorous and conformed with international standards.</p></speech>

I will go back and quote directly what the Minister said.</p><blockquote>I have indicated in terms of the legal advice as well as the experience of the board, the staff and my officials, that fair procedures were not followed.  Therefore there is a lack of fairness there, which leads to the legal risks, which is why there is not a publication.</blockquote> <p>I do not in any way wish to put words in Professor Goldson's mouth but perhaps he can enlighten us.  Does he agree with that statement?</p></speech>

We are now talking about &euro;40,000 worth of product, which has not been provided to the public.  It is perfectly justifiable for Oireachtas Members of all parties and none to be able to stand over expenditure within the Department of which we have oversight, but I cannot and I am sure that my colleagues cannot either.</p></speech>

It would be contrary to the law.  On that basis, my understanding is that the Minister has discretion, on the basis of the advice, as to whether to publish.  What we are hearing here, based on what has been an enlightening interaction with the delegates, is that there is now a clear need for the report to be published and put in the public domain so the questions that arise may be answered satisfactorily and so members of this committee can make some determination as to their interpretation of matters.</p></speech>

When the Minister was here previously, we were all very critical of the fact that the report was not before us or published.  I do not believe anybody accepted the explanation for non-publication.  That is what prompted the delegates' appearance today.</p> <p>  Citizens looking at this could certainly draw their own conclusions on why the report is not published.  It is possible that the wider public might feel something is being covered up.  We do not know that.  I am merely suggesting individuals might feel not publishing the report is to protect the wrong people, that the protection of children is being put to one side, and that the protection of those who care for children is being prioritised.  In any event, that is what someone might say.</p></speech>

As stated by Deputy Chambers, those contributions have been absolutely forthright and beneficial to our consideration.  It would be unsurprising for the delegates to hear we believe the non-publication of their report stands in the way of our performance of our function of oversight of the Oberstown campus.  Given the volume of legal advice provided to the board and Department of Children and Youth Affairs, but not to the delegates or us, the non-publication of the report presents a severe difficulty to us in the performance of our duties.  I thank the delegates for their presentations this morning.</p> <p>  I propose that we suspend for five minutes to facilitate the changing of our witnesses.  I suggest we resume at 11.20 a.m. with the chairperson of the board, Professor Ursula Kilkelly.</p></speech>

Members should not discuss anything which is or likely to be the subject of legal proceedings.  They are reminded that there are ongoing legal proceedings and that they should avoid saying anything that could have an impact on the cases involved or be seen as interfering in them in any way.  They are also advised that the operational review report cannot be discussed and that they should be mindful of the legal issues surrounding it.</p><p>I welcome Professor Ursula Kilkelly, chairperson of the board of management at Obserstown Children Detention Campus.  She is accompanied by Ms Emer Woodfull and Mr. Don O'Leary who are members of the board of management.  I welcome them and thank them for attending.  I also welcome amembers and viewers who may be watching the proceedings on Oireachtas TV.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.I advise the delegates that any submission made or opening statement submitted will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p>I remind members and delegates to switch off their mobile phones as they may interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for the parliamentary reporters to report the proceedings of the meeting.

As the Chairman knows, I have sought the invitation and I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to members about this matter.  </p> <p>  I was appointed chairperson of the board of management by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, when a new board was appointed for the amalgamated campus in June 2016.  I am a professor of law with over 20 years' experience in the areas of children's rights, youth justice and detention, in addition to my substantial academic and research experience.  I have worked for years on matters of national policy and international law and undertaken multiple research projects commissioned by national and international bodies.  I fulfil my voluntary responsibilities as chairperson of the board of management on top of my full-time university roles.  In so doing I am very grateful for the support of my employer, University College Cork.  I appear with my fellow board members, Mr. Don O'Leary and Ms Emer Woodfull.  </p> <p>  The board of management has a membership of 12 and was appointed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  It includes representatives of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, Tusla and the Department of Education and Science.  There are two elected staff nominees, two elected community representatives and five members selected following an independent process governed by the Public Appointments Service.  All members have volunteered to be of service to the Oberstown campus and the public in this role.</p><p>It is critical to state all board members have a shared commitment to the interest and welfare of young people.  They fulfil this commitment through all of their functions on the board.  In addition, many come with very substantial expertise in matters of governance, risk, law, finance and human resources.  The board is an experienced and professional body.  It operates to the highest standards of governance.  There is excellent attendance and participation by all board members at all of our monthly meetings.  Since our appointment we have supported and challenged management to provide the best possible care to young people in Oberstown on behalf of the Minister.  As the committee knows, in that time we have overseen substantial improvements in the care provided to young people and the organisation as a whole although, of course, many challenges remain.<br/><br/>When the board was appointed we were aware the process of merging three schools, in a substantial &euro;54 million building project, would be exceptionally demanding.  Industrial relations issues, which have been a feature of the schools for many years, created a challenging backdrop to the change agenda that was essential to the modernisation of the entire operation.  On my first day, I attended the Workplace Relations Commission as part of the director's efforts to resolve differences with staff.  It was in the context of this extraordinary change programme and against the backdrop of multiple other reviews that were ongoing under the WRC process, on security, health and safety, behaviour management and other matters, that the process now known as the operational review was conceived.  At the time, it was decided by the board that a facilitated review based on observation and engagement would help to move the campus forward and create a platform of engagement and discussion on how best to provide care to young people in a secure environment.  In addition to these multiple other ongoing reviews, the board took this voluntary step to commission its own review which was, as we know according to the terms of reference, designed to support the implementation of best practice to ensure Oberstown fulfils its potential to provide the best care for young people.<br/><br/>The review was designed as a supportive developmental process to enable continuing reforms to take place in line with international best practice.  We have heard the terms of reference set out.  These were to evaluate practice and policy, to identify obstacles or barriers to achieving greater implementation of standards and best practice, and to make recommendations to ensure greater and more successful implementation of the standards.  In line with the process, as a review rather than a commissioning of a report, the terms of reference explained the pattern of the process would involve observing and engaging with staff and young people, consideration of Oberstown's policies and procedures, speaking with relevant stakeholders including young people, staff, management, the board and others as required by the review, presenting findings and recommendations to staff, management and the board, and delivering a final report to the board and the Minister.  As the terms of reference made clear, the emphasis was on engaging with staff, young people and other stakeholders, considering the policy framework and reflecting this learning back to staff and management before a final report of the process was presented to the board and Minister.<br/><br/>With the appointment of the two reviewers, Professor Barry Goldson and Professor Nick Hardwick, whom I contacted as a colleague in the academic sphere, a preparatory visit took place in October with the scheduled two-day visit taking place on 7 and 8 November.  An itinerary of meetings was scheduled for the reviewers entirely at their discretion.  They were provided with extensive information on the campus, which they sought and we sought to provide.  The reviewers were free to engage with young people and staff on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis throughout their visit.  They also received emails to a confidential inbox that Oberstown established for the review.At a brief informal exit meeting with the chairperson and director the reviewers provided a summary of the issues but no formal presentation of their findings took place.<br/><br/>The first draft of the report was submitted to me at the end of November 2016.  Substantial concerns about the report were flagged to the reviewers at the time and a meeting took place between the director, myself and the reviewers in December 2016 to highlight factual inaccuracies.  A further version of the report was received just prior to Christmas 2016, and in January 2017 I again met the reviewers to seek to address the ongoing concerns with the report.  By that point, the date for the reviewers' return visit to the campus, which was envisaged as a forum to present the findings and engage with staff and the board on the issues, had passed.  To my mind, the reviewers wanted to finalise the report before undertaking the visit and, as we have heard, it has not been rescheduled.<br/><br/>The reviewers forwarded to me what they consider to be the final version of the report at the end of February, at which time it was flagged to the reviewers that legal advice would likely be required and a decision on when and in what form the report would be published would need to be determined by the board in line with its legal responsibilities.  On 9 March, the board decided to independently seek legal advice on the publication of the report and this was notified to the reviewers on 13 March.  The report was forwarded to the Minister by the reviewers on 17 March 2017.  In April, the board established a sub-committee to deal with the matter and in May the independent legal advice was received, following which we sought and received additional legal advice on the possibility of publishing a redacted version and on the management of the legal risks in dealing with the matter.  On 22 May, at a special meeting, the board decided in light of the independent legal advice not to publish the full report.<br/><br/>It is important to stress that throughout this process the board, which represents a broad cross-section of people with an extraordinary commitment to the interests of young people in Oberstown, sought to deal with the matter fairly and prudently in light of its substantial legal responsibilities to the young people in Oberstown and the staff who work there.  In light of our commitment to transparency and to reflect the important progress made since the review was commissioned, the board published recommendations of the review in July 2017 following a meticulous and detailed process that considered the implementation of each recommendation.  At the same time, the board published a summary of all of the reviews undertaken into aspects of the campus and throughout 2017 I chaired the review implementation group, which was established by the Minister, comprising representatives of staff, trade unions, the board and the Irish Youth Justice Service and an independent child welfare expert.  We collated and analysed the hundreds of recommendations that arose from all of the reviews undertaken on Oberstown throughout 2016 and 2017.  This very complex task was completed on schedule in December 2017, when, along with progress reports that were published in 2018, it was presented to the Minister and published by her.  I am very pleased to say a further progress report on the implementation of the recommendations of all of the reviews was presented to the Department in January 2019 indicating all of the relevant recommendations have now been implemented.<br/><br/>The decision not to publish the report was taken by the board following a process of exceptional care and diligence.  The decision was not one the board wanted to make.  It was its full intention to publish but, regrettably, we were left with no alternative when the serious legal risks associated with publication were brought to our attention in the form of independent legal advice.  In particular, the board was advised that placing the report in the public domain would be fraught with legal risk in the absence of the protections of the fair procedures and due process that Irish law requires.<br/><br/>There is no doubt the campus faced real challenges between 2014 and 2017 in particular, which peaked in 2016.  Efforts in all areas of staff and management, with leadership and accountability provided by the board, have played an important role in bringing about the transformative change that has been documented by our statutory inspector, HIQA, following its two full five-day inspections in 2017 and 2018.  In addition to the significantly improved environment, the board has taken a range of initiatives to improve and enhance transparency and the oversight and accountability the board provides.  It is developing and adopting the campus's first strategic plan, with full details of the implementation and progress reported and published by the Minister in December 2018.  There is also a communications and engagement strategy and the Oberstown strategy on the participation of children and young people in decision-making.  We also have the review, development and approval of a range of policies, and an entire new policy framework is under development in line with international children's rights standards and best practice.  There is also the first adoption of a governance handbook for Oberstown that sets out the respective responsibilities of all of the parties.  The board has been evaluated by the Institute of Public Administration, another first in the organisation's history.<br/><br/>Throughout my time as chair of the board of management I have worked consistently and tirelessly with fellow board members to ensure Oberstown continues to provide the best possible care to young people although many challenges remain.  Together with staff and management we have delivered and enhanced a more stable environment with objectively documented improvements happening in all areas of responsibility.  This has been done to ensure young people detained in Oberstown now and in future have the best possible care and life chances.  This has and continues to be our exclusive focus.<br/><br/>Throughout this time also, the board has delivered accountability through regular reporting to the Minister and her officials and to the Oireachtas through our annual reports and appearances at the committee - this is my fourth time to come before the committee - and in many other formal and informal ways.</p><p>Notwithstanding the very regrettable decision not to publish the report, during our term the board has delivered substantial improvements in the transparency of operations at Oberstown.  In that context, I am very happy to be here with my fellow board members.  I will endeavour to answer any questions from the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.172" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1300" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019013000002#O00200"><p>I thank our guests for attending and being so quick to offer to come before us.  That happened shortly after - if not during - our discussion with the Minister on this matter in December.  I have two points to raise with Professor Kilkelly in advance of Deputy Rabbitte's contribution.  It is difficult to understand the rationale for preventing the authors of the report from engaging with the board on any concerns it may have had about parts of the report.  Professors Hardwick and Goldson repeated at length that they did not have the opportunity to address any concerns that the board might have had in terms of being in the position to redact or remove certain elements of the report presented to it.</p> <p>  My second point is on the associated costs relating to the report.  Our guests know that I am also a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I find it very difficult when I see the cost of legal advice exceeding the value of the product purchased in the first instance, which in this case was a report costing just over &euro;15,000.  We are now looking at &euro;26,000 in legal and associated costs.  I appreciate that the board has a job to do and that it is independent.  It is still difficult for me, both as Chairman of this committee and as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, to see how that cost is justified.  I cannot see the product.  During our earlier session, Deputy Mitchell stated that there are 285 paragraphs and 95 recommendations in the report.  A number of them are a cause of concern for the members because we do not know the rationale behind them.  This presents us with a difficulty, particularly as we are charged with oversight of the Department, Tusla and operations at Oberstown.  Therein lies the problem for us, as parliamentarians.  We recognise that the board has a job to do, as does Tusla.  However, it is exceedingly difficult to do our job because we have not been provided with a product that effectively cost &euro;41,000.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.173" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ursula Kilkelly" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019013000002#O00300"><p>I will deal with elements of the questions in turn.  I completely agree with the Chairman's points on the legal costs and the overall cost of the review.  I have the same concerns and the board has had a discussion on the matter at its two most recent meetings to ensure that we produce value for money in all the professional services on which we rely in order to fulfil our role and deliver the legal responsibility we have as a board of management.  As has been mentioned, we are almost all voluntary board members but we must do a very serious job very carefully.  We rely on professional services from time to time.  It is a measure of the gravity of the matters at stake here that we sought to rely on independent legal advice and, in particular, that we were really careful to ensure we would not cause difficulties that would have much greater costs attached to them in reality.  It was really a matter of being cautious and prudent, ensuring we had all the available advice at our disposal.  I agree with the Chairman about the cost and we have asked management to review the cost of professional services and the decision-making around it.  I share the concerns on the matter and it is something we are addressing.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned the reviewers' opinion either that they were not able to return to the campus or that they did not have oversight.  I have been responsible for many reports commissioned by bodies who undertook to publish a report or where there was a discussion about finalisation or publication.  It is completely understood that the matter is with the discretion of the party that commissioned the report.  There would always be a process of fact-checking and engagement to ensure that what ends up being produced is fit for purpose.  It is not always possible to get to that point and in this instance, unfortunately, there was something of a deadlock when it came to finalising the report in a satisfactory outcome.</p> <p>  The Chairman's comments are important but I, as chairperson of the board, engaged with the reviewers in order to seek to produce a positive outcome.  It was the intention but it was very difficult in the context of the dialogue that occurred to see how we would get to that satisfactory point.  I will come back to the process that the board subsequently followed because it was specifically focused on legal risk in particular.</p> <p>  The Chairman made a general point about oversight.  The report has been seen by HIQA and the board has deliberated on that report.  There has been a particular focus throughout the process on the implementation of the recommendations, as that is how value for money can be demonstrated when one runs into the kinds of difficulties we did.  It is about focusing and prioritising the implementation of the recommendations, seeking to maximise the positive potential of a process.  It is particularly important to note that the review happened alongside multiple other reviews, with various aspects of those reviews published in different ways.  In addition, we had two full HIQA inspections, with five inspectors coming on two occasions for five days, since the operational review was undertaken.  It continues to be a matter of regret that this report has not been published but there is no question about the amount of information in the public domain about Oberstown and its operations released by its board and management.  It is significantly more than has been the case at least during my time on the board and the life of the organisation as a whole.</p> <p>  Transparency has been a focus and part of the issue with publishing the recommendations was about striking the most appropriate balance within our control and what we felt was prudent.  It was about putting the recommendations in the public domain with a narrative that responded to them.  It was considered to be the safest or least risky approach in light of the public interest, our need to focus on improvements and the significant work put into the report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.174" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1300" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019013000002#O00400"><p>In my experience of legal advice, it is often the quality of the instruction that determines the advice received.  It is often a very confusing aspect when one is trying to determine the best approach to take.  The quality of the instruction to the law firm or whoever was used would have most likely coloured the response received.  That is why I find it difficult to understand, with the available information, how Professors Hardwick and Goldson were not provided with the opportunity to be informed.  They have clearly indicated they are not aware of what is offensive within their report to the board.  Therefore, they could not offer to redact certain sections; this went to the law firms hired to provide the board with legal advice and coloured the decision not to publish.  I am sure the board comprises experienced professionals and that there are all sorts of individuals on the board and in the management structure who expressed a viewpoint.</p> <p>  As a former member of other boards of management, one of my first actions would have been to ask the authors of the report to come before the board and have a discussion about it.</p><p>That did not happen and, therefore, the authors were not aware of what was offensive within the report, as was clearly articulated earlier.  As a result, the board could not be informed by the authors' viewpoint as to what could or could not be redacted and later published, subject to legal advice.  </p><p> I cannot help but feel that the board has been robust in its approach but perhaps it has omitted something, unintentionally or otherwise, from its contribution to the committee or else overlooked it.  I wish to understand the lengths to which the board has gone to produce value for money by publishing the report, as Professor Kilkelly rightly pointed out.  I do not suggest for one moment that there is some malevolent plan because I do not think that is the case.  Rather, I wish to understand the lengths to which the board went to publish the report because it is not immediately clear.  Does Professor Kilkelly wish to respond before I invite Deputy Rabbitte to make a contribution?</p></speech>

One of the concerns that arise when one considers the matter is that there was a gap in the fulfilment of the terms of reference with respect to the feedback visit, which, according to the terms of reference, was due to happen prior to the report being finalised.  It was clear that the feedback was about the process of engagement with staff.  We did not seek a root and branch review of Oberstown at that time.  Rather, we sought expertise and insight from a different perspective of what was happening on the ground, with a view to creating a dialogue that would enable changes to be implemented.  It was intended to be an unlocking of hearts and minds on the issues.  It was not intended to commission - nor would it have been possible to do so in the timescale - the kind of root and branch review that perhaps should have been commissioned.  It was very much intended to be a process to enable staff to move forward.</p> <p>  An extraordinary amount of time has been spent on this process by me as chair and the board as a whole.  In the early days, while responding to the initial drafts of the report, the focus was on factual accuracy checking.  Extraordinary attention was paid to concerns that arose from the report at the time and they were flagged early on to the reviewers in detailed form.  It was also flagged early that because of the nature of the report, that is, the way in which it was written, the tone and the implication of what was being said rather than the substantive or critical nature of it, we became aware of legal matters that would require review, particularly in the context of Irish constitutional law and the fair procedures law that has recently been outlined by the courts.  In the context of that broader responsibility of the board, whatever the reviewers could do in response would always be limited.  The key issue was that the board did its job in ensuring that it was taken care of adequately and prudently.</p> <p>  At every stage, I flagged that legal review would be necessary as a prudent step and that the nature and timing of any publication was a matter for the board in the light of its broader legal responsibilities, not only under the Act but under broader Irish law.  Those matters were brought to the attention of the reviewers and I was clear about them.  It is the distinction between, on the one hand, a process of factual accuracy and what that can yield and, on the other, a more substantive process that is essential to ensure fair procedures are followed.  The review of that was subsequently the specific interest of the board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019013000002#P00300"><p>I thank the members of the board for appearing before the committee.  From my point of view as a member of the Oireachtas committee on children, the purpose of the review was that it would be the safety net for the committee and that independent external assessors would do a review of Oberstown.  As Professor Kilkelly stated, this is the fourth time she has appeared before the committee.  The review was set in a context where Oberstown was continuously in the media in 2016.  There was an incident with garda&iacute; and the centre was on the front pages of the papers week in, week out.  It was at such a dangerous stage that I felt a life could be lost.</p> <p>  When we learned that an external group would review the issue, it brought some calm and comfort that we, as an Oireachtas committee, were doing our job.  That was part of the communication among the committee, the board and the operational manager on campus, and it was part of the dialogue we had with the Minister.  As spokesperson for children for my party, I never expected not to have the whole document, because that is what it was all about, whether it was a redacted version or whatever.  Having the recommendations without the other part of the review does not make sense.</p> <p>  Professor Kilkelly spoke about unlocking hearts and minds, but it was about a root and branch, as far as I was concerned.  That was what I wanted for Oberstown and it was what I needed to know.  I agree that many reports and reviews were taking place, one of which related to the buildings, and I acknowledge there were many staffing and other issues.  My core issue, however, is the protection of the children in the centre.  There are 90-odd recommendations but I cannot tell what policy is part of the pillars of its foundation.  Whatever part of law it relates to, we need to know where we can steer Oberstown.  We are working in a vacuum.  I do not accept that time ran out before a final version could be produced because given that the two gentlemen, Professors Goldson and Hardwick, appeared before the committee, I imagine there was a meeting of minds of both parties to produce the report somewhere along the line.</p> <p>  Does the board of directors of Oberstown have liability insurance?  If so, how much does it cost?  As someone who is examining the issue from outside, I note that only two people are named in the whole report.  I think the production of the report has created fear in the board.  Anybody who has sat on a board of directors would have ensured there was insurance to protect it.</p> <p>  Professor Kilkelly referred to HIQA and noted that while recommendations have been made, Oberstown has made progress and taken numerous steps forward.  I have a copy of the HIQA report, which outlines two five-day inspections with five inspectors.  I cannot find comfort in reading the report.  While the situation might have improved, the report refers to external parties to the board not attending meetings, and states that Tusla had not attended "a number of months" of meetings.  Why is Tusla not required to be present at all board meetings?  Page 30 of the HIQA report states: "In addition, the chairperson of the board of management told inspectors there was no Tusla representative in attendance at board meetings for a number of months [...] and the absence of a representative from Tusla directly impacted the Boards ability to prioritise and address these inter-agency matters."  That is an important factor when talking about decisions to move forward.  I accept that the purpose of the meeting is not to discuss the HIQA report, but it is relevant if we are to place the recommendations in context and if the aim is to move forward.  Why and how was a child left in separation for 12 days?  Why was physical intervention used in ten incidents and what kind of physical intervention was used?  I am giving only a background.  We are like mushrooms in this regard.  We do not have the report and it needs to be given to us.</p><p>At no point along the line have the Minister or Oberstown given us any comfort that what was produced is working and that those key recommendations are being followed through on.  That is where I am coming from and I would like the witnesses to respond to what I have said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.179" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ursula Kilkelly" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2019013000002#Q00200"><p>A number of issues were raised and I will attempt to respond to them.  In respect of the Tusla nominee, I brought to the attention of the Department that the Tusla nominee intended to step down due to other responsibilities and there was a time lag in the nomination of the replacement for that person.  I repeatedly brought it to the attention of the Department.  We now have the Tusla nominee on the board in full attendance.  These matters arise from time to time as board membership changes.  When gaps arise, I always bring the vital nature of Department nominees in particular to the attention of the Department very quickly.  I can only do so much in this regard but I stand over what I reported to HIQA in the consultation with it as part of its process.  There was a gap at the time that has been rectified.</p> <p>  In respect of the named individuals and insurance, we always endeavour not to deal with risk at the brink but to take the proactive measures that will prevent us being in that situation in the first place.  While there has been reference to two named individuals, the legal risks arise with regard to identifiable individuals, not just named individuals.  The nature of the implications expressed in the report arise in that context.  It is a much wider issue than named individuals and that is an Irish legal concept that is very pressing in this instance.  In the context of the vacuum, I understand completely the Deputy's concern and appreciate very much her long commitment.  We have engaged on these issues a number of times when I have appeared before the committee.  The Deputy was in Oberstown at the time.  I also appreciate her levelling with us on the gravity of what we faced.  We were utterly aware of the gravity of what we faced at that time.  Throughout that time, we never had a Pollyanna view about how things are on the floor of Oberstown.</p> <p>  It is very unhelpful to suggest that there is a lack of understanding of the true nature of the problems and what needs to be done to root out and unseat deep-seated practices that have built up over the years.  This is part of the difficulty regarding where we are.  We are utterly aware and have worked non-stop on these issues.  I have daily contact with the campus.  We have routine meetings, but in between that, at least two days per week are spent on it.  It is simply not true to suggest either the board or management do not have full understanding of and oversight regarding what is happening on the ground.  I am not suggesting for a second that notwithstanding the improvements, we do not have a long way to go.  We do, but that is very clear.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right in the context of separation.  This has been a really intractable problem.  In response to Deputy Sherlock, I would say that we engaged on this last year.  We have put a new policy and framework in place regarding separation, but we have focused much more on the way it is recorded.  We have an entirely new data collection system to manage that.  That is prompting a much greater level of detailed oversight, accountability and approval, including daily monitoring by the director.  That is what has driven down the practice of separation dramatically - 50% in 2017 and 2018, respectively.  The board has been very clear and has issued a statement on the use of restrictive practices, the unacceptable nature of those practices and how we need to take various steps to ensure the policy and its implementation are correct.</p> <p>  It is simply not true to suggest that we are satisfied with good policy.  In the earlier session, Professor Hardwick mentioned that we had good policies.  I do not agree.  We did not have good policies.  We have done a raft of work to put our policies on a firm and solid footing.  We are about to develop and improve an entirely new policy framework that will set this up for the future.  The extent of the work on policy and the implementation of policy is relentless, but we should not be under any illusions about the complexity of that work or its demanding nature.  None of it would be possible without bringing all of the staff on campus - new and old staff who do this work on a day-to-day basis - with us.  The key issue in the context of the broader concerns about the report was the fact that it had to enable us to move forward.  I accept that Deputy Rabbitte's interest in it was perhaps slightly different.  She wanted this root-and-branch approach and that comfort.  I accept that completely.  Clearly, we need to work better to make sure the Deputy is better informed and feels that she has the assurances that she needs.</p></speech>

What I need to know is that the children who go to Oberstown are treated correctly because the HIQA reports coming to me year on year do not give me that comfort.  They do not provide me with any reassurance.  I feel that a complete cover-up is taking place, and one that has gone on for the past number of years.  The fact that there would be independent involvement was the only reason I agreed to this review two years ago.  I ask Professor Kilkelly to answer my question about board members' insurance.</p></speech>

To reiterate the points made previously, we do not have sight of the report.  However, we do have sight of the recommendations and take in good faith the statements made in respect of the implementation of those recommendations.  What we find hard to reconcile is the non-publication of the report.  I listened very carefully to Professor Kilkelly in respect of the constitutional element in terms of implicating people in the report.  I appreciate that dynamic because Professor Kilkelly states that while nobody was specifically identified, the language of the report could be deemed to identify individuals.  In light of what Professor Kilkelly said, what was the exact nature of the independent advice given to the board?</p></speech>

Could she be more specific about it?  What was the nature of the interactions with the Minister or her officials regarding that independent advice?  When the Minister appeared before us, she stated that she had been advised by the board that its decision not to publish the report of the operational review was not one it either expected or wanted to make and that it resulted from a lengthy, careful and extensive process of consideration that weighed up the legal risks associated with publication in light of the independent legal advice.  We are in the political domain and we perceive that the non-publication of the report could arguably be perceived to be covering up or protecting practice, culture or individuals.  We need some reassurance from Professor Kilkelly that the board's independent legal advice is robust and some greater articulation of what Professor Kilkelly means by the implications of that advice.</p></speech>

For its part, the board has been entirely clear and consistent about its concerns.  The other matters that have been raised were considerations that the Minister took into account.  It is her prerogative as Minister to have supplementary or additional reasons she had those concerns.  In the context of the report, the legal advice pointed to an absence of an opportunity for identifiable individuals to inform the findings of the review.</p></speech>

If the board owns it, notwithstanding the issues of timing, the fact that the committee has demanded the publication of the report, and our interactions with the Minister, is there still scope and time, on the basis of the evidence of Professors Goldson and Hardwick in respect of their willingness to engage at all levels and with all stakeholders, to go over the report again and work through its content if it is deemed that there are adverse findings against or implications for certain individuals?  From my perspective in seeking to address the issues concerning the recommendations published in July 2017, even if those recommendations are implemented, the sword of Damocles of this report will still be hanging over us.  As I said at the outset, we are in the political domain, not the legal domain.  Reports perceived to have been suppressed always get published, one way or another.</p> <p>  I say respectfully to Professor Kilkelly that I perceive defensiveness here on the part of the board.  I did not perceive the same defensiveness on the part of Professors Goldson and Hardwick.  This is perception; it is reality in the political domain.  Both sides need to go through this report again and find some common ground, irrespective of whether this process is brokered by the Minister or someone else.  One way or another, the report will have to be published.  The public interest absolutely demands it.</p></speech>

We are trying to obtain facts and information; it is not about trying to undermine anyone.  Considering the impact on the reputation of the two professors, Professors Goldson and Hardwick, I am conscious that Professor Kilkelly's opening comments are not overly complimentary.  Our interaction with the two professors was very positive.  I certainly found their evidence to the committee to be very persuasive.</p> <p>  The constitutional law aspect is, of course, always balanced with the public interest.  Professor Kilkelly is asking our committee to accept she was advised the tone or implications of the report were such that they prevented her from publishing it and that we just need to move on.  We are not accepting of that.  I can speak only for myself, obviously.  With regard to looking after the interest of children in the facility, it is my belief that the public interest is best served by publishing the report.  I have heard nothing so far that would convince me otherwise.</p> <p>  An aim of the review was to evaluate practice and policy in line with international standards.  We do not know whether that was done because we do not have the report.  Another was to identify obstacles or barriers to achieving greater implementation of international standards.  Again, we do not know whether this was achieved because we do not have the report.  The final aim was to make recommendations to ensure greater and more success in the implementation of the standards.  We have the recommendations but no context.  Therefore, we have half achieved our target in that respect.  The aims of the review have not been met, therefore, but obviously the State has incurred a cost.</p> <p>  With regard to the terms of reference, was the process followed?  Professor Kilkelly referred to the meeting that should have happened before the terms of reference were finalised but then she said a summary was provided to her before finalisation.  Is Professor Kilkelly saying the process referred to in the terms of reference was not followed?  I refer to the five points she identified in her opening statement.</p></speech>

The terms of reference provided for a sequence of events.  In that sequence, quite deliberately the feedback session was to take place prior to the report being finalised.  Had the sequence been adhered to, we might not be in this position.  As we heard earlier, no one is afraid of criticism here.  We are subject to criticism and scrutiny routinely.  We absolutely do not shirk from that.  We would not be here if we did.  We are very open to that as an objective process and it would have been helpful.  For whatever reason, however, the reviewers were keen to finalise the report prior to an engagement session with staff and the board.  I accept their bona fides in this regard.  In hindsight, we should have insisted that the feedback session take place in the informal way in which it was intended.  It was not intended to be a launch of the report; it was intended to show what was found and how it sits.  That was the indicative process set out.</p></speech>

It was at their discretion to take it into account.  The committee heard by their admission that they had done so.  There are probably some differences in terms of interpretation and the extent to which tho points were made, but it was within their gift to decide how matters we had raised would be addressed by them.</p></speech>

That is why I made the point, probably pedantically, about factual accuracies.  It was a limited response.  In providing for the safeguards that are necessary in a legal context before a report of this nature is published, it is vital that a substantive feedback process take place before findings are reached.  By its nature, when the report was concluded prior to the feedback session-----</p></speech>

There was some dialogue at the time about how the sequence should be as set out in the terms of reference, but their preference was to finalise the report first.  I understand why they wanted it that way.  In hindsight, I should have insisted on it being done differently, as that would have better honoured the nature of the process.  However, we are where we are.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a valid point about the balance of the public interest.  We accept that, which is why we have grappled with this issue at 22 meetings of the board.  No one wants to see this resolved more than us.  We did not just get our own independent legal advice.  Further separate legal advice and a review by the Attorney General of the matter determined the balance that was struck that we see today.  The decision was not based solely on advice provided for the board but also on other sets of advice.</p></speech>

I have mentioned the number of reports and reviews that were ongoing at the time.  It is fair to say there was no lack of information on what was wrong at Oberstown and how it needed to be fixed.  The report was intended to try to get to the heart of some of the issues with which we were struggling.  I do not mean in a substantive way or a way that dealt with the details, <i>per se</i>.  If the Deputy recalls, there was discussion about the use of, among other things, riot gear and whether the Oberstown campus, effectively a high security facility, was the right place for young offenders, older offenders, more serious offenders, remand prisoners, etc.  These important debates were ongoing at the time and the report was designed to get at these issues.</p></speech>

To be fair to the two professors, they dispute Professor Kilkelly's interpretation of how the process worked.  They say they engaged all the way through, were open and willing to change and interact, welcomed feedback and wanted to engage with staff and the board.  They have a different interpretation and presented that evidence to the committee.</p> <p>  If the only issue is that the feedback session did not happen before finalising the report, is it Professor Kilkelly's understanding the reviewers were willing to address concerns with the final report and make changes?  When it was realised this would be an issue for the board and those implicated - I mean "allegedly implicated", as we do not know the nature of the implication - did the board discuss with the reviewers how to fix it, how to go about publishing the report, whether the review session could be held immediately, if doing so would have a material impact on the findings and whether the tone could be altered in some way?  Alternatively, did it just decide not to proceed because the process had not been followed in the absolute order?</p></speech>

It was made clear that the report was final, that no substantial changes had happened throughout the process, despite there being some changes and that, unfortunately, the matter could not be addressed through further dialogue.  That was not where we wanted to find ourselves, but it was the reality of the risk we were managing at the time.</p></speech>

The legal advice regarded the specific matter of publication.  We considered and sought input on whether a redacted form would strike that balance effectively.  Again, the advice was that it would not and that it would be very difficult to produce anything of substance or meaning.  That was separately considered.</p></speech>

The handling of this issue has been a complete and utter mess.  The two professors who authored the report appeared before the committee earlier today.  They submitted a significant number of references regarding the procedures through which they went.  The committee was originally given four different reasons that the report was not published, which is confusing.  I ask Professor Kilkelly to explain that.  We were then told of legal advice that was not shared with the professors who wrote the report.  I may be wrong but it seems that Professor Kilkelly is suggesting that the feedback not taking place is another factor in the report not being published.  We are being told of four separate reasons for the lack of publication and reference is also being made to feedback, which is confusing.  The professor must be specific.  Why was the report not published?  The committee has heard many different answers to that question, which is not acceptable.  I and other members believe the professor is obstructing the committee in its work.  To do so is a very serious matter.  She needs to be upfront and tell us why it was not published.  Is it uncomfortable reading?  Is that why it was not published?</p></speech>

We have read and commissioned multiple reports about Oberstown which are uncomfortable reading and highly critical of the facility.  I wish to categorically state that that is not the reason it was not published.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's point regarding four reasons the report was not published, the board has only ever reported one reason.  The other reasons are for the Minister to articulate.  I believe she has done so, both to the reviewers and publicly.  The board has consistently stated that its concern is with fair procedures.  I am trying to help the committee understand how we got to where we are.  I do not do so in a critical manner but in an attempt to explain that if the feedback session had taken place, it would have provided an opportunity for the reviewers to engage, reflect and understand the context and related matters-----</p></speech>

That sequence was set out in the terms of reference and would have avoided where we now are, whereby the legal risk associated with a breach of fair procedures only affects publication.  The board has been consistently clear on that issue.  In the context of reference to reasons why the report should be published, the point was made earlier that the report may be in some way offensive or that lessons will not be learned.  I reiterate that this is a constant process of improvement and learning from multiple reviews, HIQA inspectors' reports and so on.  The process of getting behind the problems and understanding and remedying them is ongoing on a daily basis.  I do not think it fair to suggest that a report completed over two and a quarter years ago is our only source of wisdom on these issues.  We are open to expertise and insights from anywhere but the work must be done by those in Oberstown and that is crucial.</p></speech>

The reviewers did lengthy and detailed work and paying them was the right thing to do, notwithstanding related concerns and issues.  Treating people properly was an element in dealing fairly with the authors.  On Deputy Mitchell's point on transparency, Oberstown is one of the most scrutinised organisations and facilities in the country.  It is absolutely right and vital that is the case.</p> <p>  As I mentioned, since we have come into place we have overseen significant increases in the amount of information about Oberstown in the public domain.  This committee has been out there and is invited out routinely, as is anyone else who wants to come out to see the campus and the operation and to meet with staff and perhaps young people.  Multiple other reports have been either published or shared with the relevant stakeholders.  HIQA has access to this report and of its inspections were published in full.  </p> <p>  A full constitutional action aired many of these issues in the High Court last year.  That is ultimate accountability.  We have produced annual reports.  We have published extensive data on our single separation process and other restrictive practices.  We have regular stakeholder meetings and multiple mechanisms are used, statutory and otherwise, to ensure there is as much transparency as possible in what we do.  I completely understand Deputy Mitchell's frustration on the issue of the recommendations.  </p> <p>  From our perspective, however, it had to be safe to place the full report in the public domain.  Regrettably, that was the stumbling block we came across.  We had to deal with the reality of the risk presented at that time in the way we did.  I am confident that if we did it again it could be done differently but there is no cover-up.</p></speech>

Deputy Mitchell has spent much time on this issue.  I appreciate and respect her time.  The board, as I mentioned, has also spent multiple hours and days on it.  We are endeavouring to do that alongside everything else this voluntary board is doing.  It is a greatly onerous responsibility on everybody.  I will, however, take the comments and feedback from the committee back to the board.</p></speech>

I want to move on to some of the issues regarding the excuse for non-publication.</p><p>This idea of fair procedures and right to reply smacks of an excuse for non-publication.  I do not understand what that means.  Having examined all the documents released under freedom of information legislation, it seems to be elastic.  According to the board, its decision not to publish was based on Irish law and constitutional matters.  However, it took that decision prior to the Attorney General's input into the process.  The Office of the Attorney General was trying to deliver a pathway towards publication in November 2017.  I mean no disrespect to the board of Oberstown but it is not on the same level as the Attorney General, one of the chief guardians of the Constitution.  The Attorney General's only caveat was that staff be given an opportunity to respond to concerns.  That was the pathway to publication he set out.  What was done?  From material released under freedom of information, we know the director was given a chance to make an input into the process.  How many other staff were given an opportunity to make an input into that process?</p></speech>

People will not like it but the board has the authority to do so.  Having commissioned the report, that decision was within its gift to make.  The subsequent process involving the Attorney General was with respect to the Minister's decision on whether to publish the report.</p> <p>  On consultation, the board's view was if we were to start circulating the report and asking for input and feedback, it would partly, if not fully, realise the very legal risks we were mitigating against.  In particular, the concern was that this would also create a dynamic that would not help us to resolve the matter but which would exacerbate the situation.</p></speech>

Correspondence was made available on 13 November 2017 as a result of a freedom of information request.  The board had received legal advice on 13 March 2017.  The correspondence is from a principal officer, who I will not name, in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It stated that the Department was of the view that the following mechanisms to progress matters in order to ensure that the matters raised by the board were addressed.  This is the independent legal advice.  There follows a set of proposals.  The first was a response to the authors of the report pointing out the existence of concerns about fair procedures and suggesting a further process of engagement with staff and management of Oberstown in order to ensure that persons criticised in the report had been fairly heard.  Alternatively, the board of management of Oberstown campus could make a submission on behalf of the persons criticised in the report to be disclosed to HIQA and the joint Oireachtas committee along with the report.  To reinforce Deputy Daly's point, members are very much of the view that everything was done to try to facilitate the board, either through further engagement with the authors of the report or through the legal mechanisms of the highest offices of the State, to publish the report, yet it refused to do so on the basis of its own independent legal advice.  The arguments the witnesses are making do not hold water.</p></speech>

The board was dealing with this matter month by month and had been dealing with it extensively and exhaustively, as had I as chair.  The suggestions and recommendations that were made to the board by the Minister's office were given consideration by the board.  Ultimately, the board's concern was twofold.  The first was that publication would not be productive and would not yield the sort of outcome that we all wanted, namely, to resolve these difficulties, and that we had reached a level of impasse that would not make this productive.  The second was that the very risks we were trying to mitigate against would be realised through this process.  That was our understanding of the issue.</p></speech>

By any interpretation, the Department was seeking to suggest further engagement with the staff and management to ensure that persons criticised in the report had been fairly heard.  Notwithstanding the point that a finding had been made, which Professor Kilkelly made previously, there was still scope for further engagement with the various stakeholders before the publication of the report.  Professor Kilkelly seems to be saying that in spite of those suggestions, the board  decided to proceed on the basis of its independent legal advice.  A pathway was being sought for the board but it refused to take it.</p></speech>

That was made clear and it is also clear in the correspondence with the Department.</p></speech>

The pathway put forward by the Department to allow the board to publish the report was that staff and management be given a right to reply, as it were.</p><p>It seems from the actions taken - Professor Kilkelly can correct me if I am wrong - that the director was the only person who was given some type of right to reply and that no one else's views were sought.  Professors Goldson and Hardwick told us that the only people identified in the report are the director and Professor Kilkelly.  In contrast to what Professor Kilkelly said, they do not believe anyone else can be identified as coming in for criticism.  Having not seen the report, there are only two possible conclusions I can draw from that.  Either the director was the only person criticised in the report and somehow threatened to resign if the report was released, or else the whole thing is something of a puff of smoke.  It does not add up in any other way.  Why did the board not give other people a right of reply?  We know the director replied.  Is it the case that the director was the only person criticised?  The Chair wants me to get an answer to the point made by other Deputies as to whether the board accepts all of the recommendations of the report.</p></speech>

However, the point has been made and I do not necessarily want to travel down that particular rabbit hole.

It is, therefore, a substantive role, in addition to being director and manager of the campus.  The response from the director on that matter on behalf of Oberstown, in addition to being on his own behalf, dealt with a range of issues, which raised the concerns we then brought to the attention of the Department and ultimately the Attorney General, I presume.  It is simply not true that the Department made this recommendation and we refused to respond.  The process put in place was that it was referred to the office of the director for consideration, and a further correspondence came back on that raising a range of concerns was then referred on to the Department.  It is not fair to say that we stood there and did nothing or that we resisted.  We endeavoured to respond to ensure that whatever mechanisms that were available to us were used.</p></speech>

I have not seen any evidence in any way to undermine the work done by the two professors.  Does Professor Kilkelly support their recommendations?  One of the recommendations was that the board commission an independent review of senior management to ensure is suitable to direct Oberstown.  Has that been done?  The management is still the same.  The recommendations refer to a rupture between senior management and staff.  Has that rupture been healed?</p></speech>

That was one of the first recommendations and the review was under way at the time of the report and was completed early in 2017.  Nobody was as aware as we were of the challenges presented by the rupture and the challenges between staff and management.  None of the content of this report was a surprise to us.  We were working tirelessly on this and have continued to do so.  I will not labour the point, but all of these issues were on our table in one form or another.  That is not the concern here.  I take the Deputy's point about the criticism.  I have deliberately not sought to articulate things in more detail because I do not want to cast any aspersions on the work done.  However, if this is viewed through the constitutional perspective of the legal responsibility the board has, we arrive at a different place.  That is my view.</p></speech>

I believe that Professor Kilkelly's argument in respect of the findings militated against fair procedure.  The Department made an offer to the board of Oberstown to discuss the issue of fair procedures.  Professor Kilkelly is saying the board took up that offer.  I do not understand her answer to that, because the evidence we heard from Professors Goldson and Hardwick today would suggest otherwise, namely, that there was no further qualitative engagement with them on the issue of fair procedures.  It is very hard to find Professor Kilkelly's answer to be credible.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, and officials from the Department, Mr. Fergal Goodman and Mr. Kieran Smith; Mr. John Hennessy, Mr. John Swords and Ms Paula Keon of the HSE; and from the Health Products Regulatory Authority, Dr. Lorraine Nolan, chief executive, Ms Rita Purcell and Dr. Caitr&iacute;ona Fisher.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the joint committee.

The Chairman introduced the witnesses so I will not repeat that.  I assure the committee that detailed planning for Brexit has been ongoing in the Department and its agencies for more than two years.  As part of the whole-of-Government work on Brexit preparation, the Government is working to secure an orderly and agreed Brexit, but in view of the uncertainty in London and the increased risks of a no-deal Brexit, we will continue to intensify our preparations for any such outcome.<br/><br/>Our number one protection from whatever Brexit brings will be our status as an EU member state, with all the stability, predictability and solidarity that brings.  On 19 December, the Government published its contingency action plan, which outlines the approach to no-deal Brexit planning, and the Department of Health and its agencies are contributing in full to this.  Brexit of any kind will mean change and will impact on all sectors, including health.  It is recognised that managing a no-deal Brexit would be an exercise in damage limitation and it would be impossible in a no-deal scenario to maintain the current seamless arrangements between the EU and UK across a full range of sectors which are currently facilitated by our common EU membership.<br/><br/>It is important to underline that certain measures will allow us to mitigate, as far as possible, the implications of a no-deal Brexit.  Both the Irish and British Governments are committed to maintaining the common travel area in all circumstances and have committed to undertaking all the work necessary, including through legislative provision to ensure that common travel area rights and privileges are protected.  The Department has focused attention on protecting the common travel area with regard to access to healthcare and allowing the freedom of movement we currently have for Irish and UK citizens.  Protecting and maintaining the common travel area and the associated rights and privileges is a key part of our contingency planning and preparations.  This is vital in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland peace process, as well as broader UK-Ireland relations.<br/><br/>The Department continues to work closely with other Departments and agencies on all aspects of Brexit planning, particularly the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Department is represented at all cross-sectoral working groups and is co-operating fully with colleagues across Government.  The Department has also strengthened its internal capacity to plan for Brexit.  I meet the heads of the HSE, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, weekly to review progress on Brexit preparedness and to consider any new challenges identified.  I have also established a Brexit operations team, chaired by a deputy secretary general in the Department, comprised of senior officials from the Department, the HSE, the HPRA and the FSAI.  This group works to resolve issues and to escalate them to the heads of agency group, which I chair, if necessary.<br/><br/>An inter-agency communications group, chaired by my Department, has been established to plan for all aspects of a communications strategy to ensure that the public is fully informed of the health implications of either a central case Brexit or a no-deal Brexit.  A further working group is working to identify and monitor medicines that may be vulnerable to supply disruption as a result of Brexit.  The Department and its agencies, especially the HPRA, FSAI and HSE, have been in regular contact with stakeholders to assess the level of preparedness for a no-deal Brexit.  It is important to state that while the Department continues to monitor and seek assurances in a number of areas, our current analysis is that there are no immediate risks to the health of the population because of Brexit.<br/><br/>Co-operation on healthcare provision and the protection of public health on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain has developed over many years to the mutual benefit of the all parties.  Some of these arrangements are underpinned by EU regulations while others are on the basis of bilateral agreements or service-to-service arrangements.  Both Governments have repeatedly stressed that they are anxious for these services to continue post Brexit, and the Department of Health continues to be in close contact to facilitate this.<br/><br/>I will update the committee on the progress and the current status of priority issues since the Department's previous appearance on this issue in January 2018.  In the event that the United Kingdom leaves the European Union on 29 March 2019 without a withdrawal agreement in place, it will be necessary to put in place legislative provisions to enable necessary healthcare arrangements, including reimbursement arrangements, to be maintained between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  The Irish and British Governments have committed to maintaining the common travel area and its associated rights and privileges.  These arrangements facilitate access to health services in the UK and Ireland, including access to emergency, routine and planned healthcare.  The draft heads of the proposed legislation therefore seek to put in place an appropriate legal framework in Ireland to ensure the continuation of the common travel area arrangements.<br/><br/>The Department, as part of the cross-Government approach to contingency planning, has prepared heads of a Bill which is consistent with our commitment to provide for these rights and privileges.  The proposed legislation would allow the Minister for Health and the HSE, as appropriate, to cover the cost of healthcare provided in the UK under the same conditions as currently exist, for example, where treatments are not provided under our own healthcare system or for an Irish person who becomes ill while on a visit to the UK and needs immediate healthcare there.  It also makes provision to preserve existing eligibility for healthcare in Ireland for a range of different cohorts of people, including UK pensioners residing in Ireland, frontier workers and for UK residents on a temporary visit here.<br/><br/>As part of our common travel area discussions, key principles have been agreed at official level with the UK to maintain bilateral health co-operation.  There has been very good ongoing engagement with the UK on the technical work needed to ensure continuity of arrangements.  Proposals are now being examined with a view to ensuring the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i>pending the finalisation of longer-term arrangements.  This co-operation will support the objectives of the healthcare legislation proposed in the no-deal Brexit omnibus Bill.  This overall framework will build upon many years of very positive co-operation between the two jurisdictions.  This is true of our administrative systems but it is also true at a clinical level.  There are very strong and well-established relationships at clinician-to-clinician level.  Many of our respective clinicians have trained together.  In all of our preparations we have been able to build upon this very strong spirit of collaboration in the interests of patient care, at clinical, hospital, administrative and political levels.<br/><br/>The Department is working closely with the HPRA and the HSE on the supply of medicine.  Since the UK referendum, industry has undertaken very significant work in modifying supply chains and revising regulatory pathways to guard against Brexit.  This work is continuous and the Department, the HPRA and the HSE are continuing to work closely with suppliers.  As part of a whole-of-Government response to Brexit, the Minister, Deputy Harris, recently outlined a comprehensive set of preparations to ensure continuity of health services and supply of medical products in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  This work involves the Department of Health, the HSE, the HPRA and other agencies engaging in intensive Brexit preparedness and contingency planning.  Significant work has been undertaken together with the pharmaceutical industry to anticipate, as much as possible, potential vulnerabilities, risk assess these and devise contingencies to minimise and address any risks to continuity of supply of medicines and medical goods.  No major supply issues have been identified through the preparedness and contingency planning exercises.<br/><br/>Ireland is unlikely to face serious general medicine supply issues in the period immediately after 29 March.  Any emerging supply issues will, in the first instance, be dealt with from existing supplies held within the domestic distribution chain.  It is important to reiterate that there are already additional stocks of medicines routinely built into the Irish medicine supply chain.  This is different to the wholesaling model which operates in the UK.  The pharmaceutical industry and wholesalers have provided assurance that they are confident that they will have sufficient stocks to bridge any initial issues at ports, should they occur.  There is no need for hospitals, pharmacists or patients to order extra quantities of medicines or for doctors to issue additional prescriptions as doing so could disrupt existing stock levels and hamper the supply of medicines to other patients.  As an additional safeguard, special consideration is being given to those categories of medicines which are considered most essential to public health.  An expert group is examining these categories of medicine and, where the supply chain indicates that Brexit could potentially cause issues, the group is working with suppliers to verify that robust contingencies are in place.  Work on this process is ongoing and will continue for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Both the HPRA and HSE have requested that companies highlight any issues regarding the availability of specific products associated with Brexit and no major issues have been identified to date.  If any potential issue is identified, it will be managed through the existing medicine shortages framework.  </p><p> Medicine shortages inevitably arise from time to time and are a feature of health systems around the world.  The HPRA has an existing medicine shortages framework in place to help prevent shortages from occurring and to reduce the impact of shortages on patients and healthcare professionals by co-ordinating the management of potential or actual shortages as they arise.  This framework is already used to manage and address an average of 45 shortage notifications a month.  There is no current shortage caused by Brexit. </p><p> The mutual recognition of qualifications awarded in the UK and Ireland has been considered in the context of the negotiations on the withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future relationship.  Clearly an EU-UK agreement on the mutual recognition of qualifications, were that to be achieved, would address the issue in the best way possible.  The recognition of qualifications has been discussed as part of the engagement at official level between the UK and Ireland on the common travel area.  Both the UK and Ireland are committed to ensuring measures are in place to allow for the recognition of qualifications within the parameters applying.  The UK has recently published draft regulations, which it intends to enact in the case of a no-deal Brexit.  This legislation will enable Irish qualifications to be recognised in the UK.</p><p> The Irish health professional regulation bodies have been examining the mechanisms in place for the recognition of qualifications with the objective of ensuring efficient processes for recognition for those holding UK qualifications while ensuring that this is done in an objective and non-discriminatory way.  The Irish bodies have been linking with their UK counterparts on this issue.</p><p> The maintenance of food safety standards of food imports from the UK and the efficient flow of food through the ports is another issue for which the Department is planning.  The withdrawal of the UK from the EU and its new status as a third country will have implications for the official food control system in Ireland.  The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is the central competent authority for official food controls, which are carried out by a range of official agencies.  Those include the HSE's environmental health service, which is largely responsible for foods of non-animal origin and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which is responsible for foods of animal origin and plants.  Challenges ahead in this area include import and export issues, as well as potential divergence with EU law over the longer term.</p><p> The importation of food is subject to EU legislation.  Additional resources have been provided to conduct the appropriate checks where Ireland is the first point of entry to the EU.  Preparations are also under way in the event that the UK should decide to require export certificates for certain food products.</p><p> To facilitate these preparations the Department is working closely with the relevant agencies and has approved additional resources for environmental health service staff, the public analyst laboratory and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland.  It is also working with the environmental health service, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of Public Works, OPW, with regard to the infrastructure and traffic management requirements at Dublin Port, Dublin Airport and Rosslare Europort.  The aim is to ensure that the appropriate food controls are conducted from a public health perspective, while being cognisant of the implications for trade.</p><p> In conclusion, I wish to reiterate that the Department, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the relevant agencies under the aegis of the Department are fully engaged in Brexit planning to ensure, as far as is possible, that the health sector is prepared for any adverse impacts as a result of Brexit.  We recognise the valuable work of the committee and I thank members for the opportunity to be here today.  I look forward to the views and questions of members.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. John Swords, national director for procurement, and Ms Paula Keon, assistant national director for the HSE North-South unit.</p> <p>  The HSE has been preparing for Brexit for some time on the basis of a central-case scenario and for a potential worst-case scenario, while at all times aware that negotiations are ongoing to help ensure that the necessary transition arrangements are in place to maintain continuity of health services.</p> <p>  A HSE Brexit planning group has been in place since 2017 and has been working closely with our departmental colleagues on a wide range of Brexit contingency planning and mitigating actions.  The focus of this work has been on Brexit implications across key work streams, including the continuity of patient and client health services; cross-Border and frontier arrangements, including co-operation and working together, CAWT; emergency healthcare, including the ambulance service; public health matters; environmental health; workforce issues and recognition of qualifications; and continuity of supply of goods and services including procurement.  </p> <p>  The focus of the mitigation measures relating to continuity of care is on ensuring that service level agreements and memoranda of understanding are in place where necessary.  This applies to specific service areas such as emergency cross-Border arrangements, cardiac and cancer services, treatment abroad placements and CAWT arrangements.  The EU North-South unit is working to ensure that services currently available to people living in Border areas continue to be available post Brexit.  Examples of those, as I mentioned, include cardiology and radiotherapy services at Altnagelvin and the specialist cardiac services provided on an all-island basis for children at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin. </p> <p>  Arrangements in respect of other specific areas of healthcare, such as paediatric organ transplant services, are progressing and agreements are being finalised with the relevant UK hospitals to ensure continuity of service post Brexit.  That includes Great Ormond Street Hospital.  </p> <p>  The national ambulance services, here and in Northern Ireland, are liaising closely to ensure service continuity and agreement with regard to operating procedures.  There are two key memoranda of understanding in place between the respective ambulance services.  The first is a memorandum of understanding on the provision of assistance in the management and resourcing of emergency and urgent calls.  The second covers mutual aid for declared major incidents.  These join the two jurisdictions in their responses to emergency situations.</p> <p>  The environmental health service is engaged in ongoing discussions with the Departments of Health and Agriculture, Food and the Marine about the import and export of foodstuffs and the possible divergence of food regulations and controls over time.  As Mr. Breslin mentioned, additional resources have been made available in 2019 to strengthen the environmental health service capacity in this regard, and those additional posts are being recruited at present.  </p> <p>  The wider workforce implications of Brexit have been examined in detail by human resources department of the HSE and the key risks such as mutual recognition of qualifications and training for professional staff have been analysed in detail in the context of the movement of healthcare workers.  The HSE is liaising closely with the respective professional bodies and the regulators with a view to facilitating the continuation of existing recognition arrangements.  </p> <p>  The key risks for the provision of goods and services, such as medical and surgical supplies and medicines, in the short term relate to potential disruption and delay to supply chains.  As Mr. Breslin mentioned earlier, a joint working group comprised of staff from the HSE, the Department and the HPRA has been engaged in intensive work that involves the identification of suppliers of critical medicines and detailed follow-up with regard to specific product lines.  The key supply chain challenges in the short term are likely to be related to medicines with a short shelf life, those reliant on refrigerated supply chains, compounded products and time-critical logistics.  The HSE-HPRA group is liaising closely with hospitals and community pharmacists to identify short, medium and longer-term concerns regarding the continued supply of drugs and any risks to such supply and the proposed mitigation of those risks.  This work is being done in close collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry and both hospital and community pharmacy stakeholders.</p> <p>  There is currently a two-month stock of vaccines held in the HSE national cold chain service which, along with the stock held by companies in Ireland, gives approximately a six-month supply on the island to ensure the continuation of service delivery.  My colleague, Mr. John Swords, can provide the committee with further details about the continuity of supply of goods and services post Brexit.  </p> <p>  In terms of next steps, the HSE is continuing to work closely with service providers, suppliers and patient groups in relation to Brexit preparations.  This involves identifying, assessing and addressing the necessary contingency measures and actions required to maintain service continuity in the event of both an orderly and a disorderly Brexit.</p><p>The HSE is also continuing to work on awareness of Brexit implications among HSE and health service staff generally along with our colleagues in the Health Products Regulatory Authority, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, key suppliers, and with patients and the public in consultation with the Department of Health.  This concludes my opening statement.  I and my colleagues we will endeavour to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.402" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Breslin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019013000002#F00300"><p>I will ask my colleague, Mr. Goodman, to come in on this.  We have previously supplied to the committee data on the activity under those schemes.  It is notable that while, as EU citizens, we have entitlement to travel for treatment abroad or to avail of the cross-border directive across the EU, the majority of people are accessing care in the UK or Northern Ireland under both schemes.  For the treatment abroad scheme, as I noted in my statement, that is because our specialist links are most developed with the UK.  Mr. Hennessy mentioned Great Ormond Street.  There is a range of institutions in the UK to which we are very connected.  That will continue after Brexit.  We are confident about that for two reasons.  The level of engagement Mr. Hennessy has described with those institutions indicates that they completely understand the patient rationale here.  It is to their advantage that we form part of the catchment area for very highly specialist care and that we are able to feed in our patient to give them a critical mass of treatment within these islands.  If they were to lose some of that critical mass it would undermine their services.  They want to continue that relationship with us not only for altruistic reasons, which are very important, but also for the reputation of their units.  That is the very positive message we have received in our interactions with those facilities.</p> <p>  The heads of the Bill that have been published will give us the legal authority, subject to the drafting and progression of the Bill, to reimburse those facilities for the care they give.  At the moment, that is done completely through an EU-wide process where there is low administrative overhead and pretty well established rules as to how it happens.  In a post-Brexit situation, the UK will no longer be part of the EU-defined treatment abroad scheme but we will have an equivalent arrangement with the UK.  We will reimburse them, not as we currently do through the EU, but directly, for the care that they give. </p> <p>  In respect of the cross-border directive, the legislation also has an enabling provision which would allow the Minister and the HSE to meet the travel costs of Irish citizens to access treatment on an equivalent basis to the cross-border directive.  Currently, if someone goes to an EU member state and pays for their cross-border care, they can come back to the HSE and have that reimbursed.  We would seek to put in place a similar scheme.  It will not be the EU cross-border scheme but a similar scheme that would allow Irish citizens to continue to travel to Northern Ireland or the UK and be reimbursed by the Irish Government.  The UK authorities have indicated to us that they would be interested and prepared to facilitate continuing access under those arrangements.</p></speech>

We have such historic links between us in that regard that we have to put an overarching set of entitlements in place.  There is no point in telling someone they have a historic right to work in another country if, when they work there and need healthcare, they are not covered for that.  The common travel area has always covered not just people's ability to work but also the social security that goes with it.  It is through those mechanisms that we will seek to do that.  The cross-border directive is probably going to be an extra bit.  In the heads of the Bill, we have signalled our intention that we would like to provide for it.  We will have to work it through with the Oireachtas as the legislation goes through the Houses.</p></speech>

The principal distinction between the two schemes is that treatment abroad is very much a service-to-service arrangement, as the Secretary General has said.  As Mr. Hennessy has indicated, the HSE is proceeding on the basis that those service-to-service arrangements are essential in many ways and need to be maintained whatever happens.  The confirmation of the HSE's legal authority to continue with those arrangements is one of the purposes of the Bill.</p> <p>  As people will be aware, the cross-border directive puts the control in the hands of the patient to elect to source a service elsewhere.  That is not something that would otherwise exist in legislation.  The omnibus Bill that is being developed will need to pin that down in particular.  As the Secretary General has said, what we are seeking is the legal underpinnings that will enable the patients to continue to make those individual choices to access services.  That is the policy mandate that Government has given us in that regard.  Both arrangements are essentially dependent on reciprocation from the UK as far as is necessary to enable those systems to operate.  At present our understanding is that we expect that reciprocity to be forthcoming, all other things being equal.</p></speech>

Everyone very much appreciates it.  Both the Department and the HSE played a major part in developing the cross-border directive over a long number of years.  As a result, Irish people have benefitted substantially in being able to travel abroad when treatment is not available here.</p> <p>  The presentation suggests that many of the angles have been covered.  Is there a particular angle of concern that will now change?  The one area I want to find out about is the case of someone who is working in the UK, has private health insurance and ends up receiving healthcare.  Have the health insurance companies engaged in the same way as the Department and the HSE as regards making sure the existing arrangements will still be in place after 29 March?  Have the witnesses had any feedback from the health insurance companies on that?</p> <p>  Much work has been done as regards joint co-operation between Belfast and Dublin and between Derry and Donegal on providing medical care for people travelling between the North and South to receive care.  Will there be any real change in the services that will be available?  Will there be a change in how remuneration is resolved between the parties?  What kind of changes do we expect in that whole area?</p> <p>  On training in respect of medical care, the working time directive has brought in many changes here.  It has been very good for staff as regards working time and the hours they have to put in every week.  However, others would claim that there is less training as a result of the reduced working hours.  Now that the UK is going to be outside the European Union, the likelihood is that it will change some aspects of the working time directive.  How are we going to deal with that?</p><p>We have certain qualifying criteria, for example.  Has there been any indication that there will be changes to these in terms of the training of nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists or doctors, including GPs?  Has the issue been discussed?</p></speech>

I will ask people to contribute as we go through them.  The question on what might change was helpful.  People may not have seen it, but I saw a headline in <i>The Times</i>of London<i>.  </i>It summarised, albeit inaccurately, the position outlined in my opening statement by saying that medicines would be fine but cross-Border services would be impacted.  That is not what I said in my opening statement.  I am happy to say that we do not expect the North-South arrangements to be affected by Brexit.  That is not the basis on which either jurisdiction is planning.  When I referred to the general proposition that Brexit would change our lives and have implications for all sectors, it was not the cross-Border arrangements that we operate that I was thinking about.  I can provide examples of what I was thinking about, though.<br/><br/>We have strong North-South relationships.  We have provided capital for the opening of the radiotherapy unit in Altnagelvin.  We were there at the design stage and the commissioning stage.  We pay for the service that we get, as we do for the primary cardiac catheterisation service at Altnagelvin and some other services in the North.  Equally, our colleagues in the North are providing for the capital development of Crumlin so that children from the North with congenital heart defects can be treated at that hospital.  The North will pay the revenue costs of that.  All this is founded on the patient outcomes that can be produced by working together, and we are confident that the arrangements will be sustained through this period of disruption.<br/><br/>The arrangements are largely governed by service-level agreements.  In some cases, we have contributed to the capital costs.  In many cases, we are meeting the revenue costs.  Currently, they do not go up to Brussels and back down to the other jurisdiction.  Rather, they go directly from the HSE to the facilities in Altnagelvin or elsewhere.  We are confident in that regard.  Mr. Hennessy can discuss the detailed engagement that has been happening.<br/><br/>The private health insurers have assured us that they are not planning for an impact on those with coverage.  I will address an important point that did not come across in the question.  I believe I am right in saying that the health insurance policy of an Irish person who is working and resident in the UK will be written in the UK.  The VHI or another insurer would write insurance for people who were resident in Ireland, but if they were non-resident in Ireland, they would either get their insurance from the countries they were resident in or would get international health insurance policies.  This issue is more likely to arise in respect of someone who is resident in Ireland but who, in the course of his or her business or leisure, is in the UK or US when something happens.  That is something with which insurers are familiar.  In general, people do not use their private insurance to access healthcare in the UK on a planned basis unless that care is not available in Ireland, in which instance specific arrangements apply.  We have heard back from the insurers that there will be no change in this area.  They have examined the issue.<br/><br/>Regarding the question on training, a great deal of work has been done by our professional regulators.  This is an example of where Brexit changes the situation.  If someone trains in the EU, his or her qualification is automatically recognised in other EU member states and no one in their regulators can raise an issue about it.  However, the UK will become a third country and there will not be automatic recognition unless an overall deal is done by it and the EU to recognise qualifications.  There have been discussions in the context of the future relationship.  In the absence of a deal, we will put in place an administratively seamless approach between regulators.  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, NMBI, is already informing itself on the qualifications in the UK and will not have to go through a long check when it receives an application from a nurse trained in the UK.  It will deal with that application within the current timeframes.<br/><br/>The Senator asked a good question about what would happen if the UK diverged over time.  That does not relate to the EU's working time directive principally, as the UK could diverge from the directive without it having an implication for the quality of the qualification.  Obviously, Ireland would stay with the EU standards.  However, if the UK diverged in the period ahead - we have no indication that it will, and I am referring to years from now anyway as opposed to just months - and decided to define the qualifications to be a professional in a different way from the EU, rendering them no longer equivalent, it would raise issues for our regulators and we would have to re-examine the situation.  Similarly, if the UK decided to diverge from EU food standards five or ten years after leaving, it would pose a risk for all of our interactions with it and is something that we would have to watch.  It would not be an issue for 2019, but it would have to be examined and is likely to be one of the issues addressed in the future relationship between the EU and the UK.</p></speech>

I refer in particular to junior doctors.  If someone does 48 hours per week in Ireland and the UK diverges from the working time directive as regards training and allows someone to work up to 60 or 65 hours per week, the long-term effect on Irish people who have done two or three years of training in Ireland before going to the UK could be that they would not get the same recognition.</p> <p>  Regarding the exchange between Ireland and the UK of people working in medical services, many junior doctors stay in Ireland for two or three years before going to the UK for another three or four years and then returning.  It is important that this co-operation on training continues.  Otherwise, both countries will suffer.  An eye should be kept on this.</p></speech>

The Nurses and Midwives Act 2011 provides for the NMBI to enter into agreements with third countries for the purpose of mutual recognition.  That will allow the registration bodies in both jurisdictions to say that there is equivalence and that people can seamlessly move back and forth.  The same applies in the case of the Medical Council.  The bodies involved may need to change their internal rules somewhat, but given the historic linkages and the equivalence that we currently enjoy, the latter is something that all regulators on the two islands wish to continue.</p> <p>  I do not know what the UK's plans on the working time directive are.  I do not mean to disagree with the Senator, but the essential point is not the number of hours, but the quality of the training in the course of those hours.</p></speech>

The feedback from that process does not reveal significant concerns in the short term but, obviously, there is a need to monitor any divergence in standards over the longer term.  That will be a priority.</p> <p>  My colleague, Ms Keon, has been closely involved in dealing with the North-South relationships.  Several joint workshops have been held with representatives of the health services in the North and in the South with a view to ensuring a seamless transition to the post-Brexit situation.  They have addressed specific services such as those I mentioned in the opening statement where extensive agreements are in place.  The agreements relating to cardiac, radiotherapy, paediatric cardiac and other services have been tested to ensure that they would withstand any kind of Brexit and we are satisfied that they will.  We have been working on ensuring a seamless transition on the reimbursement issue and the funding implications in terms of issues such as the cross-border directive such that the current reimbursement arrangements or very similar will be maintained and patients will not be unduly discommoded.</p></speech>

It was late in the day before I started thinking about the impact it may have on our health sector.  How can we ensure that the general public understand what is happening or could happen with regard to Brexit?

What is Mr. Breslin's view on the potential difficulties in regard to recognising qualifications in England?</p> <p>  He referred to the various groups set up to consider the implications of Brexit.

We have issued public statements and it is outlined in the contingency action plan.  We have convened stakeholders for discussions, particularly in the area of medicine supply, on which it is very important that there is good clear public information.  Later today I will write to stakeholders with whom we had a very good meeting last week, including representatives of the pharmaceutical industry, the Irish Pharmacy Union, which represents community pharmacists, and a range of other stakeholders in order to ensure that we are all aware of the exact situation regarding medicine supplies.  As stated earlier, it is very important that people understand that this is a sophisticated industry with well-developed supply chains and some of the largest multinationals in the world delivering medicines to community pharmacists through very well established and resourced wholesalers.  The HPRA, the HSE and the Department are working with the industry to pre-empt any issues.  As per my opening statement, we are confident that there are no current issues.  However, medicine shortage can arise even without Brexit, so we will remain vigilant.  If an issue arises, we will put actions in place to resolve it as quickly as possible.  We are confident that there is adequate provision and that wholesalers routinely hold sufficient stock to bridge any problems that may arise at the ports.  The important message is that there is no need for patients, retail pharmacists or hospitals to increase stock levels or ask for extra prescriptions.  To do so would suck product out of the supply chain, which might produce a shortage and mean a person who needs the medicine would not be able to get it.  That is a very important public message which we are seeking to promote.  We will continue to review this matter with industry representatives.  As Mr. Hennessy outlined, we are considering categories of medicines and product lines.  In addition to receiving the message from the industry that it has done the preparations - and we are very appreciative of its work in that regard - we are verifying the availability of the most critical medicines and asking the industry to be definitive in regard to how the product will be delivered and that there will be sufficient supply.  All of the information to date indicates that the work is proceeding and that there is satisfaction in respect of adequate supply.  That is important information which we are promoting to the public.  It would be great if something sensible could be done in Westminster to conclude an agreement as that would render all of this damage limitation unnecessary.  However, we will continue with it because of the uncertainty.  We will continue to make that information publicly available.  Obviously, as we get closer to Brexit, we will make further information available.</p> <p>  The potential impact on the flow of patients between Ireland and the UK for specialist services is also a source of public concern.  As I stated, we are working to ensure that will continue and are confident that it will.  The authorities in the UK are very anxious to facilitate it.  As Mr. Hennessy outlined, service agreements have been reached regarding individual circumstances such as cancer or cardiac care in Altnagelvin hospital or other arrangements which we facilitate.  We are confident those agreements will withstand any issues that arise out of Brexit.  Those are probably the two most important messages I wish to send to the public today.</p> <p>  On the Medical Practitioners Act, as previously outlined, we envisage that the Medical Council will examine its current rule set.  Should the UK crash out, an EU-recognised qualification would no longer suffice to practice in the UK.  Rather, doctors there would require GMC UK-recognised qualification.  We understand the implications of that.  Once we are satisfied that a person has such a qualification, we will put him or her through an administrative procedure similar to that in regard to recognition for EU qualifications but which will no longer be automatic.</p></speech>

A person with a French qualification will automatically be recognised.  A person with a UK qualification will not have to undergo the same depth of analysis as a person from a third country with which we have no relationship.  There will be a fast-track system but it will differ from the process for holders of EU-recognised qualifications.  Our regulators will put back-to-back arrangements in place with their equivalents in the UK to allow that to function.</p> <p>  I refer to the Brexit operation team.</p><p>I hope colleagues will have a chance to provide the committee with detail of the importance of that team.  The HPRA, the HSE and the Food Safety Authority have been working on this issue for two years and a tremendous amount of work has been done.  After Christmas we decided that the cycle of work and the response would speed up considerably to the end of March and beyond.  Rather than have meetings every three or four weeks, we need a functional team from across the agencies and the Department which has a leadership and meets every week.  In between the weekly meetings there will be constant bilateral engagement.  If the HPRA needs to work with the HSE on a medicine supply issue, it can do so between meetings and report back on the Monday when the operations team convenes again.  The Department is providing the leadership for the team to ensure it will all happen in real time.  There has been very good collaboration over two years, but we have speeded up its intensity and integrated to a greater extent.  It is focusing on the full range of Brexit tasks we will have to undertake under many of the differing headings.  It is providing a central point for the agencies to feed into the Department.  It is also allowing the Department to feed into central government.  When we talk to the Department of the Taoiseach or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, we will do so having freshly left a conversation with the HPRA, the HSE and the Food Safety Authority and with the most up-to-date information possible.  It also permits a joined-up stakeholder engagement and communications piece.  On Wednesday last Mr. Goodman led a meeting with medicines stakeholders.  It was the full range of the industry, regulators and professionals working in the area.  He did so with representatives of the HPRA and the HSE in the room.  Everybody heard the same thing at the same time.  It is important in responding rapidly to an evolving situation that people move at the same speed.  That is the purpose of the Brexit operations team.</p></speech>

Will HPRA recognition and approval of drugs process change after Brexit?  I presume existing drugs will be recognised.  As new drugs come from the United Kingdom, however, will there be a different process of recognition and approval?</p></speech>

In the light of Brexit, changes to these regulatory pathways must take place.  Where there are activities which are conducted in the United Kingdom such as manufacturing or the batch release or testing of medicines, in the light of Brexit they must be changed to another EU member state.  In the case of existing licensed medicines, where there is a dependence on the United Kingdom for the activities to be conducted or where the UK agency was the lead agency in the technical evaluation of the medicines, all of these issues have to be transferred.  That is one consequence of Brexit.  Preparations have been under way at European level since 2016 and are advancing.  The vast majority of the changes have been made, but in fairness to the committee, I note that we are aware of some companies within the United Kingdom which supply both that market and the Irish market which have not as yet made the regulatory changes.  The other system is that after the United Kingdom leaves the European Union and becomes a third country, the EU 27 will continue to authorise medicines as it currently does and Ireland will continue to be part of that system.  The United Kingdom will separate from that process.  We are working on arrangements with the United Kingdom for things like joint packaging.  Because we have a common language, for a lot of the medicines supplied here and in the United Kingdom there is joint packaging.  Joint packaging with third countries will be an acceptable process.  We have worked on solutions to maintain the supply of medicines to the market and ensure we will have sufficient contingency plans in place.</p></speech>

At this point, we are working with the companies involved.  In many cases, we will have sufficient alternatives to those medicines and will not necessarily be reliant on them.  This is part of the criticality assessment exercise on which we are working.  If it comes down to dependency on a medicine, we are open to looking at pragmatic ways to transition across the period after Brexit to allow supply to continue to the market.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the preparatory work already done and congratulate the delegates on the options they have covered.  Dipping a little further into the food quality controls that will apply, as a third country the United Kingdom will import from and export to third countries and, presumably, the European Union.  If there is no agreement and it is a crash-out, the scenery will be slightly different.  Will adequate controls be in place to ensure the quality and standards applicable throughout the European Union will continue to prevail, given, in particular, that we will be in the European Union, while the United Kingdom will not?  Is it envisaged that an EU standard will be applicable?  I acknowledge the common travel area, but I am a little worried about the extent to which it will prevail if the standards to which we have become accustomed in the European Union continue to apply.</p></speech>

It is a different conversation than for product movement between the United Kingdom and the European Union post-Brexit.  Obviously, we have an interest in food safety in that context.  Significant preparations are under way.  The HSE's environmental health service has responsibility for food safety as it relates to food of non-animal origin, while the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has responsibility for foods of animal origin.  Broadly, that is how the division of responsibility works.  For example, we have approved 61 additional environmental health officers for the HSE.  They will carry out physical checks and checks on documentation in the importation of foods.  Currently, arrangements are in place for third country importation.  If foods come from outside the European Union and land in Dublin Port as their first port of entry to the European Union, the environmental health service personnel at the port go through the products to ensure they are acceptable for supply to the Irish market.  They do this on a risk basis and do not have to go through every product.  They look at the nature of the product and decide what to inspect.</p> <p>  In the event that there is a crash-out, products coming from the United Kingdom would have to be subject to the same regime.  That means taking a risk-based approach where we would look at the nature of the products, while the environmental health service would make a decision, based on the documentation, on what was worthy of physical inspection.  That would involve a logistical operation, in particular at Dublin Port, on the part of the environmental health service of the HSE, officers from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Revenue customs officials.  While such an operation is already in place, it will have to be beefed up considerably.  If a ship arrives from the United Kingdom, officials will have to look at the cargo details, lorries and importers, of which they will have to receive advance notice.  They will look at the products involved and a determination that might be made would be for the environmental health service to inspect two lorries off that ship.  Revenue will act as the co-ordination mechanism and issue a message to the haulier to the effect that the lorry must be presented for inspection.  It would not get to exit the port without that inspection.  The lorry and its cargo would be presented for inspection by environmental health officers before it could go on its way.</p><p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine could do the same for meat or similarly the Revenue in the case of a customs issue.  The logistical operation in the port has been carefully planned to ensure that, on a risk basis, we have controls in place but the free flow of traffic continues.  It is to ensure that the truck driver who does not have any issues can get off the ship and out of Dublin Port without experiencing traffic jams.  Those who are subject to inspection will obviously experience some delay as their products are examined.  That is one of the consequences of moving out of the EU.  People importing from the UK into Ireland will be subject in some cases to a check of documentation or a physical inspection based on risk.  That is not the case now.</p></speech>

There did not seem to be any great backlogs at ports or airports.  It was done efficiently and effectively.  I presume cognisance has been taken of that to put something comparable in place now.</p><p>I will move on very quickly to the supply of drugs.  I have listened to some of our colleagues in the UK predicting a doomsday situation for this country after the UK leaves.  To what extent has the Department considered their views?  Are there any particular drugs or range of drugs that might be controlled to an extraordinary extent by third countries?  That is what the UK will become.  What has been our experience in dealing directly with third countries heretofore regarding compliance and availability?  How are generic drugs likely to be affected?  I presume that has been examined.</p><p>On access to healthcare for children, in the run up to the provision of our own new national children's hospital, what arrangements are in place with third countries?  I refer to the UK and others.  To what degree is remuneration readily available?  We can still do that after Brexit.  Will Mr. Breslin, however, give us some indication of the other countries besides the UK with which we have such arrangements?  My understanding is that any bilateral arrangements require EU approval because we are, and will remain, a part of the EU.  I would like some clarification on that issue, just in case we find ourselves in some kind of a cul-de-sac at a later stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.435" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Breslin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019013000002#K00300"><p>I might ask the HPRA and the HSE to come in on the drugs supply issue as well.  The starting point is that there is a significant routing of medicines from the UK, either originating there and landing in Ireland or being sourced from there.  Up to 70% of medicines on the Irish market are manufactured in the UK or transit through the UK.  When we talk about the supply chain, and modification of the supply chain, individual manufacturers have looked at that.  Some have made arrangements, for example, where the drug is manufactured on the Continent and is moved through the UK landbridge, while some have made arrangements to come directly to Ireland.</p> <p>  Others have decided that where a product was previously contained within a drop for the UK and Ireland, they will now separate out those two loads and send them separately via the landbridge.  Significant supply chain modification is under way.  Much of that depends on the characteristics of the medicine.  If a particular medicine has a long shelf life and little potential for disruption due to a delay at a port, then there is more flexibility on the part of the manufacturer and the distribution chain.  Particular areas examined include medicines with a short shelf life, as Mr. Hennessy referenced.  A delay could lead to a product expiring.  The HSE and the HPRA have reached out to those suppliers in particular to seek reassurance and verification that arrangements in place will not be disrupted.</p> <p>  In general, the arrangements in place in Ireland for the supply of medicines are quite distinct from those in the UK.  We are an island and we have a wholesale distribution system very different from that of the UK.  We also have significant stocks held domestically within our supply chain.  That will be the first port of call if any immediate issues were to arise.  We are working with a range of stakeholders in the medicines industry to ensure they have the proper capability to respond to any disruption that might arise.  The scale of the thousands of medicines involved requires individual level preparation and planning.  In respect of critical medicines, we have an exercise under way to look at alternatives, to look at supply chains and to verify what is under way.</p> <p>  As of today, we have no issue which we are declaring will be a problem or disrupted.  We will continue to engage right up to Brexit and beyond to ensure that stays the case.  There is a background issue.  The Irish market has been very intermingled with the UK market.  Potentially, over the medium term rather than in the next weeks, manufacturers or suppliers may look at the Irish market as a smaller market post Brexit.  We were part of a huge UK-Ireland market.  For some people, we will now be an Irish market of 4.5 million people without a great supply requirement.  We may experience a situation relating to our size, as other countries do, where some suppliers decide it is not worth supplying into such a market or they may want to supply on different terms.  We will have to watch that in the medium term post Brexit.  It is not an immediate issue.</p> <p>  Generic medicines are potentially an issue.  Down the road, some suppliers might consider that extra work is required to get into this market, more documentation is needed and not much is sold.  They might then question what is the point in continuing.  We have to look at all of those situations.  In many cases, because we are dealing with generic drugs, the active ingredients are being manufactured by others.  One supplier, therefore, making a decision not to supply the Irish market might not be crucial if other generic suppliers provide the same active ingredient or the originator is still on the market.  I ask the HPRA to expand on that matter.  I ask Mr. Hennessy to speak about the children's services and existing linkages.  Regarding our ability to conduct bilateral agreements, the EU-UK withdrawal agreement and the negotiations in Brussels specifically recognise the common travel area as a distinct feature of the Irish-UK relationship and gives us a licence to give that expression post Brexit.</p></speech>

I will just add some more information.  On Deputy Durkan's question on doomsday scenario predictions in the UK regarding medicines supply, Mr. Breslin outlined very well the logistical preparations the industry is making.  We have to remember that, in most cases, the industry has been preparing for almost three years.  The industry has great expertise in logistics, knows how to split off supply from Ireland and examine different routing for medicines to come into the country.</p> <p>  In addition, the wholesale distribution model in Ireland is very different from the UK.  We hold much larger buffer stocks at the wholesale level than the UK.  In general, we hold six to eight weeks of stock.  We have, therefore, a mechanism within that system giving us the capacity to maintain supply even if there are delays in getting medicines transported to and from the UK.  Our system is more flexible and adaptable because different mechanisms evolved in the UK supply chain compared with the Irish situation.</p> <p>  Mr. Breslin spoke of generic medicines.  The generic medicines industry works on smaller margins in respect of supplying medicines to the marketplace.  Brexit, as we have said, does mean change.  The cost of supply to the market may go up.</p><p>We do not anticipate that there will be a major impact in the aftermath of or at the end of March, but what we may see over time is a rationalisation by the industry of portfolios of medicines that are supplied into the Irish market.  We do have systems for dealing with this.  Mr. Breslin mentioned that the HPRA has a co-ordinating role in respect of shortages of medicines.  We have a framework that has been put in place within the past six months and which is operating very well and has very good capability for managing shortages.  The main thing in all our Brexit contingency planning, which has been ongoing for quite some time, is that we have very close engagement with the industry and receive real-time updates from it.  The operational meeting to which Mr. Breslin referred gives us a mechanism to be able to react to an evolving situation very carefully.  Therefore, with very careful monitoring and with issues occurring over time, the situation has the capability to be very well managed if there is rationalisation of generics.  We also have quite an extensive supply of generic medicines in the Irish market.  The Deputy may be familiar with the interchangeable lists of medicines published by the HPRA.  This is the list of generic medicines that are available in the Irish marketplace.  It is an aid used at pharmacy level for changing patients-----</p></speech>

These are medicines that are brought into the country.  What I am saying is that we have adequate supplies and there is no immediate concern.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan raised a point about third countries, bringing medicines in from them and how the system can adapt to that.  The European system, of which Ireland is a part, is very well used to dealing with third countries.  It is actually set up to allow for importation of medicines from third countries.  There are additional regulatory requirements that must be put in place if we bring in medicines.  This is where the product must go through a process called batch release testing.  The developments in Europe over the past two years in preparation for the UK withdrawal have meant that much of the transfer of these activities into other European countries for certain medicines has transferred to Ireland, so we have good capability to address that situation as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.441" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hennessy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019013000002#L00400"><p>To add a quick point to that, high-volume, low-priced medicines are a very specific part of the contingency planning.  I echo Dr. Nolan's point that we do not have huge concerns in the short term, but in the medium to longer term there may be issues around continuity of supply and perhaps price implications, seeing as Ireland is such a small component of the market for those products.  My colleague, Mr. Swords, has been working on a number of these areas, including medical-surgical supplies, in order to ensure continuity and availability, but there are no major concerns emerging in the short term.  In the medium to longer term we will need to monitor matters carefully.  As Dr. Nolan mentioned, however, of their nature, there is interchangeability and alternatives may have to be sourced, but we are particularly conscious that there are high numbers of patients, particularly those with chronic illnesses, who are on these medicines who would have become reliant on or used to the same products for perhaps a considerable amount of time.  We are not underestimating the issue for a moment but it represents more of a longer-term concern rather than a short-term one in the context of Brexit.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan referred to children.  The treatment abroad scheme covers this pretty extensively for both adults and children.  However, children represent a niche in the context of transplant services in particular.  We have a very close relationship with a small number of UK tertiary sites that provide these specialist services.  The numbers would not be sufficient to provide that level of service within the island of Ireland.  Our planning focus - and there has been very extensive planning on this - is on ensuring that this access route remains open and available, and the agreements with the individual sites in the UK are developed in order to ensure that post Brexit.  As I said, though, the particular concern, and where there would not necessarily be readily available alternatives to UK sites, is in the area of transplants for children.</p> <p>  I do not know if Mr. Hennessy wishes to add anything.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.442" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019013000002#L00500"><p>Has the HSE revised any of that with a view to an alternative in the event of there being a difficulty gaining access to the UK site, either for children or for adults?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.443" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hennessy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019013000002#L00600"><p>We have done some work on that.  The concern would be, as I think the Secretary General mentioned, that very close relationships have developed and grown over the years between Ireland and the UK on the basis of consultant-to-consultant referral, and there is a high degree of comfort among Irish clinicians about these sites in terms of the service they provide.  To be frank and truthful, it would be difficult in the short term to develop alternatives across mainland Europe for many of these services.  Therefore, our efforts are on ensuring that continuity remains post Brexit in the short term, at least with the UK sites.  Over time, we will look to develop relationships with alternative providers.  Again, to be fair, there is treatment abroad activity in other continental countries from Ireland that we want to develop, but I do not think any of us would like to be reliant on that in the short term and, therefore, we need to maintain our connections with the UK sites.</p></speech>

The question was asked whether there is any learning from what has happened in the UK and so on.  Over a year ago the UK Government issued a kind of intention, a directive, stating that it wanted to stockpile certain items as far as six months for all the companies.  At that time, we had been in discussions with our supply chain people in the drugs, medical-surgical and food areas.  They are the three key areas on which we have concentrated for Brexit.  Nonetheless, the key to any supply chain is an even flow of product rather than stockpiling because stockpiling actually creates difficulties.  This is evident now in that some hospitals in the UK are finding it difficult to get product even though there is enough product in the country.  There is an abundance of product in some areas.  The hospitals do not have it when they need it, though, which means there is a redistribution and a cost associated with that.  Our strategy has been to keep an even flow of product.  As Dr. Nolan, Mr. Breslin and Mr. Hennessy stated, we have enough stock in the country at any given time to allow us to plan forward.</p> <p>  To give the committee a bit of an idea of this, we have a national logistics plan in the HSE and a national distribution centre with nine hubs around the country, which we use to supply out into community and hospitals.  We have six weeks' worth of stock at any given time across 6,000 stock-keeping units which supply on a regular basis the items that are required and used in the hospitals.  That is one area of security, and we will monitor it as we go forward.  As for drugs, we have met representatives of all the umbrella companies and are meeting representatives of the main distribution companies to see what they have in place and to reassure ourselves that the stock is there.  We have been very encouraged by what we have found.  As Dr. Nolan said, there is six to eight weeks' stock in wholesale.  There is a further number of weeks' worth of stock in the manufacturing process at any given time, and there lies the secret to our success in maintaining that supply in an even way and not knee-jerking across the system and causing peaks and valleys, which could in fact have an effect on employment.  We have manufacturing in Ireland, so we do not want to disrupt any element of the supply chain.  It is a very refined and mature supply chain, and everyone is encouraging us not to overreact.  If we stay sensible on this and stay in communication, which is what we are doing, we will be able to see whether there will be a break on 29 March.  It is later in the year that we will see any real impact because we will start seeing the ports filling up or whatever.  Even allowing for that, and looking for securities of supply, particularly in the short-life areas, we have met the suppliers of products and they have brought in enough manufacturing raw materials for three months in some cases and are upping that in some cases to eight weeks on the overall supply.  We are learning all the time about our supply chains and probably getting more information than we have ever had and more education on how we will deal with any shortages.  The shortages framework has worked very well.</p> <p>  To move from the area of drugs and more into the area of food, there are shortages on an ongoing basis in food supply.  One of our main suppliers of ambient food sources products from all over the world.  They bring shortages to our attention from time to time and we discuss any shortages they have with our catering officers who are on the ground providing the services within health.</p><p>We agree any changes that have to take place to ensure that a spurious product does not get into the supply chain.  That is very closely monitored by our catering officers.  It is a good example of day to day shortages happening within a supply chain.  We have to maintain that and keep an even flow of product, and encourage everybody to be sensible about it.</p><p> There are 1,800 pharmacies which take deliveries 11 times per week on average, through the distribution service.  There are numerous pharmacies in different communities.  They rely on each other, and it is a very mature and well-stocked system.  There is up to four weeks of supply in the individual pharmacies and six to eight weeks in the supply chain.  We do not see shortages arising at the moment.  There is no difficulty with that; it is well managed.  It is encouraging that there is such a large amount of communication going on at the moment.  We have written to more than 300 of our main suppliers and have had 70% of them write back.  Much of the information in that correspondence states that they have examined their supply chain and that they are looking at six to eight weeks, and in some cases three to six months.  Generic medicines were mentioned.  Some smaller companies are actually stocking up to six to 12 months worth of product.  They are making sure that we will not face an interruption of supply.  </p><p> It is important to note that we deal extensively with distributors, and because of that we have options within our supply chain.  We have been rationalising our logistics operation within health over the last number of years and are bringing efficiencies into it.  We are currently extending that process into the Dublin region.  We are reducing our inventory in many areas.  On average we keep two to three weeks of stock in hospitals across all of our areas, but we rely on each other in the event of any shortage in any given area.  We are in control of our information, and we are getting better and better at it.  While Brexit poses different problems and questions for us, we are in a position to answer those questions.  Our one risk, if it can be called that, is that there may be a delay of product, but there is enough in the system to sustain a shock.  </p><p> On the question of drugs that might be required on a short-term basis with a quick turnaround time, customs officials have indicated to us that, where paperwork is in place, it will provide a blue light service.  That is as good as it gets.  We have spoken to suppliers, and instead of just using road, rail and shipping to deliver the products we will also use air freight.  Those arrangements are in place with some of the companies at this point in time.  We are examining the issues and going out to meet our main supplies to ensure they understand where we are coming from and to make sure that we are working together on this issue.  </p></speech>

My colleague, Senator Burke, mentioned young health professionals going to the UK to gain experience.  That is invaluable; I spent some time in south Wales and completed my GP scheme there.  Young health professionals gain invaluable experience by working in a different jurisdiction.  This is probably an issue for postgraduate organisations, but if a young doctor completed his or her GP scheme in the UK, gained qualification and became a member of the Royal College of General Practitioners, ICGP, perhaps that could be reciprocated with a membership of the Irish College of General Practitioners on returning to Ireland.  We hope they will return to Ireland to address some of the shortages we have here.</p> <p>  We had a long discussion about drugs, and I recognise the collaboration between the Department, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, and the HSE.  I also acknowledge the challenges for refrigerated products and products with short shelf lives.  The vaccines were mentioned; are we happy that two months supply is enough?  I presume the witnesses were discussing childhood vaccinations.  Are travel vaccinations also covered under that grouping?  There is also a question about cancer drugs, and immunotherapy and biological agents.  Mr. Breslin mentioned critical medicines, but biological agents fall under that critical medicines banner.  Often with rheumatological diseases, for example rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, consultants will go straight in with a biological agent to get a patient's symptoms under control quickly.  Previously they might have used a disease modifying agent and built up to using a biological agent.  It is nowadays often a first-line treatment.  The demand for that product is obviously higher.  They are used in such a variety of cases, including gastrointestinal cases or joint cases.  Are the witnesses quite happy that we have enough of those types of drugs available?  I agree that we have good links with multinational companies and that there are excellent wholesalers in the country.  The witnesses correctly said that medicine shortages are an ongoing issue, with or without Brexit, but as a GP on the ground I am beginning to see patients requesting extra drugs because people are seeing the charade and disorganisation in the British Parliament and combining it with the 29 March deadline looming.  GPs are once again acting as gatekeepers in a role they did not think they would have.  We are trying to reassure people, but would the witnesses consider redoubling the efforts to get the message out to the public on the ground in the form of a media awareness campaign, with radio and TV, for example?  People are asking for more inhalers and more blood pressure drugs.  People who are using these biological agents are concerned that the consultants will not be sending the high-tech scripts down to their local pharmacy in order that the local pharmacy would dispense them.</p> <p>  As professionals we can be reassured by the comments made here today.  However, there is a bit of a disconnect on the ground.  People are obviously worried about their conditions, and I believe a public awareness campaign would really help to benefit that cohort of patients.  </p></speech>

Included in that is the ICGP.  It is important that networks of GPs are given the knowledge so that when a patient attends, the GP is able to tell them key things about it.  We will look at this issue.  We have a communications team in place to do that.  At the moment we are getting great free messaging out because people are asking questions, like the members present today, and the newspapers are writing about it.  As we come closer to the time we will think about putting our own public messaging out.  We have to think about the best way to do that.  If we tell people what we do not want them to do, they think that is perhaps what they should do.  That is why working through professionals is really important.  We must involve the Irish Pharmacy Union, IPU, and the ICGP so that the local community pharmacist is able to discern the real situation and tell clients what it is.  We will be doing more and more of that.</p> <p>  The point about medicine shortages already being a feature is absolutely correct.  There are 45 medicines on a current list at the moment, but with the HPRA and stakeholders we have put a medicine shortage framework in place to address those.  The last thing we want to happen - but which probably will happen in the period ahead - is that shortages in the near future will be blamed on Brexit.  There is every chance that the problem will be due to a manufacturing issue or an issue that has arisen for a completely different reason.  We must remain clear on what the source of the delays is and to work with stakeholders to explain it, while not allowing erroneous information to make its way into our system.  </p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Swords or the HPRA to talk about the critical medicines assessment process, but we are interested in building on the overall message we have received from manufacturers and wholesalers that there is a plan for this and that there is a sufficient amount of medicine.</p><p>In the case of medicines where, because of their characteristics there could be a critical issue if they were not available, we want an additional layer of verification.  We are doing that by category.  It is important that one has a medicine within the category one would be able to prescribe in that situation.  There would be some interchangeability.  The health professionals are doing this.  Doctors, through clinical programmes, and pharmacists are identifying, say, four medicines of which we need a supply.  If there was a problem with one, we would still be okay with the other three.  That involves more detailed conversations where one is looking for an additional layer of reassurance and verification.  We are going through this process.  It is not completed and we will keep refreshing it as we go along.</p><p> The important point is that just because a medicine is critical, does not mean that it is one about which we are concerned.  It could be critical in coming directly to Ireland from the Continent and there could be no disruption.  It could have features to it which mean even a short delay of a week or two might not impact our supply.  We must not just examine ones that are critical but also examine the current supply chain.  That is the level of analysis we are bringing to bear on this.</p><p> I am not certain if the travel vaccination is in this process.  It is probably in the more general process of checking levels and working with manufacturers.</p><p> It is not just about medicines which end up in hospitals but those that the public will need.  That includes medicines dispensed through retail pharmacy and prescribed by GPs.  We have to take a public health view of this, not just looking at the ones which we order.  We have to understand that some medicines will be critical but will be dispensed in the community.  They can be just as important as medicines dispensed in hospitals.</p></speech>

I read through the submissions and I apologise for being late.</p> <p>  The evidence suggests there is a struggle to recruit nurses and other healthcare professionals.  Is there any sense within the groups working on this that Brexit will have a negative or positive impact on the health sector workforce?  Much work has been done, which is welcome.  We had an engagement previously where the same level of work or engagement was not obvious.  Is someone examining the implication for workforce planning?  There is mutual recognition of qualifications which has been discussed previously.  My sense is that the British health service has aggressively recruited staff because it has a fear of the implications of Brexit for its staffing numbers.  Is this being countered?</p> <p>  It was stated in the submissions that the HSE is continuing to work on awareness of Brexit among HSE and health service staff generally, key suppliers, patients and with the public.  I appreciate the dilemma because we do not want to panic people.  We have been focused on Brexit for a long time.  However, more people are beginning to focus their attention on it and they are concerned.  I have spoken to people who are nervous and asking whether they should get a six months supply with their next prescription.  There will be an issue if everybody starts stockpiling.  I respect it can be tricky but has any consideration been given to a media campaign?  It should be more than just talking to the professionals and somewhere along the lines of radio, television or newspaper advertisements.</p> <p>  The Department stated it would be impossible in a no-deal scenario to maintain the current seamless arrangements between the EU and the UK across a range of sectors that are currently facilitated by our common EU membership.  There is no such thing as a good Brexit.  We said this repeatedly and nobody majority on the island voted for it.  However, we are where we are.  In the event of a no-deal scenario, where will the first implications hit?  Will there be a requirement at that stage for legislative change or will it have to come in advance of that?</p> <p>  Last weekend, I attended a conference in Belfast and was also at the Border Communities against Brexit protest, where people asked me about cross-Border health services.  For example, GP out-of-hours services operate between Keady and Castleblayney, and Altnagelvin and Inishowen.  They work well because they are geographically close.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, will these services continue?  Is it anticipated that there will be a break in some services while alternative arrangements are made?  I recognise it is not the fault of any person in this room that we find ourselves where we are.  However, is it anticipated that there will be a break and then it will be necessary to restore those services or is it anticipated that services will continue seamlessly?</p> <p>  I asked if service level agreements had been Brexit-proofed at a previous committee meeting.  It was a year ago and the answer was, "We did not know".  I appreciate that at that stage nobody could have predicted how this would go.  The level of unpreparedness in Britain and its impact on us is a concerns.  It is clear that while we could do all the work to prepare ourselves, we are geographically close to people who may undo any good work that might be done. </p></speech>

We have confidence in that.  Mr. John Hennessy has spoken about the Brexit-proofing of service level agreements, which has been completed.  He spoke about co-operation and working together, CAWT, because some of those arrangements are under a co-operation mechanism which we have.  We are not anticipating anything in that regard.<br/><br/>I noted early in the meeting that <i>The Times</i>Ireland edition jumped from a general statement about Brexit at large to Secretary General says medicines will be okay but cross-Border services are going to be impacted.  I did not say that.</p></speech>

One is in the area of food safety.  When product is moving east-west at the moment, it is moving within the EU.  If the UK crashes out, when product moves east-west, it will be coming from a third country and there will have to be a risk-based decision as to whether the documentation is pulled and there is a physical inspection.  We are putting 61 staff into the HSE to do that.  We are spending &euro;6 million on staff.  If we could have that &euro;6 million to spend on patient care, I would much prefer it, but because Brexit is happening, that is what we are doing.  Going from a situation that was seamless to one in which we have administrative overhead is an example of the impact Brexit has on this country and on the UK.</p><p> The Deputy referred to professional qualifications that are currently automatic.  We will have a procedure that makes it smooth and seamless but it will require an extra procedure.  It will not delay things, but while recognition of EU qualifications is automatic, we will have to have a means of saying we understand the standard of a UK qualification and will have to apply our system to recognise it here.  It is an extra layer that will have to be built in.</p><p> On the question of awareness, we are actively considering our communications strategy.  We are working through intermediaries, particularly health professionals, general practitioners and pharmacists, as well as patient groups.  Mr. Hennessy can speak on that.  There are particular patient groups that would have particular anxiety.  If we can give them information, they will be able to talk to their membership as well.  The Deputy asked about the content and timing.  We are actively considering pushing messaging out in a more visible, public way.</p></speech>

I do appreciate that it has to be balanced but it is something that cannot be ruled out at this stage.  Anecdotally, I have spoken to people who are planning to get a few extra just in case.  It is a question of putting people's minds at rest and assuring them there is no need to do that, and that if they do it, they will contribute to the problem rather than it being any solution.</p></speech>

The Bill whose heads were published is to be introduced before a no-deal crash out, which we hope will not happen.  That is subject to drafting and bringing the Bill through the Oireachtas.  The intention is that the legislation, which would sit above what we have talked about and would allow for the HSE to reimburse services in the UK that are treating Irish patients, for example, would go through before 29 March.</p> <p>  On workforce, there is a degree of speculation and it is not going to impact us immediately in April.  However, it will potentially change the global attractiveness of the UK.  One of the things that may happen is that professionals who are trained elsewhere in the EU may no longer find it attractive to go to the UK.  The UK is seized of that.  They may then find themselves running into shortages in the UK.  They are just as worried about non-professionally qualified healthcare staff such as cleaners, porters and other staff.  There may well be shortages in those areas because traditionally a lot of those posts have been filled by foreign nationals in the UK.  They may respond to that by looking for English-speaking health professionals and targeting us.  Equally, we would be more attractive in that situation because EU-qualified professionals who want to come to an English-speaking country will no longer have the UK to go to and may be interested in Ireland.  It is push and pull and it is hard to speculate.  We are working on getting the professional recognitions in place that would allow us to be able to move in the event of any patterns that develop.</p></speech>

I will ask Ms Keon to speak on the North-South dimension because she has been very close to Brexit-proofing the agreements between the various providers.  We mentioned some of them but the Deputy is right that the GP out of hours service is an important part of that programme as well.  We have been very conscious of the need for clear, reliable information for the public and for patients.  The committee is going to see evidence of a lot more proactive communication from this end over the next four to six weeks.  It has already kicked off with some stakeholders in respect of suppliers.  We are meeting the National Patients Forum, which has representation from most of the patient advocacy groups, especially those representing people with chronic conditions.  We are meeting it next week to provide information and assurance where necessary on particular issues like medicines and supplies.  We understand fully how people would be concerned about those things, and with the benefit of good, reliable information, we may be able to prevent the kind of stockpiling tendencies to which the Deputy referred.  We are watching closely at the supplier end as well to see if there are any unusual patterns of ordering from any particular sources.  Included in that programme of communication, as Senator Swanick mentioned, would be general practitioners, pharmacists and prescribers generally to help assure people about supply chains and to try to manage it.</p> <p>  The Secretary General has covered most of the workforce issues.  The HSE HR department has analysed in great detail the Brexit details across the spectrum of qualifications, training, education and recruitment.  We have a good handle on the implications there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.461" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Paula Keon" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019013000002#O00500"><p>The Deputy is correct about the GP out of hours service.  It is a very important part and I will get to it in a minute.  In fact, there have been 30 years of intensive cross-Border work between North and South.  For those of us who live on the Border, it is very much the norm to get a service in the other jurisdiction.  Since 1992 there has been a formal arrangement, the Ballyconnell agreement, whereby services North and South set up the cross-Border organisation, Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT.  That was done largely using European INTERREG funding to seed projects North and South to use economies of scale and find solutions that we could not otherwise find because of our geographic distance from the urban centres.  To Brexit-proof our current range of work, which is an INTERREG 5A &euro;30 million project, we have it underpinned by Her Majesty's Treasury.  With the Department of Health, we went to the UK to seek assurance that the current round of funding will be secured until the end of the programme of funding in 2020.  The future of European funding is obviously uncertain and probably part of the future arrangements.  We will have to see what happens there.  The current round of funding that seeds these projects is underpinned.</p> <p>  Outside the INTERREG funding there is a lot of North-South work going on.  The radiotherapy centre is very innovative and the only capital build in health on the island of Ireland with a ratio of two thirds to one third built and the same in respect of patients.  A second one is the primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI, which is clinically absolutely the solution for the patients of Donegal.  They only have a 90 minute window for their stents.  It is absolutely the solution for our patients.  We did a mapping exercise to look at all these service-level agreements and memorandums of understanding, including the ambulance service and GP out of hours service, which was the solution for 243 patients in 2018, as was noted earlier.  We have all of those mapped and they are underpinned by the common travel area.  As Mr. Breslin said, it is not anticipated that there would be any break in service on day one.</p></speech>

As has just been said, there is a commitment to continue with the current programme but the importance of building upon it is also being looked at.  Even in the context of no deal, I do not believe that Brussels will say that it is over with.  The UK authorities and ourselves are certainly committed to trying to continue with co-operation.</p></speech>

It is nice to see Mr. Breslin again.  I want to take up a few issues regarding the reality of the situation.  Deputy O'Reilly mentioned the anecdotal evidence.  My understanding is that people on the ground, and older people in particular, are stockpiling drugs, especially drugs with narrow therapeutic indexes and so on.  In the event that a GP has run off a six-month GMS prescription form and it is legally presented to a pharmacy which has stock on the shelf, Mr. Breslin will understand the conundrum of a pharmacist who is faced with a person who is concerned about the future.  Perhaps the person gets his or her news from Sky rather than the BBC or something else might feed his or her fears.  My understanding is that people on the ground are stockpiling and I am concerned about that.  I am sorry for being late, but I have heard various reports that we have approximately ten to 12 weeks of headroom in the supply chain for medication.  If people are getting six months' worth of prescriptions, that headroom will be depleted.</p> <p>  Often when a product is in short supply or is controlled, there is a limit to the number of packs a retail pharmacy can acquire in a month.  I assume somebody puts something into a computer and once a business has its 20 packs, it gets no more.  Has the Department imposed or considered imposing anything like that?  Has it considered limiting the monthly orders of retail pharmacies dealing with one of the big suppliers to 1.2 or 1.1 times what they ordered in the previous month?</p> <p>  There has been talk of a media campaign.  I urge caution in that regard because when one tells people not to stockpile, the first thing they do is get a truck and fill it full of tablets.  That is the nature of people and the survival instinct.  When it comes to supply issues, some of the products we get in through the UK include bespoke feed bags, total parenteral nutrition, TPN, and specials.  In this committee and within my own party I have heard conversations about how the Department has engaged with the manufacturers.  My understanding is that approximately 80% of some types of TPN comes from one place in the UK.  Are we sure that, if there is no deal and the UK crashes out on 29 March, we will be able to feed those people in April?  Do we have the capacity to supply ourselves as a stop-gap?  Does the Department have something in place so that somebody waiting for their nutrition in one of our acute hospitals will not be left hungry?</p> <p>  Regarding the marketing authorisations and dual labelling arrangements we have with the UK - and Dr. Nolan might be the expert on this - my understanding is that we have piggybacked on the UK for a long time in respect of packaging.  Most marketing authorisations are authorised through the UK where the qualified person, QP, is domiciled in the UK.  If there is a hard Brexit and the UK is not in the EU any more, the QPs who are authorising medications and who are responsible for pharmacovigilance will no longer be allowed to sign off because they will not be domiciled within the EU.  This leads to a conundrum where we speak English and nobody else does.  Are there provisions in this regard in the event of a no-deal Brexit?  Have we spoken to the Dutch or other friendly countries which might print the other side of their information leaflets in English?  Is there something in place to deal with the fact that we are piggybacking on the QPs in the UK, which may no longer be possible?</p> <p>  As a UK graduate, I am interested in professional qualifications.  The witnesses have said there will be an additional layer, but that assumes that the standards will stay the same.  With respect, that is only a short-term solution.  With regard to people who have graduated recently, it is unlikely that the UK will have allowed standards to fall too far by summer, but theoretically we can only add in that layer if there is alignment of standards.  Is there any plan for what happens thereafter?  I know we are talking about things that could happen based on whatever happens across the water.</p></speech>

We touched on the recognition of qualifications earlier, but there is a risk of divergence.  We have different scenarios.  We have a regulator-to-regulator arrangement that will be in place in the context of no deal, which is based on the fact that we know the standards are currently equivalent.  The most ideal scenario is an agreement to avoid no deal.  The next most ideal is that, in the future relationship between the UK and EU, something is concluded on recognising qualifications between the EU and UK.  That would be great.  We would then be fairly close to where we started.  In the event that the UK and Ireland have a bilateral arrangement, it will not be a bilateral arrangement so much as the two regulators understanding the qualifications in both jurisdictions and recognising them because they are equivalent.  If UK standards were no longer equivalent, it would be an issue for both regulators.  That will not happen by accident.  The UK would have to decide that it wants its professionals to be different from those of the EU.  That would be a big decision to be made in the UK.  Our regulator would have to make the implications of such a move very clear and plan for it were it to happen.  That is the same for the whole EU rule book.  It is not just about professional qualifications.  If the UK diverges from the EU in any element of standards, it will have implications for trade, movement and so on.  It is a big policy question for people in Westminster who have a lot on their minds at the moment.  If they got that freedom, how would they use it?</p> <p>  Moving on to the other areas, Dr. Nolan will certainly be able to talk on dual-labelling and marketing authorisation holders, MAHs.  She may also be able to talk on the TPN.  On shortages, it would helpful if the HPRA representatives talked about the medicines shortage framework.  From the contact the HPRA and the HSE are having with wholesalers, we know that they are looking at ordering to ensure that there are no artificial reasons for products being taken down.  They will continue to do that up to and beyond Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.467" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Lorraine Nolan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019013000002#P00500"><p>I will start where Mr. Breslin ended, which was on ordering, and work through questions in that way.  Wholesalers have a process for putting stock in allocation when there is a concern in respect of supply and availability.  As we work through and identify products that could be impacted - and we are not at that stage yet because we have not identified these products - those processes can be activated.  That system of controlling what is supplied to pharmacies exists and can be activated and put in place.</p> <p>  I will start with the TPN and compounded products.  The Deputy is right in that regard.  We have identified these as a category of products in respect of which particular risks will arise from Brexit because many of them have short shelf lives and some have particular storage requirements that it may not be possible to fulfil if there are delays in getting imports in through the ports.  We work with three TPN compounders and suppliers  in the UK.  We have engaged with these and with compounding companies based in Ireland.  In all cases, the companies have told us that their Brexit planning is well developed.  They have increased their stocks of component parts and are looking at the logistics of getting products into Ireland.  Some of this is routed through the UK but the companies are looking at flying it into Ireland directly.  We are engaging with them almost weekly to get updates in real time.  It is an evolving situation.  If we become aware of any concerns, we will take appropriate measures to address them.</p><p>We have not been informed of any concerns relating to those supplies.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned the conduct of regulatory activities, of which there are many because of the United Kingdom's history in pharmaceutical manufacturing, etc.  These include specifically mentioned activities such as QP batch release and pharmacovigilance QP residing in the United Kingdom.  Over the past two years, the regulatory system across the European network has been preparing widely for this and we have also been working with the companies.  It is the case that the vast majority of companies have worked to transfer those activities into the other EU 27 member states.  Some of that work, specifically in the area of quality control testing, for example, has been transferred to Ireland.  Similar transfers have happened with the batch release activities and the QPV.  We do not necessarily have any concerns about that.</p><p> Joint labelling has been an issue that we have been working extensively on, especially as 60% of the medicines supplied in Ireland have joint labels with the UK.  Ms Purcell will speak a little on that.  We have been exploring the possibilities of coming up with joint labelling with other EU member states and we have had quite extensive discussions with Scandinavian countries in that regard.  There are associated challenges because the look and feel of products will change very much for both healthcare professionals and patients but it is something we are developing as a contingency.</p></speech>

Having looked at the issue, we have publicly stated since Article 50 was invoked that provided the labels continued to meet the requirements of the EU directive, we will continue to accept UK-Ireland joint labels.  That position was slightly at odds with advice the Commission had given, and we have been lobbying very strongly on that.  I am very pleased that, as of last Wednesday, the Commission has accepted the Irish position.  Provided those labels remain within regulatory convergence, we will be able to accept UK label information on Irish packs.  We will continue to see Irish-UK labels.</p> <p>  Will there be regulatory divergence to address that risk?  The UK has stated strongly that it will continue to apply EU regulations in the foreseeable future.  Given that the UK will become a small market in terms of the EU - with 60 million people as opposed to 600 million - there is a strong incentive, certainly for all the international or global products, to remain largely convergent.  We have also spoken with both the human and veterinary product regulators in the UK and their current position is that they will work with us to ensure we can keep that alignment in place.  We do not know if that will continue five years down the road but in the next number of years there is a good grounding to continue having shared labels and leaflets.  I hope they can continue to make the Irish market more attractive commercially to pharmaceutical companies.</p></speech>

Things will be fine provided things stay the same, but if the UK changes the goalposts, there may be a problem in three years.  If its standards change and they are not compliant with the directives, we would need a new option.</p></speech>

Mr. Breslin has just mentioned that we receive approximately 45 shortage notifications per month and it is very important for the committee to understand that less than 50% of those notifications go on to be an issue where medicine supply is short.  In all those cases - we have had 90 of those shortages in the past five months - we have never had a case of a patient being left without a treatment for a particular condition because there have always been alternatives.  It is important to get that point across.  Dr. Fisher can speak about how the shortages framework operates in terms of engagement.</p></speech>

All these stakeholders came together to develop a framework where we in the HPRA co-ordinate the management of shortages.  It is done with all these stakeholders.</p> <p>  We receive an average of 45 notifications per month.  These come mainly from those who market the products.  Some notifications might go to the HSE and we can share information on potential shortages.  We ask that the company marketing the product would do some impact analysis and make proposals as to how to deal with the shortage.  We then validate it, and as Dr. Nolan states, in some cases it would not be a shortage; there might be a shortage in one part of the country but there is no shortage of the medicine in the system.  Of those notifications that are confirmed, they are designated as potential or actual shortages.  A potential shortage is not happening but it is possible there would be a shortage.  With an actual shortage, we would do a risk assessment on the impact on patients.  We manage all of these shortages and the high-risk examples amount to between 10% and 12% of the total we get.  Most of them are quite readily managed.</p> <p>  We would look at stock in wholesalers and get clinical advice if we need to help prescribers and pharmacists.  We would also consider alternatives and the market share of other companies.  We would see if there could be other strengths, formulations or generic products available.  With the company in question we would communicate to healthcare professionals if required.  If a shortage is confirmed as medium or high risk, a notice is put on our website.  The page on the website describes ongoing shortages at any one time so pharmacists, doctors or patients can see what is short and when the product is likely to come back in.  All the instances to date have been managed with alternative formulations or sources.  In no case to date have we needed clinical guidance to be issued.  There has been no change in the treatment options available to patients.  There is no backlog and we deal with the 45 notifications per month.  We have sufficient resources to deal with those.</p></speech>

It has been very clear about its intention to remain aligned with EU law but there is a caveat.  The Deputy is making the point that we will have to keep a close eye on this with respect to joint labelling and how things move forward.  We may not be able to continue with it so we are looking to future-proof our system and supply channels all the time.  The UK is adopting a position where it will recognise all the EU systems and inspections done by other member states.  I suppose it is in a privileged position where it can be in and out of the system to a certain extent.  We are in a different position because we are one of the EU 27 member states.</p></speech>

Not surprisingly, the Benelux countries have arrangements, as do the Scandinavian countries.  We have opened up discussions with other colleagues in the European network on those possibilities but I suppose the Scandinavian discussion is the one that has made advances to date.  That is not to say there are not other possibilities.  Ms Purcell wishes to make a point on the UK situation.</p></speech>

They are also subject to EU inspections.  Whether there will be resources is a second issue.  It is not even that there is an incentive to stay aligned, but that these companies must stay aligned if they want to continue to gain access to the EU.</p></speech>

Members are reminded of the longstanding parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against either a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind people, including our friends in the Gallery, to switch off their mobile phones as it interferes with recording equipment in the room.</p> <p>  We are joined by the Minister of State at the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Justice and Equality, and Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, who has special responsibility for disability issues.  The Minister of State and his officials are all welcome.  Before I invite the Minister of State to make his opening remarks on the Bill and before we begin to address the amendments, the Minister of State and colleagues should note that not for the first time, the Committee on Justice and Equality finds its work being compromised in some way by the fact that questions to the Minister for Justice and Equality are taking place in the D&aacute;il Chamber at the same time.  I do not know how quickly we will get through our work here this morning but members of the committee who are spokespersons on justice are obliged to be on the floor of the D&aacute;il to deal with questions to the Minister.  It is an absolutely unacceptable situation, and it is not the first time it has happened.  This scheduling should not happen.  I appeal to the Minister of State to address this issue after the meeting. </p> <p>  I invite the Minister of State to make any opening remarks on the Bill before we address the amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.490" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2019013000002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee.  I apologise for the delay.  A lot of work has been ongoing in the background in recent months.  I also note the Chairman's point on the schedule and understand the difficulty that it has caused and I will deal with that later.</p> <p>  I am delighted to be here today before the committee, and with its assistance, to complete another stage in the legislative process and move towards enactment of the Bill.  The Bill is being brought forward to give effect to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which took place in March 2018, and I had the honour of visiting the UN at that time. </p> <p>  It is a small item of legislation but it is a significant part of the overall process of progressive realisation of the convention.  It addresses a number of key strategic issues.  First and foremost, it establishes the independent monitoring framework for the convention, which will be overseen by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, with the support of the National Disability Authority. </p> <p>  This week, the IHREC appointed its monitoring committee for the convention.</p><p>The composition of the committee reflects the importance of involving persons with disabilities in the monitoring process.  This was a very clear statement during the week when we saw the number of people with a disability on that committee.  In addition, the Bill will increase the public sector target for employment of persons with disabilities from 3% to 6% over a number of years.  As Deputies will be aware, the National Disability Authority has the statutory duty to monitor annually the rate of employment of persons with disabilities in the public sector.  In 2017, the employment rate was 3.5% and I am pleased to note the extent to which many public bodies have exceeded the target of 3%, with the overall number of persons with disabilities employed in the public sector increasing.  This Bill will provide a mechanism to ensure a staged increase of this minimum target, reaching 6% by 2024.  This is a welcome development, particularly as leadership within the public sector in this regard is a crucial step in transforming attitudes across the employment market.  I accept that we have a long way to go and we also have to bring the private sector with us.</p><p> The provisions in the Bill regarding jury service are the culmination of a process started by the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in 1996.  The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008 amended and updated the references to persons with disabilities but did not remove them.  The enactment of this Bill will finally clarify the position of deaf jurors.  The public sector duty obligations in the Irish Sign Language Act 2017 will provide the means to make reasonable accommodation for deaf people.</p><p> I am concerned about the funding position of the Irish Deaf Society and this is a matter I am actively pursuing.  I mention it this morning because I am sure many colleagues will raise it.  I hope to have a resolution by the end of the week.</p><p> The Bill will also facilitate the participation of persons with certain disabilities on juries and will remove barriers to their standing for election, improving the standard of reasonable accommodation by certain service providers. </p><p> Many of the issues addressed in the Bill are highly complex and intertwined with other legislation, thus its passage has been slower than I would have liked.  I apologise again for the delays.  For example, a decision was taken last year to remove the deprivation of liberty provisions to feature in a stand-alone Bill to be taken forward by the Minister of Health.  Since then, the Department has organised a consultation process and received more than 50 submissions which are currently being analysed.  In addition, while it was indicated on Second Stage that it was intended to bring forward three heads relating to equality and discrimination matters, I am not proceeding with them at this time because they are not related to disability or the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD.  The Department of Justice and Equality is developing an LGBT strategy and it needs to await the outcome of that process before being in a position to determine if legislative change is needed.</p><p> Work is continuing on the reforms needed for an optimum level of compliance with the convention's requirements and the progress of this Bill forms a key part of this work.  In the early implementation phase, it is essential that resources are focused on the improvement and enhancement of services and not diverted into additional areas such as servicing the optional protocol before we are fully ready.</p><p> Five Government amendments are proposed today on Committee Stage.  We will discuss these in due course.  The opportunity is also being taken to make some minor amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, which provides a modern statutory framework to support decision-making by adults with capacity difficulties.</p><p> Detailed work is ongoing to finalise amendments on a number of issues for consideration on Report Stage.  These include amendments to address the use of the phrase "unsound mind" in the Statute Book where those references potentially intrude upon the rights of the person deemed to be of "unsound mind".  Deputies will appreciate this is a highly technical, complex and very sensitive area.  The term "unsound mind" appears in many areas of law and the meaning in each case depends on the context so it is not a simple task to replace it with a generic provision.</p><p> The Government also intends to bring forward a Report Stage amendment to align the relevant provisions of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 with the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 concerning persons appointed to act on behalf of recipients or beneficiaries of social welfare payments where those people have been medically certified as being unable, for the time being, to manage their own financial affairs.  An analogous amendment will be brought forward to amend to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to replace the reference to a "person of unsound mind" with language that aligns with the approach taken in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  Similarly, an amendment to the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 regarding fitness to plead at trial has been drafted and will be included on Report Stage further to consultation with the advisory counsel and the DPP.</p><p> I will bring forward further amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  Work is ongoing to establish the decision support service and draft the necessary codes of practice.  In the course of implementation it has been necessary to make amendments to the 2015 Act to correct initial drafting errors and to align the legislation with operational experience.  I look forward to working with the committee to refine the Bill and improve the lives of people with disabilities.</p></speech>

It is the responsibility of the Chair in upholding Standing Orders to sign off on the notification of the disallowance of amendments that are deemed not to be in order.  However, on first perusal, for which I only had an opportunity late last night, I was conflicted about some of the points made in the briefing note directing the Chair to disallow certain amendments.  For example, my experience and knowledge of the provision of polling stations in my constituency is that they are not only schools.  I have some question in my mind in respect of "no rent charged".  Church halls, private halls and so on are all employed as polling stations.  I am not convinced by the argument that some of the amendments presented would subsequently constitute a potential charge on the Exchequer.</p> <p>  As a D&aacute;il Deputy and as Chair of this committee, I am anxious at all times that members, Government and Opposition, have the opportunity to properly play their full part in the construct and passage of all legislation.  I believe I have done so fairly and equitably since I took on the position of Chair of this committee.  However, I believe an inordinate effort is made to find reason to disallow reasonable amendments that could make a critical difference to legislation and, in the case of this Bill, to the daily life of people with disabilities and their reasonable expectations in respect of the affirmation of rights and equality.</p> <p>  Without an opportunity to engage further on the note which I received very late yesterday evening, I am exercising my position as Chairman and ruling that the amendments will be allowed to proceed today on Committee Stage.  The ultimate determiner in all of this is the Ceann Comhairle.  That judgment can be reserved by the Ceann Comhairle on Report Stage.  I have had no facility to engage with the Ceann Comhairle on these matters other than very briefly through the clerk to the committee.  I will not willy-nilly be the puppet for any direction in respect of very important matters concerning a cohort of people, those with disabilities, whom I hold in very high regard.</p><p>Therefore, although one of the amendments before us is quite specific, I am not going to make fish of one and flesh of another.  I propose to proceed and take the amendments as tabled.  I will engage with whoever wishes to engage with me subsequently on the decision I made this morning.  It is up to members to proceed to Report Stage with their amendments, whereupon, when adequate time is given to the Ceann Comhairle and others to peruse and make an assessment - something I did not have - they can make a decision.  It is up to members in the intervening period to make the case as to the veracity and applicability of their respective amendments.  It is the position I am taking and I am putting the Minister of State and members on notice of it.  I would appreciate it if the members could accept the Chair's ruling in this instance.</p></speech>

It states clearly, on page three of eight, that the "decision of the Chairman regarding the disallowance of amendments is final".  I have highlighted it and I rest my case on that decision.  I ask members not to elongate or prolong unnecessarily address of the amendments as indicated.  We have much work to do and other members have other responsibilities as the morning will proceed.</p></speech>

The Chairman is absolutely right as we have ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and that comes with a cost.  If we are to ratify it in a meaningful way, we will have to take steps that are meaningful.  What we are seeing is becoming a bit of a trend and we saw it with the recognition of Irish Sign Language, ISL, and now the deaf community is in jeopardy because of finances.  The very mechanism to exercise its access to ISL is being taken away.  I appreciate the Chairman's stance on this.</p></speech>

I had no reasonable time to make a judgment on the amendments other than by giving them a cursory reading.  I am in a position to contest the views presented in most of these.  In the absence of the opportunity to engage further, I do not intend, as Chairman of the committee, to thwart an effort to further underscore the rights of people with disabilities in the passage of this legislation.  I intend to proceed on that basis.</p> <p>  Members will note a number of groupings have been advised.  Amendments No. 1 may be discussed with amendment No. 2, amendment No. 6 may be discussed with amendment No. 7, amendment 14 may be discussed with amendment No. 17, and all the others will be taken individually as we proceed.  Without further ado, I propose to commence examination of the Bill.</p></speech>

However, in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015, a person's capacity is assessed functionally and on the basis of his or her ability to understand at a time the decision is to be made the nature and consequence of the decision to be made by him or her in the context of the available choices at the time.  It is important that a person would enjoy the presumption of capacity to make decisions.  I know interest groups, such as Inclusion Ireland and others, have said it is important for us to ensure this miscellaneous Bill is consistent with the assisted decision-making legislation.  It is something I recommend and we support.  We need to ensure the legislation fits what will happen in this space.  It is a simple amendment and something we will push.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.501" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2019013000002#C00900"><p>This pertains to the Juries Act 1976.  I will refer to section 1(1)(<i>a</i>) of this Bill.  I have not yet tabled an amendment to this part of the Bill but I will do so.  It relates to the provision of Irish Sign Language, ISL, interpreters to allow a deaf person to serve on a jury.  I welcome that greatly.  We should include those who are hard of hearing with those who are deaf.  Additionally, an interpreter is not necessarily the only service that could be provided to a deaf person or a person hard of hearing to perform jury service effectively.  There are people who are hard of hearing or those with cochlear implants who can use technologies like captioning and so on.  The Bill as drafted does not allow for that.  Not all deaf people can read English and not all have ISL, for many reasons.  We must go beyond just ISL and look at the use of technology.  It is the first element of the amendment.</p><p>The second part was explained by Deputy Chambers.  It is critical that language and how we approach these matters is dealt with properly.  The assisted decision-making legislation moves away from a status approach to capacity based on having a disability and moves towards a functional approach in which the presumption of capacity is there until it is clearly not the case.  Capacity is based on ability to understand at the time a decision is made and in context with the available choices at the time.  We are removing the certainty of the statement &quot;does not have mental capacity&quot;.  It is a case of saying it might be the case at a particular time but not necessarily forever that these people might not be in a position to possess the capacity to engage in jury service.  This is key and language is not neutral.  It suggests there is a constant standard for mental capacity before it is needed, which would be the day of jury service.  People may be told they cannot serve because they will not in future have the capacity to do so.  That language is too definite.</p><p>The assisted decision-making legislation is clear about the need to assess capacity and understand what can be done at a particular time.  It is what we are looking at.  There is nuanced difference between our amendment and the amendment proposed by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire.  I would prefer for ours to be accepted, but if it is not, the alternative should be accepted.</p></speech>

The ability to serve on a jury is something most of us would consider an ordinary and democratic right, but we need to improve the presumption in favour of the person being able to participate in a jury.  I will certainly not oppose the first amendment but I have a slight preference for my own because of the specific reference to reasonable accommodation, which is important.  I will listen to the Minister of State's comments and I will not oppose the first amendment.  I will take on board the feedback of other Deputies as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.504" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2019013000002#C01200"><p>My points will be pretty similar to those aired.  The assisted decision-making legislation lists jury duty as one of the exemptions to the provisions of the Act, which is a problem as it contravenes the spirit of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, especially Article 12.2.  It affects the ability of persons with disabilities to participate in all aspects of life.  Section 1 of the Bill before us attempts to address this with respect to jury service but it falls short.  It proposes to amend existing legislation on who is defined as being incapable of serving on a jury and it seeks to ensure compliance with Article 29 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which guarantees the right to equal participation in political and public life.</p> <p>  The idea of participation is key and we are supposed to be facilitating participation of people with disabilities.</p><p>People with disabilities should be presumed to have the capacity to serve on a jury, to carry out jury duty.  People with disabilities are rights holders first and foremost and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, CRPD, is clear that they are entitled to be integrated socially and politically.  While the Bill attempts in section 1 to rectify the problem in the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 on jury duty, and that is to be welcomed, it is in fact, as I understand it, creating a new problem.  It is undermining some of the very positive aspects of the 2015 Act.  The wording of section 1 on jury duty seems to be contrary to the provisions of the Assisted Decision Making Act (Capacity) 2015 where capacity is defined as &quot;decision-making capacity&quot; and refers to a person's ability to understand at the time that a decision is to be made the nature and consequences of that decision in the context of the available choices at that time.  The Department of Justice and Equality's website describes the Act as follows: </p><blockquote>The Act proposes to change the law from the current all or nothing status approach to a flexible functional definition, whereby capacity is assessed only in relation to the matter in question and only at the time in question.  If a person is found to lack decision-making capacity in one matter, this will not necessarily mean that s/he also lacks capacity in another matter.  The Act recognises that capacity can fluctuate in certain cases.</blockquote><p>As the Department defines it, a person does not lack capacity to make a decision, rather he or she is presumed to have such capacity.  This is the spirit of section 8 of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  A person may lack capacity to make a particular decision at a particular time or his or her capacity may be in doubt but this capacity may be regained at a different time and for a different decision.  However, the wording we are addressing here, that the person must &quot;have sufficient mental or intellectual capacity to serve as a juror&quot;, brings us back to an outdated understanding of disability rights very much at odds with the positive functional approach of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  It assesses a person's decision-making capacity simply based on the fact that he or she has a disability which is exactly the kind of all or nothing approach from which we are supposed to have moved on.<br/><br/>The Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 already provides a statutory framework to support decision-making by adults who have difficulty making decisions without help and to enable them to fully participate in all aspects of public life.  The provision of reasonable accommodation, in Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's amendment No. 2, is already provided for in the existing Act, from our understanding. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.506" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2019013000002#D00200"><p>This amendment addresses important issues of capacity and participation that go to the heart of the convention, and I thank the Deputies for bringing it forward.  The amendment to the Juries Act 1976 proposed by the Government in section 1 of the Bill as published replaces a provision that prohibits a category of persons from performing jury duty with a functional test of mental or intellectual capacity.  The category of persons currently excluded are those who suffer from, or have suffered from, mental illness or mental disability which either causes them to be resident in a hospital or similar institution or to regularly attend for treatment by a medical practitioner.  This represents a status approach to the determination of capacity, and is precisely what we are aiming to move away from in the implementation of the Convention and the development of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) 2015 legislation.</p> <p>  In the Bill as drafted there is a Government amendment that changes the exclusion to read as follows: "A person who, does not, in the opinion of the court, have sufficient mental or intellectual capacity to serve as a juror."  The amendments put forward by the Deputies focus on decision-making capacity rather than mental or intellectual capacity in one case.  The other amendment focuses on the provision of reasonable accommodation for jurors.</p> <p>  As regards the reference to decision-making capacity, I welcome this clarification as the term is potentially more relevant in the context of the new approach to capacity and decision-making outlined in the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  However, we are balancing two equally fundamental rights here &ndash; the rights of persons with disabilities to fully participate in all aspects of society, and the right to a fair trial.  For this reason, absolute precision is required.</p> <p>  Furthermore, I am advised by the Office of the Attorney General that a number of legal issues arise from the draft amendment, the most significant of which is that jury duty does not fall within the remit of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  Section 138(i) of the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 specifically states that the Act does not purport to change the law in relation to capacity or consent for serving as a member of a jury.  The justice sector working group on jury service is currently examining the issues raised in the report of the Law Reform Commission on jury service published in 2013.</p> <p>  Deputies Wallace, &Oacute; Laoghaire and Chambers have hit the nail on the head about the rights to services, and the debate in the past two weeks about the Irish Deaf Society.  I am aware of the financial difficulties the society is experiencing and the concerns about its future sustainability.  There are several funding options.  I am actively involved in this and I hope to resolve it during the week.  The Deputies' early point is fundamental.  When we talk about people with disabilities and their rights we also have to ensure they have services.  It is also important to note that the largest provider of such services is the National Association for the Deaf which receives significant funding, for example, we gave it &euro;6.7 million in 2018.  There are issues such as that which must be dealt with and I will deal with them.  I take the Deputies' points on the rights of people with disabilities. </p> <p>  I will consider the legal implications of amendment No. 1 for Report Stage because the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015 will require amendments.  I am likely to support it on Report Stage.  </p> <p>  Amendment No. 2 raises a complex legal issue and I would like Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire to let the juries working group consider it because it gives rise to many complicated legal issues.  </p></speech>

Would it not be better to insert something now that the Minister of State is potentially willing to accept on Report Stage and for him then to come back with the legal advice on Report Stage and propose an amendment to delete it, if that is his advice?  If he is willing to support a change on Report Stage, he should just accept the amendment now.</p></speech>

We should put it in now.  I take issue with the Minister of State's point about a citizen's right to a fair trial as if somehow the measure we are proposing or debating on these issues would undermine a citizen's right to a fair trial by having somebody with disabilities on the jury.  The precise point of the amendment is to remove the wording which states "have sufficient mental or intellectual capacity" as if it were fixed for all time.  We are proposing to insert the words "possess the decision-making capacity to exercise the functions".  With our amendment the person on the jury would have to have the decision-making capacity to participate and therefore ensure a fair trial.  The concern does not arise in this instance.</p></speech>

It is a rational one and I do not see the rationale for not pressing ahead with it today.</p> <p>  Separately, it is good to hear that the Minister of State is hopeful that the Irish Deaf Society funding issue will be sorted this week.  Why are things allowed to get to this point?  The people from the Irish Deaf Society who contacted us were pretty upset about the approach of Government and while I am not saying it is the Minister of State's fault, I wonder if he can explain it.  He tells us now that he will probably sort it this week but I do not understand the rationale of letting it get to this point.</p><p>Can the Minister of State tell me?  </p></speech>

I am guided by the legal advice I have been given, and legal advice has to come first for these amendments.</p> <p>  Deputy Clare Daly made a point about fair trials.  It is a very complex situation, and there is a lot of work that has to be done in this area.</p> <p>  On Deputy Wallace's point about the Irish Deaf Society, it is important that people realise that not only were the Deputy and the society upset, but I was upset as well.  There have been a few differences of opinion on this issue in recent weeks.  The Irish Deaf Society had a problem last year and we provided bridging funding of &euro;195,000.  The plan was that that money was to sort it out for 2018 and that a proper plan would be put in place for 2019.  I told people to get on with it, but it did not happen in the way I wanted it to happen, and it then exploded.  The way that happened was unacceptable, and I have made that point twice at two meetings of the Government.  Different sections have to get their act together when it comes to deciding on core funding, which will be decided over the next couple of days.  I am particularly annoyed because the Irish Deaf Society, which the Members here present all supported, was very supportive during the debate on the Irish Sign Language Bill, which was brought through the Houses by Senator Mark Daly, among others.  We worked together for six or seven months, along with Gerry Maguire, my adviser, and the Department of Justice and Equality.  Many compromises were made by all sides.  Part of my agenda was that the Irish Deaf Society be properly supported and funded, but that is another issue.  The matter will be resolved this week, and there will be stable funding in place from now on.  </p></speech>

It is wise and sensible.  We have come up against this issue regularly, whether on the basis the the amendments place a charge on the Exchequer, they are not adequate or are irrelevant to the subject of the Bill.  Amendments can be reasonably ruled out of order, but perfectly sensible and relevant amendments are being ruled out of order too often. </p><p>These amendments relate to what I believe to be the most fundamental of democratic rights, which is the right to vote.  It is the case that there are many polling stations that are not accessible to all of the public.  This is not the kind of public service that one can go and get elsewhere.  If one cannot access the polling station to which he or she has been allocated there is no alternative open to him or her.  Unfortunately this is not an uncommon phenomenon.  In the 2016 election there were 15 polling stations in Galway, ten in Kerry, five in Carlow-Kilkenny and four in Dublin which were not wheelchair accessible, and that created considerable difficulty for a number of individuals.  These two amendments seek to put that right and to provide that all polling stations should be wheelchair accessible.  That is reasonable and fair, and very much in keeping with the spirit of the Bill. </p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned some examples of polling stations that are not accessible.  That is unacceptable to me as the Minister of State with responsibility in this area.  While I am completely in agreement with the spirit of the amendment proposed I have a number of concerns at the precise manner in which it has been drafted, and I cannot support it as a result.  The proposed amendment cuts across the broader reform of electoral law currently being undertaken by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Phelan.  As the Deputy may be aware, the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan has recently established a working group on disability voting, the work of which is ongoing.  The group comprises key stakeholders, representing people with disability.  Members of this group include representatives from the National Disabilities Authority, the Disability Federation of Ireland, the National Council for the Blind, the Blind Legal Alliance and the Irish Wheelchair Association.  The working group is dominated by stakeholders.  Its terms of reference provides that its role is to examine and to make recommendations on issues that arise under a number of headings, including improving accessibility to polling stations for voters with physical disabilities, particularly wheelchair users, with the goal for all polling stations to be fully accessible as soon as possible.  The Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, has shown a clear commitment to addressing this issue to ensure that all polling stations will be fully accessible as soon as possible.  Work is already under way to this end.  The expertise available within the group will provide a clear understanding of the actions required to ensure that polling stations are accessible.</p> <p>  I hope the committee will agree that it is preferable not to undertake piecemeal reform in this area but rather to implement a reform process that is solidly rooted in the perspective of people with disabilities who are directly affected.  Reform of electoral law is already under way, and we should let it move along strongly.  </p></speech>

The Government is overburdened with working groups, which delay reform across many areas of disability.  In many cases, it is bureaucracy talking to bureaucracy.  This is a simple amendment to direct local authorities to do what they should do anyway.  It would have positive effects for those who need access.  I do not know why a working group is needed to do something relatively simple.  If local authorities are directed by law to do it, they have enough staff to change their polling schemes quickly and appropriately.  A complex working group is not needed to address the area.  I support the amendment and consider that it should be pressed.</p></speech>

It is something that comes up every so often but we are always told there is a review under way and that nothing can be done in the meantime.  That excuse can be used to cover a multitude.  We saw it in the context of civil law reform recently where we were told something could not be contemplated as a review was ongoing which might recommend something.  As the Minister of State said and as Deputy Jack Chambers reflected, this should be the position as it stands.  People should not be in a position where they may be denied the right to vote or where voting may be made difficult for them because polling stations are practically or completely inaccessible.  I am minded to press the amendment unless the Chairman is certain it will create a difficulty for the committee.</p></speech>

While I understand the frustration with the working group, the problem is also one we had in respect of the capacity issue.  We placed advertisements in newspapers and received 50 submissions.  The more that came in, the more people became involved and the more complex everything became.  At the same time, if we did not consult the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Disability Federation of Ireland and other groups, I would be in the firing line.  On the amendments, I note that local authorities have flexibility to improve accessibility, which some have done while others remain weak, as Deputies pointed out.  My concern is that there are significant legal issues with the way in which the amendment is drafted, which means I cannot support it.</p></speech>

We have discussed the need to make information on referenda properly accessible to people with disabilities.  As such, it is important to integrate provisions in this regard in the Act to give the Referendum Commission a mandate to ensure that occurs.  The amendment proposes to include in section 3 a requirement to publish statements that are as far as practicable accessible to persons with a disability, to publish and distribute those statements to various media and to promote public awareness of a referendum and encourage the electorate to vote at the poll.  It adds to what is there.  In the spirit of disability reform, it is important to ensure information is put out there in an accessible way and to provide the commission with a positive mandate to ensure it reaches everyone.  The commission should be required to go that extra yard to communicate that information to those who may not currently receive it.  It is a simple amendment and one which is in keeping with the spirit of the Bill.  I hope the Minister of State will support it.</p></speech>

This is obviously welcome.  The UN committee on the rights of persons with disabilities has urged that all stages of an election should be made fully accessible, including the political campaigns around them.  Our amendment, as proposed by Inclusion Ireland, will guarantee an equal right for people with disabilities to participate in political and public life.</p></speech>

However, this concern is addressed through current practices.  In line with its existing duties under the Referendum Act 1998, the Referendum Commission prepares and provides information on referenda for persons with disabilities, including in easy-to-read format for people with intellectual disabilities.  It is important to note that.  Given that the commission is doing this work, which has become standard practice, I do not consider it necessary to amend the Act.</p><p>There are further technical issues with the proposed amendment.  The amendment proposes the deletion from section 3(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Act of the words &quot;one or more&quot; after &quot;prepare&quot; so that the section provides that the commission shall prepare statements.  This means the commission would be forced to prepare multiple statements when it might not be appropriate or necessary to do so.</p><p>The important issue is that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government commenced a public consultation process recently on the regulatory impact assessment relating to the establishment of an electoral commission.  The assessment sets out a number of options for establishing a commission, including the functions that might be assigned to it.  Following any Government decision on a preferred option for the establishment of an electoral commission, work will commence on the drafting of an electoral commission Bill.  That Bill would be the appropriate mechanism through which to provide for people with disabilities in respect of electoral matters.  I understand the aim of Deputies in proposing the amendment and support the principles raised by them.  We need to get more people with disabilities in politics, whether in local or national government or in the Seanad, to advocate directly on their particular issues.  However, the Deputies will understand the reasons I cannot support the amendment.</p></speech>

It seeks to go further than what is there at the moment.  If we are trying to keep within the spirit of the Bill, the commission should be mandated to go the extra yard.

We must push forward to ensure that more people with disabilities can go forward and get involved in politics and lobbying but the Referendum Act 1998 provides for the preparation of this information on referendums for people with disabilities, including an easy-to-read format for people with intellectual disabilities.  That is something I have seen used regularly in the disability sector, particularly the easy-to-read format for people with intellectual disabilities.  They have found it helpful and that has increased the participation of people with disabilities in elections.  We have a long way to go and I accept the points made.</p></speech>

The section makes two amendments to the National Disability Authority, NDA.  It makes provision for the NDA to play a role in a monitoring mechanism for the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It also provides for staff of the NDA to become civil servants of the State.  This is a technical drafting amendment, which seeks to align the current provision better with the section as a whole.  The term &quot;Every person&quot; is replaced by &quot;A person&quot;.  It is a minor amendment that I am making on the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to ensure a consistent approach throughout the section.  I stress that the change in the status of the staff of the NDA will not in any way compromise the authority's independence.  As the committee will be aware, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, enjoys full independence in its role notwithstanding the fact that its staff are civil servants of the State.  I intend to bring forward a further amendment to this section on Report Stage, which will deal with the transfer of pension liabilities for the staff of the NDA.  </p></speech>

Reasonable accommodation are practical changes that service providers have to make so that people with disabilities can obtain and use all kinds of services on an equal basis with others.  The convention provides that reasonable accommodation be provided for people with disabilities in the areas of employment and provision of services provided the cost does not exceed a disproportionate cost.  The amendment proposed by the Deputy seeks to eliminate the standard of disproportionate cost altogether.  This is problematic for a number of reasons, the most fundamental of which is that it is liable to incur constitutional challenge.  The Supreme Court decided in an Article 26 referral of the Employment Equality Bill 1996 that it would be unconstitutional to impose such a requirement where the cost exceeds a nominal cost.  The Supreme Court decision hinges on the private property protection provisions of the Constitution.  The Attorney General has advised that it would not be appropriate to apply the disproportionate burden obligation in the case of commercial bodies whose activities are regulated for quality of service, <i>viz</i>. banks, insurance companies, telecommunications and transport providers and credit unions.  To eliminate the maximum standard altogether would create a substantial risk of challenge and for this reason, I propose that the amendment be withdrawn.</p></speech>

The amendment would make section 4 excessively restrictive.  I acknowledge the Deputy is concerned that it may be too qualified but if the provision at the end of section 2A is deleted, it would be unconstitutional.

The proposed amendment would make two changes to the Disability Act 2005.  One relates to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other to the public service employment quota for persons with disabilities.  The first change, which was confirmed on Second Stage, brings civilian staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na back within the terms of Part 5 of the Disability Act, providing for a public sector employment quota for people with disabilities.  This group of Civil Service staff was inadvertently removed from the scope of Part 5 by the enactment of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  In accordance with this amendment, the Disability Act would also be amended to increase the employment target of persons with disabilities in the public sector from 3% to 6% on a phased basis by 2024.</p><p>A staggered approach is now proposed as follows.  From 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2021, the target will be 4%.  From 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2023, the target will be 5%.  From 1 January 2024, the target will be 6%.  The basis for these provisions is a Government decision of 2015 on foot of a recommendation in the comprehensive employment strategy to increase public service employment from 3% to 6%.  The figure of 6% and the staggered approach were recommended by the NDA, which is the key adviser to the Government on disability policy and practice.  The staged approach facilitates capacity building in respect of continued improvements in employment levels.</p><p> The NDA monitors the progress of public bodies in achieving the targets and works with Departments and agencies to advise on ways to improve policies and practices in order to meet them.  It will continue to have this role following the introduction of the new targets.  If the revised targets are agreed by the Oireachtas and enshrined in legislation, they will represent a significant advance for people with disabilities and provide them with significantly more employment opportunities in the public service.  As such, they have the potential to transform the lives of many people with disabilities who can obtain good quality and secure employment.  Like my colleagues on this committee, I feel strongly that while we have made a major dent in general employment, we must also make a major dent on unemployment among people with disabilities.  We have a lot of quality people in the disabilities sector who want jobs.  While we have taken steps to assist them in respect of welfare payments and hours of work, we must also consider the potential within the public and private sectors to provide more employment for them</p></speech>

What is the remedy if these targets are missed?  There is obviously a macro incentive for the public service to increase the percentage in employment but what is the remedy for a person with a disability on a micro level?  At the organisational level of Department or State agency, they will displace the macro incentive to someone else, as it is a general percentage.  Has the Minister of State considered specifying additional organisational targets so that the macro target can be reached?</p></speech>

I have also set up a team under the national disability inclusion strategy, which meets every couple of months.  I bring in officials from every Department and we sit around the table and ask what they have done on disabilities over the previous three or four months.  There is accountability to me as Minister of State and it is up to me to drive the process forward.  Some Departments have a good record and are above the 3.5% rate.  Some are in that zone but I want to get them up to 4% and 5%.  The accountability is directly to me and to the Secretaries General of the Departments.  There is also accountability at Cabinet level.  A point I make at Cabinet meetings is that it is not just the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities who has to be involved in supporting people with disabilities.  Every Department represented at the Cabinet table must bring something to it to develop and support people with disabilities.  We have a couple of thousand people with disabilities working in different Departments, including the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Education and Skills, and Health.  I want that number increased on a phased basis.  That is the way I do it.  The accountability is to me, Secretaries General and, ultimately, to Cabinet in a broader sense.  It is up to us to drive this forward while the NDA monitors and reports on progress.  It clips our wings every now and again, let us be honest.</p></speech>

It is an important statement.  It is important to ensure there is consistency between the legislation and our international obligations and the provision should be included in primary legislation.  The principles should be consistent with our domestic law and what we are trying to achieve through this legislation.</p></speech>

In this regard, the Department feels strongly about, and continues to prioritise, the development of legislation on the deprivation of liberty safeguards.  While it was initially intended to include a deprivation of liberty safeguard on Committee Stage, the importance of provisions in this regard led the Government to agree early last year to bring them forward in a stand-alone Bill sponsored by the Minister for Health.  This was a response to concerns raised about the opportunity for an in-depth and meaningful consultation on this important topic.  As the Deputy will be aware, a public consultation on the draft deprivation of liberty safeguard legislative proposals concluded in May 2018.  The Department of Health is engaged in revising the draft proposals and working hard to resolve the complicated policy issues that have arisen.  Deprivation of liberty is a complex matter and a great deal of information has been provided in the submissions made.  The Department and I feel strongly that it is necessary to deal with such complexity in a stand-alone Bill.</p></speech>

I ask that in advance of Report Stage any issue is raised as to whether there is anything in the current wording that should not be included or which is not consistent with how people with disabilities are treated in the context where they are deprived of liberty.  It appears that it is a minimal standard.  Perhaps we are not meeting it, but it is the least we should expect.  In that context, I am happy to withdraw the amendment now with a view to tabling it again on Report Stage.</p><p>In that context, I am happy enough to withdraw for the moment, with a view to resubmitting it or a variation of it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Adequate funding and resources will be provided to carry out these functions;&rdquo;,&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>This amendment was proposed by the Disability Federation of Ireland.  The federation is of the view that the Bill does not provide a broad enough mandate to comply fully with the UN Convention.  This amendment uses language taken directly from the convention and it tasks the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, not only with reviewing the law but also with promoting awareness of the convention and ensuring its continued implementation.  The amendment removes the paternalistic language of this section of the Bill and focuses on empowering people with disabilities rather than on protection.  It goes without saying that IHREC must be adequately funded and resourced if it is to be given new duties.  We often give extra powers to bodies, as with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, for example, but if we do not resource them adequately, those powers cannot be used.</p></speech>

It is important that this is properly implemented.  Adequate funding and resources are needed.  Good legislation and words as well as high ideals and principles are all very well but they must be properly backed by resources and funding.  I appreciate what the Minister of State said about the Irish Deaf Society and look forward to seeing more detail on that later in the week, but what has transpired there is an example of us signing up to high ideals but not providing adequate resources, which means that we do not meet the standards that the people who are relying on these protections are expecting.  This is a worthy amendment that is deserving of support.</p></speech>

I have consulted IHREC and understand that it has made provisions for its role as an independent monitor in its work plan and budget for this year.  On the question of resources, IHREC receives substantial Exchequer funding each year to support its core activities.  The 2019 Estimates provide an allocation of &euro;6.651 million.  It is possible that matters which may arise over the forthcoming UNCRPD reporting cycle could require extra resources and IHREC is free at any time to present a case to Government for additional resources, as necessary, to carry out its core functions or other functions arising from its statutory role.  As the Deputies are aware, it is the role of Government to determine how resources are allocated and it would not be appropriate for legislation to interfere with that role.  That is the key issue here.  Equally, enshrining the provision in legislation could cut across the role of the Oireachtas in overseeing IHREC's Vote.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment and propose that it be withdrawn.</p></speech>

I have not seen any amendment passed with an open-ended insertion of "adequate funding and resources", which would be impossible to interpret.

It would undermine the accountability role that the structures have to the Departments and the Oireachtas.  I agree with the Minister of State on this.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.603" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2019013000002#J02200"><p>I move amendment No. 12:</p><blockquote>In page 7, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:&ldquo;(iii) by the insertion of the following paragraph after paragraph (o):<blockquote>&ldquo;(p) to act as the independent mechanism to promote, protect and monitor implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities done at New York on 13 December 2006.&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote> <p>This very simple amendment seeks to insert a paragraph into the section based on the intention in the general scheme of the Bill, which was to provide that the commission would act as an independent mechanism to promote, protect and monitor implementation of the convention.  The additional commission function proposed in the Bill makes no reference to the independent mechanism or to the UNCRPD more broadly.  The function proposed under the Bill should be clearly linked to the commission's designation as the independent mechanism under Article 33 of the UNCRPD.  The amendment would better align the view of the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities that the State must adopt the necessary legal measures to establish the independent mechanism clearly.  That is what we are seeking to do with this amendment.</p></speech>

This section of Bill creates a statutory basis for IHREC's role in the monitoring framework with regard to the UNCRPD.  IHREC, as Ireland's national human rights and equality body has a function to keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of law and practice in the State relating to the protection of human rights and equality and so is well placed to undertake the monitoring role with the technical support of the National Disability Authority, NDA.  Having consulted IHREC, I understand that it welcomes the proposed amendment, which links its role explicitly to the UNCRPD.  It is important that Ireland's progress in implementing the convention should be underpinned by robust monitoring.  I am open to accepting this amendment on Report Stage, subject to further legal analysis or tidying up.</p></speech>

The principle of the amendment is very simple.  There is no reason all the members of the advisory committee should not be people who have or had a disability.  I will press the amendment, but if the Minister of State wishes to comment, I ask that he be as concise as possible.  Unfortunately, I will probably be absent.</p></speech>

The disability advisory committee is made up of 14 members, three of whom are commissioners, being the chair, the vice chair and the chief commissioner, as per the requirements of the commission's founding legislation.

Paragraph (a) of the new section relates to section 15 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, which provides for complaints against decision-making assistants appointed under the Act.  The first proposed amendment to section 15 is a technical drafting amendment.  As there are three paragraphs in section 15(1), the reference to &ldquo;one or both of the following matters&rdquo; is incorrect.  The second proposed amendment is a technical drafting amendment to replace an erroneous reference to co-decision-making agreements with a reference to decision-making assistance agreements.</p><p>The director was appointed in late 2017.  The preparations for the commencement of the Act are ongoing.  We are working towards 2020 for its commencement.  The staff are being recruited, codes of practice are being drafted, and procurement is under way.  The Department is working on amendments to the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 to address the issues that have arisen since the Act was passed.  They are also to remove inconsistencies and clarify provisions.  Much work is ongoing on this issue.</p></speech>

It is referred to in his script.  I am anxious to hear his additional assurances in that regard.</p> <p>  I appeal to the Minister of State to consider the amendment tabled by Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire that was not proceeded with.  The Deputy has reserved the right to resubmit it on Report Stage.  It proposes that the Title to the Bill be changed to "Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016".  There is a very strong opinion across the committee on the dropping of the word "Equality".  The matter has been referred to and reflected on on a number of occasions.  I urge the Minister of State to consider it before Report Stage.</p> <p>  On the amendments that were indicated as being out of order and on which I ruled accordingly, I was left in what I believed was an invidious position.  Considering that the Minister of State indicated correctly during the deliberations his comfort, understanding and support, in some instances, and that Opposition Members are sometimes precluded from moving amendments that "may" entail an increase in the charge on the Exchequer, he might consider taking on board some of the amendments proposed on Report Stage.  This merits consideration in a number of cases.  The greatest number of the amendments were authored initially by the various umbrella representative groups in the disability community.</p> <p>  Does the Minister of State have closing words he would like to offer?</p></speech>

They are being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  I intend to introduce an amendment to address the issue that arose regarding a person whose fitness to be tried was to be determined in the course of criminal proceedings.</p> <p>  I thank colleagues for their contributions.  I welcome the visitors in the Visitors Gallery and thank them for their submissions on the Bill.  They will have seen the interaction in the debate.  They can see that we have a Chairman and members who are dedicated to the principles behind legislating for disability issues.  We now have a different vision in the country than in the past.  We want people to be treated with respect, which is why all of the Deputies supported me when I went to New York to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  As colleagues said, it is all very well to talk about having a vision and a plan, but we need to ensure we have the resources.  That is also important and part of the debate.  In budget 2019 I managed to deliver &euro;1.9 billion for social care services for people with disabilities.  What that means in real terms is that there will be 8,568 residential places, 20,000 people in day places and 10,000 accessing 4.7 million personal assistance hours and home care packages.  The work has begun, but we have a lot to do.  In two weeks in County Meath I will be opening the twelfth respite care house to have been opened in the past 12 months.  There is ongoing work, but it is absolutely the case that we have a lot to do.  The committee has supported the ratification of the UN convention which has been a personal commitment of mine and the Chairman for many years.  </p> <p>  I have committed to ratifying the optional protocol on completion of Ireland&rsquo;s first reporting cycle under the convention.  The Government's approach and mine in meeting the terms of the convention is one of sustained and ongoing improvement.  Work is continuing on the reforms needed for optimum compliance with the convention's requirements.  Progress on this Bill forms a key part of that work.  In the early implementation phase it is essential that resources be focused on the improvement and enhancement of services and not diverted into additional areas such as servicing the optional protocol before we are fully ready.  Five Government amendments were introduced on Committee Stage.  I will deal with the optional protocol as quickly as possible.  My focus will be on resourcing the services as quickly as possible.  The Irish Deaf Society was mentioned in that regard.  Sometimes resourcing services leads to many internal battles about which those in the Visitors Gallery would not hear, but the bottom line is addressing the needs of those with disabilities.</p> <p>  On the equality issue, I have listened to the debate very carefully.  I do not want to be distracted by focusing on other areas of equality which I strongly support, as my focus in on disability services.  The members and I want to drive the Bill through.  I am open to constructive amendments on Report Stage.  I have indicated that I will do so.</p> <p>  I thank colleagues and committee staff.  I was saying to Pat before the meeting that I had attended many meetings of the committee as a member of the Opposition.  Now I am here as Minister of State with responsibility for disability services.  I will give one commitment.  I came into the job to do three things: reform disability services; invest in those services; and change the mindset to put the person with a disability at the centre of the services.  That is my objective and what I will be doing during my term of office, depending on how long the Government lasts.</p></speech>

Gabhaim f&aacute;ilte roimh gach duine.  Today we will discuss the current model of production, presenting and co-presenting in the Abbey Theatre.  Recently a large number of actors and others working in the Irish theatre wrote to the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, taking issue with the current approach of the Abbey Theatre to the production, presenting and co-presenting of work.  The letter stated that this approach has led to fewer in-house productions and has adversely affected the earnings of those working in the theatre.  It raised issues relating to the role of the Abbey Theatre as Ireland's national theatre, the consistency of the Abbey's approach with Government's national vision and framework for culture and also the funding of the theatre by the Arts Council.  Given the importance of these issues, the committee is keen to develop a deeper understanding of what is involved here.  To assist the committee in considering this matter, I am pleased to welcome, on behalf of the actors and others working in Irish theatre, Mr. Declan Conlon and Ms Cl&iacute;ona Dukes.  I welcome from the Abbey Theatre, Dr. Frances Ruane, chairperson, and Mr. Niall Murray, co-director.  I also welcome Ms Orlaith McBride, director of the Arts Council, and Ms Sheila Pratschke, chairperson.</p><p>Before we begin, I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Opening statements and other documents submitted to the committee may be published on the committee website following this meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I ask witnesses, members and those in the Public Gallery to turn off their phones as they interfere with the recording equipment.  We want what everyone has to say to be heard clearly.  M&aacute; t&aacute; s&eacute; sin d&eacute;anta ag gach &eacute;inne cuirfimid t&uacute;s leis an gcomhr&aacute;.

We have been given advance copies of the statements, some of which are quite long.  If the witnesses want to summarise their opening statements, that is fine because they will be published in full on our website.  Our aim today is to elaborate on what is in those documents and to make space to address issues concerning the future of the Abbey Theatre as Ireland's national theatre.  Members will pose questions when the witnesses have finished making their statements.</p><p>I now invite Mr. Declan Conlon to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

If it is okay with the committee, I will read the statement in full.</p> <p>  A Chathaoirligh agus a dhaoine uaisle, I have worked as a professional actor for almost 30 years.  I appreciate the opportunity to represent the signatories of the letter of concern sent to the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan.  That letter, with 312 signatories, was sent to the Minister, the Arts Council and the board of the Abbey Theatre on 7 January 2019.  Since then further signatories have signed to these concerns and now total 409.  I would like to speak to the concerns raised in the letter and clarify some responses that have been received in relation to it.</p> <p>  When the change in directorship in the Abbey Theatre occurred in late 2016 the theatre community excitedly welcomed the new directors.  Their first short programme introduced several independent companies to the stage of our national theatre by remounting very successful shows &ndash; a veritable best of - and the thought at the time was that this was a good initiative as it would give the new directors time to settle into their roles and engage with the theatre community before revealing a new vision and model to the stakeholders.  Now, coming into the third year of their directorship, there is no evidence of this new vision or an understanding of the history, remit and responsibilities of our national theatre.  The programme continues to host a disproportionate level of revivals or remounts from the previous years' programme, co-productions or buy-in shows for presentation.  The level of in-house productions has continued to decrease.  In a city with only two major producing houses, a substantial reduction of in-house productions in one impacts greatly on the ecosystem of theatre employment overall.  While a desire to bring in change is welcome, the unintended consequences of this changed model need to be addressed.</p> <p>  In 2013 and  2014 the Abbey created a &euro;1.6 million profit which then covered planned and approved losses in the following two years for the lead up to and presentation of the 2016 centenary programme.  Although the new directorships&rsquo; plan was endorsed for its financial viability and we are told it has "delivered modest surpluses and re-introduced the financial stability essential for the continued operation of the theatre&rdquo; the Abbey Theatre closed 2017 with an operating loss of nearly &euro;47,000.  We are not suggesting a return to the previous programming policies.  However, these current strategies have had a detrimental effect on practitioners.  To evolve, the Abbey and the industry need to forge a mutually beneficial way forward.</p> <p>  The Abbey Theatre released a statement on 7 January in response to our letter.  In it the theatre claimed an inherited &euro;1.4 million deficit whereas at the beginning of the new directors&rsquo; term, the Abbey had a surplus of &euro;488,949.  On 24 May 2017, in the "Village" magazine the directors were quoted as saying: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no deficit at the moment &ndash; there may have been a small operating deficit last year but the Abbey&rsquo;s not &lsquo;in deficit&rsquo; and they&rsquo;re not expecting one this year&rdquo;.  The reckless dissemination of incorrect information regarding a &euro;1.4 million deficit caused reputational damage to the sector by reaffirming clich&eacute;d notions that theatre is always loss making.  Four days later the Abbey issued an updated statement, clarifying there was no deficit.  However, the incorrect information is still perpetuated in some media although it has been retracted, with an apology by the directors to their predecessor.</p> <p>  In our letter we outlined that during the five and a half months between the closing of "Jimmy&rsquo;s Hall" on 8 September 2018 and the opening of "The Country Girls" on 23 February 2019, there would be no Ireland-based actor on the stages of the Abbey Theatre directly contracted by the theatre.  In response, the Abbey's obfuscation continued.  It did not offer comparable numbers.  It has recently come to our attention that the co-production of Tom Kilroy's between the Lyric Theatre, Belfast and the Abbey was contracted by the Lyric for the Belfast run and the Abbey for the Dublin run, so we are happy to clarify that instead of no actor in five and a half months, there were three actors directly employed who featured on an Abbey stage in that time period.  Three directly employed actors on the Abbey stages in five and a half months is unprecedented.</p> <p>  The national theatre has a responsibility toward the creative financial health of the sector.  In order to achieve financial sustainability for artists, the national theatre must assist the independent co-producer to achieve Abbey agreed salaries, terms and conditions alongside artistic excellence.  It must do this by investing in the salary structure.  The Abbey is bound by house rates and subject to certain pay scales and employment rights but independent companies are not.  When the latter are the lead producer on a co-production, this can result in less pay and fewer entitlements for the artists involved.</p><p>Regarding a pay rate differential up to 25%, the Abbey states that there is no basis over the last year in their employment data and budgets for this figure.  At the time of writing the letter, the highest pay differential that had been brought to our attention was 25%.  We have now been further informed.  The cast of an Abbey co-production, while being paid acceptable rates in Dublin, suffered up to a 36% reduction on the Abbey rate when the show played in London and a 67% reduction in subsistence.  We would question the Abbey's data collection and are happy to provide these details to complete its records.<br/><br/>We are told by the Abbey, in its statement of 7 January, that on average over the past six years, it has self-produced 14 shows per annum on the Abbey and Peacock stages and on tour.  However, the Abbey once again clarified itself in an updated statement on 11 January that, in 2019, it will self-produce seven shows on the Abbey stages, thereby confirming a 50% decrease from their own claim.<br/><br/>Communication is the problem.  Historical and institutional memory has been lost.  Phone calls are not returned, e-mails are not answered.  A submission made in May 2017 to the new work department from an artist received an email acknowledging receipt of this submission in February 2018 - nine months later - by which time the artist's idea had already been selected and programmed in a theatre in the UK.  What opportunities are we missing with this current system in place?<br/><br/>The current administration has cut out a fundamental communication cord between artists and the theatre - the casting department.  Previously, this has been the sole point of contact with the Abbey for the theatre community.  The open auditions, which used to take place annually or biannually, have ceased.  It is the remit of the National Theatre to build relationships with actors, to build a bank of talent and to nurture that talent.  In the absence of a casting department, relationships are not formed.  There is no continuity.  Equally, the agents have no point of contact to discuss pay scales, terms and conditions and any and all other issues.  The cutting of this department was a remarkably naive action.  This is the major part of the communication problem.  This is the department that understands and mentors peoples' careers.  The casting department should be reinstated with immediate effect.<br/><br/>It is not only performers who have been affected.  The number of freelance directors contracted by the Abbey has radically reduced.  Under the current model, contracts for freelance directors are significantly down on previous years.  In 2015, 11 freelance directors were contracted for productions on the Abbey and Peacock stages, as opposed to a projected four in 2019.  That is nearly three times fewer employment opportunities at present for freelance directors.<br/><br/>Writers are similarly cast adrift - an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>by the playwright Jimmy Murphy on 15 January outlined that &quot;confusion now abounds as to whether the national theatre has a functioning literary department that engages with playwrights to discuss commissioning new works.&quot;  The Writers' Guild of Ireland requested numbers on new commissioned works from the Abbey on 16 January to inform this presentation but has yet to receive a response.<br/><br/>Currently, the productions directed by Graham McLaren, including revivals, amount to the majority of the Abbey's production output.  A single artistic vision or voice is dominating self-produced Abbey shows.  This is unprecedented and unbalanced.  Previous artistic directors who themselves were professional directors did not direct such a large proportion of in-house shows.  Combined with the policy to increase co-production, present buy-ins and re-present extant work, freelance opportunities become increasingly meagre.  The request made in our letter of concern was not to end these long-established practices of co-production or presentation but simply to increase the proportion of self-produced shows, thereby generating further employment.<br/><br/>We have to speak to the issue of double funding.  The Abbey receives 50% of the entire Arts Council drama budget.  It has recently co-produced with several of the largest Arts Council-funded companies in the country, thereby benefitting not only from its own funding but from the funding brought in by that independent company.  Many of these productions would most likely have been produced anyway but at a different venue.  For example, the Druid Theatre Company has a show every year as part of the Dublin Theatre Festival, usually hosted at the Gaiety.  The Abbey has always historically produced a Dublin Theatre Festival show.  Last year, for the first time, the Abbey did not produce a show for the festival but instead hosted Druid's show.  This not only houses our audience in one venue but ultimately reduces choice for audiences by having one show on where there could be two in separate venues.  It also effectively cuts employment for artists in half, ultimately, double the money, half the shows.  This detracts from the theatre ecology as a whole.<br/><br/>Regarding the The Abbey Theatre's presentation of the musical &quot;Come From Away&quot; for the Christmas period, the theatre stated that &quot;Come from Away&quot; did not impinge on the Abbey's grant from the Arts Council and it is expected to return a financial contribution that will be invested in the Abbey Theatre's programme for 2019 and beyond.  Contrast this with Neil Murray's interview in <i>The Irish Times</i>on 1 December where he maintained &quot;'with a good following wind', if it runs for two years on the West End, 'we would definitely recoup our initial costs'&quot;.  Questions abound.  Was this show cost neutral?  How was this show funded, if not by the Arts Council grant?  Were the ticket prices for a bought-in commercial show subsidised by Arts Council funding?  Ireland-based agents put their clients forward at the beginning of March for consideration for this show but received no response.  The UK-based casting director informed us on 5 April that they would be going into final auditions as of the following day and their process was nearly over.  After pressure and questioning from actors and agents on Monday, 9 April, the UK casting director contacted Ireland-based agents requesting to meet with their clients.  No director attended these auditions, no Abbey representative was present and no one was cast from the Dublin auditions.  This timescale lends substance to the perception that these brief and hurried auditions were nothing but a cynical exercise.  Was this production predominately cast prior to the Dublin auditions?  This show garnered excellent reviews from media and audiences alike and we stand by our statement in our letter that these excellent shows should be seen by Irish audiences in the correct venues, which are plentiful.  In terms of the National Theatre, why are these franchises being bought in instead of investing in making new work?  Where's our chance to make shows such as &quot;Come From Away&quot; or &quot;Room&quot;?<br/><br/>We acknowledge the increase in The Abbey Theatre audiences and are delighted that more people are attending the National Theatre.  The introduction of the free first previews is an excellent initiative and has clearly demonstrated that the country has an appetite for theatre and wants it subsidised.  However, it would be prudent to note that in comparison with other theatres such as, for example, the Project Arts Centre, which receives a subsidy of &euro;718,000 and attracts an audience of 50,000, or Smock Alley Theatre, which receives a subsidy of &euro;80,000 and attracts an audience of 59,000, it can bee seen that with far less subsidy, these venues are attracting excellent audiences and in comparable terms of bang for buck, much higher returns.  Therefore, is it about bums on seats?  These other venues need to create a somewhat commercially viable programme to sustain themselves.  There is less onus on the National Theatre to do this and but more on it to nurture new playwrights, to challenge audiences with works that are complex and contradictory, like the audiences themselves and like the world we all find ourselves living in, and to nurture and mentor all of our artists at all stages of their careers.<br/><br/>We welcome new initiatives, such as the new works department, but we need transparency in regards to how it works.  How many, if indeed any, commissions are progressed through it and what are the criteria for selection?  This initiative seems to be the only avenue for established playwrights, as well as those emerging voices.  Is it taking the place of the literary department?  Is this the best method to deal with those writers who have built up bodies of work and already have a relationship with the National Theatre?  We note with interest the appointment of a new dramaturg but urge clarification on the job roles within the organisation and the installation of a clear method of communication and feedback for artists.<br/><br/>We also urge clarity on the chosen co-productions.  How are project selected?  What are the criteria for selecting and funding?  How can a company apply to be considered?  Must the company have a financial input or can it be artistic only?<br/><br/>Let us be very clear.  This is not about the current directors of the Abbey Theatre.  This is about the current policy, strategy, pay scales and employment opportunities.  This is about communication and engagement with the entire sector.  This is about the role of our National Theatre, the passion and respect we have for it, and the vital direction we hope for in the future in order to evolve, sustain and enhance the ecology of theatre across the board.<br/><br/>Our letter was written in order to call on the Abbey board to define its strategy and to present a model which is cognisant of the many issues raised by the signatories.  The Abbey Theatre's five-year plan for 2019-23 states that the Abbey Theatre is &quot;artist-led and audience-focused&quot;.  If that is true, the voices of the 409 artists who signed the letter of concern need to be heard.</p></speech>

This is an evolving model whose content and roll-out are also evolving.  What triggered this meeting, as we have just heard, was the letter written by the 312 signatories in January.  We immediately put in train arrangements to try to meet with the signatories' representatives.  We believe a dialogue is required.  That planned dialogue has, I think, been very much welcomed by everyone as the appropriate way forward.  We are sitting down with many technical details of the matter in hand.  For this reason we will concentrate our engagement with the committee today on the specific areas it has identified because we do not wish to pre-empt or create preconditions for what we hope will be a constructive and direct conversation on Friday and beyond.  That is our current position.</p> <p>  I wish to brief members on the Abbey's history, our current governance and our strategy.  Mr. Neil Murray will then talk about the more specific details of our approach to production.  In 1904 W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory established the Abbey Theatre, and their stated manifesto was "to bring upon the stage the deeper emotions of Ireland".  I think many members who have seen theatre in the Abbey in recent years will have seen some very deep emotions of Ireland brought forward to the audiences.  In 1925 the Abbey became the first State-subsidised theatre in the English-speaking world, which is something we are all very proud of.  This State support has fostered great playwriting and theatre-making, with the production of many memorable plays over 90 years.  I think I was at the Abbey for the first time in 1965.  I have every programme from the Abbey Theatre back to 1968, when I started as a college student.</p> <p>  In 2008 a new governance was put in place following discussions up to that period, establishing the Abbey as a company limited by guarantee.  The recurrent funding comes from the Arts Council, which acts at arm's length from the Department.  It was very much part of the decision at the time that there should be that space.  Given the scale of the funding, and the Abbey's role as a national cultural institution, the theatre operates in full compliance with all the legislation overseeing those in receipt of significant financial aid from Government.  We see this as extremely important.  That is our second hat, which is as a national cultural institution, and the scale of funding requires that we be compliant.  The memorandum of association establishes the key elements of our responsibilities, which include promoting the performance of dramatic arts to the highest standards, producing and co-producing plays, commissioning plays and promoting appreciation of drama.</p> <p>  In 2014 an independent review of the Abbey Theatre was commissioned by the Arts Council and conducted by international experts Bonnar Keenlyside.  It recommended a reprioritisation of the Abbey's activities to address a lack of touring and of community and education work, the under-involvement of visiting companies and the underutilisation of the Peacock Theatre as a space for artistic experimentation.  In the period since, the Abbey has implemented the review's recommendations.  In 2015 the board appointed Mr. Neil Murray and Mr. Graham McLaren as its co-directors with effect from July 2016, and with ownership of the programme from January 2017.  They were given a clear mandate to increase the activity levels of the Abbey while maintaining financial sustainability.  Slides 5 and 6 in the pack refer to these figures.</p> <p>  In November 2015 the publication of the Waking The Feminists report, showing the lack of gender balance in the 2016 programme, led the directors to prioritise the improvement of gender balance as soon as possible as a key objective.  Following my appointment in May 2017, we began the process of undertaking a strategic review, culminating in our five-year strategy, which has been circulated to the committee.  It was very much informed by the Bonnar Keenlyside report and feedback from the Arts Council as well as developments in theatre internationally.  If one visits the website of the National Theatre in London, one will find its discussion of what a new works department is.  This is a new way of creating theatre that the National Theatre and others are following.  It also reflects the Government's strong ambition for and commitment to the creative arts, which has been a fantastic development in recent years; a desire to build a young, diverse audience, which is crucial and which the Abbey did not have as it tended to have an older audience, which has now changed dramatically; and the requirement to be financially sustainable.</p> <p>  I wish to refer to that for a moment, because it was mentioned in passing.  At the end of 2016, there was indeed no accumulated deficit.  This was wrongly put out in the statement from the Abbey.  It was corrected as soon as it was brought to the Abbey's attention.  Accumulated losses were expressed as an accumulated deficit, which, as an economist, I know is an entirely different thing.  We absolutely regret and apologise for the distress caused by this.  What it did mean was that when the Abbey came in, our reserves were under &euro;500,000, which for a theatre with a budget of approximately &euro;10 million is a very low level of reserves, and accountants could not recommend this as a sustainable way to continue.  It is absolutely the case that there was no deficit but it is the case that the level of reserves was not and remains not at a level to support what we need to do.</p> <p>  Our new strategy, which is highlighted on slides 2 and 3 in the pack, compels us to move forward in a spirit of collaboration.  This is what we have sought to do and that is why the interaction with small and large companies throughout the country was seen as a positive thing.  It was felt that it would be beneficial to have more involvement with smaller and larger companies throughout the country, and this will develop in different ways.   At heart is our robust commitment to the arts, the art form and audiences throughout the country and internationally when the Abbey tours as an important part of Government policy.  The strategy is driven by our core values, which are excellence, inclusivity, diversity and equality.  As I mentioned earlier, gender equality continues to be prioritised.</p> <p>  From my perspective as chair of the board, I have observed some very important achievements over the past two years.  These include the exceptional progress in increasing gender balance, which members will see is recorded in the statistics on slide 8; the greater activity levels in the Peacock Theatre, which everyone openly welcomes and is delighted to see; the presentation of new and overlooked voices, different kinds of companies getting their opportunity on the Abbey stage, which then allows them to travel internationally with the reputation of having been in their national theatre; increased numbers, which we detail on slide 9; and the changing profile of the audiences.  I think everyone who has been to the Abbey will have noticed just how different the audience mix has become and how much more socially and demographically wide-ranging it is than it has been in the past.  It has brought to the stage some very challenging social issues, and we can talk to a whole range of these that have come up in the past year which are extremely relevant.  Again, it is important to maintain annual expenditure in line with annual income.</p> <p>  In celebrating these achievements, which have definitely been what the board set out to achieve, there have been significant changes.  In any organisation significant changes have some unintended consequences, and I am delighted to see that there is recognition that these are unintended consequences.  In the past four months, these unintended consequences have been under very active discussion between the Abbey Theatre and the Arts Council.  They have been on the agenda and have been widely discussed to see how we might deal with them.  As the recent Theatre Forum research illustrates, the working lives of artists are precarious and making a decent living as a freelancer is very hard.  To make theatre, an openness to criticism as well as creativity is required.  The Abbey regrets that large numbers within our artistic community feel that our journey towards a more collaborative national theatre has contributed to their personal hardship.  We commit to engaging with them and to do what we can as the National Theatre to address their concerns and show leadership in strengthening and enriching Ireland's theatre sector.  I hope we can use the opportunity of Friday's meeting to commence a constructive dialogue towards this end.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.665" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neil Murray" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22019013000002#D00500"><p>Chairman, Deputies, Senators, colleagues, the approach adopted by the Abbey from 2017 onwards, in line with a strategy agreed with the Abbey board, has been to develop a national theatre that, as Mr. Conlon said, is artist-led and audience-focused.  We believe our National Theatre should be a people's theatre at the heart of Ireland's civic and social life, a theatre for all, regardless of where in the country one lives or the amount of money in one's pocket.  Central to the history and legacy of the Abbey Theatre is its role as a producing theatre.  This continues to be at the heart of our activity.  For example, 2018 featured acclaimed productions of Marina Carr's "On Raftery's Hill", and "Come On Home" by Phillip McMahon, featuring a performance by my colleague here, Mr. Conlon.</p><p>The run of "Jimmy&rsquo;s Hall" in 2018 features among the best-attended shows in the Abbey&rsquo;s history.</p><p> Alongside producing its own work, the Abbey Theatre has always co-produced and co-presented work.  For example, in 2016 David Ireland&rsquo;s incendiary "Cyprus Avenue", starring Stephen Rea, was co-produced with the Royal Court Theatre, London, and in the same year Frank McGuinness&rsquo;s "Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme" was co-produced with Headlong Theatre and the Liverpool Everyman and Playhouse theatres in England and the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow, Scotland.</p><p> We believe in a national theatre that could also be a resource for the nation's theatre companies and makers.  This has led to an increase in the number of co-productions and presentations while retaining the Abbey&rsquo;s identity as a major producing theatre.  The impact of opening the Abbey up to other companies and artists, while welcomed by many, and which was an important part of the transition process, did have the consequence of reducing the number of self-produced shows across 2017 and 2018, which we clearly acknowledge.  We acknowledge that some have been disadvantaged by that decision while recognising that others who had previously struggled to find a home at the Abbey have benefitted.  The 2019 programme includes more self-produced work, while retaining the principle of an open collaborative programme.  There will be seven Abbey Theatre self-produced shows on the Abbey stage, of which three will tour in Ireland, the US and the UK.  Our self-produced work will be on the Abbey stage for 31 weeks in 2019, with co-produced work occupying 14 weeks and presented work occupying five weeks.  A further two weeks are reserved for essential maintenance.</p><p> In 2019 the smaller Peacock stage, which for financial reasons was dark for long periods in the past, will have a full programme of work.  This includes development periods for new shows by the Abbey and other artists, and initiatives such as the Abbey&rsquo;s 5x5 programme, where under-represented communities are given the funding and space to work on the Peacock stage for a week.  The pilot in the first year of that programme included the Pavee Point and Traveller health care project, and Shadowbox, a group for people with intellectual disabilities.  It also includes the Young Curators programme, a season of work for young people selected by young people, as well as small-scale presentations by innovative, independent Irish companies and artists.  Through these initiatives, we believe we will help to unearth the new voices of Ireland and, in turn, welcome a new and diverse audience.  Could the next Synge or O&rsquo;Casey currently be living in direct provision?  We will never know if we do not open our doors to these companies and organisations.</p><p> This approach allows both the Abbey and Peacock stages to operate all year round.  The three-year average of 49 productions in 2017-19 compares with the corresponding average of 36 shows across the stages for 2014-16.  As noted, audiences are responding positively to this approach.  Our attendances are continuing to grow and reached 127,500 at the Abbey Theatre in 2018, the highest since 2010.  Crucially, for 56% of that audience it was their first time attending the Abbey.</p><p> We believe in a national theatre where our artists are allowed to fail but must be celebrated when they succeed.  The programme adjustment has lead to a significant improvement in gender equality on the Abbey&rsquo;s stages, which, like the other main Irish stages, have had a pronounced gender imbalance in the past.  As well as the Abbey's self-produced programme investing directly in female talent, our invitation to small, independent companies, in whose works we have also invested, to present on the Abbey stages has contributed to the speed at which we have been able to improve gender balance and bring greater variety to our audiences.</p><p> Against this positive outlook for the theatre, we take very seriously the concerns raised by some in the theatre community, particularly around employment opportunities for Irish and Irish-based artists being directly employed by the Abbey.  Let me give the committee a picture for 2019.  Our self-produced programme will directly employ 85 actors over a total of 775 actor weeks.  Of those 85 actors, the vast majority will be Irish and predominantly Irish-based.  A further 66 Irish or Irish-based actors will be employed through co-production and paid directly at Abbey rates over a total of a further 342 actor weeks.  Through in-association, presentation, readings and workshop agreements, which are outlined on the slide, we estimate a further 120 actors will engage in paid employment with the Abbey in 2019.</p><p> I want to address the concerns expressed in regard to potential underpayment for artists working at the Abbey, which we take incredibly seriously, under the co-production, in-association and presentation contracts issued potentially by a partner theatre company.  In regard to co-production, we have been in discussion with the Arts Council on this matter in recent months and we have agreed to ensure that all future contracts will include a condition that any artist engaged in a co-production with the Abbey will be paid at the appropriate Abbey rate or higher, whether at the Abbey or outside it.  The issue of the Abbey determining pay rates for other companies presenting work at the Abbey is legally complex and we would like to see this issue form part of the planned dialogue with our theatre colleagues over the coming weeks.</p><p> We believe the Abbey Theatre should always be a fair-minded employer and collaborator while providing a good return for substantial public investment.  We believe our programmes balance artistic ambition with financial prudence, and support artistic development and diversity, while encouraging ever-larger audiences to visit the Abbey Theatre.  We welcome this opportunity to engage in positive dialogue with our colleagues from the Irish theatre sector and the Arts Council to ensure that our collective focus on making and presenting great theatre, in ways that are fair to artists and attractive to audiences, is at the heart of all we do.</p></speech>

I want to thank the committee for inviting us here today to discuss the current model of production, presenting and co-presenting at the Abbey Theatre.  I will outline the work of the Arts Council, our relationship with the Abbey Theatre and how we work to develop theatre and all of the arts in Ireland.</p> <p>  The Arts Council&rsquo;s role is to support the development of the arts.  We do this through a range of grants and awards towards the production and creation of artistic work by supporting organisations, supporting individual artists and working in partnership with other agencies to develop the arts.  The Arts Council has committed in its strategy "Making Great Art Work" to ensuring that artists are supported to make excellent work, which is enjoyed and valued.  We work across all of our funding relationships and programmes to achieve this goal.  In 2019 the Arts Council's overall budget is &euro;75 million across a range of art forms, areas of arts practice and supports for individual artists, as well as partnerships and development initiatives.</p> <p>  The Arts Council directly funds the Abbey Theatre, recognising its national cultural institution status, as well as the Abbey's distinctive position as a building-based national theatre.  Under the 2005 memorandum and articles of association of the Abbey Theatre, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht directly appoints the chair and three directors of the Abbey Theatre.  This process is now managed via the Public Appointments Service process, albeit the Abbey is not a State body.  The Arts Council also has appointing authority by participating in a selection committee that appoints three further directors.  This selection committee comprises the chair of the Arts Council, the chair of the Abbey Theatre and an independent theatre practitioner.  Additionally, there are staff appointees to the board of directors.  The board of the Abbey Theatre is responsible for the governance and management of the organisation, including the artistic, strategic and financial aspects of the company.  The Arts Council provides public funding to enable the organisation to carry out its work.  The Abbey is audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  In 2013 the Arts Council commissioned Bonnar Keenlyside to undertake an independent evaluation and analysis of the Abbey Theatre.  The purpose of the review was to examine the business model of the Abbey Theatre in 2013 with the aim of identifying how available public funding might secure the best outcomes for the Abbey, the theatre community and the public.  The review also considered how the Abbey Theatre could deliver its mission in a way that was more efficient and effective, and whether resources might be deployed to deliver more in terms of artistic and programming outputs.  Following receipt of the report in April 2014, the Arts Council and the Abbey formed a working group which met from May 2014 to work through many of the proposals within that report.  Specifically, there was a focus on the following: the operating model and the use of the Peacock Theatre as the development engine of the Abbey Theatre; increased production of new work prioritising Irish writing and Irish plays about Ireland, both commissioned and those by visiting companies; increased engagement and touring; legacy and leadership with talks and discourse being led by the Abbey; restructuring of the budgeting of the company&rsquo;s finances; restructuring of the staffing models for productions to increase in-house capacity; and a new system for monitoring and evaluation.</p> <p>  The working group comprised the following make-up: from the Arts Council, the chair and members of the council, the director and other senior staff; and from the Abbey, the chair and two board members, the director and other senior staff.</p><p>Although the working group was established to oversee and review implementation of the findings and proposals made in the Bonnar Keenlyside report which were largely addressed under the direction of the previous director, it continued to meet on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis on the engagement of the current artistic team, particularly in the context of the most recent bid for three-year funding.<br/><br/>The Arts Council has provided three-year funding for the Abbey Theatre on three occasions: for the periods 2006 to 2008, 2011 to 2013 and 2014 to 2016.  Funding over a three-year period affords the Abbey Theatre and many other organisations a realistic timeframe within which to plan and implement changes and has proved successful on a number of levels.  It provides security of income which assists in forward planning, both artistically and financially.  As the periods 2011 to 2013 and 2014 to 2016, in particular, were marked by reduced support from the Arts Council due to the economic downturn and its impact on Government funding, this forward funding facility became ever more important.  In 2015 a three-year funding agreement was extended by one year to include 2017.  It had been sought to assist in the smooth transition to the current leadership team within the Abbey Theatre.  <br/><br/>In 2017 the Arts Council entered into discussions with the Abbey Theatre on a new three-year funding agreement.  At the time the Abbey Theatre was also developing a new artistic vision, mission and programme.  In February 2017 the Arts Council delayed agreeing to a three-year funding envelope as it required a more comprehensive and detailed application from the Abbey Theatre.  As a result, the council only made a one-year funding commitment of &euro;7 million to the Abbey Theatre for the period September 2017 to September 2018, including &euro;200,000 towards the cost of touring, and sought further information and details of its artistic vision and strategy, overall programme and models of production and presentation before it would make an offer for subsequent years.<br/><br/>In October 2018 the Arts Council made a further offer of funding to the Abbey Theatre for 2019 and 2020, with a series of conditions attached.  The conditions focused specifically on the Abbey Theatre providing clarity on the nature of the production and presenting models being programmed, the impact on quality employment opportunities for actors and creatives, in particular, through an increased output of Abbey Theatre own productions, and the level of remuneration across all models of production at the theatre.  The council agreed to withhold &euro;300,000 of the funding proposed for 2019 until these areas were addressed.  It met the board and executive of the Abbey Theatre in November and December 2018, with a further meeting to take place following the plenary meeting of the council in February 2019.  <br/><br/>The previous model at the Abbey Theatre saw six equally budgeted productions and one international visiting production, coupled with a fluctuating number of Peacock shows.  Increased programming at the Peacock occurred latterly and was dependent on funds being generated from a box office surplus in the Abbey Theatre.  The new model of production structure is varied.  There are fewer of the Abbey Theatre's own productions, but a high number of national and international co-productions and presentations afford the programme a much increased output.  Presentations and co-productions aim to foster genuine and ongoing relationships between individual theatre artists, independent theatre companies, festivals and the national theatre.  They provide audiences with the opportunity to see a greater variety of work on the Abbey Theatre stages.  <br/><br/>The role of the national theatre is to be a leader in presenting and producing work that inspires and engages, as well as supporting the theatre community and sustaining the sector with exemplary employment opportunities.  The responsibility for the artistic and strategic direction of the Abbey Theatre rests with its board.  The Arts Council cannot and does not wish to dictate the artistic programme of the Abbey Theatre.  However, it does, through its funding relationship and art form policies, attend to overarching concerns such as the fair remuneration of artists, quality employment opportunities for actors and creatives, as well as the balance between the Abbey Theatre's own productions and other independent productions, regardless of whether they are funded by the Arts Council.  The current model, as evidenced by the recent letter from theatre practitioners to the Minister, as well as the Arts Council's articulated concerns, two years into its realisation, is impacting on the broader theatre ecology, with unintended consequences.  A review of the impact of this model, as well as a re-balancing, is now required.  The Arts Council continues to work with the Abbey Theatre and the theatre sector to ensure the very best outcomes can be achieved for practitioners and audiences.</p></speech>

We cannot ignore the impact of prolonged under-investment as we assess why that model has been chosen at the Abbey Theatre and pursued by the board and directors.  I also acknowledge the positive work undertaken by the directors in the areas of public engagement and audience development.  However, a direction that leads to wage depression of up to 25%, accidentally or otherwise, is unacceptable.  Every person in the national theatre should be afforded the highest industry pay scales to reflect the stature and importance of the national theatre which should set the bar for the wider industry.  I am alarmed by the 54% reduction in the number of actors directly employed by the Abbey Theatre and the move away from original works as it leads to a smaller pool of theatre work for everyone.  We should not forget that artists who are not salaried continue to be left devastated by austerity.  According to CSO data, artists are now earning 3.5% less than in 2013.  Even those on salaries took a hit, but the work for self-employed persons disappeared, with the Arts Council budget which from 2008 reduced from &euro;82 million to &euro;56 million in 2014.</p> <p>  At this point, in gradually improving funding circumstances, the Abbey Theatre and other well funded organisations have to lead the way on pay and conditions for those who are not on a salary.  The Arts Council funds theatre more than any other art form and more than half of that budget goes to the Abbey Theatre.  I have three initial questions for the Abbey Theatre.  Will it commit to trying harder?  Will it guarantee that it will lead by example before the year is out?  I understand the Abbey Theatre programme is set from now until the end of the summer.  What measures can the theatre take immediately and what will have to be put on the long finger, given the commitments that have been made in the programme this year?</p></speech>

How soon can that be done?  It will be done immediately and is already in train.  The other issues are more complicated because of legal requirements under competition and labour law.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.675" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neil Murray" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22019013000002#F00700"><p>I thank Senator Warfield for his questions.  It is great to have the opportunity to engage in this discussion.  When Mr. Graham McLaren and I came to the Abbey Theatre, there was absolutely a hunger for change and a more open philosophy in its relationship with artists and companies which had previously not been given opportunities there.  It was never our intention to make the Abbey Theatre an organisation that did not produce its own works.  As we said, in 2019 that number is up to seven shows again, which is pretty much in line with what the Abbey Theatre has been doing in the past seven or eight years, prior to Mr. McLaren and I taking over.</p><p>The co-productions come from an artistic and creative impulse and from meetings with organisations who approach us with ideas to tell important stories on the national stage.  We are, for example, about to do the first co-production in 2019 with THEATREclub.  What people might see as double funding, we see as enhancement.  An organisation can come to the Abbey with a relatively small amount of money for a show.  We then sit down with them and ask how much they need to make the show the way they really want to make it.  That includes absolutely paying them at the rate they should be paid, as if they are working for the Abbey Theatre.  We add a sum of money, which enhances their budget and it means THEATREclub gets to make a show on the main stage of the Abbey theatre, in a way they could not have done elsewhere.  They could have made the show but with less resources and potentially not pay at the rate they are able to because of what the Abbey is giving them.  Our aim is to absolutely step up the level of self-produced work.  That is in our bones and is what we as theatre makers want to do.  We want to keep the positive sense of collaboration and openness at the Abbey coming in.  The 2019 programme is effectively in place with the seven self-produced shows, a couple of co-productions, and some still to be determined through discussions with the Arts Council.</p><p> As we start to look forward to 2020, in the longer term as the Senator has put it, starting this week we will be in discussion with our colleagues to hopefully take advantage of the extraordinary talent in Ireland and the extraordinary potential opportunity here.  The Abbey wants to be part of that and wants to make positive engagement with the community.  We have been doing that with a lot of people who have had access to the Abbey and who previously did not.  Clearly we have to make redress with people who are dissatisfied with that model.  We are listening, we want to talk and we want to engage.</p></speech>

The national theatre is expected to punch way above its weight in original works that receive international critical and commercial success.  I am very aware of the new playwright programme and its importance to develop the writer and not just the play.  The Peacock has been described as the engine room of Irish theatre.  I have seen plays in the Peacock recently that could and should be on the main Abbey stage.  Does Mr. Murray accept that Irish theatre will not survive, or that we will not have another Brian Friel, with the policy of old revivals and recent reruns, and the buying in of international productions?</p></speech>

The 2019 programme has three new plays on the Abbey stage.  There is room for revivals and other presentations, but we are also making new theatre.  This also happened in 2018; there were new productions in the Peacock such as <i>Porcelain</i>and <i>Come on Home</i>, as well as new productions on the Abbey stage.  In 2019 there will be three new plays, commissioned by the Abbey and all by Irish writers, on the Abbey stage.</p></speech>

What do the witnesses think it means to the Abbey Theatre when the Arts Council withholds &euro;300,000?

We wanted to chose a figure that was large enough to indicate our concern.</p> <p>  At this point it might be no harm to emphasise the fact that the increased payment - the proper payment - to artists and all of the people who work in the Abbey will come out of the Abbey Theatre budget.  Independent production companies will not be topping up the payment.  The independent production companies and the Abbey Theatre will also have a much more stringent reporting relationship with the Arts Council so we can ensure there is not undue double funding.</p></speech>

I would certainly not be living in Ireland.  I look with admiration and respect at my friends who are making a living in the arts.  Playwright Shaun Dunne asked a group of politicians in Leinster House recently, if artists cannot afford to live here in this country does Ireland still get to claim their legacy?  It is my instinct that the Arts Council cannot set rates, but if something is funded by the Arts Council can we ensure that the people are well paid and that the rates set by Irish Equity, by Visual Artists Ireland, or the Musicians Union of Ireland - if and when it sets rates - are imposed by the Arts Council with an iron fist?</p></speech>

In the past when we have assessed applications and felt that the artists were not getting paid enough we have withheld money and we have conditioned funding, especially in the visual arts area.  We are currently developing a stated policy.  The Senator is absolutely right that we cannot set pay rates for artists, but we can work with resource organisations such as Theatre Forum, Visual Artists Ireland and Dance Ireland to ensure they are very clear around the optimum pay rates for artists.  The theatre sector is much more heavily unionised than other sectors and Irish Equity is there to service that purpose.  It is not so easy, however, in other art forms and particularly in areas such as visual arts where an individual artist is trying to get his or her work seen in an exhibition or in group shows.  We work very closely with Visual Artists Ireland to ensure those artists are paid properly for exhibition fees and when it is brought to our attention that artists are not being paid properly we would often condition funding to different organisations or galleries to ensure that it happens.</p></speech>

Under Part 9 of the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council has a general function to "furnish advice or information to a Minister of the Government [...] whenever the Council considers</p> <p>it appropriate".  Does the witness accept that the Arts Council has fallen short in the last eight or nine years in developing upon the living and working conditions report or the economic impact report?  Can we expect more research that would enable the Minister to approach the Department of Finance in budget 2020?</p></speech>

That report cost &euro;100,000 at the time.  During the years when our funding was reducing we had to make decisions, and it was decided that we could not possibly invest that kind of public money in commissioning of reports when actually we know what we know, which is that artists are not well paid and that they struggle to make a living.  We did not think it was appropriate at the time to spend &euro;100,000 to be told what we knew and what we know.  The last economic impact study was in 2012.  We did not feel it appropriate to use our reducing resources on impact studies, again for financial reasons.  With regard to the theatre sector and the theatre community, at an Arts Council meeting last week we discussed looking at the impact of the current model of production at the Abbey Theatre on the full arts and theatre ecology, and how we will work with the sector to ensure we can address the concerns being raised</p></speech>

I was delighted to be able to tell them, like a pantomime villain, that we were all aghast at this because nobody could find out how the money was being spent.  We would never see that kind of money in arts, culture, the islands and the Gaeltacht.  I want to point out that 75% of actors have no health insurance.  That is at the core of what we are talking about here, which is a livable wage.  I would also say the same about nurses.  Nurses cannot afford to live in this country, nor can radiographers or occupational therapists.  I believe that this place has gone half mad.</p><p>I turn to points about which I want to ask each of the witnesses.  I thought Mr. Conlon's paper was excellent.  He caught it in one what really needs to be discussed on Friday, outside of this committee.  I refer to the breakdown of communication, the no-casting department, which is ridiculous, the no-open auditions or the settled before the outcome situation, the freelance directors and the decrease in the number of writers and directors.  I ask Mr. Murray if these matters will be sorted.  It was like a very good soliloquy in that it was from the heart, was extremely factual and he was on the money as to what is going on and as to why would 407 actors have signed this.  They would not do that easily.  The point made about the difference between audience growth, bums on seats, and artistic excellence.  These were brilliant points throughout Mr. Conlon's paper.</p><p>Mr. Murray said that he has agreed to ensure that all future contracts will include a condition any artists engaged in a co-production with the Abbey Theatre will be paid at the appropriate Abbey Theatre rate or higher, which is answered there.  What about the other areas?  I will go on to my second question and then he can come back to that.</p><p>I ask Ms McBride, the director of the Arts Council, if she thinks the Abbey Theatre is doing its job.  What would she recommend?  Does she agree with the new strategies because she said there are unintended consequences and that a rebalancing is now required.  Can she explain to me what she means by that required rebalancing?</p><p>Can I ask Dr. Ruane how much did the Bonnar Keenlyside report cost?  Did this report tell her anything she did not know already?  She said something, which was extraordinary.  She said:  </p><blockquote>To make theatre, an openness to criticism as much as creativity is required.  The Abbey regrets that some of our artistic community feel our journey [it is more than some] towards a more collaborative national theatre has contributed to their hardship.</blockquote> <p>Could she explain that and how she intends to ensure that never happens again?</p><p>I would like to ask for a general opinion from Mr. Murray, who is new.  I have attended the Abbey Theatre as a member of the audience since I was five years of age.  Is there something wrong that we do not have an Abbey Theatre training school and that we lost that?  Sometimes I go to plays - this is me on a rant - and somebody comes on stage who I know should not be there-----</p></speech>

I am not talking about the training where people have trained since they were a child.  A young actor has to get a chance so I am not talking about that.  There is something wrong about a national theatre that subscribes to everything to which Yeats subscribed, that has produced international world-class actors, some of whom are sitting opposite me, world-class directors and world-class playwrights and yet has no training school.  I do know if that is what the Abbey Theatre has in mind or if that is thought about.  That would be the 300,000 or 400,000 nurturing.  Perhaps I have asked too many questions because they are all really intertwined.</p> <p>  The actors in the Visitors Gallery, the practitioners sitting across from me and the Arts Council know more about this than I do.  If I was to ask where I would find out the truth, I would not go to the media or to politicians.  I sit in the Senate, so we are legislators.  I would go to the theatre because Mark Patrick Hederman was in here last week and he said that we have forgotten that artists are the greatest cardiograph of the present and the prognosis of the future.  The writer, the artist, the practitioner, the musician or visual artist will track where a country is far faster than any politician.  He was talking about this philosophically but if we lose that, the great young talent and the passion to go into that work and into these areas of artistry, because, as we know we do not treat them properly, internally and externally, and we do not give them enough money, we are then in trouble.</p> <p>  Perhaps the witnesses might answer the questions on training and on the Bonnar Keenlyside report.  Mr. Conlon might like to mention what he felt about writing this document and if he believes any of these matters will be answered because he co-ordinated this very well.  Perhaps the Arts Council might say why it says things like "the unintended consequences".  Ms McBride sounded like a politician when she said rebalancing was now required.</p></speech>

It would be unusual for theatre companies anywhere in the world to have their own training facility.  What we have in Dublin is the Lir Academy, and we are incredibly lucky to have it.  The Lir Academy is a training school in Dublin which is churning out really brilliant actors, particularly young actors but also actors-----</p></speech>

It should happen outside of the national theatre.  It is happening brilliantly in Dublin at the Lir Academy and the national theatre and other theatres are benefitting from that.  The production that was just on our stage had eight recent graduates from that school.  It has the expertise, time, and funding to properly train young people in a brilliant way.  I take my hat off to Lir as well as the Gaiety  School of Acting.  The Lir Academy, in particular, is at the top of its game and is producing really wonderful young actors, which the Abbey Theatre is benefitting from, as indeed are other companies in Ireland.</p></speech>

The Bonnar Keenlyside report was about looking at and diversifying the production model.  It was about opening up the Abbey Theatre and, in particular, looking at animating the Peacock stage and that has happened.  We believe now, particularly with the effect on the artist and other venues around the city and around the country, that in reshaping the production model in the Abbey, there has been a very radical shift in a very short period of time.  It it has affected the lives of individual artists and the theatre sector.  I do not believe it was never intended.  I think we need to stand back and that together, as a sector, we need to work together, collaborate and look at how we can rebalance it in a way.  That is what I mean by rebalancing and unintended consequences.</p></speech>

This letter was written by Maureen McGlynn and Ms Cl&iacute;&oacute;na Dukes with very little input from me so I cannot take credit for it.  I simply delivered it.  Regarding the relationship we mentioned in the letter involving the casting department and the nurturing of young talent, regardless of where it is trained such as in the Lir Academy or the Gaiety School of Acting, there is a significant problem because there is no connection between people coming out of drama schools and the National Theatre.  It seems that the only way one can get access to the National Theatre is by forming a company.  This notion is very odd.  The Abbey's own company began a very long time ago.  Under the change model, everybody would be a freelancer and nobody would have any security of tenure in the arts.  The community adapted to that over the years.  What we have now is a situation where the system has recently changed with the new direction for the Abbey.  As far as I am aware, no artist was consulted about this new direction.  It was obviously discussed by the board of the Abbey and the Arts Council without any consultation with any of the 409 people who have written this letter.  The outcome of this is that freelancers are now being deprived in work in the Abbey because they are freelancers.  If someone does not set up or is not a member of a small company, he or she will not have access to the Abbey Theatre.  The way we used to have access was when a variety of independent freelance directors were employed by the Abbey Theatre, who then employed a wide variety of individual freelance actors because that is how the net was spread.  A wide, or wider, variety of people was employed.  This has shut down completely.  Another side effect is that we have a very limited creative vision as a result.  We said this in the letter.  One man is directing the major funded productions on the main stage of the national theatre - one vision.  As for two of the plays that were mentioned,"Come On Home", which I was very pleased to be a part of, and "On Raftery's Hill", "the latter had ten performances.  This was less than two weeks.</p></speech>

That is a particular type of work as well.  That is a separate question.  There is a lack of a spread of artistic vision because too few freelance independent voices are being employed in the theatre.  I do not understand why people who have been spending 20, 30 or 40 years in this business are not consulted by the people who run the Abbey Theatre about potential shows.  As I have said, if somebody is not in a company, he or she does not hear about it.  When somebody is in a company, the cast for that company consists of the members of that company.  Those are the people who get cast so there are no open auditions for those productions.  That company has its own core members who are cast in that production so there are no open auditions for it.  Will the casting department be reinstated?</p></speech>

In her presentation, Ms McBride mentioned a report commissioned in 2013 that contained specific recommendations.  She then said that the group has continued on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis.  If these recommendations on the operating model, increased production of new work - both commissioned work and work by visiting companies - and a system for monitoring and evaluation were made, why then are we at this point?  Why are we at a place where &euro;300,000 has been withheld because there appear to be issues in terms of what Ms McBride has outlined with regard to the nature of the productions, presenting models being programmed and the impact on quality employment opportunities for actors and creatives?  Why have we reached this place if this working group produced its recommendations and if, as Ms McBride said at the outset, the recommendations were largely addressed?</p><p>Regarding the key points emerging from the presentations, from media coverage, we aware of the fair remuneration of artists, quality employment opportunities and production runs being shorter.  They are the three key points.  It has been stated that one of them is, or is in the process of, being addressed.  It has been agreed that all future contracts will include a condition that any artist engaged in a co-production with the Abbey will be paid the appropriate rate or higher.  The previous discussion concerned the fact that artists are not being paid enough to be able to manage on a long-term basis.</p><p>How does the Abbey Theatre propose to address the three issues that have been raised, namely, fair remuneration, quality employment opportunities and the shorter production runs to which Mr. Conlon referred.</p><p> My third question, on structures and communications, has been raised by other members and relates to my first point.  A meeting will be held on Friday.  What structures, including in communications, are planned to ensure this problem does not arise again and issues do not escalate to the point at which 409 people raise concerns?</p><p> On funding, there have been challenges around budgets in recent years.  It is important to note, however, that the budget for arts and culture has increased by 14% or &euro;22 million since 2018 to almost &euro;190 million.  We must ensure there is accountability for that Exchequer funding and proper structures are in place.  </p></speech>

A different director was in place at that time.  Many of the Bonnar Keenlyside were being attended to at the time.  The reason we are at the point where the Arts Council has withheld &euro;300,000 is that we have been in negotiations with the Abbey Theatre on a new three year funding deal.  We should have made a funding offer to the Abbey back in 2017 for 2018, 2019 and 2020.  In 2017, the Abbey was not ready to provide us with the type of strategy and vision that would have allowed us to make a three year funding agreement with it.  For this reason, we made a one year funding agreement and revisited it when the Abbey provided further information to us.  When that information to allow us to make a decision for 2019 and 2020 was provided late last year, issues and areas of concern arose for the Arts Council and I have clearly articulated these.  It was at that point that we withheld &euro;300,000 to allow us to enter into discussions with the Abbey Theatre.  We have been engaged in discussions since the autumn of last year to address these areas of concern, namely, the remuneration of artists, employment opportunities and the number of Abbey-owned productions versus co-productions.  We reached this point in the context of the concerns we had when we started to engage in a process of agreeing a new three year funding envelope with the Abbey Theatre.  We met the Abbey Theatre's board and its executive twice before Christmas.  We are to be provided with further information prior to a plenary meeting in two weeks.  After that, the group will meet again to see what progress has been achieved in the areas we raised.</p></speech>

The length of the runs does not depend on who is directing but on the show and how long of a run it is thought a particular show can sustain.  "On Raftery's Hill" by Marina Carr was a brilliant piece of work but it was not the best-attended show of the year by any means.  We ran it for three weeks and it did really well and was critically acclaimed.  If one wants bums on seats, one would not necessarily programme that play or many of the other plays that we programme.  We want people to come to the theatre but we programme the theatre from an artistic imperative.  The works must be brilliant, in our view.  A play such as "On Raftery's Hill", which is fantastic and achieved everything we wanted it to achieve, is a hard sell, if I am honest.  To run that show for six weeks would not make sense economically or for the performers.  They would be paid, which would be fantastic, but they would not play to big houses over a six week run of that show.  Other shows are different and I do not want to focus on just one artistic director.</p> <p>  To pick up briefly on casting, a head of casting left in 2017.  In discussion with that person at that time, we decided we would trial not having an in-house casting director.  We ceded that role to the head of producing, which was a new post, and we also worked with freelance casting directors who are of the highest standard.  I will be specific because this was raised by Mr. Conlon.  The show, "Come on Home", was directed by the freelance director, Rachel O'Riordan, who worked with a casting director to cast the show.  There is a process, and a route through a casting director and a director to be cast.  When Graham McLaren casts his shows, he tends to hold very large open workshops of up to 100 people and then narrows it down from there.  There is a process in place.  I accept that it is certainly something we need to address.  If the actors, casting directors and agents feel it is not working, we need to look at it and we will do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.739" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Conlon" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22019013000002#K00400"><p>When I speak of a casting problem, I am not necessarily speaking about it for myself.  I have been working for 30 years and I do not need a casting department as much in the theatre in Ireland.  I raise it because at our meeting last week, a number of young actors who were just out of drama school were very vocal about how they have no connection to the national theatre.  They have no access.  In a permanent casting department, there would be a person whose job it is to go to small fringe shows in the city to see people starting out, whether in pub theatres or wherever else they are doing the shows, build relationships with them, bring them into audition, recognise them and nurture their talent over time.  An independent casting director cannot do that.  He or she will have lots of gigs on at the same time and may be working on a television show and a film simultaneously.  This means knocking out the job because he or she has various other jobs on at the same time.  It is not the same thing and it does not nurture young talent.  When I heard those young actors discuss this at that meeting I was genuinely heartbroken for them because they felt they had no opportunity.</p></speech>

I am very aware of the issues for freelancers.  Among my children and their in-laws, I have five freelancers and one person in paid employment so I know exactly how difficult this is.  However, I have also met young actors who told me that they were out of favour with the person in Abbey and so they never got the gig.  There is a blend or solution to be found that makes sense in having the point of contact and ensuring that what we put in place is fair across the board.  At the moment we are drawing on casting directors and a problem is being identified and I accept that is something we need to address.  However, I would caution that this is something that could limit actors in future.  It does not all go in one direction, just as where some of the shows have been shows have been shorter and longer means that some actors have gained and some have lost in that process.  These are all things that we are happy to discuss in a very open dialogue with the signatories of the letters and their representatives.  I think that the members of the committee will recognise what I feel is the key point.  The Senator mentioned some points at the beginning that relate to the industry or sector relating to payment and the difficulty of surviving as a freelancer in Ireland doing anything.</p><p>Some of them are wider issues which we would need to take up on a sectoral level.  What we are committed to doing is dealing with those which are Abbey Theatre specific, but the background is very difficult for freelancers who came out during the recession and who either had to emigrate or stay here to find limited work.  When we have the discussion, I urge that we have this open dialogue to map the different issues, where they sit and who might have a role to play in progressing in a positive direction.</p></speech>

How is the ripple effect measured?  There is a positive ripple effect and potentially a negative ripple effect.  As I am an economist by background, I know just how difficult it is.  The Arts Council has been working very hard to build its evidence base to try to make its decisions.  I respect this entirely and in the past year we have been finding ways to find out what is needed to allow the Arts Council to make good decisions in our interactions with it.  To me, there is a big issue in the wider sector, but we will start by looking at those issues which are Abbey Theatre-specific and which have a bearing on everything else.</p></speech>

I am also not a member of the joint committee, although I do attend as often as I can.  I thank the Chairman for accommodating me.  I was on the picket line all morning for the nurses' strike.  That is why I was late.  If I go over ground that has been covered, I apologise.</p> <p>  When I read the letter from the signatories, I was delighted that the Abbey Theatre was being discussed at a national level and that everything about it was open for discussion.  To me, that is a good start, whatever one may think about the different sides and angles of the debate.  I was also delighted that the precarious position of theatre actors, theatre performers and theatre makers was being highlighted because, to me, we should all be able to unite on it as a matter of serious concern because it is a big problem.  At the same time, I was sad because I thought different parts of the theatre community were having a crack at each other.  I would like to see them unite in addressing these serious concerns for those who make theatre if they cannot survive and need work coming up Christmas and do not have it because presented productions have been brought here.</p> <p>  I see this as the result of a drift over decades towards a neoliberal model for the arts.  We have moved from a situation where there were theatre companies, some security and training in-house to one where it is completely precarious.  I would like everybody to comment on what they think about this.  We have had a similar debate about the film industry.  One side of the debate says that is just the way it is, that it is nonsense and pie in the sky to think we can go back to a time when there was security of employment for those involved in the arts, film or theatre.  I do not agree with that view, but many seem to think that is just the way it is now.  I would like the delegates to comment on the issue.  </p> <p>  I would particularly like the delegates to comment on the issue in the light of a conversation I had with a friend, who is an opera singer, who found a job in a theatre in Germany last year.  She was amazed at her experience there and I was amazed to hear about it because it contrasts starkly with the sentiments expressed by the signatories about their situation, theatre performers and so on who had a meeting before Christmas in Capel Street and came here last week.  They said they were in a totally precarious situation, that they were at the top of the game and that they could not pay the rent, that they did not know if they would have work the following week and that they needed to get out of the country or drop out of what they were doing.  I then talked to my friend who had just found a job as an opera singer in a theatre.  She said it was amazing, that she got 6 weeks holidays, sick pay and holiday pay, that she would have security of employment if she was there for longer than a year or two, that she basically would have a job for life if she wanted it and would receive a pension.  I wondered if we could have that here and if we should not have it.  Is the battle between the different sides taking place because we have accepted that it is impossible?  Will we end up fighting over the crumbs, the crumbs being who will get to be on the Abbey Theatre stage?  </p> <p>  Some of the actors and performers at the event on Capel Street said to me that the smaller companies had effectively been dismantled because of the cuts.  That is the way they put it.  Where the smaller theatre companies had some security in the past, it is now gone.  There is no security and we are left with a scramble for who will be on the Abbey Theatre stage.  Should we not all unite to say this is not good and that the levels of public support for the arts in this country are pathetic, by which I mean the levels of public funding because the percentage of GDP that goes to the arts is pathetic?  Unless we address that issue, we will end up with a scramble over the crumbs.</p></speech>

What was in place before the crash, like in many other sectors, apart from this one, in terms of some of the structures in place, gave people more certainty, if not security.  The reduced certainty has obviously exacerbated the situation.  It is crucial, therefore, to have funding lines that are more solid and sustained.  Perhaps I am an optimist, but the Government has very publicly committed to increasing the money for the arts over a period of ten years.</p><p>Even doing that was very positive.  We must watch, and it is important that committee members watch, that the money keeps coming through.  It then needs to be spent judiciously throughout the arts system.  This debate has provided a focus and its background is about giving a greater level of certainly of opportunities in the system.</p><p> The Abbey is one stage.  Approximately 200 people were on the main Abbey stage last year in different shapes and forms.  Of these, just the small number - 45 - were involved in direct productions but more than another 100 people were involved in other ways and activities on the main Abbey stage.  As a proportion of the total country this is very small and I agree with Senator Warfield that it has a big ripple effect.  There are also ripple effects from some of the other theatres.  Funding in a systematic increasing way is the absolute key.  There is much to be said for small companies coming together but I am an economist and we believe in small and medium enterprises as the engines of innovation.  I am very strong on this.  I would like to see funding coming in such a way that people could begin to think about the next two to three years in their lives as a period during which they can plan to be creative.  This will only come from greater security of funding in the system.</p></speech>

This is still our aim and we still believe it is achievable.  What we feel we can do because of the funding we receive is to add value to what the Abbey has and enhance what is a real struggle.  We absolutely accept that struggle and we want to be part of the solution.  We really believe this is a time for unity and clarity and the Abbey has a significant part to play in this.  We are really open to this discussion.</p></speech>

It has a specific budget and we cannot expect the Abbey to solve all the problems in the theatre community.  It is important for politicians to remember the soft power and reputational power the arts have in this country.  Ireland is known throughout the world for its theatre and its arts.  People often specifically come to the country to see something in the theatre.  It is difficult to be working in the arts aware this is the reputation they have internationally and yet be living on the breadline at home.  This situation has existed for a very long time and it needs co-ordinated increases in Arts Council funding so we will not be having disagreements among ourselves in the artistic community but will be getting together to lobby Governments for more funding and more respect for the arts.</p> <p>  With regard to the Abbey, we need to mention playwrights briefly.  Historically the Abbey has had a canon of work produced by some of the greatest playwrights in the world, including Se&aacute;n O'Casey and, more recently, Tom Murphy, Brian Friel and Thomas Kilroy.  We have some really excellent-----</p></speech>

There is also Mark O'Rowe.  There are also younger playwrights.  Something is happening on that front.  However, there is a lack of opportunity for them.  We need more cognisance of the fact the Abbey has been a writer's theatre and the spoken word has been very important historically in the Abbey Theatre.</p> <p>  For a separate discussion for a separate time, I would like to see more plays produced because what we have at present are adaptations of other works of art.  We have adaptations of films and novels.  Playwriting is a very specific skill.  Being a dramatist is a very specific skill.  It is a skill we have to nurture if we are going to have great works of theatre in our canon for the future.</p></speech>

We have sent a draft agenda to the Abbey and we are waiting for it to get back to us.  Let us all be on the same side.  Let us all get together and increase the funding.  Funding in Ireland is 0.1% of GDP but it is 0.6% in Europe and we absolutely punch above our weight internationally.  Imagine what we could do if we were on 0.6% of GDP.  It would be remarkable.</p> <p>  We have only one national theatre and it is special.  It needs to have a remit that takes this into consideration and represents the entire island of Ireland.  It is not the remit of all the other theatres.  They have their own specific remits and are there to produce and provide for audiences throughout the country.  A very important part of the conversation is the national theatre remit, how special it is to us and how historic it is as well as being able to show us where we are going.</p></speech>

There are always meetings on at the same time.  I have a few questions and I hope I will not duplicate what has already been asked but if I do, forgive me.  I completely agree with Ms Dukes; I see the Abbey as something extremely special and hugely important to Irish artists and talent coming through, including playwrights, actors and designers.  It is the one place where people can use their artistic license and do not have to worry so much about bums on seats, as we all do as artists.  It cannot be all about this and it is unique to the Abbey Theatre.  It should not become a commercial entity.  From the letter written, and what I have heard over recent weeks and months, this has been a huge concern.  Perhaps it has been addressed today.</p> <p>  My next point is with regard to Mr. Conlon's presentation.  Perhaps it has already been answered by the Abbey Theatre.  If so, well and good, but if not, I would like Mr. Murray's thoughts on it.  The casting department-----</p></speech>

She was at the Royal Court Theatre in London and trained at Trinity College in Dublin.  There is a literary department in full action.</p> <p>  To pick up on the point Mr. Conlon made on new plays at the Abbey, in 2019 there will be two new plays by new Irish writers on the Abbey stage.  There is a literary department that is functioning.  Dylan Coburn Gray's "Citysong" and Lisa Tierney-Keogh's "The Beautiful Village" are new plays.  They are not film or book adaptations or musicals.  We are commissioning and developing new plays.  In addition to Ms Stephens, we have for associate playwrights from Ireland.  If anything, there is an increased function in our literary department.  I hope people will start to see the results of this coming through.  They are coming through already with three new plays.  I did not include Dermot Bolger's new play because he is more of a veteran.  The other two will be Abbey debutantes on the main stage of the Abbey.  There is new work coming through, of which we are really proud, and we are really excited to put it forward.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked how many self-produced shows-----</p></speech>

Our discussions with the Arts Council had reflected some of the discussions on that.</p> <p>  If the letter had come to the Abbey as opposed to the Minister, we would have many clarifications to what is going on.  Then we would be down to the issues that are still outstanding and more complex.</p> <p>  It will be seven shows for this year on the main Abbey stage.</p></speech>

It was decided that we would do a mixed production model in any case.  In 2015, the Abbey had four presented shows and two co-produced shows.  This is not anything new.  I accept the balance over those two years of adjustment was greater than what we would have wanted.  We are not changing.  The model of mixing, we believe, is the right one.  The "balance" &ndash; a word used by the Arts Council - within that mixing is what we are talking about.  We are not talking about something that is significantly differently.  It was already the case that seven main stage Abbey shows were patterned in for 2019.  It was early in September 2018 when that position was made.</p></speech>

There is a distinct lack of responsive communication.  We have heard this from a number of people at the meetings we have had.  The second issue, which I find strange, concerns the new works department.  Established writers, who have a relationship with the Abbey Theatre, have to send in work anonymously.  They are treated the same as anyone else.  There are no names on the submitted scripts.  How does one build a relationship with a writer who has a history with the theatre if everybody is just sending in work to this new works department anonymously?  That does not sound like nurturing to me.  One needs a literary department which works with the young playwright over the course of the development of the play.</p></speech>

There are two sides to these matters.  We would hope that, if they are all sorted on Friday, the committee would be presented with a wish list which, hopefully, it can follow up on.  We would hope the same if they are not sorted too.</p></speech>

I have heard much debate around this issue.  It is an area about which I feel passionate because that is where it is all coming from.</p> <p>  What was the experience for playwrights using the literary department as opposed to what it is now?</p></speech>

That is where we are getting this information.  As I stated in my submission, the Writers Guild of Ireland requested information about how many plays were commissioned by the Abbey Theatre for 2019.  We still have not received that information.  We did not get an answer.  Everything sounds good and well but the reality is not quite the same.</p></speech>

We have regular meetings with experienced playwrights about their work.  They do not have to submit anonymously.  There is that process but there is a direct line.  We meet regularly with those writers and work on shows with them.</p> <p>  On the issue around the Writers Guild of Ireland, what we have said consistently since 7 January is that we want to talk to the signatories.  This has come ahead of this and we welcome it.  There will be a whole raft of information to go to the Writers Guild of Ireland but we wanted to have one line of communication.  Otherwise, there was a real sense of fragmentation.</p> <p>  The reality is that the literary department is commissioning more work.  There will be three new plays on the Abbey stage this year, two by new Irish writers making their debuts.  That is a manifestation of what we are doing.  We accept it took some time for the structures to be put in place for the appointment of a full-time dramaturg.  They are now in place with significant supports for the appointment.  We are optimistic moving forward.  Not only will we be working with the great established playwrights of Ireland, with whom we want to work, but we will open up channels for emerging writers to have a real career path in Irish theatre.</p></speech>

Up to 409 people signed this letter as individuals and not organisations.</p> <p>  Organisations should be able to ask the national theatre for the numbers and get them quickly for whatever presentation or reason they want them.  It should be covered by freedom of information.  Two days ago I asked the UK&rsquo;s Royal Court Theatre and the National Theatre, as well as a French company, for their figures which they gave me in 24 hours.  There needs to be further work done by the Abbey on communications.</p></speech>

In normal circumstances, we would simply provide that information.  However, given the heat around the whole upcoming meeting, we felt it was better to focus everything on our process with the signatories.  There have been various side issues to that.  However, we want to wrap them altogether.  In future, we will communicate clearly.</p></speech>

There has been much change going on.  Anybody who has had the experience of being through change management knows that things do not always get communicated as clearly as they should and not everybody is affected equally positively by the change.  This has been a significant change.</p> <p>  On behalf of the board, I must say we are absolutely committed to having stronger communication with the whole of the sector.  There have been parts of the sector with which we have had strong communication but it has not been even.  It is the board&rsquo;s view that this communications system must be in place.  When one is making changes, setting up new departments and hiring people, there is a time before somebody can be put in place.  We are very much in place with the people whom Mr. Murray and Mr. McLaren have hired for the new works department, the dramaturg and other people who have come into the theatre in the past 18 months.</p> <p>  I would like to hope that, if we were having this conversation in six months&rsquo; time, we would all be in a much better place with a much wider understanding of the issues and a shared information base that will mean we are speaking to exactly the same numbers, as well as understanding them in the same kind of way.  It will take a little bit of time.  There is a whole range of questions.  The Abbey&rsquo;s approach is correct to bring them together as a system rather than deal with one issue here and another issue there.  The danger with a single set of issues is that one ends up with other unintended consequences.  Nobody ever intended the consequences which have arisen with the change in the model.  It is important if we take the whole system together, we work with the sector.  Subsequently, we can work in a wider way on those issues which go well beyond the Abbey.  That is what we should be planning to do.</p></speech>

Our first meeting is set up for this Friday.</p><p>It will have to be a scoping meeting because the scale of this is very significant and it will become wider as the debate progresses.  Deputy Boyd Barrett noted that one of the very positive things here is that it has widened the debate on theatre.  It seems to me that we want to scope that together.  They have looked for representatives from across the sector so they are not under-representing any group.  We want to have this preliminary meeting to see how to take this forward.  It is a schedule of meetings to see how we should do those different things.  What pieces of information do we need to gather?  What do we have already?  What do we not have?  We will be developing it from that perspective.  </p></speech>

On Friday we are hoping to get a succinct view from the Abbey's perspective.  Mr. Conlon's paper today provides some of that.  We will hear presentations from the different groups and in that context we will see where the bits fit together.  There is a preliminary set of pieces of work to be done before we can get into detailed discussions.  One of the things that came up earlier was the contracts for people who were in presentations in the Abbey.  There are legal issues that need to be teased out and worked through.  There are many things at issue.  By the end of Friday's meeting we will have a very good plan of action to see how to take each of those in turn and move forward on them.</p></speech>

We have arranged that because the most productive step is to get that first meeting going.  We have a relatively small board, many members of which do not live in Dublin and cannot attend on a Friday evening for this discussion.  With respect to everybody we felt it best to give those directors time to see at what point they would engage and which parts of this discussion it would be most appropriate for them to engage with.  Maybe this impression has incorrectly been created, but no disrespect at all is intended to the group by our sending the chair, Ms Sarah Durcan and a director.  Mr. McLaren is out of Ireland on Friday and cannot be there.</p></speech>

The nature of radio is that broadcasters try to create drama.  Whenever I heard actors referred to in a radio interview they were called "luvvies".  It is an extraordinary thing.  It is hard to gauge what the public's view is when the presenter is asking people what they make of these luvvies.  If one asked the presenter to live on the kind of money we are living on, with no tenure of employment or health insurance, never knowing where his next job is coming from having to do another job interview every time he wanted to work, I think he would be calling us something else.  I do not think he or she would be able for it.  The perception of the acting community is like something from England in the 1950s, the era of Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud.  It is nonsense.  To answer the point, it is very hard to gauge the public's reaction.</p></speech>

I wanted to congratulate  Mr. Murray in another way.  Some philistines I hang out with, who have never crossed the Abbey door, have been to the Abbey because of the productions that have been staged and they loved it.  It is very important to say that we are not here to judge.  That is the positive nature of it.</p> <p>  Also I note the forces the theatre is up against.  A series like "Breaking Bad" is theatre on television.  The forces ranged against live theatre are so enormous, from Netflix to smartphones.  Some films are so theatrical and clever the viewer can feel he or she is in the room or at the theatre.  It is a huge challenge.  The Taoiseach has promised to double arts funding.  He said that six months ago.  It was a promise to double or to treble funding.  </p></speech>

The arts are our heartbeat and without them we are lesser human beings, educationally, performance-wise and observationally.  There must be a huge surge against these forces to actually make the arts central.  Funding is extraordinarily important to ensuring this does not happen to theatre professionals, so that they have ways and routes-----</p></speech>

First, the arts matter.  That is an issue we were debating last week.  There are votes in this issue.  The most intense lobbying I got when I was first elected in 2004 concerned section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Everyone in the film industry and their brothers, sisters, uncles and neighbours wrote individual letters to me and, I presume, to every other Deputy appealing for the protection of section 481, which is a tax incentive for the film industry.  That was one experience I had of the potential votes in this issue.  The other one was in the 2011 election.  Some 400 artists in my own constituency wrote to me and asked me to sign up to a pledge.  They invited me to a meeting attended by 300 or 400 people in the Project Arts Centre.  Sometimes we forget that there is a vote out there.  The people we are talking about are in front of us.  They are normal people, they live with us.  They go to school with our brothers and sisters.  They have the same needs as us.  They have to eat, clothe themselves and pay a mortgage.  We need to remember that.</p> <p>  There are a number of salient issues.  If it is not appropriate to address them here, I urge the witnesses to bring them to the debate on Friday.  One question is for the Arts Council to look at.  There was a mention of double finding, whereby theatres would receive funding twice over because they have a production in the Abbey.  I would not like to take funding away from any theatre.  God forbid.  I raise this to ensure we do not end up with a situation which is detrimental to the National Theatre at the very least. </p> <p>  As for the participants and practitioners, what does one call a group of actors, playwrights and so on?  There are so many different skills. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.832" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1235" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22019013000002#O02500"><p>They are very courageous people.  I presume the issues in the letter emerged from frustration.  Had they been raised before?  Was there consultation in the 2014 report that was mentioned earlier?  Was that the reason it was triggered?  Was there a lack of dialogue or miscommunication?  One issue concerns the Abbey and the Arts Council.  In the presentation it was mentioned that funding of late has been on a year-to-year basis whereas it was previously on a three-year basis.  Is that a source of frustration or difficulty in planning for the Abbey?  Multiannual funding usually makes planning a lot easier, especially if an organisation is planning for three or four years down the road.</p><p>If some of the changes that have been made are to be rowed back upon, it would require some certainty in funding.  I agree with those who mentioned the minuscule funding the arts receive.</p><p> There are two issues.  I will not name names but quite a number of staff have left the Abbey Theatre in recent times.  Some of these people, who held prominent positions in Irish theatre, have left at a time when they probably are most needed.  Is there a concern among board members over the level of departures?  My figures show there have been up to 30 in the past two years, including HR staff and heads of different sections.</p><p> The other issue is of even more concern.  I will read out the end part of the letter first and I will try to get an assurance, publicly, that none of its signatories will be blacklisted or sidelined.  Some of them are concerned about this and some of the cast of one of the plays have overheard suggestions that they will be pursued for signing the letter.  Some people say things in the heat of the moment and come to regret it.  I want to make sure that nobody in the industry feels under pressure.  There is work to be done and I wish the witnesses well in what they are undertaking to do on Friday.  Since the letter was published there has been a huge amount of interest from other actors who have never had anything to do with the Abbey but are looking for guidance and for something that gives them hope.  All the people who have come before this committee since I became Chair a few weeks ago have a genuine interest in the arts and do not want the sector to be fractured in any way.  They understand and value the arts and if the witnesses present feel we can be of help in any way, they should drop us a line or pick up the phone.  We will try to help and to facilitate them.</p><p> Perhaps the representatives of the Arts Council can answer the first question.</p></speech>

We have agreed a template to a memorandum of understanding for each of the co-productions being staged at the Abbey, or in association with it, in order that there is no duplication of funding for activities that may have been supported by the Arts Council in other ways.</p> <p>  Back in 2017, we would have liked to have offered the Abbey a three-year funding commitment for 2018, 2019 and 2020 but we did not feel we had the information we needed on the artistic vision and the overall strategy for the coming years, so we only offered one-year funding.  The information in question has now been provided so we have offered a two-year funding envelope and, as the issues are resolved, we hope that we can go back to the normal rhythm of three-year funding agreements to allow the Abbey Theatre to plan in the most effective way.</p></speech>

We are delighted that the Arts Council is moving back to three-year funding.  We were not ready a couple of years ago but we are hoping to complete the two-year arrangement in the next number of weeks.  We would very much value getting back to a three-year arrangement because the sector needs certainty.</p></speech>

In my experience of working in theatre, which I have done for a long time, there is a rhythm and people often work with certain directors and regimes for a couple of years before things start to change and the wind blows in a different direction.  We have lost some brilliant people, which I regret, but we have replaced them with brilliant people and I feel we have a really good, solid team at the Abbey at the moment.</p> <p>  I would want to stamp on any hint of blacklisting people.  Many of the signatories are my friends and they are all colleagues.  Blacklisting will not happen.</p></speech>

There had been formal requests to meet the Abbey from the Irish Society of Stage and Screen Designers, ISSSD, as well as from the Writers Guild of Ireland, but there was very little in response.  The ISSSD did not get a response for five months and no meeting had been planned so we felt urgent action needed to be taken.  As the Abbey Theatre is our National Theatre, it comes under the remit of the Minister and the Department, as well as the Arts Council, and that is the reason we informed those bodies.  It was a cry for help.</p></speech>

I thank everybody and sincerely wish them well on Friday.  The transcript  and full presentation, including the slides, will be sent to the Minister in order that she is kept abreast of our discussion.  When she comes before the committee to discuss the Estimates in March, we hope to persuade her that they are wrong and that she should look at them again or, at the very least, give a commitment to increased funding and, as the Taoiseach has said, front-load it rather than promise it for two or three years' time.  Some of the issues are specific to funding, especially for the practitioners who are living on the breadline or barely surviving.  Without them, we would not have the joys of theatre in Ireland.</p></speech>

I am a solicitor and I have been in practice for almost 40 years.  I am a partner in the firm of Beauchamps Solicitors, and have been a partner there, and in a previous firm, for more than 30 years.  I have a Bachelor of Civil Law from University College Dublin in 1978.  I did a stage with the legal service of the European Commission in 1980.  I am a member of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators since 1999.  I am a founder mentor of the joint Law Society and Bar Council law and women mentoring programme that is in its third year.  Last year, I obtained a certificate in charity law, governance and trusteeship from the Law Society, and the course was run by the Law Society and The Wheel.  I have just been appointed to the board of Action Aid Ireland.</p> <p>  I am a partner in the litigation and dispute resolution department in Beauchamps Solicitors.  I work with State and semi-State bodies, major financial institutions, owner-managed businesses and multinational companies.  I have extensive experience in the public administration, financial services and healthcare sectors.  I specialise in contentious matters.  I have a lot of expertise across a range of areas, including administrative and constitutional law, contractual disputes, company law, insurance law, construction, employment and equality law, and defamation law.</p> <p>  To frame my experience I will set out some details about the functions of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.  The board was established in 2002 under the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000.  The legislative framework for the operation of the MCIB, which is the reporting and investigation of marine casualties, and the powers of MCIB investigators are set out in the Act and in the related European Communities (Merchant Shipping) (Investigation of Accidents) Regulations and directive.  In carrying out its functions, the MCIB also complies with the provisions of the International Maritime Organisation's Casualty Investigation Code.</p> <p>  I will summarise the role of the MCIB.  It arranges for investigations and reports into the following serious marine incidents: a fatality or serious personal injury, the loss of a person overboard, a significant injury to property from a collision, or in the case of significant environmental damage.</p><p>Jurisdictionally, that relates to any vessel that is in Irish waters, any Irish vessel, wherever that may be, or if the vessel is normally located or moored in Irish waters and under the control of a resident of the State, where the incident occurred in waters contiguous to Irish waters. </p><p> The investigations are conducted by professional investigators appointed by the MCIB to determine the cause of the accident, but not to determine who is at fault, and with a view to making recommendations for the avoidance of similar marine casualties.  By the end of 2017, the MCIB had published 216 reports into incidents under its statutory remit.  The board published eight final reports in 2017, while it has published seven reports in 2018.  The board's 2017 report was published on its website this morning, I believe.</p><p> My legal experience is relevant in guiding the MCIB in respect of the natural justice aspects of the investigation reports.  In particular, under section 36 of the 2000 Act, interested parties, namely, anyone who is likely to be adversely affected by it, have an opportunity to comment to the board on reports before they are finalised.  I have worked on a wide variety of investigations that involve issues of statutory interpretation, natural and constitutional justice and the assessment of evidence including its weight, relevance and credibility.  Also, because of the sort of regulatory and administrative law work on which I advise, I have worked with a number of State and semi-State entities and, therefore, I am familiar with the practical operations of public entities and the various applicable legal regimes and codes that establish their jurisdiction and functions.  </p><p> I will now outline some examples of the sort of work I have done in the area of constitutional and administrative law.  I acted for the Law Society of Ireland in the proceedings with the Motor Insurers Bureau, MIB, that sought to ensure that persons injured in road traffic accidents where the drivers were no longer insured due to the collapse of Setanta Insurance received proper compensation, rather than the capped amounts that were then applicable from the insurance compensation fund.  This involved complex interpretation issues between the obligations to the MIB as against those of the compensation fund.  That case led to the 2018 Insurance Act, which gave these road traffic victims the same level of damages as other injured parties. </p><p> I acted for the Charities Regulator in the first prosecution and in the first judicial review under the Charities Act.  The prosecution was directed to ensure that charity shops are conducted by legitimate registered charities in order that the public interest is protected by properly regulated charities.  </p><p> I acted for the European Commission and the European Council in proceedings challenging the EU-Turkey statement on asylum, which was brought somewhat oddly by Syrian asylum seekers in Greece who were seeking leave to enter Germany. </p><p> I acted for an Irish quadriplegic receiving health care in Germany under the EU healthcare regime in proceedings against the HSE when it sought to prevent his continuing care in Germany.  The case was heard by the European Court of Justice. </p><p> I am chairperson of my firm&rsquo;s finance sub-committee.  I have good experience of all aspects of our owner-led business, from personnel, business, marketing, and finance to insurance and regulation.  Experience on the board of a professional business partnership is relevant in providing the necessary experience, engagement and approach required for the chairmanship of the Marine Casualty Board.  The board is an independent body with its own funding provided for by the Oireachtas under section 19 of the Act.  It is independent of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in the performance of its functions and, in general, must be independent of any other person or body whose interests could conflict with the functions of the board.  I am not a member of any sailing or boating club, and I have not acted for persons likely to be involved in investigations.  I do not believe I have any conflicts that would impair my appointment as chairperson of the MCIB or that would affect its independence.  </p><p> In regard to Europe, the MCIB is an active member of the European Maritime Safety Agency, EMSA, which is responsible for providing technical assistance in the implementation of the EU directive establishing the principles governing the investigation of accidents in the maritime transport sector.  It is also responsible for maintaining a platform of casualty data and investigation reports of incidents that fall within the directive.  The reports are provided by the member states, and the MCIB is tasked to provide them on behalf of Ireland.</p><p> The members of the MCIB are Ms Dorothea Dowling, Mr. Frank Cronin, Mr. Brian Hogan, Mr. Nigel Lindsay and the secretary to the board is Ms Denise Hyland.  I thank the outgoing chairperson, Ms Cliona Cassidy, for all her work with the MCIB since her initial appointment in 2013.  It is a small board and a considerable amount of work is required outside of the regular board meetings.  In addition to all of that work, Ms Cassidy gave freely of her time to brief me on the role to ensure a smooth handover.  I hope to be able to continue the good work carried out by her and the other board members.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it.</p></speech>

I thank her for her deliberation and for sharing her experience.  She is eminently qualified for the role and I wish her every success in it.  She outlined her qualifications, which are of the highest standard, and a little about the board, the independence of the board and the importance of that.  It is a small board and it would be useful if there was a brief outline of its members, primarily because it is a small board.</p> <p>  I am involved in a number of boards in different areas.  It is important for a board and, in particular, its chair to consider inviting an organisation such as the Institute of Directors to carry out some due diligence of the board, perhaps once every three years.  The board can then establish whether it is fit for purpose and what its strengths and weaknesses in governance are.  It supports the integrity of the board and the chairperson.  I offer that suggestion as a thought because I found it useful in other areas, in private companies as well as in some public organisations.</p> <p>  Ms Callanan mentioned the EMSA.  My experience in this overall area is in aviation and the air accident investigation unit, AAIU.  Will Ms Callanan outline her thoughts on the AAIU and whether the board has any interaction or engagement with it?  The AAIU is extremely professional.  We are all on the same island and accidents must be dealt with.  The AAIU has processes and systems, and the MCIB and the AAIU might learn from each other through sharing methodology for investigating accidents.</p><p> Are the board's professional investigators employees, contractors or a mixture of both?  Seven reports were published in 2018.  What happened to them and what were their follow-up actions? </p></speech>

This was a board of which I was not aware.  I imagine that most people in Leinster House are not aware of it.  It was set up in 2002.  In the early 2000s and 2010s, people talked about getting rid of quangos.  Due diligence was done on this board and it survived, so it obviously has an important role.</p> <p>  I will ask some questions for the sake of my own understanding.  In the event of someone falling overboard, a fatality or a serious personal injury, how does the board go about investigating it?  Are the Garda and other State agencies involved?  That information might inform us better.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.866" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Claire Callanan" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019013000002#E00900"><p>I will go in reverse order and explain how an investigation is carried out.  I am new but I will offer an illustration.  Yesterday, we received an incident report.  The way the system operates sees the emergency services filtering potential marine incidents and reporting to the board, which has three staff.  The staff circulate that information immediately to the board members, so yesterday was my first experience of it.  There was a flurry of emails over a short period in the afternoon entailing a brief technical outline of the incident, asking whether there was any missing information that would be essential for determining whether there would be a preliminary investigation or an investigator would be appointed immediately for a full investigation, and identifying an available investigator.  Within an hour of the first communication, an available investigator had been identified and tasked with carrying out a preliminary investigation.  That involved checking with the Garda in the first instance.  Other State agencies involved include any of the emergency services and the Coast Guard.  Also involved are local fishing information and the weather service.  In the reports I have read, the latter appears to be essential, as it possesses technical information from the time.</p> <p>  The investigators are independent and retained as consultants by the board.  They are appointed from time to time following the usual sort of process.  They have expertise in marine engineering, naval architecture, naval machine learning, marine surveying, etc.  An investigator gathers all of the information, carries out interviews and prepares a draft report, which is then considered.  It may be returned to the investigator.  When the investigation is concluded and a report has been drafted, there is a natural justice phase wherein persons who may be affected are given a copy of that report.  They can comment on it, which is then taken on board by the MCIB.  That is how the system operates.</p> <p>  I was impressed by the speed yesterday, as well as by the availability of board members.  It was all done very efficiently by email.  An investigator was identified and on the job within a short time.</p> <p>  The reports are published online when they are concluded.  They generally contain recommendations that go to the Minister, after which the recommendations become a matter for the Department to consider and, if viewed as relevant, to take on board and feed into its legislative and other processes.  In 2017, the Department reissued its code of safety on recreational vessels, so I assume previous reports fed into that.  Safety on recreational vessels also seems to be a theme in the chairman's statement in the report that has just been published.</p> <p>  I welcome the observation on the Institute of Directors.  I will take it back to the board, as one always needs to be reviewed and externally audited from time to time.  Even if someone believes he or she is doing well, one can always do better.  The observation is timely.  I cannot say whether there has ever been a board review or reassessment.  Assuming there has not been one in recent times, it would be useful.  I am happy to take that observation back to the board for discussion.</p> <p>  Regarding the AAIU and the availability of expertise, there appears to be good co-ordination in what is a specialist area in respect of accidents.  Although it is just a preliminary observation, my understanding is that there has been good co-ordinating and sharing between experts in rail, aviation and marine accidents.  One of the members of the board is the chief investigator of rail accidents.  The methods used may be different, but accidents have similar concepts, methodologies and other things to critique.  Given that we are a small country with a very small number of experts in this area and, happily, a very small number of accidents, I appreciate the point about there being merit in sharing information and expertise.  I believe we have that.</p> <p>  Regarding fees, Brexit and the current position, the fees for the chairperson are approximately &euro;8,700 per annum.  Currently, nine investigations are ongoing.  They include one that is led by Antigua and Barbuda because it involves an Antiguan and Barbudan boat.  We are contributing to that investigation but, as the flagship country, Antigua and Barbuda is the lead investigator.  The most immediate objective is to progress existing investigations and reports.  I am told that three draft reports are in the natural justice phase.</p><p>The deadlines for the receipt of responses are 5, 6 and 7 February and, depending on what comes back, three reports will be published relatively promptly thereafter.</p><p> I have had a preliminary briefing on Brexit and, if I may, I will respond in a number of ways.  On the regulatory regime, apparently it will have little consequence when the United Kingdom falls outside the EU legal regime because, in large part, all countries are parties to international marine conventions that contain similar safety provisions and regulations.  EU directives and regulations are closely aligned with international conventions.  Therefore, there is a secondary legal regime in which continuing operations can be framed, if I can put it that way.</p><p> On the European Marine Safety Agency, it seems to us that the only issue is that data from the United Kingdom will not be uploaded and will not become part of the data platform.  Therefore, to a certain extent, the value of the statistics and input from the joint agency will be devalued, given, in particular, that the United Kingdom is our nearest neighbour and a marine entity, but it is not something we can do much about.</p><p> On the response to a marine casualty, there is an international safety regime which operates in different areas from territorial waters.  I understand the response to an emergency should not be affected.  Thinking a little downstream, it might be the case that the outcome of marine casualty incidents could be prejudiced if there were to be delays or difficulties of whatever nature in seeking access across the Border or to healthcare facilities because it would not be the norm in the context of the EU healthcare regime.  I have not bottomed it out sufficiently to see what would then operate.</p></speech>

I am the acting director and will respond in the best way I can to members' questions.  To assist me in dealing with them, I am joined by Mr. Niall Ferns, our volunteer services and training manager who is responsible for the volunteer Irish Coast Guard units, as well as by Mr. Caoimh&iacute;n &Oacute; Ciaru&aacute;in and Ms Clare O&rsquo;Connell from the maritime services division of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport which provides significant corporate support for the Irish Coast Guard.  Before taking questions from members, I would like to take a few minutes to set out the international context for our work, some of the history of our development and an overview of our remit and the challenges we face.</p> <p>  As members are aware, we conduct search and rescue operations and respond to marine casualties.</p><p>The maritime and aviation world is regulated by two UN bodies, the International Maritime Organisation, IMO, based in London and the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, based in Montreal.  This is done through international conventions and agreements between states.  The regulation of the maritime and aviation world in through these two UN bodies.  The international framework for maritime search and rescue is based on the 1979 search and rescue convention.  The IMO's safety committee divided the world's oceans into 13 search and rescue areas.  In each area the countries concerned have delimited search and rescue regions for which they are responsible.  The limits of the Irish maritime search and rescue region correspond with those of the flight information region, which is approximately 200 miles off the west coast, 30 miles off the south coast and the dividing line between Ireland and the UK in the Irish Sea.  The whole process of international search and rescue is based on close co-operation between the ICAO and the IMO.  It also requires close co-operation with the UK&rsquo;s Maritime and Coastguard Agency, with which we have a close working relationship.  That covers the search and rescue element.</p><p> The international framework for responding to marine casualties is based on the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation.  It provides a legal basis for states to take action for the purposes of preventing, mitigating or eliminating danger from pollution or a threat of pollution following upon a maritime casualty.  If a ship breaks down or is damaged in our exclusive economic zone, EEZ, we have the powers to intervene if we are not happy with the action the master is taking.  To do that, officers of the Coast Card or warranted officers under the Sea Pollution Act and Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act have powers that allow us to intervene in maritime casualties to protect the coastline. </p><p> To put the organisation into context and give a brief history of the Irish Coast Guard, we were set up in 1991 as a result of the Doherty report and we were called the Irish Marine Emergency Service.  The IMES was established by a Government decision in 1990 as a division of the Department of the Marine at the time.  The name was later changed to the Irish Coast Guard in 2000 and the division was subsequently transferred to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in 2006.  Since 1990, the organisation has come a long way from old rocket houses, horse drawn carts and yellow sou'wester foul-weather gear to the current progressive organisation with state-of-the-art equipment.  When I joined the Coast Guard 20 years ago, I noted on one of the first inspections of rocket houses around the coast that they were little more than sheds in a dilapidated condition and our staff were wearing yellow sou'wester gear.  Since then, we have invested significantly in the coastal volunteer force to develop it into its current configuration.</p><p> As it currently stands, the Irish Coast Guard is a discrete division within the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  As with any other division within the Department, we report to the management board and the Minister.  Our responsibilities and powers are derived from Government decisions and the search and rescue framework.  We are also authorised officers under the Sea Pollution Act 1991 and the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act.  In performing our responsibilities, we provide a variety of services.  We provide a marine radio distress listening service and a broadcasting service for marine safety information.  Essentially, that means we have three rescue co-ordination centres, RCCs, and  a radio network around the coast.  If ships are in distress, they can call us on marine VHF and HF radio frequencies.  We also regularly broadcast marine safety information for weather forecasts, navigations hazards and so on.</p><p> We also provide a marine assistance service for ship casualties.  We monitor maritime traffic within our traffic separation schemes off Fastnet and Tuskar.  We co-ordinate search and rescue in the Irish search and rescue region, along the coasts and cliffs of Ireland and also in support of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the major inland lakes and remote areas.  We monitor the EEZ and intervene, as necessary, for marine casualties to prevent or minimise damage to the marine environment by oil, hazardous and noxious substances from vessels' cargoes and offshore installations such as gas rigs and exploration facilities on the coast.  We provide support, on request, to statutory bodies or agencies, particularly in terms of emergency response.  Under the State's major emergency framework, the Coast Guard is nominated as a principal emergency service.  We are, therefore, Ireland's fourth "blue light" service alongside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the national ambulance service and the fire service.</p><p> I will now outline the way the Coast Guard is organised and, essentially, what we are all about.  To carry out its functions the Coast Guard organisation is made up of four sections.  The first is Coast Guard operations.  Search and rescue and ship casualty operations are co-ordinated through the three rescue co-ordination centres, namely, the marine rescue co-ordination centre in Dublin, the marine rescue sub-centre in Valentia on the Iveragh Peninsula and the marine rescue sub-centre on Malin Head.  These centres are responsible for search and rescue co-ordination, provision of coastal radio services, ship casualty operations and co-ordination of all Coast Guard volunteer activities.  The current staffing complement in the three centres is 46 and the centres maintain a 24-7 watch coverage.   </p><p> The second section of Coast Guard operations is that of maritime casualties.  As well as monitoring the distress channels and responding to search and rescue incidents, the RCCs monitor our EEZ and respond to maritime casualties which pose a threat of pollution to our coastline.  The RCCs are supported by the maritime casualty and counter-pollution section in Coast Guard headquarters.  This section is responsible for developing, training and maintaining Coast Guard incident response to ship casualty and counter-pollution preparedness and response in line with the oil pollution, response and preparedness convention.  It also maintains the national oil spill contingency plan and audits local authority and harbour plans, which are also oil spill contingency plans.  It maintains the national pollution stockpile in Blanchardstown and develops training for national response teams and county councils in response to major incident management.  Currently, there is one staff member in this area with two more to join shortly.  The Coast Guard employs contractors to support operations in this area.  </p><p> On receiving calls from distress channels - marine VHF, EPIRBs and 999 calls - the RCCs in responding to marine incidents on the coast have a number of resources to call upon.  These include search and rescue helicopters.  Coast Guard helicopter services are provided under contract by CHC Helicopter, operating a fleet of Sikorsky S-92 helicopters out of four bases in Dublin, Shannon, Waterford and Sligo, respectively.  Helicopter services are on 15 minutes' notice by day and 45 minutes' notice by night.  In addition to their primary role of provision of maritime search and rescue services, the Coast Guard provides an around-the-clock medical evacuation service &ndash; so-called medivacs - to the offshore islands.  In 2018, the Coast Guard flew a total of 102 island medivacs, an increase on 2017.  In addition, Coast Guard helicopters conducted eight long-range offshore medical evacuations.  These are evacuations from fishing or merchant vessels off the coast where, for example, someone falls ill.  Coast Guard helicopters have flown in excess of 665 missions in 2018.  These missions also include inland searches for missing persons in support of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and mountain rescue teams.</p><p> The helicopter service also provides assistance to the national ambulance service.  Coast Guard helicopters provide helicopter emergency medical service to the national ambulance service, including inter-hospital transfers.  The busiest inter-hospital transfer route is from Letterkenny hospital to University Hospital Galway.  If an ambulance is called out to a person in Donegal or the surrounding area and a STEMI alert is issued or the person needs to be brought to hospital quickly, the nearest hospital for this type of emergency will be Galway.  We are called in by the national ambulance service and we transfer the person to Galway.</p><p> Another resource we use heavily is the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, RNLI.  It is categorised as a declared resource to the Coast Guard, which means that each individual station can be directly requested to respond to individual incidents.  The RNLI maintains 38 lifeboats on the island of Ireland manned by volunteers.  In 2018, the RNLI was requested to launch on more than 836 occasions.</p><p> Another Coast Guard response is the search and rescue units, which are volunteer units.  The nationwide network of volunteer Coast Guard units is an integral part of the national search and rescue framework.  The network has a membership of approximately 1,000 volunteers formed into 44 individual units around the coast.  All units are classed as onshore search units, with 23 of the 44 units having an additional function of boat operations and 17 units having a cliff rescue capability.</p><p>They can do onshore search.  Some of them have boats and some of them have cliff rescue responsibility. </p><p> The Coast Guard units are composed of: 12 three-function units - search, boat and cliff; 16 dual function units; and 16 single function units carrying out search only.  The units comprise typically between 15 and 25 volunteers.  Each Coast Guard unit is composed of a volunteer person in charge, deputy person in charge, training officer, equipment officer, administration officer and education officer.  That is how they are organised and each has a particular role and responsibility within the volunteer unit.</p><p> Coast Guard units were tasked from the rescue co-ordination centres on 1,180 missions in 2018.  It can be seen that they provide a significant response for us.  All units are coupled with a capacity to support their communities during local emergencies including inclement weather.  These community services were to the forefront during Storm Emma last March when major challenges were experienced in maintaining essential services.  Coast Guard volunteers provided emergency support to healthcare staff and also provided support for isolated homes.</p><p> Mr. Ferns manages, resources and trains the Coast Guard volunteer units.  There are ten dedicated Coast Guard staff in volunteer service and training, which includes six staff on the coast managing the volunteer units directly.  The section's resources are given considerable support by the maritime services division of the Department, including Mr. &Oacute; Ciaru&aacute;in and Ms O'Connell who are present.</p><p> The output of all this work is lives saved.  The Coast Guard attaches particular attention to what is categorised as lives saved.  This refers to assistance provided that if it was not available would have resulted in loss of life, severe risk of loss of life or protracted hospitalisation.  In 2018 the Coast Guard has recorded that in excess of 400 people were categorised as lives saved.</p><p> A vital part is the organisation engineering and logistics section.  The engineering and logistics section manages the radio communications network in the rescue co-ordination centres and the radio aerial infrastructure around the coast to maintain marine VHF and HF coverage in the search and rescue region.  VHF channel 16 and HF frequencies are used for distress listening, and calling and working channels to maintain communications with the ships at sea.  The engineering and logistics section also manages the Coast Guard stores in Blanchardstown.  There are seven staff employed in this area with another three staff in the pipeline. </p><p> I have briefly set out the role and structure of the Coast Guard within the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The Coast Guard as we know it has existed for 19 years, and has been under the remit of the Department for Transport, Tourism and Sport for 13 years.  During that time it has evolved to the organisation it is today, monitoring distress channels and responding to incidents, saving lives and responding to threats of pollution to the coastline.  Its success depends largely on the goodwill of volunteers from the RNLI and its own Coast Guard volunteers to give of their time and become professional responders in maritime life-saving situations.  In return the Coast Guard provides excellent training and equipment to carry out that task.</p><p> While the role has not changed in those years, the challenges we face have evolved over time and continue to do so.  The Coast Guard has always sought to place safety at the heart of its activities.  We define a successful operation as being when we get a distress call, send out a boat, cliff team or search team with five people and we get those five people back; the bonus is actually carrying out the rescue.  Safety is and always has been at the heart of our organisation.  However, we are involved in high-risk activities on a daily basis.  For that reason, we have invested significantly in training, equipment and systems to ensure that our volunteers and full-time staff are our first concern when we task a search, boat, cliff team or helicopter.</p><p> Reliable information and awareness of risk is key.  Strong communication channels are vital.  Learning the lessons from missions that went well but also those that did not is essential to an organisation that wants to continually improve what it does.</p><p> Recent tragic accidents have been difficult for the organisation as a whole.  We mourn the loss of close and valued colleagues and friends.  We are also compelled to honour their memories by building a stronger, safer and more resilient search and rescue service for Ireland.</p><p> I hope this provides a quick overview of who we are and what we are about.  I am more than happy to take questions from committee members. </p></speech>

The 400 lives saved in the past year are very important and that work cannot be overvalued.  Having a professional and voluntary membership is all linked up.  It is all well organised.  I acknowledge that the recent tragic accidents have been very difficult for the organisation.  The whole country mourned the loss of Mr. Clonan's close and valued colleagues.  I concur with his commitment to honour their memories by building a stronger, safer and more resilient rescue service.</p></speech>

I thank the Coast Guard for the work it does and the lives it saves.  Often when we meet a Coast Guard vehicle on the road, people are not aware of the details Mr. Clonan has given this morning.  I know there have been some television programmes in recent times.  I was amazed by the work the Coast Guard does in extremely difficult conditions at high risk to its members.  I join the Chairman in acknowledging the tragedies involving the loss of colleagues in recent times.  Our sympathies go to all members of the Coast Guard.  Any life lost is tragic but a life lost while trying to save others is especially tragic.  As well as people employed professionally, the volunteers who work above and beyond the call of duty in many respects deserve great credit for putting their lives on the line.  I did not realise until today the strong Coast Guard network involving helicopter rescue, hospitals and all of that.</p> <p>  Mr. Clonan commented on how the Coast Guard is resourced by the State.  Is that a difficulty?  Following tragedies have the recommendations from investigations always been followed up or is there an issue there?  I wish to ask about the number of hoax calls the service gets.  I was amazed when I got the figures for people making hoax calls a few years ago.  There appears to be a lack of follow up or inability to follow up on charging people who bring out the Coast Guard services in such a way.  Is that continuing to increase or has any action been taken on it?  Those services are so vital for genuine cases.  I was astounded by the number of hoax calls.  Is that still an issue?</p></speech>

I wish him good luck in his term as interim director.</p> <p>  I also wish to be associated with the words of sympathy over the loss of lives in recent years.  It is good that people can get up the following morning and continue to go to work in such circumstances.  The Coast Guard is recognised as the fourth blue light emergency response service in the country.  When we see the work it does, it must be near the top of the plinth.</p> <p>  As Mr. Clonan mentioned, the Coast Guard is dependent on the volunteers from the RNLI and the volunteers who operate under the coastal unit advisory group, CUAG.</p><p>Do the witnesses have a good working relationship with the volunteers, especially from CUAG?  Do issues arise in the organisation that have not been addressed?  Have the volunteers raised concerns with the Coast Guard that have not been addressed?  I cannot point to anything specific, given where we are, but have issues of malpractice been raised?  I am interested to hear whether there are outstanding issues.  Is it the case that the Coast Guard is not recognised as a special operations agency?</p></speech>

From their description they are doing a lot with very little, given the size of the coastline, which is longer than the coastline of many European countries.  We have a big ratio in terms of land to sea.  There is a lot to be policed.  We probably have a greater exposure.</p> <p>  How do we compare, for example in terms of the amount of resources and services, with other European countries?  Are there typical countries with which we should compare ourselves or what is the ideal?</p> <p>  Could we have an indication of the fleet size and the number of cars, boats and trailers?  Are there unmet needs?  I am sure there is redundancy in some of the existing fleet as well.  What is the full complement of operational staff?  We have heard from the witnesses that there is a lot of training with volunteers, which is extremely important.</p> <p>  How is the cost recovered on joint missions outside the jurisdiction?  How are the costs shared if there is a joint mission?  If, for example, there is a big rescue in the Irish Sea and we have to call in our counterparts in the UK, is there compensation or does it balance out over time?  Will there be any change in that regard in the context of Brexit?  I presume there will not but it is useful to have a clear picture.</p> <p>  Whatever about running costs, the Coast Guard has upgraded a lot of out-of-date facilities since 1990.  What is the position in terms of capital costs?  We know, for example, what the expenditure is on sports capital grants.  Is there a particular fund for that purpose?  I hope it is all right that I have a good number of questions.</p></speech>

I would welcome an outline of the lease arrangements.</p> <p>  Does the Irish Aviation Authority have responsibility for mapping hazards?  What input does the Coast Guard have in the process?

It was mentioned in the opening statement that inland waterways are included for rescue purposes.  I was contacted some years ago by someone who was concerned that the Coast Guard was not used to help someone in distress in the River Liffey, as it happens.  It was not in the city centre but in west Dublin.  How is the Coast Guard called to deal with such incidents?  Is it the air rescue service that is involved or are boats also involved?  I had many such queries at the time.</p> <p>  We heard that seven members of staff are employed in Blanchardstown with three further people on the way.  Are additional staff resources coming into any other aspect of the service?  Has the Coast Guard asked for any staff that have not been provided?  If so, I would welcome a comment in that regard.</p> <p>  Mr. Clonan indicated at the outset that the director of the Coast Guard is taking up an appointment with the EU capacity building mission in Somalia.  I can understand there are particular issues in that regard in terms of why that would be a good initiative.  What demands or calls are made on the Coast Guard in terms of the kind of expertise that is available on such missions?  Is that unusual?  Would it be taken up?  I think it is probably a very good one.  I would welcome an indication of whether it is something out of the ordinary.</p></speech>

My comments are directed at the full team and the volunteers.  Something that is important to me is "the world with you versus the world without you".  What that means is that the Coast Guard makes a significant difference to me.  There is a big difference between the country with them versus the country without them.  I know two or three people who benefitted from the Coast Guard's work.  It is very significant.</p><p>There is nothing more valuable than to be involved in work that makes a real difference to people.  As they say in America, we have first responders before us.  I have great admiration and respect for what Mr. Clonan and his team do.</p><p> My questions will be somewhat in the same space as Deputy Catherine Murphy's, but they will primarily relate to an area about which I know a little, that being the search and rescue helicopter service.  Who has that contract?  Who were the successful tenderers for the contract in the past 20 years?  What is the overall value of the contract?</p><p> A Sikorsky helicopter is the type used.  It is a fine helicopter and Canadian and American manufactured.  Indeed, I believe it is the only type of helicopter that has been used for search and rescue operations in Ireland.  In the majority of countries around the world, though, a European helicopter, the AgustaWestland AW139, is used.  Why was it not considered?  I do not have all of the details on me, but from memory of one of the tenders, the Agusta did not meet all of the pre-qualifying criteria.  It has just over five hours of endurance and a range of 659 miles or 660 miles, but the one criterion it did not meet shot its tender out of the water.  If I am right, that level of competition is very important.</p><p> I would also like to get a sense of the annual budget and what percentage of it the search and rescue helicopters cost.  According to Mr. Clonan's presentation, they flew 665 missions in 2018.  How much did each mission cost?</p><p> I am not promoting AgustaWestland at all and have no relationship with any of those companies.  I have some peripheral engagement with the Air Corps, though, and it bought six Agustas in 2006.  By creating alternative win-win situations, there might be a way whereby we can be more effective, including cost effective, while continuing to do the Coast Guard's amazing work.  I am just asking questions that are intended to be outside the box to some degree.</p></speech>

There is no issue with that.  Regarding Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's final point, though, I was interested in that contract and related issues, including its cost, some years ago.  I believe the contract is due to go out again shortly.</p></speech>

There was a process whereby it took over each base progressively.  The contract award included S-92s, which replaced the old S-61s.  The S-61s were very capable, but some of them had been flying since 1960, so were quite old aircraft.  The S-92s were new aircraft.  They are faster and more sophisticated and can fly in worse weather conditions.  That is why we have them.</p> <p>  Regarding the Agusta, I was not involved in the contract process for the S-92, so I do not have the detail of the bits and pieces, but the requirement was to fly out 200 miles, remain on scene, take up a fishing vessel crew of approximately 17 people on the winch, and fly home again.  The Agusta is a smaller helicopter.</p></speech>

That is allowed for within the current tender.  Is that correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-30a.957" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Caoimh&iacute;n &Oacute; Ciaru&aacute;in" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2019013000002#M00700"><p>I can answer that question.  What we are doing at the moment is looking at the ten-year contract.  It is the largest component of spending in the Coast Guard.  There is no question about it.  It represents approximately 85% of the overall amount of money.  It is a significant spend and it is one of the largest contracts in the State.  There is no question that it is a significant amount of money.  It was tendered internationally against specific requirements.  The development of the tender at the time involved the proposal being run through many hoops to get it to the point where it was ready for tender.</p> <p>  I was asked about the mid-term review.  We are looking at the contract as it exists and whether it is delivering what we want and what we intended at the outset.  Part of this relates to the machines and the helicopters while part of it is the built-in resilience that is there.  We are paying a premium for a level of contingency and concurrency in the contract.  In the event that something, God forbid, happens, then we require a certain amount for that.  That is in the contract and we are paying a significant amount for it.  It is a requirement of the contract.  The mid-term review is looking at the existing contract, whether it is delivering the key performance indicators that we intended at the outset and whether adjustments can be made within the contract for the remaining element of the contract.</p> <p>  The question of extension arises and a decision will have to be taken on that.  Other extraneous issues arise relating to the contract and other issues that may impact over the course of the year in terms of other investigations, etc.  That is also part of what we will have to consider.  Part of this process involves looking at how we set up a new contract and what parameters might change or vary.  The Senator is correct.  The mix of helicopters and the model will be looked at in terms of the value for money we are getting from the existing model.  The mix of bases, the type of helicopter and so on will be part of that discussion.  That is not a matter for right now because we are looking at the contract, but all the information that we are gathering will inform the next stage.</p> <p>  This is a lengthy process.  The contract is worth &euro;600 million plus over ten years so there will be considerable interest in it.  However, as members will probably know, there is a small pool of companies internationally which provide this service.  We have a specific model under which the contracted company will private and not military.  Many jurisdictions use the military to perform this service.  The Air Corps would have done it in the past.  The decision to exclude a military provider will be reviewed as part of this process as well.  All the models for delivery of the service will be looked at in terms of what delivers the best value for money.  That is our primary consideration.</p></speech>

I know he is 100% on that and that will happen.  That is really important given that &euro;600 million is at stake.  I am not saying the contract should automatically go to the Air Corps or anything like that, but the Air Corps has six AgustaWestland AW139 helicopters already in operation.  The choice and options for the Department are important in terms of making the best possible decision and I know the Department will do that.</p></speech>

I will explain who we are.  I am head of the maritime services division, which is in the Department alongside the Coast Guard.  We are on the same corridor.  We work closely with Mr. Clonan and his colleagues.  At least half of the maritime services division is essentially corporate support for the Coast Guard.  We cover much of the administration and similar functions, including the financing, budgetary matters and procurement, which was just discussed.</p> <p>  Approximately &euro;74 million in funding is allocated annually to the Coast Guard.  Approximately 85% of that is for the helicopter contract.  That figure is variable and can go up or down.  Other significant expenditure items include volunteer training exercises, equipment, maintenance and renewal.  Information technology is increasingly important and there is considerable investment in that.  Volunteer payments are made.  We pay volunteers for their time and for doing exercises, etc.  They are the essential component parts.</p> <p>  The building programme is also relevant.  Deputy Murphy asked about the capital element of the budget.  A large part of the capital is for the building programme for Coast Guard units.  I would describe that as lumpy from one year to the next, depending on what projects can proceed and so on.  The Coast Guard works closely with the Office of Public Works on the building programme.  Most of the units are part of an OPW building programme.  It is a partnership.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked whether there were any areas where we were under pressure in terms of funding.  I worked previously as the finance officer in the Department.  Part of the problem with the Coast Guard building programme is the question of being in a position to spend the money.  Often we have had to carry over money from one year to the next.</p></speech>

In the past 20 years, we have built 16 new stations to replace the old stations.  Back 20 years ago we only had the old rocket houses.  I am unsure whether committee members know what the rocket houses look like, but they are basically garages.  They were built at the turn of the 20th century.  A cart and some equipment were kept in these garages.  That is what we inherited when the State was formed.  Then, 20 years ago we started to spend more money on these buildings.  Of the 60 buildings we have, 16 have been replaced with state-of-the-art buildings.  I read a newspaper cutting which referred to a lack of toilets, sanitary facilitates and so on.  That was a reference to the old rocket houses, of which there are 16 around the coast.  Included among the 44 units are rocket houses that are sub-units to the main unit.  They have a main meeting room and so on whereas the rocket house on the coast will be used as a storage area.  The OPW carries out all our maintenance and building projects.  It has inspected all these external buildings in respect of the sanitary and toilet elements.  We cannot do anything with some of the buildings because there is insufficient surrounding land to extend or there may be planning issues.  In other cases, there is a main building and the old units are used for storage only, which means it is not necessary to install sanitary facilities.  We are looking at these units and in cases where we have identified that sanitary facilities or running water need to be provided, we have an active programme to implement that.  Where we cannot do that, we put in place temporary facilities.</p><p>Where we cannot do that, the best thing is for the local team to use that building as a garage, which it is, and meet in the local hotel or community hall.  We will fund that so people are out of the weather when they are doing their training.  I mentioned the three-function and dual-function units and they mostly have good facilities.  It is the single function units that have problems.  There are 16 of those.  We prioritised busy buildings but we are now looking at those 16 units to see where we can improve conditions.</p></speech>

In Cork, on the coast off Kinsale, a value for money report was commissioned that found the Summercove station should be closed and the Oysterhaven unit purposely built up.  There was also mention of sharing purpose-built buildings with the RNLI.  Why was the Summercove station kept open when it was supposed to close?</p></speech>

Stations such as Greystones and Wicklow and Courtown and Arklow were amalgamated.  In many cases, however, we were able to hold on to the second building.  That might not be the main building in many cases.  Let us take the example of Carnsore and Rosslare.  Those units were amalgamated, as well as Summercove and Oysterhaven and Toe Head and Glandore.  We have had a significant number of such amalgamations.  In many instances, however, rather than shutting down the small station - because its geographical area or border spread out - buildings were retained because we still have to cover the same amount of coastline.</p> <p>  Teams were amalgamated but for operational efficiency, it made much more sense to retain buildings.  There are some buildings within the amalgamated units, therefore, into which we still want to invest some money.  There is no work on a new building going on at Summercove.  That work is under our maintenance programme and we got it across the line in 2018.  We are spending some money on that project to bring it up to the standard we want.  Units have been amalgamated but in several instances the smaller building, the smaller outstation, is still retained.  That is how the amalgamation worked in that situation. </p></speech>

He was in Ballydavid where the coastguard station was burnt during the Troubles.  For many years, he used to have the only telephone in the village and he was the person who went up to see if there was a ship in distress.  He used to climb the sort of pole to fire the rocket and carry out all of the other aspects of the role.  There is great history attached to people who gave that service over the years.  I acknowledge that now.</p></speech>

We had the telephone bills for the number one men, as they were called, around the country.  They have now been replaced by Android mobile phones, so we are getting there.  When we went around the coast we were able to preserve some of what we found, such as the old rocket carts, and pass that material on to the local communities.</p></speech>

We were formed in 1991.  Recalling recent history, in 2008, and during the fiscal crisis, we were one of the only divisions within the Department that maintained our expenditure and our budgets throughout that period.  They were not cut at all.  Staff numbers also increased.</p> <p>  During the fiscal crisis, there was a high staff turnover in our rescue co-ordination centres because people were nearing retirement.  We recruited throughout that period.  We have always, therefore, been very positively supported by the Department in respect of funding and staff replacements.  In our building programme, the complexity of planning and the required interactions with the planning authorities can be imagined.  We normally, therefore, have two to three building projects, one slightly ahead of another, stepped to try to get the programme going.  We have built 16 station houses in recent years.  </p></speech>

This is an issue across the board, as Deputy Catherine Murphy knows.

Greystones was a unique situation.  As Deputy O'Keeffe knows, there was a harbour development there.  I was very involved in trying to get the Coast Guard station across the line for many years.  A whole community section has been built in Greystones harbour.  Six organisations have been put in a section of the harbour and we have a state-of-the-art facility to go in there.  We got it across the line this year, so it is well under way but it is on a dedicated site which sits on the old pier in Greystones.  Technically, that caused much additional work in preparing the station to go in.  We are delighted that the Greystones station is across the line and will be in a state-of-the-art location within the harbour.</p></speech>

Deputy Catherine Murphy spoke of search and rescue and costs, and, in particular, a comparison of costs between us and the UK.   We do not charge for search and rescue.  That is our ethos and that is the ethos throughout the world.  In years gone by when we had no helicopter service the UK Coastguard used to provide that service.</p><p>As it did not have helicopters, the RAF and Royal Navy bases on the west coast of the United Kingdom provided the service.  Today we have a helicopter search and rescue service.  The RNLI does not charge us for providing a service.  The Irish Coast Guard units are funded by the State.  If we send a helicopter into Northern Ireland, possibly up hills, as often requested by the marine rescue co-ordination centre in Belfast, we do not charge for the service.  In the case of a pollution incident, the principle is that the polluter pays.  If there is a pollution incident involving a ship casualty or which requires us to hire tugs or salvage firms, we recover the cost of the operation from the ship owner.</p></speech>

We have dealt with such incidents.  Some years ago, soon after the sinking of the tanker <i>Prestige</i>off the coast of Spain, the <i>Princess Eva</i>, an 80,000 tonne tanker, was sailing from Murmansk across the Atlantic to Houston, Texas, to offload a cargo of crude oil.  It had cracks in its deck.  There was an accident off the coast and two crew members were killed.  A life raft had broken loose in heavy weather.  The captain sent three crew members to secure it, but they were hit by a wave and two of the crew members lost their lives.  The tanker anchored in Donegal bay to sort out the problem, repatriate the bodies and get other crew members aboard.  Cracks were then found in its deck.  Members of the Marine Survey Office went aboard and determined that the ship was not capable of going to sea as it would break up.  We had to transfer all of the cargo from the vessel onto another ship and make temporary repairs, which took 40 days.  All of the expenses incurred by the State in that operation were recovered from the owner.<br/><br/>Deputy O'Keeffe asked about the coastal unit advisory group, CUAG, as well as the wider coastal unit group, grievances and so on.  We greatly value our volunteers and work very closely with them.  They are our colleagues.  There is no difference between full-time staff and volunteers in how we operate together.  Given that we have 1,000 volunteers, it is reasonable to ask how we manage and operate with them.  Our coastguard code sets out the agreement on how we act and volunteers act for us.  Like every organisation which uses volunteers, we require procedures for how we negotiate and operate together.  The code of practice is based on best practice.  I have spoken to representatives of Concern, Tr&oacute;caire and other volunteer organisations about their HR procedures and processes and I am satisfied that ours are best in the class.  In working with our volunteers the coastal unit advisory group has been in existence for several years.  Six officers in charge are elected by volunteers around the coast and their job is to present the views of all units.  The six members are selected on a geographical basis and serve for a period of three years.  The group is representative of coastal search teams, boat teams and cliff units.  It regularly meets the national volunteer servicing manager and the director annually.  I attend all of the meetings.  Additional meetings may be called by the CUAG or management, as necessary.  To date, the structure has proved to be an effective forum for advocating on volunteer issues.  It deals with several issues.  For example, if we wish to introduce new equipment, we discuss with the CUAG whether that would be acceptable.  Ideas for better ways of doing things around the coast can be presented at that forum and worked through.  We do not implement new procedures or introduce new equipment for volunteers, of which they are unaware.  We negotiate to ensure the changes are palatable and will work.<br/><br/>In addition to the CUAG, there are three meetings held annually in each sector which are attended by all volunteers in that sector.  The meetings are a round table forum at which issues or problems can be presented and talked through.  It is like a community hall-type forum, at which everybody gets issues off his or her chest and we can see what we can do, as well as determining where we have fallen down and what we are doing well.  In addition, there are six coastal unit sector managers.  How many units does each manager have?</p></speech>

Our annual conference takes place on a Friday, Saturday and Sunday and is attended by all area officers and particular issues are gone through.  It also provides an opportunity for the volunteer area officers to meet the six elected representatives on the CUAG.

Only approximately 1% of the 1,000 volunteers are involved in a grievance procedure.  The rate is quite low when benchmarked against other organisations and it is low because we engage with our volunteers.  A grievance usually involves two parties, but it may involve three or four.  Those arising in a local community may become very raw and troublesome.  Previously, we only  had three managers on the coast and some grievances festered over time.  Members may be aware of some such issues.  We have recruited additional staff.  In additon, to resolve particular issues we have taken on a HR company to review our manual which stands up to best practice and carry out mediation and try to work grievances through the process.  If mediation does not work, there is still a process to be gone through which involves warnings, appeals and so on.  That is the process and we work through it.</p></speech>

Hoax calls normally come through the 999 system.  When we receive a call, we have three people on watch.  The search and rescue, SAR, mission co-ordinator takes the call and asks the usual questions such as where is the caller.  He or she will very quickly find out whether it is a hoax call.  In the case of persistent hoax calls we identify the number, contact the provider of the GSM or landline service and ask it to block the number.  There is a process to be gone through in that regard.  If a person is responsible for hoax calls over a significant period of time, we contact the Garda at its communications centre on Harcourt Street.</p></speech>

For example, there was an incident in north County Dublin which involved the activation of an emergency position indicating radio beacon, EPIRB, carried by aircraft and ships.  The signal was received by a satellite and relayed to a mission control centre and we were alerted.  The beacon transmits the position and name of the vessel.  We rang the owner who stated he had sold the boat years previously.

I pay tribute to him and his staff for their work, professionalism and bravery in keeping us all safe and saving lives.  I pay tribute, in particular, to the over 1,000 volunteers, with whom he works, for their commitment and professionalism in keeping us safe and saving lives.  We look forward to engaging with Mr. Clonan again in the near future.  I presume that when the review is complete, or at the appropriate stage, he will revert to us on the helicopter issue, the contract, which is important.</p></speech>
