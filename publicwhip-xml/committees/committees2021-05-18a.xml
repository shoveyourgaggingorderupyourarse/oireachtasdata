All members must join remotely from elsewhere in the parliamentary precincts.  The secretariat can issue invitations to join the meeting on MS Teams.  Members may not participate in the meeting from outside of the parliamentary precincts.  I ask members to mute their microphone when not making a contribution and please use the raise hand function to indicate.  Please note that messages sent to the meeting chat are visible to all participants.  Speaking slots are prioritised for members of the committee.</p> <p>  Today's meetings is in two sessions.  The first session, from 3.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m., is an engagement with a representative from James Fitzgerald Agricultural Services.  The second session, from 4.30 p.m. to 5.30 p.m., is an engagement with representatives of the Irish Farm Film Producers Group, IFFPG.  For the first session on farm plastics, I welcome to this meeting Mr. James Fitzgerald, owner of James Fitzgerald Agricultural Services, joining remotely.  We have received his opening statement and briefing material, which have already been circulated to members.  We are limited in our time due to Covid-19 safety restrictions, so the committee has agreed that the opening statement is taken as read.  The committee will use the full session for questions and answers.  All opening statements are published on the Oireachtas website and are publicly available.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I must read an important notice on parliamentary privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Participants joining the committee meeting from a location outside of parliamentary precincts are asked to know that the constitutional protections afforded to those participating within parliamentary precincts does not extend to them.  No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, participation is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.</p> <p>  I invite questions from the members for Mr. Fitzgerald.  We open up the subject on farm plastic.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1651" speakername="Paul Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051800002#A00300"><p>I welcome Mr. Fitzgerald to our meeting.  I have been reading his submission.  For the record, I am small suckler farmer in the midlands and my form of silage is wrapped bales, so while I am familiar with the process, I was not familiar with the intricacies of the arrangement.  I was aware I was paying a levy, but I was not aware of where that levy was going.  From reading the two submissions, I would call the system being explained to us in both submissions as, and I do not use words loosely, extremely discriminatory.  I would like to give Mr. Fitzgerald the opportunity to elaborate further on his submission to the committee, especially with regard to what I would call the missing 30% of the levy that I am paying.  I have paid a levy on my plastics for ten years, give or take.  The contractors have decided to get the farmers to buy their own plastic.  I have been paying 100% of the levy, but from reading the submissions, while that entire levy is going to the IFFPG, it is only collecting 70%.  Where is the 30% balance going?  How is it being used?  What is being used on?</p> <p>  On the frequency of farm collections or the conditions, if there are any, for the IFFPG to do them, in the documentation I have read, they are offering collection point collections and farm collections.  I have a recollection of looking for farm collection myself, to try and avoid a bit of hassle, and it was not forthcoming.  Mr. Fitzgerald might elaborate on that as well.  Perhaps he would also elaborate a little more, from a private contractor's perspective, on what he mentioned about the Repak-style system that is in use for waste on the industrial side of things other than farming.</p> <p>  That is it for the moment, Chair.  Basically, I want to give Mr. Fitzgerald an opportunity to elaborate further on the written document he has submitted to us in the context of the few points I have raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051800002#A00400"><p>First of all, to address the position on the levy, the IFFPG is the statutory agency charged with collection of the levy.  There are approximately 40 or 50 importers and retailers of farm plastics in this country.  They are all signed up with the IFFPG.  They pay a levy at the point of import, or the point of sale, on the plastics.  This is a system that has prevailed as a result of legislation originating in 2001.</p><p>Down the years, there have been a number of players.  The IFFPG has been in the market but prior to it being established, Farm Relief Services was also involved at a level alongside it.  A number of contractors were involved with Farm Relief Services, some of whom subsequently joined the IFFPG as contractors.  Most of us who are independent contractors have had a contract with the IFFPG at some stage.  When contractors get involved and have an investment, and if the tender does not work out, they end up outside of the system along with their investments, licences and permits, so there is very little option but to keep going in the business they started. </p><p> The IFFPG collects 100% of the levy and uses it at its discretion within the company.  Its business is to export farm plastics.  The issue is that the IFFPG is deemed to have fulfilled its statutory remit when it has collected 70% plus of the material.  The balance of us are collecting and have been collecting, shipping and exporting plastic over a number of years.  We have been able to do that without the use of the levy in a buoyant market situation.  </p><p> Originally, the IFFPG-type enterprise was set up under statutory guidance to correct the fact that there were no recycling or collection facilities and plastic was being spread out around the country.  The original remit of the scheme was to address that particular issue.  The situation has now evolved.  The amount of plastic being used has considerably increased and we have independent contractors.  The IFFPG goes out to tender every four to five years to ask contractors like me to tender for so many counties or whatever.  Those that fail in that are still plastic collectors.  We get no assistance whatsoever.  What has helped us is that we were in a position to export plastics as a result of buoyant markets between 2012 to 2017 but since 2017, the Chinese market disruption has created a situation where a normal functional market has not worked.  We are, therefore, looking to the IFFPG at this point for a share of the levy or, indeed, some of the levy that may be due on plastics already shipped.  That is the background to the levies side of it. </p><p> What we have in mind when we speak about Repak, our understanding is that for assemblers of plastics, it will make a contribution to those that export.  It is paying out the levy to anyone, whereas the IFFPG has ended up, by virtue of its remit, being a competitor in the same market as private operators.  That is not exactly what was envisaged.  </p><p> Senator Paul Daly made a point about farm collections by the IFFPG.  The group runs a bring centre collection.  I was part of its system for a number of years.  The bring centre aspect of it has run quite successfully at various points such as towns, marts and various places around the country, but the IFFPG also provides a farm-to-farm collection service, which many people want.  One reason there seems to have been a consolidation of IFFPG contractors down to a small number of five, six or seven is that they do not have the same geographical cover.  Therefore, it appears it may not be economic for the IFFPG to send out a lorry to collect farm plastics in certain areas.  In that instance, where the nearest IFFPG contractor is more than 40 miles away, the service I provide at a bring centre to take in farm plastics services a 30- or 40-mile radius.  There is no particular issue with that but I do not have lorries on the road.  It is a fact that the cost of keeping lorries on the road is quite expensive and prohibitive for farm-to-farm collections.  There is a price at which it is viable and, perhaps, if we were getting more money for plastics or getting some contribution from the levy, we could be in a position to provide a viable farm-to-farm collection service.  That is what we had in mind on Senator Daly's three points. </p></speech>

Can he confirm that he has to operate without receiving any of that?</p></speech>

He was able to do that without the levy.  The IFFPG was collecting the levy and charging farmers at its depots for taking in the plastic, even though private operators were doing that in the absence of a levy.  I presume there was probably a collection charge but they had no access to the levy.  Now market conditions have changed, it is no longer profitable to export plastic without the existence of the levy.  Has Mr. Fitzgerald now plastic on hand?  Has he collected plastic he is not able to export?  Has he a quantity of plastic stored waiting for a new home, let us say?</p></speech>

We have about 1,500 tonnes on site here at the moment.</p></speech>

Is that the scenario?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051800002#B00700"><p>Yes.  Part of that uneconomical scenario relates to low oil prices over the last number of years, which have changed the dynamic of the market.  It is a commodity market and we would expect in the medium to longer term that this will correct itself.  Perhaps, with a bit more legislative assistance, both in Ireland and in Europe, we would be in a position where this market could balance itself out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051800002#B00800"><p>I welcome Mr. Fitzgerald.  I am looking through the material and Senator Paul Daly has brought up some of the issues.  As the Chairman noted, it seems crazy that there is a system whereby the IFFPG collects 100% of the levy but only collects 70% of the plastic, while the farmer also has to pay a deposit fee for the plastic to be returned.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions for Mr. Fitzgerald.  Does the current arrangement cause issues for him in terms of where he can operate?  The Chairman brought up this second issue.  While Mr. Fitzgerald stated he has 1,500 tonnes of plastic on site; do other operators also have stockpiles of plastic?  If so, can he let us know what is happening with it?  Can he outline the advantages he sees a publicly-supported private collector model would have for the environment and farmers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051800002#B00900"><p>Under the current arrangement, I am free to operate where my facility permit allows, locally.  My collector's permit allows me to operate in about four to five counties.</p><p>The constraints in that regard are associated more with the original collection permits and licence in respect of the National Waste Collection Permit Office, NWCPO, in Offaly and the local authorities themselves.  I am not really constrained, in the sense that I could operate nationally but the economics of doing so are counterproductive.  It is a business with a certain footprint, and it will not extend beyond that because the cost of haulage is a killer.  </p><p> On the stockpiles of plastic around the country, all the independent operators have stockpiles of plastic.  These are estimated to be 10,000 tonnes among contractors in the private sector  That is the scale of the situation.  It has been a difficult market and the stockpile is not only a concern for us.  I understand the IFFPG also has some stockpiles but I cannot confirm that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1508" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051800002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chair and members for having this matter included on the agenda.  I welcome Mr. Fitzgerald.  I understand that when the Department initiated the scheme it basically involved farmers paying a deposit upfront and they were to get a refund.  Can Mr. Fitzgerald confirm that was the basis on which the scheme was set up?  Farmers paid &euro;5, &euro;6 or &euro;7 for a roll of plastic and they were supposed to get their money back when they brought the plastic back.</p> <p>  I also understand that the Department, with a stroke of a pen, changed green waste to amber and that caused a major problem.  Green waste can be disposed of free of charge in other countries.  I would like confirmation of that.</p> <p>  I understand there is something called a trammelling machine - I may have named it incorrectly - which the plastic is pushed through.  Does that turn the plastic into green waste?  Is it an expensive process?</p> <p>  Figures show that farmers have paid between &euro;1.6 million and &euro;2 million a year upfront for plastic upfront, or rather they paid for it after the companies that brought the plastic in had paid for it.  At the end of the day, it is the farmers around the country making bales and silage who are paying for all this plastic.  There is also the collection point to be considered.  Am I right in saying that most plastics have doubled in weight when they are brought back from farms because they are covered in bits of muck and dirt and that we are looking at a cost of &euro;50 a tonne?  That suggests an income of at least &euro;3 million a year for the body overseeing this.</p> <p>  I have done some research in this area.  There are systems in place for recycling plastics.  Setting up an industry would require machinery costing between &euro;5 million and &euro;6 million.  Has anything been done in that regard?  Is there an opportunity to undertake this type of endeavour in Ireland and avoid what has happened here?</p> <p>  My understanding from photographs I have seen is that large stockpiles of last year's plastic are being held by the people accredited with collection.  Mr. Fitzgerald may not know that.  What will be the outcome of that?  Is it correct that between 10,000 and 14,000 tonnes of this waste is stuck in the hands of private individuals around the country?  Chaos is about to occur because the Department is not doing anything to try to resolve this issue.  Everything I have seen suggests this is like a closed shop.  </p></speech>

His first point concerned the deposit refund.  To confirm, that is the way the legislation was set up.  Farmers were to pay upfront and then get a refund when the material was recycled.  That is provided for in the original legislation back in 2001.  I confirm that is the case.</p></speech>

On the deposit refund scheme, the legislation also made provision for an approved body alternative.  This is the element of it under which the IFFPG has been established as an approved body.  It is the State-approved body to collect the levy on farm plastics coming into the country.  The context <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the legislation is that the system has moved away slightly from the legislation.<br/><br/>The Deputy raised the issue of green versus amber waste.  Until 2013, all farm plastics were exported as green waste.  In other words, farmers baled their plastic and shipped it to a recycler.  A certificate was provided when it was leaving and another was provided when it came back.  The situation changed in 2013 when farm plastics were designated as amber.  This involved a significant shift and difficulty in respect of the export of farm plastics.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051800002#C00900"><p>Amber waste is considered hazardous waste.  I do not know the context but amber waste is significantly more difficult to export.  First, a bond of about &euro;5,000 per load is required.  For example, I could have a bond of &euro;20,000 in place for four loads of plastic to be in play at any one time in my yard.  Once the first load was recycled, I could then ship the fifth load.  It significantly restricts our movement of and trade in plastic.  The amber designation also created difficulties with the loading of plastic at yards.  For example, if a lorry could not come on a certain day, the load had to be abandoned and permission has to be obtained for another load two days later.  This is causing extreme difficulty here for those shipping plastics.</p> <p>  It also created an even bigger difficulty with regard to the yards to which farm plastics could be exported. Amber waste cannot be exported to a green facility, which cuts out most of the facilities.  There are only three amber facilities we know of, namely, one in the Netherlands and two in Great Britain.  Our markets on the Continent could not take this waste because amber waste cannot be shipped to a green facility.  That is the case even though Irish farm plastic, and farm plastic Europe-wide, is classified as green waste.  This aspect is managed by the National TransFrontier Shipment Office, and its view was based on the fact that there would be commingling of hazardous materials.  Grit, soil and organic matter are not hazardous materials.  We import and export cattle and other livestock, for example, and that activity involves bedding and all sorts of issues.  There is no greater difficulty to the country in that regard than with farm plastics, but that is the perception in the National TransFrontier Shipment Office.  </p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice also mentioned the trammelling machine.  The National TransFrontier Shipment Office has indicated that farm plastics may be trammelled, a process that involves putting the material through a big screen and screening it out.</p><p>However the volume of material one gets out of a trammel is less than 5%.  It is really dust, some sand, stone and little things like that.  It is a costly procedure to put the material through a trammel and to export it as green waste.  That is the first element of it.  It does not add any value.  The current recyclers for farm plastics are quite well prepared to accept untrammelled plastic, which is what they have done for years, in their recycling facilities in England, Wales, Scotland and in Holland.  We think trammelling waste is a waste of time, to coin a phrase, to deal with that issue.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned the figures of &euro;1.6 million to &euro;2 million.  Again, those are estimated figures.  However, it was money that farmers paid.  When one buys a roll of plastic, and it is 40 kg or 50 kg in a roll, it doubles its weight when one brings it back in for recyling because it is a hygroscopic material and retains water and it would have a certain amount of grit and dust in it.  It doubles its weight naturally.  That is one of the issues with it.  We might put 16,000 tonnes of plastic on the market, but we will end up getting 25,000 tonnes to 30,000 tonnes of plastic back in as a result of that issue.</p><p> Deputy Fitzmaurice mentioned a plastics recycling facility.  That is rather interesting, in that there have been a number of iterations of plastics recycling facilities in this country over the last ten or 15 years.  Unfortunately, in many cases, it has been a graveyard for money.  The recycling facilities failed commercially, but I am not privy to the reasons this might have happened.  It would appear that, perhaps, lack of investment and engineering technology were letting people down.  There was a great Bord na M&oacute;na facility in Littleton, County Tipperary.  It is a super yard, ideal for the particular job.  However, the process of handling farm plastics involves fairly robust machinery and, in many cases, the investment has not been appropriate or enough to get the machinery that would ensure that the facility would run.  That is my view of it.</p></speech>

My understanding from the research I have done is that there was a reluctance to guarantee supply to some of the people who were willing to invest in the proper machinery in this country.  Would the industry have heard of that?  While what Bord na M&oacute;na is doing is appreciated, I understand that the gear it has is not fit for the silage plastics.  It is basically like a monkey and an elephant, in that it is not fit for purpose.</p></speech>

There were engineering and design issues with the facility.  What was the Deputy's first point?</p></speech>

I cannot verify any of that but that appears to be what is out there.  A guarantee of supply is the first thing one needs when one is making a big investment in a place.  It seems that, for whatever reason, these types of guarantee were not forthcoming with regard to processing plastic in this country.</p></speech>

If the State decided to provide some private operators, given the ties they have in England where there are some big operators, with the moneys required here, for example, between &euro;2.5 million to &euro;3 million per year, would there be an incentive for them to come over and set up something that would create jobs here and, perhaps, alleviate the problem that is building up around the country?</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Fitzgerald for appearing before the committee.  It has been three years since concerns of a critical nature that there was going to be a problem down the road were highlighted.  There have been a few Ministers in that time, and some of them went as far as saying that they would offer any assistance they could.  Here we are in 2021 and the horse has well and truly bolted.  Why was this issue not resolved?  That is one question.  Why was support never given to an Irish recycling plant, such as Barrington and Filco?  Private individuals invested millions and would have worked well if they were guaranteed a decent gate fee from the IFFPG.  Hundreds of jobs could have been created instead of high-ranking officials creating more jobs for the boys, in my view, in the initial establishment of the IFFPG and later.  Also, why did the IFFPG not operate the tried and tested Repak model, where significant subsidies were passed directly to Irish recyclers?  If it had, we would now have an industry that is self-sufficient in terms of recycling.</p> <p>  I might have another question after that, but I would appreciate it if Mr. Fitzgerald could answer that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051800002#D00900"><p>To address the Deputy's last point regarding the Repak model first, in a way what has happened here has been the result of an unpredictable evolution of things since the waste management legislation was introduced.  Originally, there was no market at all for farm plastics, pellets or the like.  That has developed, but it was an <i>ad hoc</i>development of the system.  The evolution of the collection and recycling of farm plastics has followed an unsteady trajectory over a 15- to 20-year period.  For the first seven or eight years there was no gate fee being achieved for the export of farm plastics, and the IFFPG would have had to subsidise substantially the recycling of farm plastics at facilities abroad.  However, for most years in the last ten or 12 years there was a market for that particular product.  We need a dynamic type of model that takes account of the market fluctuations, and possibly one that would, encompass the ideas of, perhaps, the Repak model.  We certainly believe that what the Deputy said about the Repak model is true, that it would help significantly in this regard.  Rather than seeing independent farm contractors or collectors as competition in the market, the IFFPG could collaborate with us in some way in order that we could achieve the one purpose, that is, to move the existing stocks of plastic and to develop into the future on that basis.<br/><br/>The Deputy further asked why support was not given to an Irish plant.  That is a question for the people in the IFFPG, as I was not privy to the scenario in the establishment of those facilities and was only just vaguely aware that they were there at the time.</p><p>Some of these things date back seven to ten years at this point.  The Deputy might put that question to the IFFPG.  Have I addressed all of the questions posed?</p></speech>

How can the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, who is the leader of the Green Party, support and protect a company that is in receipt of 100% of the levy while only having to reach a collection target of 70%?  The Minister admitted that it did not even reach that target in an email dated 22 September 2020.  It should be noted that these targets were set by the Government.  Surely it is the Green Party's belief that they should be made to work.  What are Mr. Fitzgerald's thoughts on that?</p></speech>

They have not evolved to take account of the current environment or the changing scenarios in which we find ourselves.  In terms of a solution, we need to re-examine the legislative basis.  Why not aim for 100% with the co-operative model of IFFPG and independent farm plastic contractors working together?  That would be a model to aspire to but reform is required.  The original Waste Management Act under which this was constituted needs to be updated to take account of issues such as the European Green Deal and the sustainable use directive as well as the current context.  It is a complex matter but it can be resolved in the round.  In terms of the IFFPG aspect of it, we should consider reorganising the role of the group in a way that would be more co-operative for all of the players involved.</p></speech>

What amount of plastic does Mr. Fitzgerald believe is around the country?  Has he seen figures on it?  People talk about 20,000 tonnes of plastic lying in farm yards.  In the context of the market and the levy, does Mr. Fitzgerald believe the issue of the volume of plastic in yards around the country must be addressed?  I have been told that 20,000 tonnes would be a conservative estimate of the amount of plastic out there.  China has stepped back from the market and Wales is our main option at the moment.  What is required to clear the backlog?  How big is that backlog and how do we ensure that a similar backlog does not build up again in the future?  Mr. Fitzgerald has referred to the requirement to collect 70% which is based on legislation that was drafted in the early 2000s and which is now totally out of date.  His comments regarding the legislation are well noted and will be put to the next group of witnesses to appear before the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.37" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051800002#E00600"><p>I thank Senator Lombard for his questions which were on the market, the amount of plastic in the country and the backlog.  I would estimate that there are approximately 20,000 to 25,000 tonnes of plastic out there and that may even be a little conservative.  Anecdotal evidence from yards suggests that is what is in the system at the minute.  A multi-strand approach is required to clear the backlog.  We must deal with the green versus amber debate in the context of the transfrontier shipment of waste.  We could be in a position where there are markets for farm plastics as green waste.  We could ship a certain amount of plastic in that manner, or at least facilitate the moving of farm plastics, thus reducing our stockpile.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice raised the issue of a recycling facility and my comments in relation to that may not be orthodox.  If we were to consider developing such a facility in Ireland, with State support, the first thing it would need is a base operating load.  The 25,000 tonnes could be looked at as an asset or a liability.  If one is setting up a recycling facility, one needs a base load and 25,000 tonnes of farm plastic would not be shocking.  There have been up to 4,000 tonnes of plastic in my own yard at times so having 1,500 or 1,600 tonnes in stock in a really difficult market situation would be well within our remit.  We can examine the recycling facility option but the most immediate action that could be taken to deal with the 25,000 tonnes in 2021 is the facilitation of exports.  </p> <p>  The Senator also asked about future reforms.  We should revisit the statutory model, consider the designation of farm plastic as an amber material and look into the development of a recycling facility for the country as a whole.  I hope that addresses the questions posed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051800002#E00800"><p>I thank Mr. Fitzgerald for giving us such a detailed presentation.  First and foremost we must acknowledge the enormous efforts of farmers in this area.  Farmers are facing a lot of challenges and are under a lot of pressure.  When plastic was first introduced to farming, it was a blight on the countryside and townies derided this.  Hand on heart, though, one would find it hard to drive down a country road now and find a piece of plastic which is testament to farmers and the efforts they are making.</p> <p>  The world is changing, as is the economy.  We are now aiming for a circular economy.  In his opening statement, Mr. Fitzgerald referred to the Chinese, who really cornered this market, as well as the paper market.  Indeed, they cornered so many markets and were ahead of every other economy in this game.  However, when they had what they wanted, they shut the door.  </p> <p>  We have a number of challenges in this country in terms of recycling.  Used paint, for example, is next to impossible to recycle.  It is very difficult to recycle paper, particularly newspaper, because the Chinese are closing the door or are dropping the price such that recycling companies here cannot afford to collect it.  This is putting pressure on Repak.  There are some positive recycling developments including a very successful tyre recycling business in County Longford.  Tyres are being recycled and made into a synthetic plastic that is used in sand arenas.  </p> <p>  We are placing enormous demands on farmers and the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill will increase such demands significantly.  It is important that we do not burden them with additional costs.  Realistically, 25,000 tonnes in the context of recycling overall is not a big figure.  It is a very manageable amount.  That said, the recycling of farm plastic cannot operate in a silo.  It can only operate in a campus where other materials are also being recycled, including paper and newspaper.  The recycling companies themselves argue that we need to be recycling such waste on Irish soil rather than exporting it.  </p> <p>  In terms of the academics out there, who has Mr. Fitzgerald linked up with?  In a lot of the universities, but particularly in our institutes of technology, there are specialists in the area of plastic.  Has Mr. Fitzgerald linked up with any of them?  In the context of the just transition, has he had discussions with Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB?</p><p>Bord na M&oacute;na, as Mr. Fitzgerald rightly said, has a semblance of a plan.  It has a track record in recycling.  Has Mr. Fitzgerald had any discussions on a joint venture with it?  Those are two questions for Mr. Fitzgerald.</p></speech>

However, we have not linked up with them in relation to exploring a solution.  What appears to happen when we speak about plastics is these institutions are working on other types of possibly more lucrative plastics or more interesting materials in their own way.  We have not come across the right person in relation to that particular issue.</p> <p>  In relation to Bord na M&oacute;na, we did link up with it.  We visited Littleton looking at the possibility that it might take a supply of farm plastics from us but its sheds were already full and it was having problems with its machinery.  Its machinery was letting it down.  It had a good process line and superb facilities - buildings, layout, etc.  Much of the investment was already there.  We discussed it with it and we had to wait.  As a result of the mechanical issues in relation to it, we have had to go back to it because its facility is not able to cope with what is in front of it at the minute.</p></speech>

As a follow-on from that, has nobody in the Department said it will give funding for a research project to see what is the alternative or if this can be recycled on Irish soil?  If that is not the case, possibly one of the actions for us arising out of this is that we ask the Department to undertake that research project because it seems pertinent.  If we are serious about climate action, it would lead to the type of housekeeping that we need to tidy up and be effective.</p></speech>

The plant is not yours but I have two questions.  There was significant investment in that plant.  I was present the day that this project was launched amid much fanfare but, obviously, it has not operated successfully.  What kind of capital would be required to make Littleton a successful recycling plant for our plastic?  It would have a good central location near the motorway.  It would be an excellent central location if the plant could operate successfully.</p> <p>  There is a second question I want to ask and if Mr. Fitzgerald wants to refrain from answering it, that is okay.  Irish Farm Films Producers Group, IFFPG, had a number of good years dealing with plastic.  While I can understand how private merchants have a stockpile of plastic in their yards, why has IFFPG stockpiled plastic?  Why has it not taken a hit?  It has collected the levy and in most cases, charged farmers for delivering it into its depots.  What excuse has it for stockpiling plastic and not exporting it to one of the two plants that are operating in the UK?</p></speech>

In relation to the capital requirement, we would estimate funding of the order of &euro;4 million to &euro;5 million to get a facility up and running with robust equipment fit for purpose.  In relation to the farm plastics, it is not only about the facility.  There is also an issue in relation to the marketing of the granules that are produced and of the product for that.  If we think on a more global basis in relation to plastic marketing, the global situation in processing is owned by large conglomerates, some of which employ up to 50,000 people.  We would need possibly to team up or in some way link in with a large external outfit that is already involved in this.  There is much to be said for that rather than reinventing the wheel or that particular model.</p> <p>  I am sorry, Chairman.  I missed your second question there on the stockpiling by IFFPG.</p></speech>

I would imagine they may be waiting for the market to somewhat improve.  It has done so a little bit in the past year in that it is &euro;30 cheaper this year to export farm plastics than it was last year.  I cannot address that issue in relation to IFFPG.</p></speech>

Can he outline what advantages it would have for the environment and for farmers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.49" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Fitzgerald" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051800002#F01100"><p>From the farmers' point of view, it would be convenient and it would be local.  Those would be the two.  At present, the IFFPG model has depots.  It has only five or six depots in the country.  That means that there are large parts of the country that are not covered with any service.  The second part of it is that farmers are bringing in plastic by tractor and trailer and there is an outer limit to how far they will travel with the tractor and trailer.  That is another aspect to it.</p> <p>  The situation has evolved, with contractors leaving the collection of farm plastics and with others staying in it.  Gaps have now opened up in the market where areas are not viable to service because of the distance and location.  A public service model would fall in a good bit there in relation to that.  If one was going to Connemara, for example, one would be travelling quite a distance to get farm plastics.  That is where the model breaks down on economics.</p> <p>  On the environmental side, the balance that is not collected by IFFPG is collected by us and maybe there is merit in the support of the private individual in places.  There will be 30% left out there if IFFPG has not the reach within the market to collect it all.  There would be an environmental benefit from that point of view.</p></speech>

I am from Roscommon.  Listening to Mr. Fitzgerald, he has opened my eyes to this matter.  I would have known about it but, to be honest, I would not nearly have the grasp that he has of it.  The difficulties that exist there are quite serious.  I was called away to take a phone call but I have two questions.  I am sorry if Mr. Fitzgerald has been asked them already.  Would Mr. Fitzgerald accept, because of its seriousness, that there is a far greater need for the State to become involved to sort this matter out as a matter of urgency?  After all, we are talking about improving the environment.  It has already been mentioned by Deputy Flathery that farmers have in recent years cleaned up their act in relation to plastic along roadways and even around their farmers and they do not want it, but if we have this problem of not being able to get rid of it, it certainly causes a problem for the farmers on the ground.  That is the first question.</p> <p>  The second question is on whether any research is being done in any of our institutions - and I am thinking of the status of Athlone Institute of Technology, AIT, changing to university status - or are universities coming up with a model with which we could deal with this matter?  We definitely have to get involved and sort this matter out.</p><p>I thank the witness for his address.  I found it very good and I would like to communicate with him more on the issue.</p></speech>

Previously, there has been reluctance on the part of the State to get involved.  Its representatives would point immediately to the Acts on this.  Because of state aid concerns, they would be afraid that they would be supporting a business in a way that would constitute state aid.  We believe, however, that with a bit of thoughtfulness the matter could be dealt with.  Covid has taught us about the State's need to intervene in certain small businesses to maintain certain coverage and so on.</p> <p>  On university research, I must admit that I have not had a whole pile of time to look at what was happening out in the universities.  I am aware there is a strong plastics aspect to Athlone Institute of Technology and maybe we have to reach out and make contact with some people who may have an interest in further developing their research in this area or to assist them in any we could to develop that particular space.</p> <p>  On the third point-----</p></speech>

Perhaps people like me could follow up with the institutes of technology or the universities to see if they would be interested in getting involved in a solution to this problem.  I will take this on board and I will get back to Mr. Fitzgerald.  I thank him.</p></speech>

It would be worthwhile talking to them.</p><p>To synopsise, to solve this Mr. Fitzgerald has stated there are three different things the committee will want to look at.  I was jotting them down.  Should the legislation be looked at?  Should we look at an amber to green system instead of <i>vice versa</i>?  Should the Minister set up a body made up of the private collectors, the IFFPG, and the Department to try to resolve this issue?  Going by my telling, over the past ten to 12 years, at least &euro;40 million has been paid out by farmers.  We have what is near an industry out of it.  It is basically like being salespeople, we are getting the plastic and we are trying to fob it off to somebody, but it is the farmer who is paying at the middle.  Would Mr. Fitzgerald agree?</p></speech>

It is a combination of all three or four aspects of what Deputy Fitzmaurice has just said there.  The legislation has to be examined.  On the amber versus green matter, we believe that something simple for now might get that moving such as a statutory instrument or a ministerial order.  We should have a body made up of the private collectors and the IFFPG to attempt to resolve the issue together.  We could put it together with the Department, with a view to pulling together all the aspects and issues involved to have a solution and most definitely to look at having a facility in Ireland, if that was at all possible.</p></speech>

There could be an opportunity in the midlands, under the just transition, to create employment and to have a facility, as referred to by Deputy Flaherty earlier, so we can recycle our own plastics instead of talking about it.  Setting up something like that, with the funding that would be there, could be a great opportunity in the midlands area.</p></speech>

Different people around the country are making us aware of things.  Is there an intention to reduce the number of bring centres around the country this year?  Are there large stockpiles with the IFFPG's collectors around the country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.71" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051800002#H00300"><p>On the first question, we intend to run the same bring centre programme again this year.  Typically, we run a bring centre programme that consists of 220 to 230 bring centres.  They are provided in each county throughout the country.  The average county has around eight or nine bring centres.  Unless Covid stops us doing so we expect to provide a similar service this year.  On the stockpiles in our contractors' yards, they probably have 10,000 or 11,000 tonnes at the moment but we are very confident that material will move in the next 12 months, along with whatever we collect this year.  To put the thing in some perspective, last year we collected 34,000 tonnes of material from farmers throughout the country but we also sent 34,000 tonnes for recycling.  However, we carried material from previous years because the market is so difficult.  It is a difficult market situation but we are seeing improved demand.  We supply a lot of material to Irish recyclers, we are committed to supporting Irish recyclers where possible and we are very confident that whatever we collect this year, along with what we are going to carry over, will be recycled in the next 12 months or so.</p></speech>

Some seven or eight years ago, it decided unprocessed farm plastic waste was amber-listed, not because it is hazardous but because of the high contamination level.  That contamination is largely rainwater and small particles of silage, clay, etc.  We have no issue or problem with that.  Having said that, if the office were to revert to classifying it as green-listed we would of course work with that new arrangement and it would be an easier one to work with.</p></speech>

We must understand that, going by figures from the last ten years, at least &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million, maybe more, has been paid upfront by farmers in this.  This was supposed to be a case of pay upfront and have it collected free.  On what basis does the IFFPG claim to be able to impose charges?  How does it add them up or come to the conclusion a farmer must pay a second time for the plastic he or she brings to the bring centres?  When one looks at the legislation that was initially brought in, it was basically pay upfront and a person was actually supposed to get money back, never mind pay.  Where does it give the authority to the likes of the IFFPG to go charging farmers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.77" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051800002#H00900"><p>The regulations allow an approved body, which the IFFPG is, to fund itself through a levy if it sees fit and also we have the leeway to charge collection charges.  At the moment, we make up around 70% of our income through the recycling levy and the remaining 30% comes from collection charges to farmers which are weight-based.  We have gone with this model because the weight-based charging encourages farmers to bring in plastic that is less contaminated.  For that reason we have gone with that model.  If we were to abolish collection charges to farmers we would have to increase the levy because there is a certain amount of funding we need to operate each year and we also think it would negatively impact on the quality of the plastic we bring in at our collection points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.78" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1508" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051800002#H01000"><p>Under the agreements, the IFFPG gets 100% of the levy to collect 70% of the plastic, which is not a bad deal I must say.  How come that if there is a private operator there that has collected plastic that it can give the numbers because I am a contractor myself and we know on a line of baling one must have the number to give at the different centres?  If that plastic is legitimate why is that not handed on to those people in the private side of it who collect it in different parts of the country, in order to reduce the amount of plastic hanging around?  The second part of that question follows on from that.  I am going to be straight and blunt here with Mr. Moloney.  We would have heard anecdotal evidence that the IFFPG was less than co-operative if companies wanted to secure all the plastic to go into a venture setting up in this country.  If a company was prepared, or, under the just transition if something could be worked with the Department, to set up a recycling facility with the proper machinery like there is in England, would the IFFPG be supportive of that and would it guarantee them all the plastic it has?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.79" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Moloney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2021051800002#H01100"><p>On the first part of the question, yes, we collect 100% of the levy and, as the Deputy said, the recycling target is 70%.  However, last year we collected 80% of what our members placed on the market so we collect in excess of the target.  As the Deputy is aware, the last few years have been very difficult in the recycling market.  It has been extremely expensive to send the plastic for recycling so we had use all that money to cover those additional costs.  We have a track record of passing any cost savings we achieve because of a good market situation back to farmers and members in the form of reduced charges.  For example, in the period 2011 to 2013 we reduced farmer charges by 40% and I think we reduced the levy almost 30%.</p> <p>  On the collectors operating outside our scheme, we do not support them because they are operating outside our scheme and it would be counterproductive for us to support them.  One of the essential elements that contributes to the success of our scheme is the fact we contract our collectors.  They collect exclusively for us and do not compete with each other so they can concentrate totally on quality of service provided to farmers.  I should say any collector can participate in our tendering process which takes place every five years but the fact we have contracted, approved collectors means we can guarantee the same quality of service from one county to the other, from one year to the next and also that farmers are charged the same price.  For example, a farmer in County Donegal will get the same quality service and be charged the same price as one in County Wexford.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's last point about supporting Irish recyclers, last year we sent over 34,000 tonnes of material for recycling and over half of that went to Irish recyclers.  We have a policy of supporting Irish recyclers if they are fit for purpose and if they are in any way competitive on price.  It makes sense for us to support Irish recyclers and we want to support the development of an Irish recycling infrastructure.</p></speech>

Indeed, a very significant cost is incurred.  As the Deputy is aware, that cost has escalated in the last few years due to the decision by the Chinese to stop importing plastic waste in 2017-2018.  It caused a flooding of the global market.</p><p>That resulted in our costs increasing from &euro;4 million in 2018 to &euro;6 million last year.</p></speech>

The IFFPG model works very well for IFFPG.  As was mentioned, we are achieving an 80% recycling rate at the moment, even though the target is only 70%.  To put that into perspective, an 80% recycling level for plastic waste is extraordinary.  No other plastic waste stream in Ireland is achieving an 80% recycling rate.  Our scheme would be seen as one of the highest achievers in Europe.  The system that we operate works very well for us.  The system that REPAK operates works well for REPAK.</p></speech>

We collected 80% of what our members put on the market.  The rest of that money was used to move material to recycling facilities at a time of very high cost.

Mr. Moloney indicated earlier that more than half the 34,250 tonnes sent for recycling in 2020 was supplied to Irish recyclers with the rest going to European firms.  In 2018, China ceased importing all waste, which flooded the European market resulting in higher recycling costs.  Bearing that in mind, how are plans to increase our recycling capabilities progressing?  What is the position with regard to the plant in Littleton increasing its capacity?</p></speech>

That plant has dramatically improved and it hopes to start operating commercially in the coming weeks.  Bord na M&oacute;na is very hopeful that the plant will deliver and we are obviously hopeful as well.  We will give it whatever volume of material it requires from us.  It makes good sense for us to supply to a recycling facility in such a central location.  We have also recycled significant quantities of material through other recyclers in the past year.  I refer, for example, to Walker Recycling Services in Portlaoise, which is a pre-treatment facility.  We hope to put 6,000 or 7,000 tonnes of material through the ADN Materials plant in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, this year.  We are absolutely committed to supporting Irish recyclers wherever it is viable to do so.</p></speech>

No companies which are putting farm plastic products on the market are offering self-compliance because it is so onerous.  It is very difficult to arrange for the collection of waste from customers and send it on for recycling.  The scheme that we operate represents an easier option for them.  That is not having any impact on costs.</p></speech>

We would like to think that we give a very comprehensive service to farmers.  We provide bring centres in every county.  We also provide a year-round farmyard collection service and I believe the results speak for themselves.  We are currently achieving an 80% recycling rate.  It is unfortunate that we have had to increase charges to farmers and to members in recent years, but that was unavoidable.  As has been mentioned a few times already, we are more than happy to pass any significant savings back to farmers and members in the future through charge reductions.</p></speech>

It would be counterproductive for us to support independent collectors because in effect they are competing with our collectors.

Last year and in 2019, it was &euro;40 per tonne.  It is, therefore, a &euro;10 per tonne increase.

Obviously, that is not verified by anyone; it is a statement that was made at committee.

As I mentioned earlier, we see the market improving so we are very confident that we will recycle all we collect this year, as well as what we carried over from previous years, in the next 12 months.</p> <p>  The big push to manage plastic resources in a more sustainable way will see increased demand for plastic waste over the coming years.  Manufacturers of plastic products now are increasingly being asked to put recycled content in their products and in time, this will see an increase in demand for plastic waste, including farm plastic waste.  For the moment, however, it undoubtedly is a difficult enough market situation.  That is where we see things, however.</p></speech>

The IFFPG collects a levy on 100% of the plastic.  Independent operators have collected because, in fairness, it is recognised that very little plastic is thrown in farmers' yards around the country.  The vast majority of it is collected.  Whether an extra 15% or 18% of the market has been collected, therefore, they have collected that without any levy.  They collect it on the basis that they hope the market will improve.  Is Mr. Moloney saying the IFFPG does not have any responsibility to help those independent operators to offload that plastic given fact that it collected the levy?</p></speech>

It is due to a global market change but it is not our responsibility to make the levy available to them.  The levy is there for the running of this scheme, which works very successfully.  I am afraid we are not, therefore, in a position to offer any assistance in that regard.</p></speech>

The independent collectors made a commercial decision to go out into the market and provide a second service to farmers, as they were well entitled to do.  They collected the plastic and now they have an obligation to move it on.  When the market is good, obviously, we do not hear from the independent collectors but now the market has gone into a difficult position and they are seeking assistance.</p> <p>  If we were to give funding to independent collectors, in effect, we would be paying our competitors.  Those guys are out there competing with our contractors, which would make our own contractors very unhappy as they have exclusive rights to collect in particular counties.  It would also leave us open to a legal challenge as our contractors have contracts with us to be exclusive collectors in their areas.  For those reasons, therefore, unfortunately, we would not be able to assist the independent collectors, although we very much sympathise with their position.</p></speech>

Based on some of his answers, I am finding it hard to get my head around the situation.  We will give Mr. Moloney the benefit of the doubt.  The IFFPG's target is 70% and it collected 80%, therefore, 20% is left out there.  Mr. Moloney admits that.  The IFFPG is paid for collecting, however.  That 20% of the plastic is 100% of the problem.  That is the plastic that is not accounted for.</p> <p>  The IFFPG is prepared to take State money.  Mr. Moloney is running what he calls a not-for-profit organisation, which is State-funded, to alleviate a problem.  The solution was designed in the 1990s, which was actually ahead of the curve when it came to environmental issues that are the order of the day today.  In fairness, we were ahead of the curve on this one.  We set up a system and the IFFPG was formed, which was getting money from the farmer to solve the problem of his or her finished plastic.  IFFPG took 100% of the money and is proud today to say it handled 80% of the problem.  I do not know how anyone can appear before a State Oireachtas committee and hold his or her hand up and justify that argument.  As I said, 20% of a balance is 100% of the plastic that is out there with a potential environmental catastrophe for the country.  The only reason that 20% is not creating mayhem within the environment and in every bog hole, ditch and laneway of the country is thanks to the individual sole traders who stepped into fill the void, and Mr. Moloney cannot see why they would not be entitled to a piece of the pie for the service they are providing for the country and the environment.</p> <p>  The IFFPG calls itself not-for-profit yet said it is sitting on thousands of tonnes of plastic.  How can it do its sums or know what reserve is it carrying?  When it fixes its charge to the farmers this year, the way the global markets are going, how does it know it is not going to cost ten times that to dispose of the plastic if it does not dispose of it there and then?  How does the IFFPG come up with the figures?</p> <p>  Its submission highlights with great clarity the fact that IFFPG reduced the prices by 29% and 40% during 2011 to 2013.  In the past three years, however, it has increased them by 45% and 66% for collection off a higher base.  It is not giving much back to the farmer other than the problem of the disposal of the additional 20% of plastic, which the IFFPG is getting paid to take away.  Will Mr. Moloney please tell me how this can be a good system for the Government and explain why we as politicians should not be going back to redress this issue from the roots up?  The current system is not working.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the only way we have been able to deal with that situation in the last few years is to increase costs.  We spend everything that we collect in a given year on collecting and recycling farm plastics waste.</p> <p>  Incidentally, this particular scheme does not cost the taxpayer a cent.  It is a self-funding scheme.  Again, I must go back to the point on the service that the farmers are getting.  Every year, we collect a massive volume of plastics from farmers throughout the country.  Farmers support the service.  We have the support of the farm plastics industry.  As I have said, we are sympathetic to the situation in which the independent collectors find themselves.  However, we cannot assist them, because if we do, we are working against our own scheme.</p></speech>

In listening to the discussion and the arguments made, I note that there seems to be a misunderstanding that somehow the money we are collecting is public money.  Our scheme operates independently.  All of the industry is represented on the board, of which I am the independent chairman.  We should think about why we have this scheme.  If we did not have this scheme, that is robust and is able to take the massive fluctuations in the market which we have to deal with, no plastics would be collected in this country at all.   We are a non-profit organisation.  We are set up in such a way that we can take the difficulties as well as the good times.  Our company has really stabilised the market.  If we were not in operation, no plastics would be being collected.  There would be a massive problem.  Therefore, the committee must take it in the round and understand the situation.  We sympathise greatly with those who find themselves in a difficult market situation.  However, they took a commercial decision.  When they took that decision they knew the way the system operated.</p> <p>  One of the members - I believe it was Senator Daly - asked how we figure out the charges.  Each year, with all of the industry representatives on the board, we do a balancing exercise.  We look at how much it is going to cost us to recycle the plastics that we are managing.  We set our charges at the minimum level possible.  The reason the system is set up as it is, and the reason there is a charge for the farmer at the bring centre, is because of the nature of the plastic.  The nature of the farm plastic is that it is a most difficult product to deal with and it has 50% contamination.  Therefore, the reason for the charges at the bring centre is to encourage the farmers to ensure that the plastic is as clean as possible, because they are charged on a weight basis.  This has led to a much better product over the years because the farmer is incentivised to keep the plastic clean.  This means that we can move the plastics up a category from amber to green and that is it worth more money.</p> <p>  We are striving to make this plastic worth more money so that the costs are reduced back to the farmer.  At the end of the day, we all know that it is the consumer who pays the price.  The producers pay the levy, but in the end the consumer has to pay.  We are trying to make this service as cheap as possible for the farmer.  If 100% of the plastic comes to us, we will recycle it 100% of it.</p></speech>

Mr. Dunne spoke about public money.  Let us be very clear that it is farmers who have paid for this scheme.  The organisation should not regard itself as a hero.   It is farmers who pay at the beginning and the end.  I am a contractor.  I know that when they one buys plastic, there is a levy on it.  When that farmer, for whom we go baling, goes to the bring centre, he or she has to pay again.  Therefore, those farmers are paying twice for the so-called great service being provided by the Irish Farm Film Producers Group, which itself is getting paid the full levy to collect 70% of the plastic.  That is the reality.  There are no "ifs" or "buts" about it.  The Irish Farm Film Producers Group collects 80% of it at most.  That is the bottom line.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Moloney.  In respect of recycling, he mentioned that the company does recycling in Laois.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Mr. Moloney and a previous contributor both spoke about private operators.  It was stated that they are in competition with the Irish Farm Film Producers Group.  That is fine.  For all the years when plastic was good and the private operators were sending plastic out of the country, the Irish Farm Film Producers Group was getting paid money to do nothing with a lot of plastic.  The Irish Farm Film Producers Group took that money for years while the plastics industry was good and private operators, which was not subsidised, sent the plastic out of the country. The Irish Farm Film Producers Group received subsidies from industry and did not have to do anything.  It did not have to collect the plastic, but received the subsidy for it.</p><p>There are now 10,000, 12,000 or 14,000 tonnes of plastic to be dealt with and, after so many years of getting money for jam, to be quite frank about it, when the private operators got plastic out of the country and received no subsidy, the Irish Farm Film Producers Group, IFFPG, is not prepared to call an amnesty and do something not only for the farmers, but for Ireland Inc. to address the amount of plastic that is hanging around.  Mr. Moloney should go back and have a rethink of what he has said to us.  I will follow up on the tonnage that was taken out of the country by the private sector and for which the IFFPG was paid by the industry.  I know everything about competition.  Are our guests saying to me that the IFFPG should be the only entity in this country with a monopoly, that it should get a subsidy and forget about the private people?</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Moloney and his board of directors to go back and have a rethink about where they are going.  It is fine if the IFFPG gave money back but at the end of the day, the farmer is still paying.

I think that was the scheme to which the Deputy referred.  We do not offer a deposit and refund scheme and we never have.  In our system, companies that put products on the market pay a recycling levy and that is how they meet their obligations.</p> <p>  We are a self-funding and not-for-profit body.  We generate what we need to operate and must also have an appropriate reserve.  As mentioned, many times in the past when we have found ourselves in a position of having more money than we needed in reserve, we made significant charge reductions to members and farmers.  That is something we hope to do in the future.</p> <p>  The Deputy talked about what it is costing the farmer.  The average farmer pays &euro;35 at our bring centres.  That farmer has also paid a levy of perhaps &euro;30, which has probably been passed down the supply chain.  We are talking about something in the region of &euro;60 or &euro;65 and the farmer is getting a good service for that price.  That is not only my opinion.  The results every year support that.  Over 40,000 farmers used our service last year and we collected 34,000 tonnes of material, the equivalent of 17 million silage bales and an 80% recycling level.  That does not suggest to me that farmers feel shafted or unhappy with the service.</p></speech>

Farmers typically come out on a two, three or four-year cycle.  They do not come out every year.  The Deputy will also be aware that many of those farmers with herd numbers are not necessarily wintering cattle, or they are wintering such small numbers of cattle that they are only generating minimal amounts of plastic.  The majority of livestock farmers in this country use our service.</p></speech>

That is only proper.  Mr. Moloney also said that with some of those profits, the group reduced the levy and I understand that.  However, farmers did not get a rebate, even though they were promised one.  Can Mr. Moloney answer that for me?  If a deal is made and farmers are supposed to get a rebate but do not get one, it does not look credible.  Farmers have not been saying that to me but, to be honest, it is not very credible if farmers who go by the rules and gather up the plastic that is then taken away do not get the rebate they are supposed to get.  What is the explanation for that?</p></speech>

Companies that are self-complying, of which there are currently none, would be offered a deposit and refund scheme.  Our scheme does not fund itself that way.  We never offered a rebate.  We charged the levy, initially, and then charged the levy and a collection charge.  We introduced a rate-based collection charge to try to improve the quality of the plastic coming in to us.  In good times, we have given significant price reductions to farmers.  As I said, in the early part of this decade, the price went down from &euro;70 to &euro;24 per tonne for farmers over a two or three-year period.  If we can get ourselves into a better financial position in the future, we will be happy to do something similar.</p></speech>

The group is licensed by the Department and the approval of that licence is renewed every five years.  Is it a formality or is it an advertised, open tender.  Could I decide I wanted to take on the role and submit a tender or is it a formality whereby the group and the Department sit down informally, or whatever, every five years and go through the contract?  Is there a guaranteed roll-over or is there a competitive side to it?  Can anybody else come in and apply for that licence?</p> <p>  With that in mind, and given the IFFPG was established in 1998 and, it has had four renewals of its licence.

The regulations are very clear for anybody who looks at them that anyone can apply at any time.  We are the approved body and, therefore, must go officially for reapproval every five years.  As I said earlier, last year was the most recent time we did that.  It is a very extensive process that took six months.  We submitted a detailed application to the Department in terms of our operational, financial and corporate governance performance over the past five years.  We had to map out the coming five years under the same headings and consider how we are going to perform.  It is an extensive process.</p> <p>  Some of the changes are worth mentioning.  I have been with the IFFPG for 13 years.  When I started, the recycling target was 50% and it has gone to 70% over that period of time.  The name of the game is to increase the recycling level.  We are here to provide a comprehensive service to farmers to recycle as much as possible and do it all within the context of good financial well-being and corporate governance.</p></speech>

I welcome our guests and thank them for their contributions.  I do not have a question but wish to make an observation.  What the witnesses are doing is a very good example of the circular economy in practice.  It is an industry-led initiative and the fact that they are achieving 80% recycling is a testament to their hard work.  We have come a long way from the situation some years ago when plastic littering the countryside was the bane of rural Ireland.  I commend the witnesses on that.  The line of questioning from some of my colleagues suggesting that the IFFPG should be required to bail out private contractors who have taken a commercial decision to get into this area and for whom it has not worked out, is absolutely absurd.  I am quite satisfied with Mr. Moloney's answers.  He has been very thorough and comprehensive and has dealt very clearly with what could be called an interrogation.  I certainly do not agree with that line of questioning.  What the IFFPG is doing is very good, more power to it and I would urge the witnesses to keep it going.  The group should strive to reach 100%.  Well done to Mr. Moloney and Mr. Dunne, the chairperson, and keep it up.</p></speech>

I had hoped to be here earlier.  I thank our guests for being here and I look forward to reading the transcript of the meeting.  I would make a general point that may be surprising to outsiders.  I have been struck by the number of people I have spoken to in the past year who said that they paid the levy for silage covers and wrap at the point of purchase on the understanding that the collection of same would be facilitated for free.  When did that concept change?  Is there something we can do here?  Deputy Leddin spoke about the scourge of plastic being left in the countryside in the past but I must say that in some parts of the country, I am beginning to see that again.  It is really important that whatever we do, we ensure that we do not see waste plastic polluting the environment, entering watercourses and so on.  I thank the Chairman for facilitating me.</p></speech>

It is a service that is working very well for farmers.  I rang around and spoke to members of the environment committee of the IFA and nobody is aware of plastic in the yards.  The way the service is structured allows for consistency.  It is very evident, having listened to other witnesses earlier, that we are dealing with a very volatile market which has only been exacerbated by Covid.  Having stability there and assuring farmers that a consistent service is available is very important.  As Mr. Moloney outlined, it is a not-for-profit service.  The collection charge covers the additional and increasing costs of the service.  It is not a double charge but is designed to cover the cost of collection.  As Mr. Moloney pointed out, it is a difficult market and it is not a high-value product.</p> <p>  From the farmer's perspective, it is important to know that the bring centres are there and that there is the opportunity to avail of collection.  While it may not happen every year, when farmers do a clear-out it is very important that the service is there for them.</p></speech>

We have had a very good exchange of views.  I wish to acknowledge the fact that the IFFPG is doing a very efficient job in collecting plastic throughout the country.  I am a farmer and have seen the collection points.  I know that the service operates very efficiently in my county.  Nevertheless, there is a problem.  We can argue about the exact amounts involved but at a conservative estimate, 30% of the plastic used on farms is lying in stockpiles in the yards of independent operators.  Depending on how much is imported, the figure could be higher than 30%.  That is an environmental concern.  Farmers have paid a levy on the plastic and have paid for it to be collected but now it is lying in yards.  I am not saying it is the responsibility of the IFFPG to collect that plastic but it has collected a levy on a proportion of it.  Farmers have played their part and we do not want the plastic on which they have paid a levy to cause environmental problems.  They have paid for it to be collected in the vast majority of cases but there is a significant amount of it lying around.  We know that county councils are getting worried about it and issues are arising.</p> <p>  This is an issue that must be resolved.  Plastic cannot be allowed to cause any environmental issues given that the primary producer has stuck to his or her part of the bargain, paid the levy and paid for it to be collected.  If the market for plastic improves, the problem will probably resolve itself but, as legislators, we cannot wait around in the hope that the plastic market improves.  Legislation is on the Statute Book to protect the Irish environment from pollution arising from farm plastic and it would be an absolute disaster if stockpiling of same caused issues that are completely outside the control of farmers.</p> <p>  I again thank the witnesses and fully acknowledge the role the IFFPG is playing in the environmental control of plastic waste.  We will suspend now and resume in private session on MS Teams at 5.50 p.m.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for appearing before us to share their expertise.</p> <p>  I remind those attending of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if any statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that any such direction be complied with.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as do witnesses who are physically present in the building.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex.  I ask that all members, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House complex.</p> <p>  For the information of people watching proceedings online, Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely and only I, as Chair, and staff who are essential to the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  Due to these unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask that everyone bear with us should any technical problems arise.</p></speech>

Ireland is a global hotspot for peatlands, with over 20% of the national territory covered by peatland or peat soils.  Peatlands are valuable ecosystems that form a significant part of the Irish sociocultural landscape.  Healthy peatlands are wetlands, characterised by complex interactions between three main factors, namely, water, biodiversity and peat.  Tweak one of these components and we effect change in the living system, making them more vulnerable to natural hazards and climate change at the same time.<br/><br/>There are four main types of peatland in Ireland.  These are raised bogs, mountain bogs, lowland blanket bogs and fens.  Each has characteristic features that arise from local climate and geography.  Understanding their past and how they have been used and changed through our activities is key to their restoration and their future.<br/><br/>Healthy peatlands deliver an array of services to people, including control of water flows, water purification, climate regulation and biodiversity.  It is the complex web of relationships between water, biodiversity and peat that creates the peatland, maintains it and allows the peatland to store vast<i></i>volumes of carbon while also acting as a sink for carbon dioxide.  Peatlands have been regulating our climate for millennia and although globally peatlands cover only 3% of the Earth&rsquo;s land surface, they store about double the amount of carbon as is stored in all forests, which cover a ten times greater area.<br/><br/>Healthy peatlands are therefore, without a doubt, incredibly important for our well-being.  Changing the water regime by draining, utilising peatlands for timber crops or wind farms or digging out the valuable carbon stock will change the peatland.  Our activities have already changed peatlands.  The truth is that few pockets of healthy peatlands remain in Ireland, functioning as they should.  Peatlands have been changed into sources of carbon dioxide rather than valuable carbon stores and sinks.<br/><br/>Over a quarter of the total area of peatland in Ireland has been drained for grassland and approximately one third has been developed for forestry, with a significant portion of the raised bogs converted to industrial extraction.  The remainder comprises commonages and turbary areas.  Most of these areas are today acting as sources of carbon dioxide, as well as contributing to poor water quality and loss of biodiversity.  The desolate and barren industrial bogscapes of the midlands, the devastating bog slides in Leitrim, Donegal and Kerry in 2020 and the recent fires in Killarney are all legacies of our neglect of these vulnerable ecosystems and are set to continue unless we take action.  Restoration, therefore, is essential in order to stabilise peatlands, reverse degradation and bring peatlands back to healthy status.<br/><br/>Every peatland is different and successful restoration requires an understanding at site and catchment level.  Passive rewilding is not an option here and active restoration measures are required.  The key measures bring us back to our water, biodiversity and peat equation and must be tailored for each site.  Above all, rewetting is critical to get peatland plants back in place and reduce peat breakdown.  Peat loss equates to carbon loss.  Once initial restoration has been carried out, time and aftercare, or a watchful eye, are necessary.<br/><br/>Key to all these steps is people.  I mentioned in my opening lines that peatlands are a significant Irish sociocultural landscape.  Real, genuine and long-term engagement is required from and with landowners and adjoining neighbours, and a switch towards community-led restoration can ensure long-term success.<br/><br/>In terms of Irish experience, seminal work was initiated by Dutch researchers in the 1980s in partnership with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, and since that time, the NPWS, Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na have carried out targeted site level works with plenty of scope to increase in that area.  In recent years, European Innovation Partnership projects such as the hen harrier and pearl mussel projects have been breaking new ground, engaging farming communities to alleviate pressures and encourage restorative measures.  Non-governmental organisations such as BirdWatch Ireland and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, along with community groups across Ireland, are leading the charge in conserving and restoring peatlands, as evidenced by the increasing membership of the community wetlands forum.<br/><br/>Given the extent of peatlands in Ireland, their current widespread degradation and their significant role in climate regulation, peatland restoration is one of a number of nature-based solutions, if not the number one such solution, to the biodiversity and climate crises in Ireland.  In 2021, the dawn of the UN decade on restoration, we must embrace the potential of our peatlands for what they can naturally deliver.  Peatlands in the Irish landscape are unbounded and there are rarely fences or gates around them.  Equally, peatlands are multisectoral, with policies for agriculture, climate, energy, the environment, forestry, nature and water management affecting their use.  We need a multisectoral approach and instead of draining, digging and planting, we must change our perspectives to enact restoration solutions, creating the policy and economic structure to support this.<br/><br/>A national peatlands unit is required to inform, co-ordinate and execute an action plan to support sustainable peatlands for the people who rely on them and look after them, and equally for water, biodiversity and climate.  Peatlands take time to heal but inaction is not an option.  We must simply roll up our sleeves and work together across sectors to do it.  I thank the committee for its time and look forward to taking questions from members.</p></speech>

ProSilva Ireland is an all-Ireland organisation supporting the use of alternative forest management systems through the clear-fell system.  These alternative systems, which are generally called continuous cover forestry, CCF, do not clear-fell the forests but instead involve thinning trees periodically while allowing the retained forest to grow and develop.  ProSilva Ireland is part of a wider European network of ProSilva organisations in 27 countries.  We have a diverse and dynamic membership of foresters, forest owners, contractors, ecologists, wood scientists, artists and others.</p> <p>  Well-managed forests can serve many functions.  They can produce timber for domestic and industrial use, be places of recreation while enhancing our landscape, protect and clean our water while helping prevent flooding, stabilise and improve our soils, harbour and enrich biodiversity, sequester carbon, shelter farms and be places of inspiration, wonder and calm.  Successive forestry programmes and forestry practice in Ireland have concentrated on the timber production function.  This has resulted in the successful establishment of a vibrant timber processing sector and vital job creation in rural communities.  The clear-fell system has been used to produce timber efficiently to feed this industry.</p> <p>  This management system struggles, however, to deliver satisfactorily the other services that society requires from forests, and this is at the heart of recent protests and anti-forestry feeling in places such as County Leitrim.  It is clear that society wants more from Irish forests in the form of the aforementioned multiple benefits.  The difficulty is that all these other non-timber products and services to which I referred are rarely, if ever, monetised, and a situation has evolved in Ireland whereby the provision of these services is expected to be paid for entirely by the revenues from the sale of timber.  In ProSilva Ireland, we believe that CCF will deliver these multiple benefits in a sustainable way that will rebuild a forest culture, be profitable and, at the same time, deliver a range of environmental services.  We know from experience, from CCF forests managed in Ireland and more so from those under longer term CCF management in Europe, that it is possible to sustain commercial timber production while delivering the multiple benefits.</p> <p>  The committee's role is to consider action on climate change and what measures can be adopted to mitigate this very serious issue.  There is particular concern that Ireland's biodiversity, which has been under increasing pressure for many decades, should not come under further pressure as a result of climate action measures.  Well-managed forests are excellent carbon sinks and we are paying the price, both globally and nationally, for both current and historical deforestation.  How we manage our forests also has a significant effect on the efficiency of carbon sequestration and on how they support biodiversity.</p> <p>  CCF is an efficient means of optimising carbon storage in forests as it avoids the large-scale release of soil carbon and the loss of biodiversity that occurs when plantations are clear-felled.  In cool, moist, temperate climates like ours, greater than 70% of forest carbon is held in forest soils, most of it in biota, or living carbon, which is dependent on the presence of the overhead forest to sustain itself.  This underground biodiversity is very important for the productivity of our soils.  CCF provides permanent forest habitats, which keep carbon locked in the forest, including the all-important forest soil carbon.  CCF also produces a higher percentage of high-quality and long-life timber products in which sequestered carbon is locked over a longer timeframe, meaning that less timber goes into short-term products such as pulp and pallet-manufacturing and more goes into long-term construction.  We can, therefore, supply the needs of our very important, well-established industry while locking up carbon for longer and delivering the other forest functions.  CCF also results in more biodiverse, resilient forests, with lower biotic and abiotic risks.</p> <p>  We need forests now more than ever.  They have a very significant role to play in climate change mitigation, but to do this they must be resilient themselves.  There is no point in us planting, growing and managing forests that are themselves vulnerable to climate change.  If our forests are blown down in strong winds, burned up in fires, stressed from drought or infested by disease such as ash dieback, they will be unable to perform their carbon sequestration function.</p> <p>  The good news is that forests can be resilient, and this comes through diversity of species and structure.  The richness of forest biodiversity is the strength that makes forests resilient.  CCF management seeks to create such conditions through maintaining the forest habitat in order that it will evolve slowly over time, accumulating carbon and enriching biodiversity.  We believe that new planting must be robustly mixed with greater utilisation of diverse conifers and native species and that we should cease planting monocultures, the predominance of which we are deeply concerned about.  Even aged monocultural plantations are not good at delivering the wider long-term social and environmental benefits of forestry.  Concerns about the sustainability of monocultures are not new, and currently, in central Europe, bark beetles are destroying large areas of monocultural spruce plantations that are suffering from drought stress.  In Ireland, ash dieback is devastating monocultural ash plantations.</p> <p>  If we want to diversify our forests and make them more resilient, thereby improving their capacity for climate mitigation and biodiversity, we need also to discuss the problem of invasive deer in Ireland.  In many parts of the country, invasive non-native deer are now at such high densities that they have a very negative effect on the sustainability and resilience of forests and on their biodiversity value.  Invasive sika and fallow deer both preferentially browse young broadleaved and diverse conifer species.  For CCF and native woodland practitioners, this is the single greatest constraint in creating diverse and resilient forests.  One of the reasons Sitka spruce is still the predominant commercial species planted is that it is the only one that can find its way through the deer pressure.  All other species require expensive protection over a sustained period using fencing and tubes.  If we can resolve this issue, the groundwork will be laid for nature to get back on track and solve many of the other, bigger issues with biodiversity and carbon sequestration.</p> <p>  We also need to address the legacy issues in Irish forestry and acknowledge that, although well intended, some forests were located in places they should not have been, resulting in significant carbon losses from blanket and raised peats and considerable habitat loss.  We must accept that these mistakes of the past must be rectified and the correct way to do this is not by trying to maintain them as productive or necessarily as any kind of forest but instead helping to restore the hydrological function of these areas using techniques such as Ms Farrell outlined.  This would yield a much better result in terms of both carbon sequestration and biodiversity restoration.  Similarly, we need to be careful that today's forestry practices do not generate more legacy issues for the future, and in this regard, selecting the correct tree in the correct place, without recourse to site modification through drainage, is a good starting point.</p> <p>  It is important that discussions on Irish forestry are balanced, and I say this in the light of a very negative narrative regarding forestry in recent times.  While mistakes have been made in forestry that have been negative for biodiversity, there are also many good stories and the overall picture is not all bad.  We hear much about habitat loss but in many cases this is better described as habitat change.  Just as there are examples of species under threat, such as the hen harrier, curlew, merlin and others, there are many examples of species that have responded positively to increased forest cover, such as the pine marten, red squirrel, red kite, great spotted woodpecker, buzzard, jay, long-tail tit and chaffinch.  There is a long list of species with upward population trajectories.  It is implicit in any policy that seeks to increase forest cover from the low level in Ireland that this must come with a certain degree of habitat change.</p> <p>  Similarly, despite criticisms, our forests have never been more popular for recreation and well-being.  The connection between people and forests, through both their work and recreation, was lost in Ireland, and while it is recovering, the restoration of a forest culture will happen slowly over time.  We believe the CCF approach will greatly assist in this regard, as it is difficult for communities to develop a sense of connection with forests that are impenetrable for half a rotation and then cut down relatively soon after they have become accessible.  Permanent forests, managed under CCF, offer a much greater opportunity in this regard.</p> <p>  We have to manage expectations of what is possible.  Forests, by their nature, take time to plan, grow and transform.  Similarly, if we want to achieve a cultural change in Irish forestry, this will also take time and investment.  No magic wand can be waved to transform Irish forests overnight.  It will take long-term planning, with a refocusing of forest policy and programmes.  Forestry has an important role to play in the fight against climate change, but we must ensure our forests are well designed, well managed and resilient if this role is to be optimised.  CCF offers a means to achieve this whereby biodiversity can be a winner as well.</p></speech>

Species like the curlew, lapwing and the now extinct bittern are mentioned in our songs, poems, prose and folklore.  Birds adorn important texts like the Book of Kells.  Whether in the garden, along the coast or in the countryside, the presence and songs of birds have given people great joy and respite during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Wild birds are also indicators of the health of the environment, and many of our regularly occurring species are monitored to detect changes in populations and in the world around us.</p> <p>  In April 2021, BirdWatch Ireland and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in Northern Ireland jointly published Birds of Conservation Concern in Ireland 2020-2026, our fourth assessment since 1999 of what is commonly known as the BoCCI list.  This is a quantitative assessment based on the most up-to-date information that is available from a range of studies.  Using a traffic light system, BoCCI indicates the conservation status of bird species on the island of Ireland by placing them on three lists - red, amber or green - indicating whether the species is of high, medium or low conservation concern.</p> <p>  The key message is that more birds than ever are now red-listed in Ireland, which is the highest status of concern for their population.  A total of 54 Irish bird species, or 26%, are now on the red list.  An additional 79 species, or 37%, are now on the amber list and 78 species are on the green list, meaning they are not currently at risk.  This means that 63% of Ireland&rsquo;s bird species are now in trouble, either in Ireland or in other parts of their range, and about a quarter of all our birds are suffering a decline here in Ireland.  Not only are some declining species becoming more threatened but even recently common species are declining too.</p> <p>  The main groups of birds of concern are those of wetlands, farmland and our marine environment.  Ireland is an important wintering area for migratory water birds that breed at Arctic latitudes and migrate southwards using our estuaries, coastal bays, rivers and lakes as staging posts or wintering areas.  We used to host well over 1 million water birds during winter but this number has decreased by a shocking 40% since the mid-1990s.</p> <p>  Since Ireland has been farmed for millennia, many bird species have found a niche in Irish farmland, where they breed, over-winter and stop off on migration.  In 1999, 11 farmland birds of meadows, arable, pasture and upland habitats were on the red list.  Today, one of these birds, the corn bunting, which is an arable specialist, has become extinct and a further eight new species have been added from across all farmed habitats, indicating a continued marked decline in the quantity and quality of these important areas for biodiversity in the past 20 years.  Shockingly, the kestrel and snipe were until recently widespread on farmland and are now on the red list.  The kestrel has suffered a 28% decline in its breeding population between 2006 and 2016 and the snipe has declined by over 50% in the past 25 years.  Ireland will possibly be the first European country to lose the iconic curlew as a breeding species.</p> <p>  With regard to seabirds, three species were added to the most recent red list, the kittiwake, razorbill and much-loved puffin.  Since the departure of the UK from the EU, Ireland is the most important member state for four of the red-listed seabirds.</p> <p>  Ireland is losing its diversity and abundance of bird species.  We are at a tipping point and we are deeply concerned about what the next BoCCI will look like if concerted action is not taken now to safeguard our wild birds.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.218" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Oonagh Duggan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2021051800002#E00300"><p>I will go over some of the causes and what needs to be done.  Climate change is playing a part in the decline of some species but the loss of and degradation of habitats, pollution, predation of nests and chicks, and disturbance caused by human activities are the most significant reasons for decline.  Specifically, the stepped-up and continued intensification of agriculture, afforestation on high nature value farmland, inadequate protection of hedgerows, peatlands and other habitats, overfishing and unmanaged recreation are all taking a toll.  On top of this, the failure to enforce environmental laws, inadequate environmental assessment of projects and plans, and poor mitigation measures are, on their own and cumulatively, leading to this poor outcome for wild birds and associated biodiversity.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, sectoral policies and plans are undermining policies and legal obligations to protect nature.  In addition, chronic underfunding of the National Parks and Wildlife Service means this creates significant challenges for us to be able to continue to protect biodiversity as the response is inadequate.  Under EU and national law, all wild birds are protected but Ireland is failing to protect them and the habitats they need.</p> <p>  Protecting and restoring biodiversity must be at the heart of all Government land use policies and decisions.  Failure to halt losses and reverse trends will mean further breaches of international legal obligations.  It will also hamper our ability to mitigate and adapt to climate change.</p> <p>  We must meet our target to cut emissions by 51% by 2030 and every sector must play its part.  In addition, landscape-scale restoration of habitats to complement absolute emissions cuts is critical.  Nature-based solutions for climate action, some of which the meeting has already heard about, will help wild birds but preventing catastrophic decline and extinctions will require a significant, co-ordinated and sustained effort of targeted and resourced measures.  These include supporting high nature value farming and pulling back on the intensification of agriculture; providing generous agri-environment schemes in the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, to support farmers to farm with nature; a new forestry model that protects the biodiversity we have; resourced species recovery plans, enforcement of environmental legislation; urgent designation of new marine protected areas; and the sensitive deployment of renewables both onshore and offshore.</p> <p>  BirdWatch Ireland is playing its part through the restoration of peatlands in counties Donegal and Sligo, working directly with farmers in counties Galway and Leitrim to save the curlew and a range of other species, as well as other survey, monitoring, conservation and awareness-raising projects.</p> <p>  The tide of public opinion has turned as declines in environmental quality become more obvious.  We must listen to the science and act to protect our valuable heritage so that our countryside and coast does not go quiet for the lack of birds.</p></speech>

This meeting is confined to a maximum of two hours.  I propose that each member be given two minutes to address questions to the witnesses to ensure that all members have an opportunity to pose questions.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I have a question for Dr. Farrell on peat-based soils that are currently used for agriculture.  What is the appropriate approach to take to these lands?  Does she have examples of good practice where farmers have maintained farm incomes while simultaneously restoring these peatlands?</p></speech>

This is an area that is still evolving.  The science is telling us that draining peat soils for agriculture leads to emissions in carbon dioxide and also nitrous oxide.  There are some new initiatives.  New European Innovation Partnership, EIP, projects are looking at addressing this issue.</p><p>The most recent cutting-edge project is the FarmPEAT project, which is being led by the same team who set up the pearl mussel project.  This is an evolving and probably very sensitive space.  These are brand new innovations to try to reduce emissions from these areas and they require a sea change in the approach of farmers.  We have to try out this approach, set up different trials to see what we can do and what savings can be made through raising the water level.  We are not on our own because this has been trialled in other countries.  Those trials are probably the best examples we can draw on.  The case scenarios are learnings from Germany, which is trying to promote raising the water level in drained peatlands and implement what are called wet farming practices.  It is a matter of trying to find ways we can farm these areas in a manner that farmers would not lose income, could continue to farm these areas, albeit in a more sustainable way, and would not be penalised.  It is about incentivising that.</p><p> This is very much an evolving space that requires real engagement with farmers.  In my experience, such engagement is key as farmers will tell us what will work on their land.  Just as every bog is different, every field is also different.  It must be based on real trials on the ground and learning from our colleagues in Germany and the Netherlands who are also faced with these issues and high levels of emissions.  I hope that answers the Chairman's question.</p></speech>

The Greifswald wetlands group in Germany has done considerable work.  It is working with landowners in the area.  The peatlands there are somewhat different from here in that they are mainly fen areas.  Solutions are tailored for the area and Germany is also working to drive policy changes through the EU Common Agricultural Policy to support wet farming practices.

As the Chairman said, there was great depth to them.  Following on from Dr. Farrell&rsquo;s statement that this is an evolving situation, much of what we are attempting to do is at the cutting edge of our understanding of systems, their capacity to capture carbon, the impacts on diversity and the level of interactions.  When discussing any ecological system, action in one area may have an impact one could never envisage in another area.  We are learning a great deal as we go.  Do we have enough data and information and is enough money being put into research on these issues?  This is a question for the four witnesses.  Are we putting enough money into research without seeking an output from it?  Sometimes when we put money into research, it is for a specific purpose but sometimes we have to do it for the sake of research to get the results we need.  Do we have those data?</p> <p>  Dr. Farrell mentioned that a quarter of our peatlands are now grassland.  What percentage of our natural peatlands are in their natural state or have been remediated?  What proportion is in public ownership, which would make it easier to address than dealing with land owned by private individuals?</p> <p>  On forestry, what is the percentage of clear-felling that is applied across the State?  What percentage would come under the continuous forestry model Mr. Purser referenced?</p> <p>  I read recently that BirdWatch Ireland had updated the red list, which now includes 54 species, an increase of 23.  I find it baffling, and this does not only relate to bird species, that scientists identify particular species that could potentially become extinct or endangered and we do not immediately put an action plan in place to deal with that.  They go on the red list and then we forget them until they disappear.  Would an action plan be useful or is it an approach we should be taking?</p></speech>

I ask Mr. Purser to respond first this time.</p></speech>

She asked about research into the delivery of new technology and the way we think and manage our land resources, in my case the forest resource.  There have been a number of research projects and there is a research project under way on continuous cover forestry in Ireland.  There is also research on diversification of forest management and integration of the delivery of multiple resources.</p> <p>  As to whether there is enough research, that is a difficult question to answer.  Forest research is different in nature from much laboratory-type research because what is needed is long-term research.  As the Deputy can imagine, one does not get results from forestry overnight or in one year or even in two years.  Sometimes the results are 20 years down the line before one can draw conclusions from a research study.  What is important is that long-term research projects are funded.  That is happening but we are at quite an early stage in the process in relation to continuous cover forestry in Ireland.</p> <p>  Regarding the percentages of land management of continuous cover forestry here, we do not have an exact figure.  ProSilva Ireland estimates that it is between 15,000 to 20,000 ha, approximately.  It is probably significantly more than that if we include areas that are not managed but would be categorised as not ever going to be clear-felled for different reasons, including access and so on.  I am talking about areas that are managed and owned by farmers, Coillte and private landowners who are seeking to manage their forest actively under continuous cover forestry management.  It is not a statistic that is recorded in the national forest inventory but it should be recorded.  I am doing the mathematics in my head but the total area of forestry in Ireland is about 770,000 ha, so CCF accounts for in and around 5% of that.</p></speech>

Dr. Donaghy is in Donegal and I am in County Wicklow so we are poles apart.  I thank the Deputy for her questions.  There is a need for much more research, especially surveying and monitoring, as well as conservation research on wild birds in general.  Unfortunately, this sector was underfunded for a long time but things have picked up in the past year, which is great.</p><p> As regards what happens when a bird is added to the red list, the critical question is taking the action to ensure that the species can be turned around.  It requires a co-ordinated approach among a range of Departments.  For a curlew, for example, that would relate to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications in respect of renewable energy.  Many cross-cutting actions would need to be implemented by all Departments.  Where we see things falling down is the lack of implementation and also in the fact that policies are still not in line with retaining our biodiversity.  It is really hard to ensure that species action plans are infiltrated or integrated completely into these policies.  With regard to the hen harrier, for example, the hen harrier European innovation programme has been a great programme.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine was very brave in taking on all the European innovation partnerships, EIPs.  They were a new departure for the Department and they are excellent projects for working with people on the ground to take action.  However, we are still waiting for a hen harrier threat response plan.  We hope to see that soon from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  There is a multitude of measures that can be taken to save species when they get on the red list.  There is just a need for the will, funding and a co-ordinated approach to get there.</p></speech>

On the question about research on peatlands and systems in general, the current research I am involved in is about mapping out the data gaps in terms of assessing ecosystems.  The first gap is that we do not have a national peatland ecosystem map.  We have indicators of where peatlands might be.  The second gap is that we do not even know what depth of peat we have across our peatlands.  In the 1940s and 1950s there were peatland research centres across Ireland because value was seen in understanding our peatlands, what they were doing and how we could use them to the best effect.  For us to focus our research, time and energy now, it would be on what the services are, what values and benefits we can receive from restoring our peatlands, how they work and how we can restore the peatland system to work with freshwater systems, and also in line with all the work Mr. Purser spoke about in terms of restoring post forestry.<br/><br/>We would know nothing without research.  In terms of its strategic alignment, it has been somewhat <i>ad hoc</i>to date and quite reliant on the interest of a few researchers in Ireland, who really lack support and have to compete for grants as they arise.  From a peatland perspective, given their role in 20% of the landscape, the water benefits and all the things relating to water quality and the provision of water and supporting our biodiversity targets, we must have a more strategic and holistic view.</p></speech>

I will launch straight into my questions.  I have specific questions for each witness, and I will start with Dr. Farrell.  Her opening statement was quite strong.  She said that peat and bog restoration could be the number one tool in the battle against climate change.  I wish to delve into that a little further.  Regarding timelines for rewetting bogs, what length of time does it take from beginning the process of rewetting a bog to getting a bog that is starting to perform and capture carbon and starting to resurge biodiversity?</p> <p>  Second, we have recently seen the news that cranes may potentially breed in a bog in County Offaly.  I remember driving all the way to Wexford from west Cork to see my first crane in Tacumshin.  With that reintroduction of wildlife, is there a socioeconomic potential benefit from the expansion of bogs and the biodiversity in nature that will flourish there?  Have any studies been done of the potential economic value of tourism where there is a healthy bog?</p> <p>  My final question relates to horticultural peat.  It is something we have to discuss.  There is demand for horticultural peat and there is a shortage of it.  The alternative that has been looked at is the import of horticultural peat, which one would imagine would leave quite a large carbon footprint.  Could Dr. Farrell discuss that debate on what the right approach is for the provision of horticultural peat?</p> <p>  I have a brief question for Mr. Purser regarding monoculture plantations such as Sitka plantations.  Could he comment on the carbon sequestration value of monoculture plantations?  Is there any sequestration value compared with a mixed woodland?  Will he comment on the biodiversity value of mixed woodland compared with the biodiversity value of, perhaps, a Sitka plantation.  In addition-----</p></speech>

I assume this is due to drainage of wetland, loss of wetland and loss of habitat, as one of the issues.  She spoke about proper agri-environment schemes and what a new green deal would look like.  Can she give examples of agri-environment schemes or farming for nature or farming for biodiversity schemes which have successfully resulted in an increase in biodiversity, an increase in bird species, successfully capturing carbon and also helping to keep money in farmers' pockets?</p> <p>  There are so many more questions and it is very difficult to get them into two minutes.

Yes, it has largely been due to habitat loss and degradation, that is, damage to peatlands, loss of wetlands and degradation and fragmentation of habitats.  That in turn has led to a serious increase in the levels of predation.  That is not just for snipe but for all the ground nesting birds, including curlew and lapwing, but particularly snipe.  Predation by general predators, crows and foxes, in particular, has a very serious impact on the ability of these birds to produce young every year.  The reason we are seeing sustained declines is failure at the nesting chick stage in general.  That is on top of what is happening to their habitats.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about agri-environment schemes as well and if we have any examples of the successful implementation of schemes.  Obviously, successive agri-environment schemes in Ireland have become more targeted at biodiversity.  The green, low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, for example, has increased its suite of priorities for adoption, and that is welcome.  We all have mentioned the EIPs.  For many reasons that is the route we would want to see - agri-environment payments being delivered in a much more local and targeted level where a suite of biodiversity is encapsulated in one scheme.</p><p>The Shannon callows agri-environment project was a precursor to the current draft of the EIP.  The restoration of farm bird populations is not something that can happen in the short term.  There are not many examples of the implementation of agri-environment schemes resulting in increases in populations in a relatively short time because it takes much longer to restore these bird populations.</p></speech>

Rewetting studies undertaken to date have shown we can reduce the carbon emissions.  It will take time for these sites to revert to being carbon sinks.  Reducing emissions is better than allowing things to just happen anyway.  In the meantime, let us look at all the other benefits and co-benefits that go along with that rewetting in respect of water and biodiversity.</p> <p>  That brings me to the question regarding cranes.  This is a fantastic development.  All along the Shannon corridor the habitat is evolving and emerging for this iconic species.  When I was working in Bord na M&oacute;na on restoration, there was great engagement and excitement from the Golden Eagle Trust and BirdWatch Ireland regarding the potential for all these Shannon bogs to become a hotspot for ecotourism.  That prospect was discussed at the time and Bord na M&oacute;na was interested.  Looking right along that Shannon corridor, it is a wetlands wilderness park, as John Feehan described it so eloquently 20 years ago.  These ideas have been around for some time but they must be explored seriously because these are the types of initiatives that create sustainable jobs for local people.  Large-scale projects such as wind farms do not really sustain local populations and communities whereas ecotourism projects would.  </p> <p>  On the horticultural issue, we do not have an alternative to peat at this time.  We must find whatever is going to replace peat.  I am aware that Bord na M&oacute;na had some great trials on developing alternatives.  That must be brought back on to the research agenda because we cannot continue to use peat.  It just makes no sense, so we must research the alternatives.</p></speech>

We cannot ignore that Sitka spruce is far and away the most productive forest species in Ireland.  It is incredibly efficient at sequestering carbon because of its growth rates.  The difficulty we have with Sitka spruce is not with the species itself but the management of it.  Growing it monoculturally causes difficulties for biodiversity and resilience, which is a point I will come back to.  The forestry management system which clear-fells trees like a crop means that 50% of the resulting volume does not go into long-term carbon storage, and is instead turned into sawdust, sawmill waste, etc.  Some of that is used to substitute for other fuels in drying and heating, so it has its benefits from a carbon perspective but it is not going into long-term carbon sequestration.<br/><br/>After clear-felling there is a release of soil carbon because much of the carbon is held in the forest soil.  This is highly dependent on the soil type.  Mineral soils are less carbon-emitting than more organic soils.  It is the forest management type which is important.  Even though planting a new monocultural forest of Sitka spruce is incredibly efficient at locking up carbon for the duration of the rotation, the problem is what happens at the end.<br/><br/>The position is similar with regard to biodiversity.  Removing the forest sets back all the biodiversity gains which were slowly achieved in that forest over time.  Biodiversity does adapt.  Thinning a forest increases biodiversity levels.  Continuous coverage forestry carries that process on <i>ad infinitum</i>, effectively.  Therefore, instead of removing the forest and having to start again - biodiversity has to start again after a carbon release - the CCF approach allows species to adapt slowly.  There is gradual enrichment and accumulation of carbon, and natural processes come into play.  CCF therefore has economic and climate benefits.  <br/><br/>Returning to the monocultural aspect and biodiversity, if we plant these forests as monocultures, there is a major risk factor involved.  We witnessed this in central Europe.  I do not know if members are aware of this but climate change is already having a devastating effect on European forests.  That is particularly the case with monocultural forests, which have been pushed outside their normal range because the timber production function has been prioritised.  Climate change has resulted in drought stress in those forests.  The bark beetle, a secondary pest, is destroying large areas of these forests right across central Europe, in Czechia, Germany, France, Belgium and Slovakia.  All those countries are suffering huge losses to the ravages of the bark beetle.  Once those-----</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy that we could do much more on this issue.  It is a very interesting subject, and I feel we are only scratching the surface here.  Before I bring in Senator Boylan, given the time constraints, I suggest that members prioritise questions to prevent the witnesses having to answer a whole string of questions in the time we have available.  Having said that, I recognise there is much to deal with.  If members wish to ask a series of questions, the committee will facilitate the witnesses in responding with written answers after the meeting, if they so wish.

I have no speeches, just questions.  I thank all our guest speakers for their excellent presentations.  My first set of questions is for Mr. Purser.  What are the greatest barriers to continuous cover forestry in Ireland?  Do we need a new forestry strategy, or are there legislative changes we could make to incentivise landowners to go in that direction rather than with a monoculture crop?</p> <p>  Did Mr. Purser say that continuous cover forestry is not included in the forestry inventory?</p><p>If that is the case, was CCF not included Ireland's National Accounting Plan 2021-2025, the report submitted to the European Commission in September 2020 which sets Ireland's forest reference level, FRL, for that period?  If the mitigation impact of CCF was accounted for, it would mean emissions from monoculture forestry are even higher?  I ask Mr. Purser to clarify that point.</p><p> In her opening statement, Dr. Farrell called for a national peatlands unit.  Where should such a unit sit?  We have seen the problems that arose with regard to the biodiversity centre, short-term contracts, who owns the data, workers' rights, etc.  Does Dr. Farrell believe the unit should sit within the Department or should it be in the National Parks and Wildlife Service?</p><p> That leads me to my final question, which is for all our witnesses.  What would they like to see emerge from the review of the National Parks and Wildlife Service?  Would they like it become a stand-alone agency with powers of enforcement?</p></speech>

In relation to the barriers to continuous cover forestry adoption in Ireland, the primary barrier is a cultural one.  For most of the foresters who have trained in Ireland and the institutions which promote forestry in Ireland, this is a new practice.  We are all learning.  Even those of us in ProSilva Ireland who have been at this for 20 years are still learning how to do this and introduce CCF in an economically sustainable way for forest owners.  This involves a major training requirement and cultural shift which is being well supported by the forest service in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It has a CCF grant scheme, which is being well received.  There are good examples of new entrants being mentored into the practice.</p> <p>  As I said in my introductory statement, the biggest constraint to the practice of CCF in Ireland is the unsustainable deer populations that we have.  CCF practice and any kind of diversification of our forestry sector with native species or diverse conifer species require them to get through an army of invasive deer which are rampant in our countryside.  This is hugely expensive to the Department because it pays grants to help us with this.  For me as a practitioner, the deer issue is the number one issue.</p> <p>  On the Senator's question on the national forestry inventory, I will have to check the position and revert to her in writing.</p></speech>

One of the models that has worked well and shines out for me is the EPA catchments unit.  It works right across different sectors.  It has great engagement with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and groups right across Ireland.  It is supporting initiatives such as the local authority waters programme, LAWPRO.  We need a model such as that which would engage with the geological side and the EU side, through the Department while also overlapping with climate.  It must have the ability to cross and break down silos.  That is the general model that I believe would work well.</p> <p>  On the National Parks and Wildlife Service, I think the answer was in Senator Boylan's question.  The NPWS needs to be a stand-alone body with powers of enforcement.  For me, the model is the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which has clear leadership and accountability, is well resourced, sets clear targets and smart objectives and has a network of supporting initiatives.  In the interests of finding a positive solution, there are some models that work well in Ireland and we need to look to those.</p></speech>

BirdWatch Ireland contributed to the review process and we look forward to its outcome.  We want to see some additional examples of how this type of agency or entity has worked well in other countries.  We are keeping an open mind on whether it should be an independent, stand-alone entity.  There will always be a master Department in charge of an agency and there will always be connections with that Department.  No entity is completely independent.</p> <p>  What is needed - we hope to see it in the review - are proposals for internal restructuring, building on the knowledge base of current staff and increasing staff.  It would be great if we could see what additional funding will be provided.  This has been the weak point for a long time.  We have not seen the NPWS operating as it could operate for many years.</p> <p>  We will have to wait and see what the review looks like but we are hopeful that it will lead to a budget proposal.  Everybody around this table will be looking at this.  We need to see support for implementing the findings of the review when they come before the committee.</p></speech>

This is an incredibly interesting discussion.</p> <p>  The 60% of the forest land in Ireland that is managed is likely to be a net emitter until 2025.  I ask the witnesses to comment on clear-felling.  As has been mentioned, much of the sequestration is in the soil.  How much of that could be potentially reduced by a thinning approach?  How much of the remaining 40% of afforested land and new managed forestry that is less than 30 years old could be converted to diverse forestry?  I am referring to forest that is already planted.  I was interested in what was said about bringing biodiversity back into currently afforested land by moving towards continuous cover and more broadleaf forest.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses comment on the practice of having a decorative flourish of broadleaf around the edge of forestry and the importance of having an integrated diversity within our forestry?  I am interested in hearing specifically how much of the emissions loss is due to clear-fell and how much could be done if we brought in a thinning mandate now for managed forest land.</p> <p>  Under the mandate for the protection of peatlands, only the finest specimens have been protected and in many cases, they have not been managed.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the management of existing special areas of conservation, SACs, on which cutting is still taking place, and the need to expand that network of both SACs and national heritage areas, NHAs.  What might be the ladder or trajectory for degraded bogs, from rewetting to rehabilitation and then habitat restoration.</p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to comment on our target of having 30% of land designated as protected areas in the context of biodiversity and climate benefits.  How much of our forestry and peatland could bring us towards that target?</p><p>My final question is for Birdwatch Ireland and I am happy to get a written answer if we run out of time.  Mention was made of inadequate protection of hedgerows and I ask the witnesses to comment on that as well as on the use of environmental impact assessment tools in the context of birds, water, habitat directives and so on.  Could they be used more?  They are used on Natura sites <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>birds but should they be used more generally?  I would also welcome comments from the witnesses on urban biodiversity and marine biodiversity in the context of bird life.</p></speech>

What we need to do is make a thorough assessment or inventory of what we have in terms of our peatlands.  We selected out the cream of the crop, as it were, back in the 1980s and 1990s but sadly we allowed their continued and ongoing degradation.  Some of those examples that we designated as SACs are of a lower quality than areas that exist outside of the SAC network.  We need to get back to assessing what is there and looking at the inventory but it is not just about conservation.  It is also about reducing the risk of devastating events such as bogslides, fires and so on.  We have to combine these conservation aims with reducing the risks relating to degraded peatlands.  A national inventory is required.</p> <p>  We must target areas that are hotspots for nature conservation and look after them but also those hotspots that are going to cause huge problems and lead to huge costs to the State in terms of water and carbon loss and potentially, the loss of human life at some point.  The important thing is to get them all back on a trajectory of recovery.  I have worked on degraded peatlands and often the ones that are outside the network can give back the most in terms of a minimal intervention.  The more degraded the system is, the easier it is to work with in some ways because one can start to push it back and get positive responses.  I would not be prejudiced against a peatland because it is not as good looking as the next.  They all have their role.  Each peatland has to be assessed at site level and catchment level and there is no easy way around that.  Doing that will make a hugely significant contribution.  It also overlaps with Mr. Purser's work in terms of the areas that should be restored under forestry and the areas that can remain under this continuous cover forestry, with added benefits for biodiversity.  They all need restoration and they can all contribute to that 30% target.</p></speech>

Carbon accounting is a very specialised subject and the answers will depend on a lot of different assumptions.  It is one of those subjects where one can get the answer one wants depending on what assumptions one makes.  I do not think it is my place to guess.  There are national experts in that field so I am not going to get into the figures on it.  What I will say, however, is that we can improve on our carbon sequestration figures in forestry by retention, thinning and diversification.  However, we must be realistic as I said previously because it is not possible in many cases to do this.  Often crops have gone too far, are too mature or have been grown too long without intervention and to intervene now would destabilise them and could cause massive windblown events, or similar.  In many cases, we are looking at felling, redesigning and replanting with a reverse mix and a reimagining of the future management.  That would be appropriate in many cases.</p> <p>  On the actual design, the Senator referred to using diverse species around the edges of plantations to hide or screen industrial or monocultural plantations.  Policy initiatives to date have allowed or encouraged this.  While we are pushing for greater levels of diverse planting, what happens is that a lot of it becomes compartmentalised so we end up with smaller monocultures.  All of the diverse species go into one field and all of the broadleafs go into another but the largest part is the commercial, monoculture spruce.  It is a diversification of sorts but it is not real.  It does not allow for future transformation of management to continuous cover forestry.  A redesign should involve the integration of species at planting stage.  We have submitted proposals to the forest service on that.</p></speech>

Ms Donaghy will respond to the other elements of that question.  There is no law to protect hedgerows.  They are protected by proxy under the Wildlife Act and by regulations relating to agriculture such as the environmental impact assessment, EIA, regulations relating to restructuring of land holdings, where linear features in the landscape are protected.  However, the thresholds when it comes to those EIAs are really high.  A landowner does not have to seek EIA screening from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine until a certain threshold is met so we do see quite an amount of hedgerows falling through the cracks in those regulations.  We are calling for a bespoke law to protect hedgerows.  Under the Wildlife Act, restrictions aimed at protecting breeding birds mean that there is no cutting or burning of vegetation allowed between 1 March and 31 August.  Quite a number of bird species use hedgerows which is where the protection comes into play.  They are so important in the landscape and we would like to see a law protecting hedgerows in their own right, especially some of the older hedgerows.  Some are hundreds of years old or more.  They are not the same as young hedgerows.</p></speech>

There are a couple of other species on the amber list that have moved straight from green to amber, including mallard and greenfinch.  These common species are suddenly being flagged up and we need to be aware that once-common species are no longer safe and are also declining.  In terms of the marine environment, we are very seriously threatened and a lot more research is needed on diet and productivity in particular.  We can provide more information in writing.</p></speech>

Allied to that question, do we need to change the way the inventory is measured at EU level?  It is my understanding that neither peat nor forestry falls into the existing inventory.</p><p> The big question then is how to drive both peat restoration and forestry, which are far below where they ought to be, even with relatively timid ambitions.  How do we drive them up to the levels of hectares per annum that we need to get to?  In particular, what is the role of Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte, two State bodies with much experience.  Coillte has done relatively little planting and Bord na M&oacute;na is embarking on a programme of restoration.  Could we support that in going faster and further, bringing a wider community with it?</p></speech>

The Deputy asked how we drive the recovery in this and that process is under way with wide industry support.  Although the process has support, the outcomes are on the line.  I refer to Project Woodland, which the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, initiated through her Department.  There is widespread support for the process in the forestry sector and engagement in it.  There are four strands in this, with one specifically looking at how to reach the targets that have been set.  Another of the strands looks at what is an appropriate target over the next ten or 20 years, along with what is an appropriate strategy around that?</p> <p>  Within the forest research area, there is a Council for Forest Research and Development, COFORD, committee that is also looking at land availability.  It is doing good work in that regard.  There are processes in place but the Project Woodland initiative must be given a chance.  Everybody who should be involved in that process is involved and everybody is working hard to achieve its aims.</p></speech>

The peatlands <i>per se</i>are not included in the national inventory reporting and we must address that.  If we were to start including them, how would it affect our accounting results?  We need to align the data we have, identify the gaps and inform the process so we can make a proper and appropriate assessment of the peatlands we have.<br/><br/>On the restoration work that is ongoing and whether we can up the ante and scale up, the Deputy mentioned the work in Bord na M&oacute;na.  My sense is that work is being well supported.  Let us remind ourselves that this is approximately 5% of the total peatland resource that we have.  Coillte certainly has potential and it should be supported.  The Coillte Nature initiative was set up to take on these legacy areas that do not have any commercial value <i>per se</i>but are now recognised as having amenity value and can be converted for the purposes of peatland restoration for water and climate benefit and biodiversity value.  It is something that should be supported.<br/><br/>The real wins come with farming communities, as that is where the majority of lands lie.  They are outside the semi-State bodies.  We must support these communities in stopping degradation even before we move to restoration.  The degradation must stop, which means reducing grazing or even removing grazing animals from uplands entirely.  Then we must start looking at how they can be supported through farm support schemes and CAP measures to implement restoration.<br/><br/>There is no big bang solution but we must work in a way that supports communities that are biting at the bit to get involved with wetland and peatland restoration.  That is a framework to follow in deciding what we must do in moving on with restoration.</p></speech>

Farmers have not been found wanting in responding to results-based agri-environment schemes, where results can be seen on the ground.  They should be rewarded for those activities.  There is great scope for increasing CAP funds in the strategic plan to help farmers not only to restore peatlands but to undertake landscape scale restoration for biodiversity, and that is about restoring habitats, as well as supporting or restoring semi-natural grasslands and wetlands all over the country.  It is an exciting time and we must recall that we are in a biodiversity crisis as well as a climate crisis, so we must really work together on this.</p></speech>

Much has been covered.  I sometimes wonder how different policies might be if birds could vote.  It is great to hear Ms Duggan say it is an exciting time because when we look through the list of species that have moved from green to amber and amber to red, it feels a little overwhelming, to say the least.</p> <p>  It is great to hear that results-based schemes are having an impact.  What more can be done around that?  Are we looking at pure investment at this stage to support farmers?  I suppose the same would apply to peatlands.</p> <p>  Continuous cover is the gold standard but what are we talking about for silver standard, for example?  Sometimes that can get left out but perhaps it will come out in the wash with Project Woodland.  What could be suggested that will get us some way there, although it might not be the gold standard of what we are looking for in forestry?  We are in a crisis with forestry, from production and felling through to biodiversity.</p> <p>  Mr. Purser mentioned that this is not so much to do with the type of forestry but how it is processed and the soil.  Does he have any comments to make about soil and the kind of investment we need to make in soils in order to ensure forestry is doing the best job it can?  I know organics have been mentioned.</p> <p>  Many of the questions for Dr. Farrell have been covered but one of the concerns we have as a committee is how fast this can happen in order to get us to where we need to be climate-wise when we are looking at sequestration.  I thank the witnesses and I am very conscious of the time left.</p></speech>

In the past year in particular, but also prior to that, even back to the heritage Bill campaign, we saw a public response to the proposed weakening of the laws protecting breeding birds.  The response was phenomenal.</p><p>In the past year, we have seen people return to taking an interest in birds and nature as a means of respite and to get away from the bad and sad news we are hearing all the time.  That has been reflected in the membership increase at BirdWatch Ireland and a major increase in interest in nature generally.  The tide has turned.  The public are behind measures and initiatives.  They want to see change, biodiversity restored and climate change tackled.  There is where I see the hope.  This as an exciting time.  The red list makes for pretty depressing reading but there is a momentum now, which includes momentum for Deputies and Senators to help us to get to where we need to be.</p></speech>

It is a matter of moving to the engagement phase.  As Ms Duggan said, this is an exciting time.  Farmers are realising the works they are doing do not align with what they know is right for the environment.  The appetite is there but incentives are needed.</p></speech>

There are many different types of woodland.  If the priority is promoting biodiversity, native woodlands are definitely the area to prioritise.  The difficulty is on the economic side.  We are asking private landowners to deliver the forestry programme and many are planting native woodland.  I planted 11 new native woodlands this year on behalf of private owners.  That is a major gesture on their part for the country and there is no economic reason for doing so.  That is the difficulty.  That is why when we talk about forest management we try to talk about delivering sustainably on all three of the cornerstones, namely, ecology, economics and the social aspect of sustainable forestry.  There are different systems.  The CCF system is able to deliver to those functions in a balanced way.  We continue timber production through harvesting timber and selling it to the timber industries but by not clear-cutting the forests, we are retaining the forest ecosystem, allowing it to evolve and develop, and storing and locking carbon the whole time.</p> <p>  As regards a bronze standard, as I indicated in a previous answer, there are circumstances where it is not possible to transform a plantation forest in the current rotation.  It would need to be felled using best felling practices and then redesigned, restructured and replanted.  That applies to many of the forests in this country, which are simply not possible to transform.</p> <p>  On the question on soils, I would refer to my presentation and some of the legacy issues.  The way we invest in the soils that are suitable for forestry is by planting them in a diverse way.  Planting a monoculture does not respect the soil because one ends up with a very simple structure beneath the ground and that is not good.  A diverse structure is needed underground as well as overground and that is what the soil will indicate and benefit from.  It is not through any action we do directly with the soil but through the secondary benefit of having diverse species planted on the soil.</p></speech>

We heard about the custodian approach and were given the wisdom of the ages.  I have a question for Mr. Purser.  We have to get buy-in.  We must have the necessary humility in our actions and attitude towards forests, biodiversity and climate change.  The forest resonates in our psyche as humans as a place of shelter, almost of magic, and Mr. Purser spoke of a magic wand.  How do we best communicate the idea that we are no longer masters of the universe and we have to become servants of nature?</p> <p>  Mr. Purser also mentioned deer.  Is he proposing a cull of non-native deer on the basis of their interference with native woodland?  I heard that native woodland was not as badly devastated as other woodland as a result of the fire that broke out in Killarney National Park.   Can Mr. Purser confirm that?</p> <p>  I have a brief question for either of the witnesses from BirdWatch Ireland.  Their presentation was magnificent and powerful.  We heard during the week about the return of the crane to Ireland after 300 years.  I do not think people know that 63% of birds are at risk.  Our left hand is destroying what our right hand is doing.  To imagine a spring without birdsong would be horrendous.  We have to get that message out.  I would welcome comments on that.</p></speech>

Her question on how society value forests is a cultural one.  I do not know if I have all the answers to it.   We are a culture which fell out of love with forests.  Forestry is a relatively new thing in communities again.  We should not forget that at the turn of the last century we were down to having 1.5% forest cover.  It is now at 11%.  The European average is between 20% and 30% range and in some countries it is more than 50%.  We are far behind in terms of having a forestry culture.  Many of the forests we have, particularly the private forests, are first generation forests.  We have not gained access to them and they have not been thinned.  They have not yet appeared from behind the hedgerow.  That is a slow process that will take time.</p> <p>  A game changer in how we value forests would be on the natural capital front, by recognising and valuing this natural capital that is provided by forests and offering that value to the forest owner.  If the forest owner was not dependent on the timber income to deliver all the other products and services from the forest, and in a similar way to the results-based schemes referred to in the other presentations, forests could deliver much more efficiently and forest owners could be rewarded for the delivery of all those other functions which make forests magical and beautiful places to be in.  That aspect is being discussed in Project Woodland, which should issue guidance on it.</p> <p>  Regarding deer, it is a difficult but critical topic.  Deer do not respect individual land ownerships.  They range across huge areas of land and multiple land ownerships.  With respect to the way culling is licensed, plenty of deer culling takes place but not in as organised and systematic way.  What we need are localised round-up deer management groups where neighbours co-operate, targets are set and people work together to achieve a particular deer density target.</p><p>It is a particularly big issue for native woodlands.  Native species are struggling to regenerate because of browsing pressure and the same applies to existing native woodlands.</p><p> There was a question relating to fire and the Deputy was 100% correct.  Mature native woodlands are far less vulnerable to fire.  In fact, they are almost repellent to fire as it sweeps through the landscape.  We have a problem with younger native woodlands that are recently planted because we still have ground vegetation.  The preceding ground vegetation is still present on site.  Young native woodlands can be vulnerable.  However, it is different for mature native woodlands because they are more diverse and have a higher moisture content at ground level.  They tend to be bypassed by fire or stop fire in the landscape in Ireland.  The same applies in other western European countries.  An example of this was in Portugal, where fires ripped through eucalyptus and pine plantations but when they came to a riparian native woodland, they stopped.  Such fires might hop over native woodland but the surviving forests in the landscape are the native forests.</p></speech>

The pandemic has shown us that we are not masters of the universe, especially given the likely links or origins of the pandemic with the trade in wildlife and loss of habitat.  If there was ever a message, that is it.  We have been able to address the pandemic by treating it as an emergency.</p> <p>  Two years ago, we declared a climate and biodiversity emergency.  What we need to see now is action on that.  How do we increase awareness of the losses of birds?  It would be great to see the media discuss it more.  We see many nice nature films and television programmes.  These are important to raise awareness, but we need to see more programming on the reality of what is happening, the losses of species and the challenges to restoration of populations.</p> <p>  We have an opportunity now to restore populations.  Between the forestry programme, Project Woodland and the Common Agricultural Policy we have the opportunity to invest in restoration.  This should be at the heart of all decision making relating to restoring biodiversity and tackling climate change.</p></speech>

That is one approach I am currently working on in terms of presenting a more holistic framework of how we get benefits from restoration.  It can also help us to target other hazard areas.</p> <p>  Many services are returned but we have not heretofore recognised the value of these services.  They are almost like the hidden values and hidden wealth within our forests and peatlands.  There is momentum presented by this committee.  It is in the gift of the committee to drive restoration for climate and biodiversity.  The key understanding is that biodiversity underpins climate; they are not separate issues.  Therefore, we have to hold difficult and awkward conversations on where we have to bring them all together.  We cannot separate the water from the peat, the wood from the trees, the fire from the landslide.  It is very much an integrated approach.</p> <p>  There have been some great initiatives by the Water Forum recently.  I want to flag two particular publications.  One is the Framework for Integrated Land and Landscape Management.  The forum has also published a document on the co-benefits of water and peatlands.  It is hosting a session on Friday and I recommend that all members attend.  There is extensive ongoing work in this area and the session is to raise awareness among people such as members of this committee in order that they can start to bring this into their conversations.</p></speech>

We will circulate the details and encourage all members to attend if they can.</p> <p>  We are out of time.  I was going to ask Mr. Purser about the economic gap between clear-fell forestry and continuous cover.  If he has information or analysis of the economic gap that exists, perhaps he could forward it to us.  I am mindful that the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine deals regularly with forestry.  I am unsure if Mr. Purser has had the opportunity to appear before that committee.  Perhaps we could try to arrange that.  I could speak to the Chairman of that committee if Mr. Purser has not done so.</p> <p>  I thank our witnesses for their contributions and opening statements.  As I said, they were most informative.  The answers were fantastic.  It has been a remarkably engaging session.  My thanks to members of the committee for their good questions, as always.  I reckon we are the most switched-on committee in the Oireachtas at the moment.  I know members are working hard and I thank them for that.</p></speech>

The Minister is welcome.  He is addressing the committee from a meeting room in Kildare House.  I also welcome the official accompanying him today, Ms Dara Breathnach, who is a principal officer in the Department.  The purpose of our meeting is to engage with the Department on the pre-legislative scrutiny process on the proposed legislation.  I remind members that when putting their questions to the Minister they should adhere to the agenda item scheduled for this meeting.</p> <p>  Before I invite the Minister to deliver his opening statement, I will advise him of the parliamentary privilege situation.  He is protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation he makes to the committee.  This means that he has an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything he says at the meeting.  However, he is expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Chair to ensure it is not abused.  Therefore, if his statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, he will be directed to discontinue his remarks.  It is imperative that he comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister to deliver his opening statement, which will be followed by a question and answer session with members.  Members will be asked to speak in the order they indicate.  They might start indicating now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.289" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021051800002#A00500"><p>As the Chair said, I am joined by Ms Dara Breathnach from my Department.  I thank the committee for the invitation to speak on the general scheme of the Certain Institutional Burials (Authorised Interventions) Bill.  This legislation is vital to allow us to intervene at Tuam, where the remains of children were interred in a deeply shocking manner with no concern for their dignity, or that of their families.  I am determined to prioritise this legislation to address this terrible failing.</p> <p>  I am committed to approaching all aspects of the Government&rsquo;s response to the commission of investigation report into mother and baby homes in a way that is survivor-centred.  I have engaged with survivors and their advocates and family members in relation to burials.  I have paid close attention to the pre-legislative process that has been under way over the past number of weeks.  I have listened carefully to the wide range of views that have been expressed on the incredibly sensitive issue of burials.  I will continue to consider the issues we will raise and discuss today, and I look forward to receiving the pre-legislative scrutiny report from this committee.</p> <p>  Today, I would like to take the opportunity to address some issues that have been raised in this process but I want to stress that I continue to consider the legislation.  Today's discussion, the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny and my own considerations will all be taken into account in the final draft I hope to bring before the Oireachtas soon.  I would like to acknowledge the members of the committee, and the Chair, for the great sensitivity with which they all handled the public sessions the committee held.  I thank the committee for allowing survivors&rsquo; personal experiences to be heard.  I want to thank all those who gave evidence, particularly those survivors and family members.  This is an incredibly emotional topic and their input will help strengthen the final draft of this legislation.</p> <p>  A number of the witnesses raised concerns that the Government has too much discretion under the general scheme to decide whether to intervene at a particular site.  When survivors and their advocates see a discretionary power in the State&rsquo;s possession, they feel they can have little cause to trust that such discretion will be exercised in their favour.  Given how badly the State failed them in the past, I completely understand that scepticism.  I hope I can have the opportunity to explain some of the policy choices that are indicated in this general scheme.</p> <p>  The committee will be aware at this stage in the pre-legislative scrutiny process that there is near consensus that it is vital to intervene at the Tuam site.  The nature of these burials present a set of circumstances where almost everyone agrees that humanitarian forensic recovery is the appropriate response.  In relation to other known sites, there is a spectrum of sincerely and strongly held views as to whether infants and children should be exhumed, or their resting places marked but otherwise left undisturbed.  I have received correspondence ranging from welcoming the proposed new laws to some correspondence expressing deep distress and anxiety that the legislation may lead to what people see as the desecration of the final resting place of their loved ones.  This legislation must provide guidance to the Government of the day on the factors that must be considered when deciding on an intervention, and must allow for reasonable discretion based on the circumstances of a given site.  This is what the provisions in heads 3 to 7 are designed to achieve.  The discretion afforded will be exercised transparently and with the benefit of appropriate independent expertise and stakeholder input.</p> <p>  The issue of compulsory access to dwellings has been raised during the committee&rsquo;s hearings.  Private property and the family home are robustly protected in the Irish Constitution.  Any legislation passed must be proportionate and cognisant of those rights in order to be constitutional.  The land access regime in the general scheme seeks to balance the public interest in conducting interventions with the rights of those involved.  It has been suggested that a blanket ban on conducting interventions at residential sites may have the unintended consequence of sealing off extensive grounds of a single dwelling entirely.  I have taken this on board and I am re-examining these provisions in the course of drafting.  I hope to bring forward a more nuanced position in due course, balancing the constitutional protection of property rights with the undoubtable significant public interest objective in interventions.</p> <p>  Several witnesses have raised the issue of the specific expertise that will be available to the agency.  In particular, some witnesses have criticised what they see as undue weight given to identification using DNA analysis to the exclusion of other relevant professional disciplines.  It has always been intended that a multidisciplinary team would be required in order to provide the best possible chance of individualising and identifying remains at Tuam.  The proposed legislation will enable an agency to enter into contract and procure expert services for exactly this purpose.  It is not necessary to prescribe each professional discipline in legislation; this will ultimately be a matter for procurement and contract documentation.  DNA is such a powerful tool in identification and this is why it is treated as sensitive personal information, including for the purposes of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.</p><p>The GDPR requires that DNA processing by the State have a specific lawful basis beyond the consent of a person providing a sample.  These legislative proposals will create that basis, as well as establishing extensive rules to guarantee the security of information and the privacy of persons who may wish to participate in an identification programme.  Similar concerns do not arise with other relevant disciplines, such as osteoarchaeology or forensic anthropology. </p><p> Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, are the national experts on DNA technology and, alongside the facilities at the FSI labs, the organisation has a very robust governance structure for the handling of DNA samples and the data generated from them.  I can confirm that this legislation will provide the legal basis to test DNA using techniques beyond those currently used in the criminal justice system.  The general scheme was drafted with a view to ensuring that advanced techniques, such as using mitochondrial DNA or single nucleotide polymorphism, can and will be used where necessary.  Where FSI do not have the resources required, they can be procured or outsourced but, importantly, this will be done under the FSI governance structure.  This will ensure best practice in protecting the participants of an identification programme and relevant third parties, and allow the State to meet the relevant obligations.</p><p> I have listened closely to concerns about the scope of a DNA testing programme and its restrictions to immediate family members.  I have heard concerns that this may be too narrowly constructed and have directed my officials to scope the possibility of broadening participation in an identification programme in this regard, at least to the degree of aunts and uncles and nieces and nephews.  Nevertheless, while I am minded to extend access, anything possible here will need to be carefully balanced against robustly protected privacy rights.</p><p> Concerns have been raised that the general scheme seeks to seal records.  This concern is understandable given the importance of records access to so many people affected by mother and baby institution issues.  I assure the committee and anyone concerned that this is not the case.  The principle underpinning any agency is that it will be transparent in its operation, information will be given in annual reports and the agency will also be answerable to the relevant Oireachtas committees.  The regime that will apply to the records of an agency is very different from that applying to a commission of investigation.  No restriction is proposed to the operation of the data protection or freedom of information regimes.  The only way in which I intend that information will be restricted is that personal information submitted as part of participation in an identification programme will be afforded the normal legal protections that safeguard access to anyone's personal information.  These protections will continue to receive close attention in drafting to ensure that no unintended consequences arise.</p><p> I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding the role of the coroner.  I have listened to commentary raising particular concerns regarding investigative obligations under various human rights instruments and the information that will be available to family members during an intervention under the proposed legislation.  This is a very important issue and I welcome the opportunity to clarify this part of the general scheme.  The policy intention of the general scheme is to suspend coronial jurisdiction as it relates to exhumation and identification but only for so long as the intervention lasts.  This is to avoid having concurrent jurisdictions between different State bodies and is considered good administrative law in that regard.  For similar reasons, the jurisdiction of a local authority in respect of exhumation is also suspended.</p><p> The proposed Bill will place legal authority for excavation works and attempts to identify remains in the hands of the agency to be created so that there will be a clear line of legal responsibility and the bespoke resourcing that will be required for interventions under the Bill can be provided in the form of a dedicated, driven and transparent State service, sensitive to the particular context of institutional burials.  Careful attention is being paid in drafting to the specific relationship between the coroner and the agency to ensure that investigative obligations that currently lie with the coronial service will not be undermined.  The position is that nothing in the legislation should preclude further investigation if that is warranted.  I will continue to consider this element of the legislation to ensure no element could be construed as providing a barrier to any investigation.</p><p> I am also conscious of the emphasis, placed in some of the submissions, on the importance of the agency operating within a rights-centred framework.  Issues related to the provision of information to relatives, the treatment of remains and their return to relatives must all be undertaken by the agency.  I will examine how greater reassurance can be provided that the manner in which these obligations will be undertaken by the agency will be done in a rights-compatible way.</p><p> I thank the committee for its dedicated and constructive engagement with the proposed Bill.  I have taken this opportunity to set out my thinking on some of the issues that have arisen during the pre-legislative process.  I ask the committee to bear in mind that I continue to examine the draft heads and the submissions made during pre-legislative scrutiny, and will thoroughly review the committee's report when I receive it.  I thank all those who have made submissions to the committee and who have so helpfully and informatively engaged with the pre-legislative process.  In particular, I thank those survivors and family members who have appeared before the committee and given testimony with such honesty and power as part of the process.</p></speech>

I confirm for the committee that I am located on the precincts of Leinster House.  I would like to stay to hear all the questions and answers but I will have to attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice.  I may return before the end of this meeting but, if not, I will watch a recording of it.</p> <p>  I understand we have been asking the same questions and going over similar ground.  The Minister touched on the following in his contribution but it is nonetheless important to ask about it in isolation in order to be clear.  He mentioned rights and my question relates to that.  According to the proposed Bill, the level of intervention on a site will consider the economic impact of the intervention and the impact on residents who live beside or on a site.  Given that many of the sites are located beside residents' homes, this will be a problematic restriction when investigations are being carried out at certain sites.  These restrictions are likely to hinder robust investigations.  In the Minister's opinion, how can we reconcile this with our duties under international law, including Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the right to respect for private and family life, to ensure transitional justice?</p> <p>  I invite the Minister to respond to that question before I follow up.  He might keep in mind that my allocated time is limited.</p></speech>

Rights in regard to property are a set of rights as well.  The extent to which we value them is questionable but they are protected and have to be assessed in a decision on any intervention.  The clear tenet of this legislation is such that where we have identified  a burial site that meets a manifestly inappropriate standard, we wish to address that.  When a law is passed, it has to have a balancing mechanism built in.  If we did not have some element of balancing, there is a risk that it would be constitutionally challenged.  Having that balancing mechanism built in and listing the considerations certainly does not mean that this Government or future governments applying them would give undue weight to private property where there has been a manifestly inappropriate burial, whether in Tuam or at other sites.</p></speech>

I may not be framing the question correctly.  How can the economic impact of an intervention be balanced against the rights to investigation and justice?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.295" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021051800002#B00600"><p>Inherently, that balancing approach is being undertaken by the Minister, in the first instance, and then the Government in determining whether an intervention is made.</p><p>It is important that that is there as it ensures there is a set of criteria in the Bill, so if the Bill was ever challenged in court the Government or Attorney General could point out that a balancing test is provided for.  As regards the Government making a decision on a situation like Tuam, where there is such an incredibly inappropriate burial arrangement, the economic argument against intervention would have to be absolutely massive in order to rebalance that need to intervene. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.297" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1681" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021051800002#C00200"><p>Under the criteria for intervention, head 5 of the Bill outlines the withholding of consent to an investigation by a landowner.  That withholding is only deemed unreasonable if the owner was also the owner of the land when inappropriate burials took place or if they acquired the site on or after the date of the publication of the general scheme of the Bill.  The Bill does not address the withholding of consent by landowners who acquired the land in the period succeeding the burials and preceding that publication.  I ask the Minister to comment on that.  What plans are there to rectify that issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.298" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021051800002#C00300"><p>I understand that this issue was referenced in both the oral and written submissions during pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  That provision is in place to recognise a situation where the land has transferred ownership subsequent to the burials.  I am happy to continue to examine those criteria in the course of my own determinations.</p></speech>

He mentioned in his speech that the discretion afforded for interventions will be exercised transparently.  Will there be a detailed process for that transparency?  Will people know what that process will be, for the benefit of all sides, including the Government, victims and survivors?</p> <p>  I am concerned about the unidentified remains.  Unfortunately, we have decades upon decades of burials in this country and not all remains will be identified.  I fear there is not enough emphasis on looking after them, respecting them and giving them the burial they need.  What will happen then with the DNA database or whatever the case may be?  The Minister said the agency will not be barred from passing on its evidence to the coroner.  That makes sense.  He spoke about an administrative process but what are the barriers or limits to that?  We will, unfortunately, have a lot of remains.  What are the circumstances in question?  Will it be up to the agency to create the circumstances for passing on those investigations or details to the coroner?  Where do those lines fall?</p> <p>  Regarding the balancing of rights, the Minister mentioned the constitutional protections relating to residential property.  Would there be a case for using compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, for land under reasonable circumstances?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.300" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021051800002#C00500"><p>On the CPO point, the idea is to allow the State to intervene on a temporary basis.  There is provision in the Bill to intervene and take possession of land on a short-term basis and, if seen as necessary, potentially pay compensation.  Again, because of the constitutional protection of property rights we have to have these processes in place but they are temporary rather than permanent.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about situations where there has been an intervention by this agency and not all of the bodies exhumed have been identified.  The agency has a specific mandate to make provision for the dignified reburial of those remains.  That is very important, particularly in places with high numbers of burials such as Tuam.  We are going to make every effort to identify remains but where that is not possible it is important that we make provision for respectful reburial.  That is key to what we are seeking to achieve here.</p> <p>  As regards the coroner, we will be very clear that we do not want anything in this legislation that will be seen as a barrier to the conducting of the coronial process.  The power of a coroner to conduct an inquest is granted in section 17 of the Coroners Act 1962.  There is nothing in these heads that in any way limits that section.  The two limitations mentioned are specific roles the agency will have.  First, it has a role to exhume.  We have to make sure that when an agency is appointed it has the sole power of exhumation.  Second, it has the sole power of identification because we are giving this agency the power to undertake a very significant DNA-based identification process. </p> <p>  Regarding the transparency of the decision-making process, the key area where transparency will be needed is in the Government's accountability to the Oireachtas when making a decision on whether to intervene.  That relates to the Minister of the day's accountability to the D&aacute;il and the Taoiseach's accountability to the D&aacute;il.  Where the Government of the day considers an intervention and decides not to intervene, it is going to have to explain that and explain very clearly why the particular circumstances of a site did not warrant an intervention. </p></speech>

It is glaringly obvious that coroners' inquests are required at all sites.  I will give three brief reasons for that.  First, it is the law.  The Minister just referred to the Coroners Act, which goes so far as to specify that if someone dies in State care or custody, the coroner is obliged to act.  Second, there is a lack of information on the causes of death.  The abnormally high death rate in mother and baby institutions clearly demonstrates a high likelihood of negligence.  There is also a lack of information on location of burials.  All of these highlight the absolute necessity of the coroner being integrally involved.  Third, all the experts who came before the committee outlined the need for the coroner to be involved.  Yet, this Bill suspends coronial jurisdiction and disapplies the coroner.  The Minister said that the Bill will not interfere with the coroner acting but is the plan for the new agency to exhume, identify and re-inter remains and then for the coroner to go and do the same again?  What is the purpose of disapplying the coroner from this Bill?  I have yet to understand what that purpose is.</p> <p>  In his statement the Minister said that it is vital to intervene at Tuam but that other known sites will be left to the discretion of the Government.  That is a complete abdication of responsibility.  In essence, the Minister is saying that we have to do something at Tuam but we will decide on the rest depending on public pressure.  There are already laws in place relating to the Coroners Act.  Why are these decisions being left to the discretion of the Minister at the time?</p><p>Basically, the Minister is saying it is vital to intervene at Tuam and it is not vital at every other site and he is legislating to remove laws which will ensure that this will happen.  One would have to forgive people for wondering if it is by design that it is another attempt to do the bare minimum, wait and see what the pressure is, and only deal with Tuam.  Why not bring the coroner's powers into this agency?  That is the key question.  Why do it separately and say that this will not disapply the coroner when it states in the Bill that it suspends coronial jurisdiction?  I do not understand.</p></speech>

From a legal point of view, it is regarded as inappropriate that at the same time the coroner would have also jurisdiction and the local authority would have jurisdiction.  In terms of exhumation, we are not only disapplying coronial jurisdiction to exhume.  We are also disapplying the local authority jurisdiction to exhume.</p> <p>  In terms of identification, this agency will have very significant powers based on legislation to undertake a DNA-based identification programme and that programme is not one that would traditionally be open to the coroner.  The identification powers that the coroner has under the existing Act would be disapplied and there would not be concurrent jurisdiction.  In terms of any other powers the coroner has under the consolidated Coroners Acts, those are not being impacted by what is proposed within the draft heads of this legislation.</p> <p>  On a decision to intervene, it cannot be a matter of merely leaving it up to public pressure.  I do not agree with that interpretation of what has been done here.  What we are seeking to achieve is to set out clear criteria within the legislation which will guide the Government, or future Governments, in a decision as to whether to intervene in a particular site or not.  We all accept that those criteria have been reached in Tuam.  We do not know whether they will be reached in other sites but it is important to say that is why this Bill was not designed as a Tuam-specific piece of legislation.  It was designed in a way to be cognisant of the fact that there may be future sites where there is a need to intervene.  We need to be conscious that whereas in Tuam there is that almost unanimous agreement, particularly among relatives of survivors, about the need to intervene, that same degree of agreement among relatives is not necessarily currently in existence for all other sites and that is why those various criteria need to be there and need to be considered.</p></speech>

It is vital in Tuam.  Is the classification for vital not the fact that we know there is very likely death due to negligence?  Is the Minister saying we know that people want to find out the fate of their disappeared relatives and in some instances, it might not be vital but it is in Tuam?</p></speech>

That is what this legislation is designed to address, namely situations where the burials of children and babies who were in mother and baby institutions or county institutions are in a manifestly inappropriate manner.  That is fundamentally what this legislation seeks to achieve.  As I say, there is general agreement that that manifestly inappropriate standard is clearly evident in Tuam but this legislation allows for the fact that a similar situation may be revealed elsewhere and will allow a future Government to intervene elsewhere.</p></speech>

I am in Leinster House.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister for taking the time to meet the committee here this morning.  I welcome the chance for this engagement.</p> <p>  I want to follow up on what Deputy Cairns was talking about.  We know that the DNA will provide who the people were and, hopefully, survivors or families will get answers on that.  Many of the families and survivors who were in contact with me in relation to "the how".  In one of the committee meetings, I asked Dr. Niamh McCullagh and she stated that the technology that will be used could provide the how.  At that stage, what is the role of the coroner once that technology is there that can show how people's loved ones died?</p> <p>  The Minister said in his opening statement that the "legislation will provide the legal basis to test DNA using techniques beyond those currently used in the criminal justice system."  That is a strong and welcome statement.  Does the Minister believe that this technology will be robust enough to trigger criminal investigations down the line?  Does he believe that survivors and family members will get to know how their loved one died?  At what point does the coroner get involved in the process once the how is decided, as it relates to criminal investigations in the future?  Where does the coroner fit into that process?  I am a little confused on that.  Many of the family members and survivors who were speaking to me want to hold somebody to account for the loss of their loved ones.  Whether it is malnutrition, neglect or something more sinister, they want to get answers on that.  Basically, that is the question I have.</p></speech>

My understanding is that the wide range of techniques that the legislation makes provision for, both DNA and other types of identification process, are primarily about who these individuals are and that is what the legislation is designed to achieve.</p> <p>  In terms of the information that this agency gathers, I would certainly be happy to put in a provision that that information is fully available to all other State bodies for their use for any functions they have, be that the Garda or the coroner.  Within provisions as regards GDPR, etc., I am certainly happy for any information that the agency gathers to be freely available.</p> <p>  In terms of the role of the coroner, other than the points I have made in terms of exhumation and identification, I am not looking for this legislation in any way to interfere with the role of the coroner or the existing legislative powers that coroners have.  It is important to state we are not looking to interfere with the role of the coroner beyond not having the coroner, this agency and a local authority all having jurisdiction in terms of exhumation at the same time.  Such simultaneous jurisdiction is legally confusing and we do not want to have that.</p></speech>

It will be a quick one.</p> <p>  I welcome that the Minister mentioned that provision will be made but I want to know who is responsible for notifying the Garda or the coroner of potential criminal activity in the past where a loved one died.</p><p>Is it the agency or the Department?  Who picks up the phone to the coroner or the Garda and says there is a potential that criminal activity happened in mother and baby homes in the past?  Who makes that phone call?</p></speech>

The Garda recently set up special lines and an email address, and called on anyone who knows about criminal activity in mother and baby homes to contact it.  We all welcome that.  The obligation exists for anyone and everyone, including the agency we are talking about, if it is established.</p></speech>

I am in one of the booths so it is a little dark.  I will try to improve the lighting.  I thank the Minister.  One of the things that has come through in the testimony to the committees and the public debate on this issue is a breakdown of trust, a lack of trust among survivors and their families that the right thing will be done.  In his statement, the Minister talked about how the legislation will enable a wide range of disciplines and a multidisciplinary assessment of sites.  It enables it but it does not necessarily require it.  We have seen from the evidence so far that things such as forensic anthropology, osteoarchaeology and forensic DNA are very important in assessing any particular site.  They are important for understanding fully what happened at a site.  It is important for those disciplines to become requirements of the legislation to ensure that these things are at least considered.  Perhaps there should be an assumption that these things will be used that must be rebutted by the agency.  Perhaps there should be a requirement for an assessment of the site and which disciplines will be needed.  That way, decisions as to what disciplines and expertise will be used are taken in a transparent way.  As the Minister said, if the agency decides not to exhume or investigate a site, it must make clear why it has made that decision.  For the same reason, it is important for the agency, should it choose at a particular site, for example, not to use forensic anthropology, to justify that decision.  Putting that requirement or assumption into the Bill is an exercise in building trust and transparency.  I appreciate that the legislation does not preclude these things and they can happen.  However, putting them into the legislation as a positive requirement shows that we are at least thinking about these matters and acknowledging they are important.  It is an aspect of helping to rebuild trust.</p> <p>  The Minister said that he wants to make the information freely available to others and that is positive.  However, we must have information that we can make available and we get that information by making sure that experts are involved.  In turn, we make sure those experts are involved by making an assumption that they will be involved and showing that we are trying to achieve those things with this legislation, instead of the legislation simply being an enabling piece.  I appreciate, as I said, that those measures are not precluded but they should be baked in from the very beginning.  I would love to hear the Minister's thoughts on the difference I am highlighting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021051800002#E00400"><p>My understanding, having spoken to officials and listened to experts, is that the appropriateness of the particular techniques very much depend on the particular site.  It depends on the condition of the site and the condition of the remains at the site.  The Deputy is right when he says that it is absolutely correct that this agency applies the right techniques to the particular site.  However, I am not sure whether that requires the listing of every single technique that could possibly be used in this legislation.  There might, of course, be particular techniques that are wrong for a particular site.  An obligation to use what is necessary for that particular site is how I would understand this agency will work.  In terms of accountability, the director of the agency is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts and other relevant committees, including, I presume, this committee.  If a situation arises whereby a director is refusing to use a technique that would seem obvious, that director will be called in front of a committee and held accountable for that decision.</p> <p>  I take on board what the Deputy is saying in respect of the breakdown of trust and it is something I acknowledged in my earlier contribution, as I have in all my contributions on the issue of mother and baby homes.  We will certainly look to see how the legislation can clearly indicate that the agency will use those techniques that are most appropriate to the particular site.</p></speech>

A justification should be required if they are not being used.  While I appreciate the head of the agency could be called up by any committee, the chances are that will be a delayed process.  We do not want a situation where an exhumation or investigation has begun on the wrong terms and when the head of the agency gets to the committee, he or she holds his or her hands up and states that the work has already started and cannot be changed.  It is about assuming a maximised starting position where we make the assumption that we will do as much as possible and then justify each step backwards.  The legislation tends to take the opposite approach.  It enables us to do a lot but it does not necessarily make that assumption and, therefore, the transparency in the decision-making process is not there.  The legislation would be stronger and people would have more faith in it if it took the assumption that these things would happen instead of the opposite.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for his comprehensive submission to the committee.  I wish to be clear about a couple of things.  As recently as last night, there was reference to Tuam on the RT&Eacute; series about former State Pathologist, Dr. Marie Cassidy.  She discussed the mammoth task it will be to identify the remains in Tuam.  I am ever mindful, as we talk here about processes, that we may not overcome the very first hurdle, which is identification.  Not all of the remains will have a DNA contact or a manner of identification.  I always feel concerned and a responsibility for the expectation of relatives when considering what may be achievable.  Dr. Cassidy talked about how complex identification will be.  She said it may result in DNA and other testing being required on every item of remains.  Forgive me the bluntness of my words.</p> <p>  The issue comes back to our original plan.  This is about ensuring dignity and respect in death and a proper reinterment, or a proper interment because remains were not properly interred in the first place.  We must now move to a proper and respectful interment.  I hope, insofar as it is possible, that there will be a restoration of remains to the families and loved ones concerned.</p><p>There may be instances where that will not be able to be the case, however.  I know the Minister and his officials have discussed these sorts of things.  What are the plans in those instances?</p><p> The next outcry is about their cause of death and whether criminal procedures should follow from that.  I hear what the Minister said about there being no intention here to corral or limit coronial power.  There is merely a legal conflict about who holds jurisdiction whereby only one party can hold jurisdiction at any one time, and that is what is set into the Bill.</p><p> What are the Minister's plans?  In our earnest desire to bring resolution, we have a huge task but not all of the answers.  There will not be closure here for every set of remains.  What timeline does the Minister envisage?  If we are coming to pre-legislative scrutiny sometime in the autumn, this will be before both Houses of the Oireachtas and will be enacted into law.  After that, when do we expect to break ground in Tuam, mindful that a long period has already elapsed?  Time is of the essence.  We also have the issue of perhaps the implications of further decomposition so I would be interested to hear about a timeline.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.322" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021051800002#F00200"><p>I thank the Senator.  I believe she is correct; all of us must bear in mind that uncertainty around raising expectations and hope.  We are providing for this intervention, and in particular, for DNA identification to enable identification as far as is possible.  We cannot be certain what is possible, however.  The experts who spoke at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage reminded us of the significant possibility that identification may not be possible in every circumstance.  The Senator is correct to remind us of that.  We all need to bear that in mind, as difficult as it is for family members to hear.</p> <p>  The agency has a clear role in terms of providing for the dignified reburial of those remains where identification has not been successful.  That will obviously be done in the context of the views of the wider survivor group at a particular site as to the appropriate way to ensure dignified reburial of remains that either have not been identified or perhaps are unclaimed by relatives, which in light of the age of some of these remains is a very real possibility.</p> <p>  In terms of the timeline, as soon as this legislation is passed, we will be seeking to provide for the agency to intervene at Tuam.  We will seek to get that set up as quickly as possible.  These agencies are designed as being of relatively small size.  This ensures that the process of establishing an agency is as uncomplicated as possible, although bear in mind, it will have to have expertise across a range of areas with regard to the exhumation but also the identification in terms of actual employees and other skills that can be contracted out.</p> <p> We are also particularly conscious of time, which is the point the Senator made.  Everything in this area is time sensitive, particularly considering the ages of relatives.  Provision was made for an administrative collection of DNA.  That has been delayed due to Covid-19, which is completely understandable.  It is a face-to-face exercise that has to be witnessed, and therefore, involves people in close contact.  Certainly, however, as soon as we see wider provision of vaccinations across the community, we will be seeking to run and initiate that administrative scheme as quickly as possible in order that we can gather and bank DNA to permit identification</p></speech>

Is it the Minister's proposal to get into discussions at other sites?</p> <p>  I am coming back to the exercise of discretion as to what is needed at other sites and what intervention by the commission would happen at other sites.  Does the Minister propose doing that in collaboration with survivor groups or can it be tailored?  Is he mindful of it being tailored to each site?

I am in Leinster House.  I join others in welcoming the Minister to the committee.  I will read briefly from the Minister's opening statement:</p> <blockquote> 	Careful attention is being paid in drafting to the specific relationship between the coroner and the agency to make sure that investigative obligations which currently lie with the coronial service are not undermined.  The position is that nothing in the legislation should preclude further investigation if that is warranted. </blockquote> <p>The Minister will hear very clearly from members the doubts and worries that are being expressed with regard to the disapplying of the powers of the coroner.  We all know that a person of no less standing than Professor Phil Scraton submitted to the committee, which I am sure the Minister heard.  When talking about the legislation, Professor Scraton said:</p> <blockquote> 	... its enactment would disapply existing powers of the coroner in whatever locations and in respect of all deaths over which a new agency is given jurisdiction.  The Bill implies that families of infants and mothers who died in institutional custody will be compelled to make a choice between exhumation and identification of their relative's remains followed by reinterment ... [or] the coroner retaining the power to hold an inquest to confirm the deceased's identity, approximately when ... [they] died, where ... [they] died and, most important, how ... [they] died. </blockquote> <p>I put it to the Minister that he has not adequately addressed thus far the proposal to disapply the power of the coroner.  I remain very doubtful about this piece of legislation at present on the basis that witness after expert witness, from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties to Professor Scraton, have all expressed their deep concern about the disapplication of that power.  I do not care if this is a misuse of that word.  I do not believe the Minister has adequately addressed the elephant in the room today.  I would love to hear his view on that first point.</p></speech>

As I said before, the sole disapplication we are seeking to achieve with this legislation is around the actual carrying out of an exhumation, which is one of the powers set out in the Coroner's Act and in the Local Government Act.</p><p>We do not believe it is appropriate that three bodies would have jurisdiction over an exhumation.</p></speech>

I apologise for cutting across the Minister but my time is limited.  I have noted this and I have internalised what the Minister has said in respect of this point.  If he is saying that we cannot have a cross-jurisdictional regime and there has to be consistency in respect of the coronial process, or a system of investigation, I put it to the Minister that the legislation before us still does not robustly instill within it a coronial process akin to the laws of the land and the standards that apply in respect of deaths and the investigative process arising from them.  I put it to the Minister that he still has not adequately addressed this issue in the proposal before us today.  This is the elephant in the room.  I cannot move on with the legislation until we have dealt with this issue sufficiently.  The Minister is saying he will consider this element of the legislation to ensure no element could be construed as providing a barrier to any investigation.  I am not seeing the evidence of this coming forward in the wording.  Forgive me if I have missed this in dispatches.</p></speech>

It exists and we all know this.  It applies in these circumstances.  We are seeking to disapply two elements of it that we see as problematic in terms of the two key roles the agency is trying to achieve, which are exhumation and identification.  Barring this, nothing in the legislation interferes with existing coronial jurisdiction.</p> <p>  I got the sense the Deputy is looking for the construction of a new jurisdiction but I am not sure whether this is the correct way to go.  We are speaking about the laws of the land.  The laws of the land exist as does coronial jurisdiction.  What I did say earlier was that if clarifications are necessary to ensure this agency is fully working with all State bodies, agencies and processes, including the coronial process, we are happy to look at clarifications in this regard.</p></speech>

Even if we take exhumation and investigation, is there a fear that the power of the coroner and the coronial process will be undermined?  To refer to what Professor Scraton told the committee, 9,000, or 15%, of infants born in the institutions examined died there, in addition to the deaths of 200 mothers.  We know the rates of mortality are extremely high and I would have thought this alone would be sufficient to ensure there is no ambiguity on the issue of the discretion of the Government of the day to put in place, or set up, an agency as it sees fit.  If the number of deaths is so high, and if we know from the commission's reports that the mortality rate in institutions was extremely high, this in and of itself surely is worthy of investigation, such that a Minister cannot limit the power to investigate it if the Government of the day decided for economic reasons not to go there and not to open that casket because it could be at it for years and investigations could cost the State millions of euro.</p> <p>  If we go down the road in the Bill of being influenced by economic factors and not factors of transitional justice, such as the convention on enforced disappearances, the obligations of investigation and the rights to remedy, then we will come back to this down the line.  I am on the side of the Minister but I want to be reassured by what he is telling us about the legislation being robust enough to ensure justice will not be denied in future to people or relatives and to those poor souls who have the right to justice.  Forgive me as I do not mean to be rhetorical about this but I want to be sure we get it absolutely right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.337" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021051800002#G00700"><p>I thank the Deputy and I absolutely understand.  To clarify, determination on manifest inappropriateness will be made by the Government and not by the agency.  Once the agency is established it will do the work so there will be no discretion on the part of the agency.  It is a huge thing to exhume a body.  In Ireland we have a culture of a resting place being a resting place and it is very significant to intervene to exhume a body.  The legislation seeks to give the Government of the day criteria on which to make this significant decision.  Where we have a situation with burials that are manifestly inappropriate, and we have all identified Tuam as such, the degree of the appalling nature of the treatment of the remains in this situation warrants this particular intervention.</p> <p>  As I have spoken about previously, and I am sure the Deputy knows, there are other sites where the relatives have diverse views as to whether or not to intervene.  If we intervene we do so across an entire site so it is important there is a framework within which a Government can take a decision as to whether the situation of the particular remains on a site warrants the extreme nature of the type of intervention provided for under the Bill.  I will continue to look at these criteria and I will take on board the points made by the Deputy.  There does have to be a framework within which the decision is made.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister and thank him for his ongoing engagement on this important matter.  I will touch on the importance of access to records and vital information for the many people affected by the mother and baby institutional issues.  In his opening statement, the Minister said he understands the concerns being raised that the general scheme may seek to seal agency records.  Will the Minister outline how he intends to safeguard access to personal information and the regime that will apply to records of the agency versus the laws or regulations that apply to the commission of investigation, which caused huge difficulty for many survivor groups?</p><p>What restrictions does the Minister intend to apply in certain circumstances within the agency?  I know of some survivors who are still having significant difficulties accessing information and who are experiencing huge delays in getting things like medical records from various historic health boards and information from county homes and local authorities.  We must ensure that this is managed correctly and effectively within the legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.340" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2021051800002#H00200"><p>I might speak generally to the issue of records first and then deal specifically with the role of this agency.  Access to information is absolutely crucial to survivors and indeed to a wider group of people including adoptees.  Last week we brought forward the draft heads of the birth information and tracing legislation which provides the best guarantee of access to all information and I look forward to working with this committee on passing that important legislation.</p> <p>  In terms of the archive of the commission of investigation, as per the 2004 legislation under which the commission was established, there are restrictions on access.  However, following the decision of the Attorney General, we were able to clarify that the right under GDPR to access one's personal information did apply to the entire archive and I said I would ensure that right was upheld when the archive transferred to my Department from February.  We have just over 150 subject access requests in hand at the moment and are working our way through them.  As this is the first time we are applying these subject access requests and this is the first round that we have done, our team, which was built to address the requests for access, is not currently reaching the initial one-month deadline.  However, we are confident that we will have full replies to the subject access requests in the near future.  A small number have been fully answered already and we are in the process of fully answering the rest.  </p> <p>  On the issue of the treatment of records by the agency, the traditional FOI rules will apply to the agency, as will GDPR rights and subject access requests about one's own information.  The one area that we have to protect is the data the agency will hold and is designed to bank, namely people's DNA.  DNA information is incredibly sensitive and is an incredibly powerful tool and it is very important that there are robust protections in place so that where somebody gives a DNA sample in order to allow for identification, that it is strongly protected.  That is what we are seeking to do with this legislation and the protections will be strong and robust.  That is why we are legislating for them here but beyond that, we are not seeking to put any special regime of protection around the information and the records of this agency.  The same regime that applies to other State agencies, both in terms of protection and access to information, will be provided for.  </p> <p>  There is a wider issue, to which the Deputy alluded, regarding access to information beyond the archive of the commission of investigation, in the wide range of State institutions, State bodies and private actors that held information about individual women and children who were in care during the twentieth century.  The Government has committed to address that in terms of a records and memorialisation centre.  We want to get the information and tracing legislation passed first because that is so vital to allow immediate and full access to birth certificates and other records but it is the Government's intention to provide for the wider element of records and memorialisation as well.  I hope that addresses the question. </p></speech>

There will be an obligation to provide an annual report on the activities of the agency as well as its interactions with other State agencies.  I am conscious that what this agency will be doing is incredibly sensitive in terms of the exhumation of the remains of infants and children and its role in seeking to link living relatives with those remains.  These are some of the incredibly difficult and sensitive tasks with which the agency will be charged.  How we design the functioning of the agency in legislation is something I want to consider more, particularly how we design an agency that is doing something incredibly sensitive on one side, but incredibly technical on the other.  We have legislated very significantly for the technical element but it is important that we do not omit the requirement for sensitivity.  I am conscious of the need to have some element of protection or oversight of the agency's engagements, particularly with families.  I have not fully fleshed that out yet and would be interested in what committee members have to say in that regard.  In terms of its accountability, if something falls there, I do not think it will be enough that it gets raised at an Oireachtas committee or something like that because it is so central to what we are trying to achieve here that families feel that their needs are being accommodated by the agency.  I have not made a final call on that but having looked through the heads of the Bill and listened to the various points made, in as much as it has a technical role, it has a deeply sensitive role as well and we need to make sure that is clear from the initiation of any agency</p></speech>

In their time, these children clearly were not cherished and neither were their mothers but we have an opportunity, in what we do now, to restore their dignity, to respect them and to cherish their value to us as a State.  I appreciate the Minister's words and thoughts on that.</p></speech>

Is the importance for the Minister of this legislation and the exhumation and identification of remains based on families finding out where their disappeared relatives are or is it more to do with the way in which the unmarked graves came about, whether in an unmarked site or a septic tank?  What is the most important reason for this Bill?  Is it how the unmarked graves came about, literally, in terms of their layout or is it important to the Minister because we can help people to find out where their disappeared relatives are?</p><p>What is the thing that makes it more vital?</p></speech>

Not only were they denied, everything about the collective nature and the location of the burials is deeply repugnant to our notions of decency.  It was on that basis the legislation is being brought forward.  There is the need for the families of those who were born in Tuam to have some reassurance that those remains will be treated in a dignified manner by the State, and to make provision for that.</p></speech>

Maybe it is not necessary but I am asking why it is not in the Bill.</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about it being inappropriate for three agencies to be involved around the exhumation and identification process.  Does this mean that if the coroner does decide to act in relation to any of the sites examined by this agency, the coroner will have to wait until the agency is finished because, as the Minister has said, it is inappropriate to have more than one agency involved at one time?  Would this result in remains being exhumed, identified and re-interred, and then that process happening again if the coroner was to get involved?  Is the coroner allowed to come in during the process being undertaken by the agency?  If that is the case, why is it inappropriate to have more than one agency involved at any one time?</p></speech>

This is what we seek to address in the disapplication of the coroner's exhumation power and the disapplication of the local authority's exhumation power.  With regard to the coroner conducting its wider investigatory powers, there is no clash on that and the role of the agency.

I am not sure what the clear benefit would be to repeat those powers within the context of the agency and in the particular circumstances.

If we accept the fact that the powers of the coroner are being disapplied on two out of three sets of criteria, which is what the Minister is saying, but that the power of investigation is not diminished in any way because that is the law of the land, the legitimate question arises about the number of agencies involved.  Referring to Tuam specifically - and thank goodness for the work of Catherine Corless and others - we reasonably know where we stand and what is ahead of us in the road ahead as this application applies.  If I refresh my memory, we had a presentation from the historical burials legislation unit - the Minister's own colleagues - where they said that the legislation was being applied because existing jurisdiction to authorise exhumations does not readily apply to the particularly unusual circumstances arising at Tuam, and similarly the legislation governing the identification of remains by means of DNA comparison is not suitable for those circumstances.  We know why we are legislating.</p> <p>  I have a final request for the Minister.  If we accept that the power of the coroner is not diminished in any way will the Minister give this committee some comfort that resources will be made available for the recruitment of an additional number of coroners, or give us an assurance that the coronial process as it applies to the creation of an agency in respect of a specific site or other follow-on sites will not be hampered by the lack of adequate coronial services, such as for the efforts in seeking justice and the efforts in seeking to identify remains, and that these services are not undermined by a lack of resources?  That is my question, fundamentally.</p> <p>  I have a second point for the Minister.  There is one limited power that individual Members of the Oireachtas have, which is the power to submit the parliamentary question.  I hope that something would be built into this legislation on the accountability feature that allows for me, as a Member of the Oireachtas, to make representations on behalf of a person or families who may wish to seek information.  I hope that the making of those representations or the advocating for families, which is what we all do as Members, would not be diminished in any way and that some structure could be put in place so Members could assist such persons, and that GDPR and other barriers would not be put up in front of us.</p></speech>

My understanding is that a wider review is being undertaken in that regard, and I am happy to provide input into that review.  It is also important to state that there is an independent element to the coronial jurisdiction in respect of decisions taken to undertake specific investigations.  I am not in a position to interfere in that process in any way, but obviously we want to support-----</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to forgive me, and I know he is not deliberately misinterpreting what I am saying.  I am talking about the resourcing of the coronial service, and that is a matter for the Government.  I recognise that silos exist in Departments, but the Minister is the line manager, as it were, for the setting up of this agency.  Therefore, if there is to be an extensive coronial investigative process in this regard, I ask that it will not be hampered.  That is presumably a whole-of-Government matter and not just for the Minister for Justice.  Therefore, I take the point the Minister is making about the review, but I ask him to use his good offices to ensure that when an agency is created that it will not be hampered by the lack of investigative powers due to the unavailability of a coroner or coroners or other such appropriate staff as might be deemed necessary to carry out investigations.</p></speech>

Indeed, what we are seeking to do with the creation of this agency is to have resource-intensive elements of this process addressed through this agency.  A relevant example would be the significant resources which will be required for an exhumation on the scale and complexity, initially, of the site at Tuam.  That will be undertaken by the agency.  As I said, we are disapplying the jurisdiction of the coroner in respect of that particular element.</p> <p>  Turning to the point concerning representations to the agency, I am happy to look at that aspect.  If the Deputy would like to refer me to an existing model in use by another agency as an example of what he is thinking about in that regard, I would be happy to explore that as well.  The Deputy's request to disapply GDPR is difficult, but look-----</p></speech>

It is sometimes misapplied, and I do not want that to happen in this case.  The Minister is again telling us that the coronial process is being disapplied in two out of three criteria, if I understood him correctly.  I may be mishearing the Minister, but he appears now to be saying that the coronial process is being completely disapplied.  My hearing could be at fault or I might be misinterpreting the Minister.  If I am, I will stand corrected.  However, there needs to be clarity in this regard, because I am a little more confused after the Minister's last intervention than I was before.  I ask the Minister to forgive me if I am wrong.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late.  I was on with the IT department for the last half an hour because my computer crashed.  I am back up and running now, it was nothing sinister and everything is fine.  I do not know what happened, so I apologise for coming in late.  The IT staff were very good, they sorted it all out for me.</p> <p>  I do not know if I might be going to repeat what has been said already, because I missed most of the meeting.  First, I thank the Minister for his engagement on this Bill and in respect of the mother and baby homes.  We all know how sensitive and complex this issue has been for families.  It is very important now that we listen to survivors.  In October, we protected the records and now it is important that there be access to those records.  I refer to proper access, so that people do not encounter barriers when they attempt to access their records.  One or two people who have contacted me are coming across such barriers, so I ask the Minister to address that aspect.  </p> <p>  We have all seen how much the Minister has done with this legislation, and it is important that we move on this issue without delay, especially concerning the site in Tuam.  I state that because we heard from the forensic teams just how fragile the situation is.  When is it expected that the legislation will be commenced?  From the oral submissions and from reading the written submissions, some issues arose in respect of the coroners.  I am aware this topic was just raised, in respect of disapplication.  The Minister was paying careful attention to the submissions received.  Can he talk us through that aspect?  He is assuring us that this initiative will be specific to this Bill.  However, was consideration given to reforming the Coroners Acts, as well as the resourcing of the coronial system?  I ask the Minister to examine that aspect.</p> <p>  My next question concerns situations where Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, does not have the required facilities.  Would it be possible for such capabilities to be procured or outsourced under the FSI governance structure?  What engagement has the Department had with the third-level institutions to see what resources we have in Ireland before we consider extending a search for facilities abroad?  The Minister might respond to me in respect of that issue.  We are only in the process of building a purpose-built FSI laboratory, which we have been planning for almost 20 years.  This lab is not expected to be operational until 2022, at the earliest.  I am concerned therefore, that from the get-go we will have to go abroad for expertise because we have limited relevant premises here.  That FSI lab is much needed, and the Minister understands that point.  I wonder if that aspect could be worked on.</p> <p>  I also want to inquire about the collection of DNA samples.  Do we have the potential to undertake a process of collecting DNA first?  Is the idea of destroying DNA after a short time connected with not having the FSI lab available yet?  Regarding collecting DNA, I am concerned that many of the relatives involved in this situation are getting older and are already at an advanced age.  However, under the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Act 2014 a DNA database was established in Ireland.  It is used as an intelligence source for criminal investigations, but also to help find missing people and identify unknown people.  Has FSI set up a system for volunteering DNA samples?  FSI was hiring forensic scientists grade 3 in the areas of DNA and chemical and physical analysis just last month.  What resources are available if we do take on board the suggestions made by survivors to begin the collection of DNA samples now?  Some families would be willing volunteers.  Did the Minister examine that?  I thank the Minister and I again apologise for coming in late.  </p></speech>

We did cover a couple of those points earlier, so I will address some of the points that did not arise previously.  The Deputy asked about FSI and its powers.  We have set a power for FSI to engage in contracts where it may not have the required facilities.  FSI has significant expertise and capabilities, and I acknowledge that at the outset.  However, where FSI may not have particular capabilities on site, this legislation will grant it the right to contract out for required skills and capacities in Ireland or abroad.  That is appropriate in respect of ensuring we have the widest range of expertise available to us in the DNA identification process.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked some very specific questions, and I do not have all the answers on hand.</p><p>Much of that will come about in terms of the administration of the agency, but it will be set up with a view to having the widest possible availability of DNA and other identification techniques.  That is the right way to go about it.  </p><p> We discussed the collection of DNA.  There is provision for DNA to be collected prior to the agency being established.  That was suspended due to Covid because it is a situation where two people must be present and there is the transfer of a saliva swap as part of that process.  As restrictions continue to be reduced and as soon as we can ensure anyone involved will be fully vaccinated I will seek to initiate that process.  It is dependent on vaccine roll-out, but I am conscious, particularly as the Deputy said, given the age of the people involved that it is important we start collecting that DNA as quickly as possible.</p><p> In terms of the Coroners Act, what we are disapplying is the exhumation and identifications powers of the coroner.  Those are the two elements of the coronial Act we are proposing to disapply. We are not proposing to disapply any other elements of the existing coronial legislation.  </p><p> The Deputy asked when the legislation will be commenced.  It depends on when it is passed by the Oireachtas, but I am very eager, as I believe everyone is, to get this agency set up and operating initially on the Tuam site as quickly as possible.  There will certainly be no barrier put in place by my Department in achieving that.</p><p> On the issue of wider access to information, we touched on that earlier.  We have provided GDPR access to the archive of the commission but I always said it was the birth information and tracing legislation that would be the ultimate key to providing access to information.  As I said, I look forward to working with the Chairman and all the members of the committee to get that legislation passed as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Very good.  I thank the Minster very much for being with us and for all of the engagement.  As I have said a few times regarding this Bill, it just shows the importance of the prelegislative scrutiny process.  We have had a great number of hearings and I echo what others have said about the power of the coroner.  That point has come through strongly in our discussions.</p> <p>  We hope to have our report completed shortly and we would then appeal to the Minister to examine it and take on board any suggestions and possible amendments from the committee.  They will have come forward on the back of expert testimony and the people we have heard from.  When we invite groups to appear before the committee it is important we really listen to what they have to say and try to change the legislation in that regard and not have people in merely to tick a box and for nothing to happen with respect to what they have told us.  That is really important.  </p> <p>  The next process regarding the adoption and tracing information will also involve a great deal of work, but we are all very much looking forward to playing our role in that to ensure, finally, after so many years there will be justice in various forms, hopefully, for survivors of the institutional mother and baby homes.  </p> <p>  I thank the Minister again and also Ms Dara Breathnach who is with him today.  I thank all the members for their co-operation.  I need to get their agreement to publish the Minister's opening statement to the Oireachtas website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

Apologies have been received from Deputies Paul Kehoe and P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan.  I remind attendees to ensure that their phones are switched off for the duration of this meeting; even if they are working remotely from their office and their phones are on silent, phones can still interfere with the sound and the broadcasting equipment.  The minutes of the meeting on 11 May 2021 have been circulated to all members.  Are the minutes agreed by the members?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The second item on the agenda is to meet with teachers and students unions on the topic of school bullying and the impact on mental health.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Matthew Ryan, welfare officer with the Irish Second-Level Students' Union, ISSU; Ms Anne Piggott, president of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland, ASTI; Mr. David O'Sullivan, assistant general secretary of Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO; and, Mr. David Duffy, education and research officer of the Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI.  </p> <p>  Witnesses are here today to brief the committee on school bullying and its impact on mental health.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Mr. Ryan to make an opening statement, then Ms Piggott, followed by Mr. O'Sullivan and then, finally, Mr. Duffy.  Statements will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  Each member has a six-minute slot in which they can ask questions and the witnesses can respond.  I ask members to stick rigidly to the six minutes.  </p> <p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the longstanding parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  As witnesses are giving evidence remotely from outside of the parliamentary precincts, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses have already been advised that they may think it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  They are reminded of the longstanding parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  I ask members, when it is their turn to speak, to confirm that they are in the precincts of Leinster House.  </p> <p>  I call on Mr. Ryan to make his opening statement, followed by the other witnesses, as outlined.  Witnesses have three minutes each, and I would appreciate if they could respect the three minutes. </p></speech>

I am the welfare officer of the Irish Second-Level Students&rsquo; Union, ISSU.  I want to express my views on how we can implement long-lasting solutions, as opposed to incremental quick fixes to bullying.  One thing that has always been apparent is that with issues like bullying, we often try to work from the top down and eradicate the issue as a whole.  Instead, I want to highlight the importance of the straightforward and pragmatic actions that, when combined, could yield a much more practical and useful solution.</p> <p>  We can begin to build the groundwork of a more accepting and inclusive school culture if we tackle issues such as our relationships and sexuality education, RSE, and social, personal and health, SPHE, curriculums, investigate and improve our referral system, look to how we can fully support our staff and pastoral care teams and implement a more holistic and realistic approach to education.</p> <p>  A lack of education can lead to animosity, so we need to teach our students as soon as they enter education about real world issues and use practical, up-to-date language.  Language is vitally important when it comes to tackling bullying.  The use of passive slurs and derogatory language in schools normalises the victimisation of certain groups.  The passing of a simple, snide remark can often snowball into full-on bullying.  We need an education system that is constantly adapting and evolving to the vernacular and vocabulary of each generation, something that is constantly changing.</p> <p>  It is also the belief that no one becomes a bully for no reason.  A reform, not reprimand, approach is needed.  This aims to help students who have bullied to learn and grow personally and help them in becoming more open and accepting of others.  We need to help both victims and perpetrators in this scenario.  We all have a duty to do everything possible in our power to help re-educate students who have bullied, so that they do not repeat this behaviour.  Where do we start?  The role of the parent or guardian in this process cannot be understated.  It is crucial that we upskill parents to help them become the key parties that they can be in tackling bullying.  It is also vital that we look at the mental health aspect of this.  Being the victim of bullying can manifest itself as intrusive or self-destructive thoughts.  It can cause a young person's belief in themselves to waiver.  They have thoughts of &ldquo;Why me?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What did I do?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What is wrong with me?&rdquo;  We need to support these students and equip them with the proper coping mechanisms they need.</p> <p>  Private psychotherapists can be expensive and this issue is particularly prevalent among young people of more disadvantaged backgrounds.  I ask the committee to look into how we can better equip our pastoral care teams to deal with serious cases of bullying.  I ask that all educational stakeholders and the National Educational Psychology Service, NEPS, are engaged in this process.  I would also urge the committee to look at the mental health funding available.  In 2021, only &euro;50 million was allocated to mental health services.</p><p>This needs to improve.  There is a dire need for greater funding, but also for better management of how and where it is spent.  It is sometimes the case that the default is the typical posters or awareness campaigns but the truth is that these are often not enough.  I ask that the committee work to aid the establishment of student councils across the country as they provide invaluable insight to schools when they are drafting or reviewing their anti-bullying policies.</p><p> I wish to finish with the message that we need to have strong and solid foundations before we can build anything on them.  We need to look at the way we educate as a whole.  The tangible solutions I have mentioned and those outlined in our written submission are but a start.  I welcome any and all questions the committee may have.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.</p></speech>

This extract is from a coroner&rsquo;s report in America about a girl who was described in a newspaper as "a beautiful sensitive and capable teenager".  I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak about bullying, which is potentially devastating for its victims and can have fatal consequences.</p> <p>  Many definitions of bullying abound.  The Department of Education defines it as "unwanted negative behaviour, verbal, psychological, or physical, conducted by an individual or group against another person (or persons) which is repeated over time".  Clinical definitions do not capture the impact of the relentless, emotional and painful torture caused by bullying, or the loss of self-esteem, hindered opportunities, feelings of uselessness and lifelong implications of persecuting behaviour.  This often occurs where there is a power imbalance.</p> <p>  The stereotype of the schoolyard bully taking lunch money fails to encompass the wider reality.  Bullies are often charismatic and charming.  They please and impress superiors and demand the respect of others for whom they show little regard.  Definitions often omit how subtle bullying can be.  It is often the case that the victim wonders if they imagined or even deserved it.  Bystanders witnessing events stay quiet out of fear or perhaps for personal gain.</p> <p>  Cyberbullying is a significant concern. It is intrusive and constantly on.  Digital devices delve into worlds where just one abusive comment or a displayed photograph may always exist to the victim's utter dismay.  Perpetrators can be anonymous and the distress of the sufferer may be unknown to anyone.  Victims are often fearful of further reprisals or may not want others to know about their embarrassing online abuse.  They can lose concentration and become withdrawn, isolated and depressed.</p> <p>  Schools have a duty of care and, although they are required to have policies and procedures, it is difficult to know who is being targeted and how much victimisation occurs, particularly with regard to cyberbullying.  Several improvements need to be made in order to control intimidation in school environments.  Measures must include more guidance counsellors, restoration of middle management positions, prioritisation of well-being, relevant training for teachers and smaller classes.  A reduction in work overload would allow time for extra-curricular activities and room to foster school connectivity.</p></speech>

The INTO recognises the impact that school bullying can have on the mental health of pupils and teachers and is committed to tackling all forms of bullying.  We endeavour to provide as much support and assistance as possible to our members and schools.</p> <p>  When members think back to their own school days, they may remember the culture and classroom environment that predominantly prevailed, where there was much focus and emphasis on achievement.  The sands have shifted and are continuing to shift to a greater focus and emphasis on pupil well-being.  Nowadays, there are a range of policies, procedures, practices and strategies in schools to promote pupil well-being.  Fostering well-being is one the competencies that will underpin a revised primary school curriculum currently being prepared by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA.  Although we are on the right track, there is still some way to go in terms of supporting pupil well-being in schools.  Teacher professional development and learning programmes should include a dimension on well-being.</p> <p>  Bullying can be overt or subtle and can be racial, homophobic, disability related or based on any form of difference.  Bullying, regardless of form or type, can have an impact on mental health.  As regards LGBT+ bullying, in February 2020 the INTO published the results of a survey carried out with teachers.  The survey found that the majority of respondents reported that they had not received any training in how to educate about and prevent homophobic or transphobic bullying and a large cohort stated that they would like training in this area.  We recommend that there is a need for the updating of the anti-bullying procedures for schools, as well as for professional development and strategies and supports to address identity-based bullying and cyberbullying.</p> <p>  Teachers have a strong sense of responsibility towards their pupils.  However, they are not psychologists or psychiatrists.  Psychological, socio-emotional and mental health supports are practically non-existent for primary pupils.  Both the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, CAMHS, are understaffed and should be expanded.  The INTO recommends that schools should have counsellors and therapists available to pupils who require such interventions and supports when they have experienced bullying or engaged in bullying behaviours.  Such supports would go a long way in having a positive impact on mental health.</p> <p>  Schools are also places of employment.  Teachers are often subject to inappropriate behaviour.  Although not often named, but identifiable in some cases, teachers are often subject to negative comments and untoward behaviour from parents on social media platforms.  The importance of an inclusive school environment for all members of the school community cannot be overstated.  The INTO is concerned that teachers who identify as LGBT+ may not always feel accepted or represented in their workplaces.  That has to change.  We recommend that teachers are provided with comprehensive professional development, training and support in LGBT+ inclusion and visibility within the school environment.  All teachers, irrespective of their sexual orientation, race or disability, must be treated with dignity and respect in their workplaces.</p> <p>  In conclusion, as there must be a shared responsibility to tackle bullying in society, this should also be the case in schools.  School leaders and principal teachers must be adequately supported through a further restoration of middle management posts.  This is vital in order to create and-or maintain a culture of inclusion and acceptance.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.387" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051800002#B00700"><p>The TUI thanks the Chair and the committee for the opportunity to make this opening statement.  I will be pleased to answer any questions thereafter.  Bullying is a damaging experience for students and the wider school community.  The TUI and its members are committed to the prevention and elimination of bullying in schools and are proactively engaging with school communities to this end.  Research points to the fact that Irish children and students are significantly less likely to encounter chronic bullying than the OECD average.  A recent survey found that bullying of young people has halved in the past 20 years and is now significantly lower than the international average.</p> <p>  While certainly a cause for optimism, these facts must be viewed in the context of the emergence of online bullying.  Online bullying can be more harmful than traditional forms of bullying.  It is relentless, has the potential to reach a large audience and is nameless and faceless.  It often encourages others to participate in commentary which means that, even when very little of it is published, it can have far-reaching consequences for the victims.</p> <p>  The use of online platforms has also allowed the bullying of school staff to become a problem.  Staff are entitled to dignity and safety in their workplace.  School leaders and teachers are sometimes the subject of derogatory and even defamatory comment on social media sites.  They are easy targets.  Online bullying is particularly harmful and, in extreme cases, can lead to teachers leaving the profession, which will further exacerbate the teacher supply problem.  To protect staff and the whole school community, clear guidelines and processes for investigation are essential in order to deal with the perpetrators.</p> <p>  The TUI is concerned that post Covid there may be a rise in certain types of bullying in schools.  Covid-19 has exacerbated and highlighted socio-economic and educational disadvantage.  In light of the in-school teaching time that has already been lost, it would be horrendous if a fear of bullying were to cause students to refuse to return to school.  Concerns have been raised that teachers may become the victims of bullying as a result of their engagement in the accredited grades process.</p> <p>  Bullying does not just occur in schools.  It is often a matter for parents and communities to address and occasionally, in very severe incidents, for the Garda to investigate.  Schools cannot be held accountable for matters that arise outside of their control.  Schools are doing what they can to minimise bullying when students are in school and when they are informed of the problem.</p> <p>  The TUI makes the following recommendations to the committee.</p><p>It is essential that guidance allocation, middle management posts and pastoral care supports to schools be dramatically increased.  While recent changes in middle management are a small step in supporting students in difficulty, a much larger move in terms of full restoration is required.  Significant investment is needed in out-of-school supports such as CAMHS and NEPS if the school is to adequately support the affected students, both victims and perpetrators.  Such supports are currently inadequate or lacking.   Addressing the issue of bullying requires a whole-school partnership approach of students, parents and school staff.  The provision of home school community liaison officers, HSCLOs, in every school in this context would be invaluable.  Appropriate training, resources and time need to be put in place for the entire school community, including the board of management.  Staff need time to engage in continuous professional development.  The anti-bullying procedures for primary and post-primary schools, which were published in 2013, should be updated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.389" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051800002#C00200"><p>The past couple of weeks during which we have been examining this issue have been fascinating but upsetting and very worrying.  There is no doubt but that the impact of bullying on so many families and individuals, children and adults, can be really profound.  It is appropriate that we reflect here that a lot of discussion has concerned the bullying of children and rightly so, but we also need to remember that schools are workplaces and employers have a responsibility to support their staff when instances of bullying emerge and protect them from bullying.  While schools and school staff, including SNAs, have a very significant role to play, we cannot expect our schools and our teachers to solve all the problems relating to this issue.  It is vital that schools have access to relevant professionals such as psychologists when they are needed.</p> <p>  I will not get the response from all four witnesses in the limited time available to me so I might come back to the INTO at the end if I get in again.  My first question is for Mr. Ryan.  Regarding the submission from the ISSU, there is a fair bit of comment on the reform of relationships and sexuality education, RSE, which has been in the news a lot to the effect that it is outdated and inconsistent.  Does Mr. Ryan have any views on how it can be improved?  Is it his experience that it in some way contributes to the "othering" of students or people feeling excluded?  </p> <p>  The ASTI and the TUI have raised very interesting points as proposals we can address.  Could we get further comment from the witnesses from both unions?  HSCLOs play such an important role in ensuring that not every crisis in a school ends up on the principal's desk.  They can address some of these issues and build relationships.  Could the witnesses comment on the benefits of that?  The proposal that there be a liaison officer within the major social media platforms to work with schools is very interesting because these issues constantly evolve.  Obviously, we must all ensure that we are as up to date as possible but it is a really interesting proposal and I would appreciate some elaboration on it.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.390" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matthew Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051800002#C00300"><p>RSE has been in the spotlight lately.  From our experience, if students receive RSE at all, it is very inconsistent regarding when and how they receive it.  It is very heteronormative and exclusive.  It focuses on the average white straight couple and does not include anything about intimacy or maintaining relationships.  A lot of students would say that they learn more about sexuality and sexuality education from the biology course than from the RSE course.  There is a big fear of language and the stigmatisation around it in RSE.  It is difficult for a teacher to stand up in front of a class of 30 students and talk about pleasure, orgasms and things like that without there being that natural fear of what they might hear back.  However, we need to remember that if we are not giving students this adequate RSE, every year, a massive cohort of students graduate from sixth year and move on to third level without any education in this area.  The only education they have received regarding RSE is from third party sources and the Internet, which oftentimes can be very inconsistent and dangerous.  So the lack of a RSE curriculum leads to a lack of understanding, which leads to animosity and a lack of inclusion.  It leads to a very negative school environment so I would encourage us engaging with the NCCA to reform the RSE curriculum, roll it out and get it working properly so that we can educate students on what they need to know because they are learning it themselves.  The age of consent is 17 but students are becoming sexually active long before that and are learning these things as they go by trial and error, which is a dangerous precedent to be setting for young people.  We need to listen to young people on that issue and hear what they want as opposed to telling them "this is what you need from an RSE curriculum" as opposed to them saying "well this is what we actually would benefit from in an RSE curriculum".</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said he had a question-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.393" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051800002#C00600"><p>There are a few strands to the Deputy's question.  There is a need for a HSCLO in every school.  At the moment, HSCLOs are only available in DEIS schools.  We are looking at around 30% of all schools in the country but bullying is not restricted to any one sector or individual school.  We must deal with it across the system so there needs to be a HSCLO for that vital liaison between, as Mr. Ryan mentioned, the home and the school.  As the Deputy noted, this is not just an issue where a school, home or community can fix a problem.  It is across the entire system so HSCLOs play a vital role in that.</p> <p>  Ms Piggott mentioned the importance of guidance.  There has been an increase in guidance support over the past few years, which needs to be recognised, but we do not have the ex quota guidance support we had previously.  I note the second topic with which we are dealing today is the impact on mental health.  Guidance counsellors in post-primary schools are the main line of defence in respect of this.  Year heads are the very first line of defence in post-primary schools.  Again, as Ms Piggott mentioned, we have seen a significant cut in middle management posts of the order of almost 50%.  There has been some alleviation over recent years, including one quite recently, but we are still a very long way off where we were ten years ago.  They are often the ones who will see a student is having difficulties.</p></speech>

I also think we should have links with corporate companies involved with online media platforms.  At least then they could be told to take down material.  The Deputy also mentioned adult bullying in schools, which is very serious.  That needs further investigation following on from when the committee has finished looking at the bullying of children and how they feel and cope.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1654" speakername="Aisling Dolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051800002#C00900"><p>I thank Mr. Ryan for his contribution.  He mentioned parents.  I was curious about that as I feel it is more a matter for schools.  How do we upskill parents and get them more involved?  I have a couple of ideas but I would like to hear Mr. Ryan's views.</p> <p>  I am a bit surprised regarding teachers' unions.  Over the past number of weeks with the contributions to the debate on bullying we have heard, what has emerged is how important the school environment is.  Not one of the groups here has tackled that.  I was also surprised by Mr. Duffy's statistics and the optimism he indicated when it comes to bullying when everything we have heard over the past year has shown that over one in three students have suffered from bullying.</p><p>Perhaps cyberbullying was not included in the statistics.  I am very surprised by them.<br/><br/>I understand that teachers also suffer from bullying but the focus here is on children who take their own lives due to bullying.  In the past few months, the committee has heard about terrible cases of severe bullying.<br/><br/>Mr. O'Sullivan from the INTO indicated there is no training for teachers in primary and post-primary schools.  In that regard, a number of groups have not mentioned, including Dublin City University's anti-bullying centre, the FUSE programme, which has been rolled out, and SOAR, which does early intervention in transition year.  Why was training not part of the presentations?  How important is it?  There is training available.  The <i>tacklebullying,ie</i>and <i>webwise.ie</i>websites are available and there is information available to teachers and parents.  I am a little annoyed to be honest.<br/><br/>I ask each of the representatives from the teaching unions to give an example of a positive school environment.  I understand we need more training for career guidance.  There has been investment in NEPS.  What is a positive school environment versus one that does not embrace a culture of engaging with bullying, not just an anti-bullying policy?</p></speech>

One of the first points I made was that bullying is a damaging experience for students and the wider school community.  We certainly believe it a very serious problem.<br/><br/>The Senator referred to the statistics.  People are quite surprised that the statistics that I use are from UNICEF, the OECD and a study by Rawdon <i>et al</i>.  I am more than happy to give the Senator more details on that study later.  I cited international statistics from organisations like UNICEF and the OECD.<br/><br/>On the role of schools, schools definitely have a significant role to play but that is not say others do not also have a role.  Of course, bullying is a serious issue.<br/><br/>If I understood the Senator correctly, she asked about the school climate.  I believe the vast majority of schools have a very positive climate but that is not to say that individual problems cannot arise.  Sometimes they can be quite serious.  I am certainly not minimising the issue.  There are supports that are essential to schools, for example, NEPS and CAMHS, which are beyond the control of schools.</p></speech>

On training, while I am aware of the FUSE programme provided by DCU and other initiatives such as Webwise, I was drawing the attention of the committee to a national programme of training.  There is no national central policy on what training should in place.  Other agencies have devised programmes but we are seeking a national programme for training.</p> <p>  There is a shared responsibility.  We all have the same shared objective in trying to address school bullying.  Schools take preventative measures by having awareness weeks and posters.  They create a culture of openness so that parents can come into schools to address any issues and concerns.  It is important that parents do that sooner rather than later in order that schools can invoke their anti-bullying policies.  When issues arise, teachers are well versed in engaging in restorative practice.</p></speech>

Will Mr. O'Sullivan give an example of the measures a school will take when there is an instance of bullying?</p></speech>

It is all about the proportionality and, again, it is about mending relationships.  Schools have their anti-bullying policies that they will invoke.  They will engage with the parties and consider strategies because it is important that all relationships are mended.  That is what teachers spend some of their time doing.  It is the person who has been bullied and the perpetrator.  These pupils must share a classroom, sometimes in groups of 30.  Teachers invest their quality time in restorative practice and mending those relationships.  There are problems and sometimes it can be a little more challenging to mend relationships but teachers are wholly committed to having relationships restored.</p></speech>

If it is physical, for example, somebody has a black eye or students are caught fighting, that is easy to deal with because it is visible.  However, there are other very subtle cases going on and if somebody does not speak up, the teacher will not know.  Teachers must make sure they have the best possible relationship with their students so they feel they can talk to their teachers.  Maybe a school, through the student council, could go through the policy on bullying.  Every student council member should then go back to their class and inform their classmates.  We need to create a culture whereby students know it is real if it is happening and they can talk.  According to a report issued earlier this week by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, sometimes young people just need one good adult.  If every student could have one good adult, that would be a huge achievement for us.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for attending before the committee this afternoon.</p> <p>  I will start by asking Ms Piggott and Mr. Duffy a question.  I am conscious that society in general and politicians in particular very frequently ask teachers to solve issues concerning society, whether it be issues concerning sexual development, sexual education or issues pertaining to consent.  Bullying is one of those issues as well.  Describing bullying as school bullying narrows it down because it is an issue that extends much beyond schools.  Rather than putting all responsibility on teachers, what responsibility to tackle bullying should be placed on social media companies or other actors outside teachers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.407" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann Piggott" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051800002#D01100"><p>To begin with, social media companies should monitor their sites.  Some bullying instances are obvious because they involve really bad or negative comments that encourage others to join in and jeer at people.  There could be a large number of comments.  I am sure politicians get these readily.  Even adults find it hard to cope with such comments, so it must be devastating for children of 13 or 14 years.  As soon as social media companies see such comments, they should remove or take them down or be found responsible and fined.  Legislation should be in place to prohibit this, particularly with regard to young people.</p> <p>  In terms of wider society, parents could get involved in helping us.  Local businesses that are located close to schools might observe things that we do not see.  There is also a major role to be played by the inspectorate.  Whole-school evaluations should focus on bullying.  Likewise, there should even be special inspections that focus solely on bullying, survey and interview students and work from there.  That is how we can go forward. </p></speech>

What is the general response of parents when it is brought to their attention that their child has been involved in bullying?  Is there a universal response or is there a lack of concern on the part of parents in general?</p></speech>

An awful lot of organisations have responsibility - the social media companies, schools, parents and the general community.  Bullying, particularly cyberbullying, is not restricted by time or place so we all have a responsibility to make sure we prevent it as much as we possibly can and deal with it as well as we can when it does happen.</p> <p>  On where bullying can take place, an interesting report during lockdown - in February last - indicated that the incidence of cyberbullying rose dramatically when the schools were closed.  That is not to say that schools do not have cases to deal with as well.  It is interesting that bullying takes place in many different contexts.  Schools have to deal with bullying that happens within their control and jurisdiction when they become aware of it.</p><p>I will address the question on the conversation with parents where possibly a child may be suspected of engaging in bullying.  I can say from personal experience that it is an incredibly difficult conversation.  It is important to remember that the research suggests the vast majority of people who engage in bullying are themselves victims of bullying in a different context.  That has to be borne in mind.  It can be a difficult conversation.  Naturally, parents will be deeply concerned if there is a fear around that of if a child is suspected of any misconduct in the school, whether it is bullying or anything else.  Understandably, the parents are going to be worried and can be distressed.  There needs to be support and understanding all round.  That is why guidance counsellors, home school liaison officers and year heads are important in mediating and in showing everyone that we all have responsibility.</p></speech>

We sometimes forget that many teachers are young people themselves.  Often they are young people in their early 20s.  I am interested to hear about the incidence of bullying of teachers.  Is that an ongoing problem in schools?  Is it an infrequent occurrence?  If it is a problem, how is it dealt with?</p></speech>

Ideally, schools have open engagement whereby if parents have any issues or concerns they are encouraged to address them with the school.  There have been incidents of commentary online relating to teachers.  Where that has arisen our members generally raise the matter with the school management, who would generally tend to engage with the parents in question, set out what the policy is and explain that any issues or concerns should be addressed directly to the school, because that is the appropriate platform on which issues should be addressed.</p></speech>

As I read through them I found things that I strongly endorse as well as some things with which I disagree with equal enthusiasm.  It is probably the case that we need more than six minutes to hear ourselves out fully.</p> <p>  What struck me most was that I strongly endorse the need to focus more on the issue of teenage suicide.  We all have to be careful how we speak about the topic.  Importantly, the Teachers' Union of Ireland draws the link between the unacceptable waiting list for a first appointment with the HSE child and adolescent mental health services and the fact that Ireland has the fourth highest incidence of teenage suicide in the European Union.</p> <p>  Reference was made to a staffing problem.  Of all the things I have seen I would put that close to the top, if not at the top.  It is a remarkable statement around our society that we have such a major social threat but that we are so behind in resourcing the problem.</p> <p>  I note what the Irish Second-Level Students' Union said.  The union talked rightly about the strong referral system that is imperative to lower rates of self-harm, suicidal ideation and suicide among students.  That is important and I am keen to join the ISSU in putting the stress on that.</p> <p>  Where I disagree with several of the submissions is in the attempt to draw a causal link between relationship and sexuality education as it now stands where it does not meet the aspirations of some students, parents or representative groups and the problem of bullying.  I believe we need to think that out more carefully.</p> <p>  From my point of view the Christian gospel proposes a message of unconditional love.  However, in all areas of life, including, but not confined to sexuality, there is often a challenge as well.  The history of Irish education has provided much of the inspiration and rationalisation of so much that we take for granted as being necessary for an education system, especially in the whole area of inclusion.  One thinks of the outreach in the developing world and outreach to people with disabilities.</p> <p>  I come from a generation whereby I witnessed children with intellectual disabilities being beaten in my school, so I am not claiming anything.  We have come a long way in many areas.  Yet, as long as there are free and thinking people in our society the ethics around human sexuality will be contested.  There are people who have what one might call a traditional Christian view - even non-believers may have a traditional view around human sexuality - and who propose that in education respectfully with the support of parents.  They do not simply see sexuality in recreational terms.  They see it in terms of human beings honouring each other.  It seems that those people are among the greatest allies in the fight against bullying.  There is a real danger of demonising them if we portray their ideas and values as somehow causative of bullying.  Far more work needs to be done there and I would invite comments from the representatives present on that.</p> <p>  The last thing I would invite comments on from the representatives is something I have mentioned to various contributors in recent weeks.  Are we talking enough about building resilience among students in respect of bullying?  I have heard much about the need to promote upstanding and about getting people to stand up when they witness or encounter bullying against a third party, and I am all for that.  I believe in building resilience in helping young people to understand what is happening to them and not to let it cripple them, as it were, and to help them to be strong enough to push back against that.  That is an important area of endeavour but it is not being given enough attention by those who are working and speaking about combatting bullying.  I have used up four minutes.  I would be delighted to hear what the representatives have to say and to continue this conversation at some other point.</p></speech>

I disagree with the point made because there are major links between the RSE course and the way students interact with each other.  I will read out some quotations from a survey I conducted within our union before drafting my policy.  These are all anonymous quotations.</p> <blockquote> 	I often felt left out when I was younger, especially when I came out.  People would ask inappropriate questions and harass me and my girlfriend.  People tried to grab her other hand while we held hands and asked if we had kissed or had had sex.  We were 13. </blockquote> <p>This happens if we are not educating our students with adequate RSE.  That is the realistic view of students.  It is very out of touch with students to say that sex is a big huge thing.  It is not anymore these days with young people.  It is a very different thing from what it was 30 years ago.  We need to educate young people on the issue as opposed to telling them what we think was right 30 years ago, because it is a completely different timeframe.  If I have the time I will read out the second quote:</p> <blockquote> 	People would make inappropriate comments and harass me about being gay.  Either I was being made fun of or ignored, even before I came out.  In first year, the boys thought it was funny to make weird comments to all the girls by talking about condoms and making lewd suggestions.  One boy even rubbed his crotch on the corners of the girls' tables asking if they wanted to use his ruler.  Another held up a drill piece asking if they wanted it up their fannies.  This happened repeatedly. </blockquote> <p>That only stems from a lack of education.  A remark like that is only made through a lack of education and ignorance.  We need to educate our young people from the age of 13, because we know that is how young this is happening.  I strongly disagree that there are no links between the RSE curriculum and bullying.</p></speech>

Anyone can be bullied at any point for any particular reason.  A person may be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  A person may be jealous or maybe someone got 100% in a test.  I do not believe we can narrow it to any one reason but we should keep talking about it and make people aware that it is happening.  We need to highlight that people have to talk to others.  That is where we have to go in future.</p></speech>

The inclusion of well-being on the curriculum is welcome.  It should be underpinned by supports, training and resources for these key skills.  If interactions occur, then pupils can deal with them through certain skills.  This can help to build capacity in pupils to deal with incidental matters as they arise as well.</p></speech>

Suicide and suicidal ideation are incredibly serious.</p><p>NEPS and CAMHS are agencies on which schools rely very heavily if a student is in a crisis.  A report published in 2018 by an Oireachtas committee found that NEPS was significantly understaffed, while a study published by the Department of Education in 2020 found referrals to CAMHS had risen by more than 50% in seven years.  The committee needs to bear in mind that student numbers will rise dramatically in post-primary schools in the coming years.  When there is a crisis, schools need to be able to rely on these services.  I need to make clear that I am not criticising the staff involved in those services, who are dealing with caseloads that are simply unmanageable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.422" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051800002#F00200"><p>I thank all of our guests.  I enjoyed listening to their perspectives, as always.  I will first address the issue of RSE, on which I fundamentally disagree with Senator Mullen.  People need to see their families and their lives reflected in the kind of education they get and they need to feel comfortable in their own skin to be resilient and show compassion and empathy for others.  That is essential.  I welcome any comments in that regard because a point that has not been addressed is that of empathy and how linked it is to whether people go on to bully.  Having empathy means you have to see other people and respect them equally.  Mr. Ryan may have some perspectives on that.</p> <p>  One of the issues is the patronage system we have.  It means people do not always have a choice and their religion or lack of religion is not always reflected in the school they attend.  That means we need a broader kind of education in terms of sex education and relationship education that caters for everybody across all schools.  Alternatively, we need to dismantle the patronage system, or do both.  In the immediate term, RSE certainly needs to be brought in in a way that reflects the whole of society in every school.</p> <p>  On the bystander point that was raised, and particularly in the context of the point of view of teachers and young people, it was brought up at the committee meeting before last that the issue of the bystander can be quite challenging.  It is difficult to put people in the position of always having to be the ones to take action.  Are we putting too much on young people to try to sort out problems when the problems are structural?  I have not heard anything from the teachers' unions in particular around whether there are structures within education that could change and could be easier to implement before it gets to the point where there may be a need to call in other people.  I refer to structures with which teachers would feel comfortable, such as mentoring and having the student voice involved in coming up with the decisions around how schools function for everybody while showing equal respect for adults and young people.</p></speech>

It is crucially important we have an unbiased RSE curriculum and an unbiased curriculum in general.  As I stated, the current RSE curriculum is based around the stereotypical, heteronormative white couple and that is simply not reflective of what students are.  If students cannot see themselves in a curriculum, they will not engage with it.  If they see people who are nothing like them, they will not engage with that because it is not them.</p> <p>  On the point in respect of bystanders, I point out how important it is to start with the grassroots and the small changes we can make.  In a group of six people, for example, there may be one person who could be considered a bully, while the other five may be complete bystanders who have never engaged and would never engage in bullying.  However, when their friend decides to bully another person, it is very difficult for them to stand up against their friend for fear of retaliation or being seen as lesser by that person.  It is very important to acknowledge in the context of the bystander and standing up that it is very difficult because bullying often happens purposefully out of sight, such as when a person walks into a bathroom and tries to get to the stalls but is slammed on the way in or comments are made or anti-Semitic comments are written on the walls of the bathroom.  It is very difficult to escape it but it is also very difficult to ask teachers to intervene if that is happening in bathrooms and such places.  That is why it comes back down to education and working on the smaller level to stop it at the grassroots.</p></speech>

I ask Ms Piggott, to be followed by Mr. O'Sullivan and Mr. Duffy, for a very brief response to Senator O'Reilly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.427" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann Piggott" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051800002#F00700"><p>I am interested in the Senator's remarks about empathy because bullies have no empathy whatsoever and sometimes show no remorse either.  It is very important that bystanders speak out and stand up, but the bystander may not even see the bullying.  For example, if a student who had an incident in the bathroom with a bully meets the perpetrator on the corridor the next day, the perpetrator might sneer at the victim.  A friend who sees that may not realise there is anything in it or realise the seriousness of the situation.  Some schools have mentoring programmes through which they match sixth years with first years, which helps the first years to settle.  It is a very good idea and could be used to progress this idea.</p></speech>

Although the Stay Safe programme has been in schools for several years, there has been a distinct lack of training for teachers in that regard.  It is now mandatory in schools and it is checked by inspectors as part of child safeguarding inspections and so forth.  The rolling out of a suite of training on that issue may go a long way to addressing it and giving the bystander not the power but the confidence to address issues as they arise in schools.</p></speech>

As Mr. Ryan and Ms Piggott have referenced, bullying can sometimes be very obvious, especially if there are physical injuries, whereas in other cases it can be insidious and very difficult to pick up on.  That is why everyone needs to be vigilant.</p> <p>  As regards possible solutions to it in the post-primary sector, the well-being programme at junior certificate level covers some of this area.  Obviously, more could be covered in that regard.  There needs to be continuing professional development for everyone, including members of boards of management, who, ultimately, are the ones who have to deal with much of the fallout.  The other thing that needs to happen is an update of the anti-bullying procedures from the Department.  The procedures were published in 2013 but, through no fault of anybody, the system has changed quite dramatically since then, so the procedures could do with an update.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I am slightly taken aback by some of the adversarial comments by some Government representatives towards the trade unions in particular, particularly given they are all on the front line and doing their best to deal with the issue of bullying.</p> <p>  Bullying can start in school but, obviously, it moves away from school by the nature of it.  As a result of the advent of smartphones, you can never really hide from it.  In years gone by, you could go back to the bosom of your family and worry about it on Monday but now smartphones give the ability for bullies to be at you, intimidate you, hurt you and harm you at all hours of the day and night.</p> <p>  I am also taken aback by comments about the nature of the RSE programme.  A total of 90% of primary schools are under the patronage of a church that believes women are second-class citizens and LGBT people are disordered.  As regards the patronage issue, we only managed to amend section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act a few years ago.  I was involved in that.  If a teacher is gay, divorced or a single parent, he or she is kind of under that ethos and is disadvantaged in trying to advocate for a more equal society and to point out homophobic or transphobic bullying or bullying that others people.</p><p>I refer back to something said here last week by Saoirse Brady, the legal officer for the Children's Rights Alliance.  She said one challenge we have is the lack of data and that schools sometimes struggle to ascertain proper data so that we can have a proper overview of when bullying starts, how much of it is racially motivated, how much is homophobic, or gender oriented?  I mentioned the age profile.  We do not know how violent it is, is it about exclusion, violence or is it about taunting?  That question was for everyone.  </p><p> Does Mr. Ryan believe the promised Government citizens' assembly on education is an appropriate avenue for us to deal with the totality of education, how our system is structured, how the patronage model works and how within that we can have a system where the Department plays an active role in the day-to-day management of schools?  Under our current system a huge amount of responsibility is left by the Department of Education to boards of management and patron bodies and therefore it dilutes the capacity of the elected representative or the constituted Department to have more of an influence than the patron bodies do.</p></speech>

I echo what was said on this topic at previous committee meetings in that there could be three schools on the same road, each dealing with bullying in a completely different way because it is very much up to the school at the moment.  It is also very difficult for the schools to engage with the Department, there is a very large gap there.  Many students do not even know who the Minister for Education is.  There is a fundamental gap between the students and teachers on the ground and the Department of Education at the top.  It is very difficult to tackle a bullying problem when one does not feel supported from the top.  There absolutely must be a more active role for the Department with schools on an every day basis.  Our report did call for an annual review of the Department's anti-bullying policies, just as schools have to, because we are working with outdated material so it is very difficult for schools.</p></speech>

Perhaps we need to start looking at schools and see where the high numbers are, monitoring those and going into those schools.  Every school should have templates that are filled out by teachers when students are bullied.  That has to be the unfortunate starting point, and work from there.  Otherwise, who can tell when it starts?  It probably never finishes.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned cyberbullying which is a particularly insidious thing because one can never actually get away from it, as the Deputy mentioned.  If cyberbullying takes place at 10 p.m. on a Saturday night, there is a limit as to what a school can do about it in the immediate case, even if it becomes aware of it.  This is why everyone needs to work together on it.  Cyberbullying is something one will never escape from.</p></speech>

Students provide invaluable insight to schools when they are reviewing their bullying policies on an annual basis because only students know what students are going through and they can say clearly what is happening and what they need supports for.  It is sometimes difficult.  One of the biggest challenges ISSU faces is the establishment of student councils and how they are treated.  They are often set up so that schools can say they have done it but then they are not actually engaged with and they have to push and fight to be heard.  When they are met with, they are treated as students, as though they are just giving a student opinion, as opposed to representatives of the student body which is what they are - they are bringing their peers' views to the higher bodies in the schools so that they can actually do something about it.  The main things are, first, to support the establishment of the councils and making sure that every school in the country has one so the student voice can be heard.  Second, ensuring that they are treated as equal stakeholders because they do make up the largest stakeholders in the education system.  When they are not treated like that it is infuriating, especially on an issue such as bullying where students can offer such invaluable insight because they have been and are going through it themselves.  It is imperative that the councils are set up and supported.</p></speech>

To the INTO and TUI, how can we introduce a higher value on social and emotional intelligence?  The whole curriculum is designed around stuffing in as much information as possible and vomiting it out on a paper for an exam.  What is needed in schools to prioritise social and emotional intelligence?</p></speech>

The introduction of well-being on the curriculum is a very welcome step and we would obviously call for resources, appropriate training and the supports to be put in place as well.</p></speech>

That is why we need a radical reform of the whole curriculum, particularly at second level.  I am very conscious that we are talking about schools here, but not all schools are the same.  Some are excellent, very outward looking, and embrace all these things.  However, I am conscious of the level of bureaucracy and the high levels of work for teachers in schools and the impact of pupil teacher ratios in all of this in striving to do what is required of them and the load they have on them all the time.</p> <p>  On the impossible caseloads of CAMHS and NEPS, we must ask when is a service not a service?  It is when it is not accessible or not accessible in a timely way.  That is no reflection on either those working within NEPS or CAMHS but it is just not fit for purpose.  We are told that millions and billions of euro are being made available for mental health.  As public representatives, we all get calls from parents all of the time who need their children to access CAMHS and NEPS, but the service is just not there.  It is not even there in the form of a call back.</p><p>For teachers and parents who do not have that, no matter how well intentioned they are, it is causing a blockage.  What can be done for CAMHS and NEPS in this regard?</p></speech>

The TUI, in its commentary on that report, believes that education should be respected in its widest sense.  While it has a role in preparing for the labour market and for further and higher education, it also has a role in the sense of education for education's sake, and much of the social and emotional aspect will come into that.</p> <p>  As for CAMHS, NEPS and so on, staff, through no fault of their own, are under severe pressure.  Schools find it difficult to get support for students in crisis.</p> <p>  On the other supports needed for schools to deal with social and emotional intelligence and students in crisis, there are pastoral supports such as guidance counsellors, middle management and home school and community liaison officers, HSCLOs.  The Deputy referred to the pupil-teacher ratio.  If staff have fewer students at any point, they are more likely to be able to pick up on those small triggers that show that a student is possibly displaying the first signs of difficulty.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Ryan for attending.  His facial expression, like mine, said it all as Senator Mullen spoke.  I felt a little embarrassed for the Senator and had to turn off my webcam as I was listening to some of his inappropriate comments.  I apologise for them.</p> <p>  I am a member of the Traveller community.  I have not heard Travellers mentioned once in this discussion or in our guests' submissions, although they mentioned racism and discrimination.  The same is true of the Muslim community and Muslim women who have to wear a hijab.  Last year and early this year, in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement, we heard from many people.  A young woman from Kildare spoke about being bullied at school and about many young Black students being bullied at school.  Mr. Ryan spoke about how the curriculum system needs to speak to communities and individuals, with the inclusion of people who look like them.</p> <p>  We are still under-represented professionally.  There are not enough Black, Traveller or trans teachers in the education system.  How can the curriculum system be made more inclusive to educate students about racism and discrimination?  At present, I am waiting for the Minister, Deputy Foley, to progress a Bill that has already been debated, although it does not seem as if that will happen any time soon.  It is called the Traveller History and Education Cultural Bill 2018.  It is very important for members of the Traveller community that that be included in the curriculum system.  It is not Travellers who need to be educated about Travellers, however, but rather students from the general population.  I am interested in hearing all our guests' opinions on how the curriculum system can be made more inclusive and how we should educate both teachers and students about people from ethnic minority groups.  Trans people are a big part of that.  Should there be a module on racial discrimination and fairness within the school system?</p> <p>  Finally, we have not touched on the yellow flag programme, which is delivered by the Irish Traveller Movement.  It is an inclusive flag and every school should fly it.</p> <p>  I thank all our guests for their attendance and Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh for allowing me to contribute before him.</p></speech>

We must not speak for anyone but rather with them.  In education, there is often a default of speaking for people and saying this is what people need to be educated about on these issues.  Even in religion classes, where a White teacher might educate on, say, the Muslim faith, the Muslim students may be sitting there and wondering why they are not included in the conversation, or why they are being spoken for instead of being spoken with.  Language and the way we speak with people instead of about them is very important.</p> <p>  Language can be so much more inclusive than it normally is.  We have the default of using "he or she", whereas if we change that to "they", it will be much more inclusive of students who might be non-binary and might not identify with the "he or she" pronouns.  Little things like that can make the school culture more inclusive.  If a student is sitting in class and is not feeling represented, or if someone is speaking about only "he or she" or one particular group people, and if the student does not identify with that, immediately that student will feel ostracised and will not feel part of the conversation.  That culture change that needs to happen.  It has to happen actively; we cannot just say it needs to happen.</p></speech>

There is plenty of scope, under the nine grounds of discrimination and so on, where there would be an avenue for that.  There are brilliant displays of the Senator's culture and its crafts.  Perhaps members of the Traveller community should be more commonly invited in to schools as guest speakers.</p></speech>

Sadly, it happens in society and schools are a microcosm of society, so sometimes it happens in schools.  We need to address it every time it happens.</p> <p>  The TUI has always argued that the teaching workforce has to be diverse.  The longer period of teacher training that has been in place in recent years has in some ways created a greater difficulty in trying to achieve that because it means that if a teacher comes from certain socioeconomic backgrounds, it will be harder for him or her to engage in the process.</p> <p>  On anti-racism, a few very good programmes operate in schools, such as Anti-Racism Week and so on.  As Ms Piggott and Mr. Ryan quite rightly said, it needs to be a part of the curriculum.  Programmes such as the leaving certificate politics and society course, the junior certificate CSPE course and the social, personal and health education, SPHE, programmes are very important.  </p> <p>  I am delighted that Senator Flynn mentioned the yellow flag programme.  It is a very good programme and the TUI has been involved in it for a long period.  I was the TUI representative on the programme for quite a few years.  It is an excellent programme that does very good work in schools, and the TUI has been doing its best to promote it in schools where it does not exist.</p></speech>

My first question is for Mr. Ryan.  He made a very eloquent case for the importance of the student voice.  It should be front and centre in how we deal with any of these things.  Much of today's discussion has centred on RSE and cyberbullying.  In secondary schools, is that the predominant form or the kind of bullying that most affects the student population?  In my experience, most bullying tends to be blended; it is not just one type.  Are we placing too much emphasis on cyberbullying in this conversation or is this very much the lived experience?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.454" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matthew Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051800002#J00300"><p>It is not a black-and-white answer; it very much depends.  The problem of cyberbullying has been exacerbated during the Covid pandemic.  We have been using things like Microsoft Teams and it is possible to private message on Teams.  There is an instant opportunity for bullying when someone can private message someone else at any time of the day.  It is very difficult for teachers to monitor that, if they are not trained properly in IT skills.  It is also hard to know whose jurisdiction it falls under if it is happening outside the school, as the Deputy mentioned.</p> <p>  The clich&eacute; of the schoolyard bully walking around beating people up, taking their lunch money and so on was mentioned earlier.  That is quite outdated.  It happens, but I feel it is a much more blended approach to bullying.  There is not one type that is more prevalent or less prevalent.  It is not about which is more or less prevalent; it is about the impact it has on students.  Whether they are cyberbullied, physically bullied or excluded, what is important are the impact it has, as opposed to what happened to them, and how we can prevent that no matter what type of bullying it is.  </p></speech>

There has been mention of diversity in the classroom.  It is sometimes difficult for children to see themselves at the front of the classroom if they are not from a traditional background.  The Employment Equality Act provides that a school should not be taken to discriminate against a person for the purposes of this Act if "it gives more favourable treatment, on the religion ground, to an employee or a prospective employee over that person where it is reasonable to do so in order to maintain the religious ethos of the institution".  That will naturally go against people from a different religious background or from none.  I think it also has a cooling effect on teachers feeling they can be openly gay within a school setting.  The Act also provides that a school should not be taken to discriminate against a person if "it takes action which is reasonably necessary to prevent an employee or a prospective employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution".</p> <p>  We may have put too much emphasis on RSE in this discussion today.  At last week's committee hearing, it was stated that homophobic bullying was rife in our secondary schools.  I am concerned that our RSE programme at primary level does not really allow us to talk about homosexual relationships in a way that I think would be healthy and positive.  We need to get to children before that age of 13 that Mr. Ryan was talking about.  In this context, is there a need to go back to the Employment Equality Act to include the things we are talking about, diversity in the classroom and revisiting our RSE norms, to ensure it is fit for purpose?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.456" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051800002#J00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  In February 2020 we produced a very interesting survey on this matter.  Some of our members refuse to come out in the workplace for fear of being overlooked for promotion or for fear of not getting a job.  They become more comfortable in expressing their sexual identity in their workplaces when they are more secure in their employment.  We would probably need to give further consideration to anything else within section 37 of the Employment Equality Act that might need to be amended.  It would be heartening for our members to get some statement when they apply for jobs that everybody would be treated equally and that nobody would be disadvantaged in the workplace because of their sexual orientation.</p> <p>  Regarding strategies within schools, in 2011 there was a commitment in the programme for Government at that stage to encourage schools to develop antibullying policies and in particular strategies to combat homophobic bullying to support students.  In the survey I mentioned, the majority of our members are aware that schools must implement education and preventative strategy to deal with homophobic bullying.  However, 89% said they had not received any training in how to educate about and how to prevent homophobic and transphobic bullying.  That is a startling statistic.  There is an urgent need to roll out training.  More than 80% said they would welcome training in that regard.  Our members feel very passionately about ensuring that nobody is bullied because of their sexual orientation in their school environment.</p></speech>

He will know as well as I do that the SPHE programme is only afforded half an hour per week.  Unfortunately, it is one of the easiest lessons within the school week to skip or to get rolled into the extra maths lesson or whatever else.  Will more time be allocated for well-being education if we are moving in that direction?</p></speech>

Obviously, it is important to get the balance right in the curriculum, but well-being is now crucial in the school environment.  Obviously, we will need to look at other areas of the curriculum.  Thirty minutes is not enough time in the school week to deliver a well-being programme.  We have had well-being programmes, such as Walk Tall and others.  Schools must now go it alone in implementing those initiatives themselves.  We need a centralised approach to the provision of training for well-being.  It needs to be adequately resourced and supported when the curriculum change takes place.</p></speech>

I am a member of the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health and I am aware of the importance of the issue.  I believe it will blow up in terms of mental health and well-being, particularly given everything we have had to endure over the past year both for our students and our teaching staff.</p> <p>  Cyberbullying and homophobic bullying have been mentioned.  It is about the tools we need to support the teaching staff, students and parents.  What form should that training take?  Could it be online?  Could it involve role play?  How does that work in a school setting?  What would be the most useful for teachers, school board members and parents?  How do we strengthen career guidance teachers in terms of mediation, particularly at post-primary level?  What are the ways the witnesses feel would be useful to connect?  </p></speech>

Children at the age of two can turn on their mother's phone whereas the Covid pandemic saw many teachers using computers regularly for the first time.  That is a start.  Training is needed, even simple basic training on bullying because many people might not fully appreciate what it is if they have never experienced it.  They might not appreciate the depths of it or might dismiss it as being not so bad for people.</p><p>Guidance counsellors, of all staff, are very well trained so it is more a question of having more time to spend with each student and of listening to them.  After all, guidance counsellors have two roles, namely guiding students on their career paths and counselling them.  If the rest of the teachers could have some of the guidance and counselling training, it would help enormously.</p></speech>

With regard to training, we need to look out for the signs of bullying.  That is crucial.  Bullying could be happening in the yard or at home so it is difficult for a teacher to spot it.  A teacher could be in a classroom with 30 pupils.  In this regard, we would welcome a reduction in class size.  It is crucial to be able to identify the signs of bullying.  On homophobic bullying, teachers would welcome comprehensive training in understanding LGBT+ terminology.  LGBT+ inclusion and visibility within the school setting and curriculum are issues.  How many of the books used in school make reference to same-sex families and so forth?  There are several initiatives in this regard that can be used in any training programme.  We are happy to expand further on that if the Senator wishes.</p></speech>

At present, there is simply not enough continuous professional development.  As Mr. O'Sullivan rightly pointed out, it needs to be extensive for all parties and needs to cover all forms of bullying.  It needs to cover homophobic bullying, cyberbullying, traditional bullying,  racist bullying, etc.  The same principle applies to some extent to the question on guidance support and the training of guidance counsellors.  Again, it is possible that the mode is not as important as the availability of ex-quota guidance, which sadly has not existed for the best part of ten years.  As Mr. Duffy rightly pointed out &ndash; this applies as much in the post-primary sector as the primary sector &ndash; a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio is important in preventing problems in the first place.  The restoration of year-head provision at post-primary level is also important in terms of prevention.  We could all agree that prevention of the problem is a lot better than trying to fix it later.</p></speech>

It will be possible to allow some members to contribute again.  They may indicate if they wish to do so.  I skipped my time slot because, as Chair, I ask my questions at the end.  I thank all the witnesses for our incredibly engaging discussion and debate.  I am passionate about the subject.  As a former teacher, I note from year to year the difficulties young people have because of bullying and a lack of support.  I note the isolation they perceive themselves to be in.  Society has a huge responsibility to try to do what it can to prevent bullying and to intervene and support those who need support.  We must also support the perpetrator in seeing why his or her behaviour is completely wrong.  This is why I believe restorative justice is very important.  The committee regards this as a major part of its work.  This is our third session on this matter, and there are three to follow to ensure that we will come forward with really strong recommendations for the Minister and the Department.</p> <p>  I agree with much of what has been discussed regarding the update of the RSE curriculum.  This is important if we are to engender respect for those who are different, for whatever reason.  The update of the anti-bullying procedures, which have been committed to since 2011, is exceedingly important.  I was surprised to learn that data on schools around the country have not been compiled.  They are important.  Mr. O'Sullivan mentioned that many schools are doing their own thing.  Are principles of good practice shared in the unions in respect of how schools are dealing with the matter?</p> <p>  I thank all the witnesses.  Every time I have an opportunity to engage with the ISSU, I am incredibly impressed by the young people involved.  I really am in awe of how articulate they all are and how they respond.  We are talking about developing resilience in young people.  Mr. Ryan is an ambassador for young people and students.  Every one of the representatives has been incredible.  I am always enthused by what I hear.  We are on a good path when we have people like Mr. Ryan representing their peers.  As a matter of course, we have always made sure we have included the voice of young people in dealing with every issue at meetings of this committee.  Mr. Ryan does everybody proud.  </p> <p>  I have a few brief questions.  I will start with Mr. Ryan.  I am looking for short responses, if possible.  As a committee, we believe the voice of young people is exceedingly important in finding solutions to the issue of school bullying.  How does Mr. Ryan believe schools can develop their own policies.  How can young people be included better in this regard?  Senator Dolan asked how parents could be included.  We must consider the whole school community if we are to be successful.  How does Mr. Ryan envisage parents becoming involved?</p> <p>  At our last meeting, on 11 May, one of the members of the advisory panel from Webwise said he felt that when teachers and garda&iacute; go into schools to talk about bullying, it is more a case of lecturing rather than discussing.  It is important that we examine this.  Does Mr Ryan believe former students with experience of bullying should go into schools?  How can this be addressed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.468" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Matthew Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051800002#K00700"><p>To answer the first question, on how we can engage students, our view is simple: talk to them.  They always have plenty to say.  People should not be afraid to ask them for their opinion.  We are often afraid of asking students what they think because there are differing opinions, opinions clash and everybody has something to say, but we should celebrate that as opposed to keeping discussion with students as a reserve in case it is needed.  It is not always easy.  If there are 800 students in a school, talking to all of them is not easy.  Again, the establishment of student councils cannot be understated, nor can supporting them appropriately.  Councils can articulate their students' views and talk to their peers.  Nobody knows what students are going through apart from students.</p> <p>  On the question on garda&iacute; and teachers, even from some of the comments made today we can see that, from generation to generation, there are many out-of-touch views on what youth are experiencing.  We are often spoken for as opposed to spoken to in a conversation.  We are often told bullying is bad and that we should not bully because it hurts people rather than being supported and having our expectations met.</p><p>The last point I would like to make is one I have tried to raise a lot today.  It is all about the importance of language in this whole thing, especially when it comes to suicide, which can be the result of bullying.  When we say things like "committing suicide", we insinuate that suicide is a crime or a sin.  Making simple changes like this to our language can make a great difference to students.  Even this morning, when we were advised about parliamentary privilege, we were asked not to mention "him or her" by name.  This could be changed to "them".  Simple changes to our language allow us to include more people and, to bring it back to society, make society a more inclusive place.  Schools and society are massively interlinked.  If society is more open, young people see that and bring it back into their schools.</p></speech>

I completely agree with the call for extensive continuing professional development, CPD, for the whole school community, including boards of management, which have been mentioned.  Teachers need to be given more upskilling with regard to language and empathy.  It is certainly difficult with large classes but developing our teachers to be that significant person who can listen and provide support is of great importance.</p> <p>The idea of the online safety commissioner came up quite strongly at the last meeting.  Do the witnesses have any comments on that?  Some schools take the firm view that if bullying happens off school property outside of school hours, the school does not have a role to play.  I contest that, if the bullying is between students, the school does still have a role.  Will the witnesses comment on that?  They have addressed the whole area of middle management, which is really needed, but will they address those two issues?  I will ask Ms Piggott for a very quick response first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.471" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ann Piggott" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051800002#L00300"><p>I like the idea of the online safety commissioner but, if I could leave the committee with anything, it is the idea that this must be open and that there must be discussions.  That is what it boils down to.  Pupils who are bullied, who clam up and do not tell anyone and who feel very bad, need to know it is okay to tell someone, that somebody will do something or listen and that they will not be ridiculed.  Their friends also need to tell.  Sometimes friends or other people who see things do not tell simply because they are afraid they do not have enough evidence, that they will be bullied next or they will be considered tell-tales.  That all needs to be done.</p> <p>  I agree with regard to the students' voice through the student council.  I was at the Irish Second-Level Students' Union, ISSU, online event for a few hours last Sunday week.  I heard that it is trying to get direct links to every student council.  There is a member of management in charge of every student council.  Perhaps there is potential for the setting-up of committees either nationally or locally in every school.  There is a parent who has suffered in every town.  They will probably make themselves available to go into schools and talk to students.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.472" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051800002#L00400"><p>I thank the Senator.  With regard to the online safety commissioner, this is obviously something which would be welcomed.  We need to give it further thought and consideration and revert to the committee with regard to the specific role this individual would have.  We will come back to the committee on that.</p> <p>  With regard to bullying that happens outside of the school, it can sometimes start at school before continuing outside.  It is a matter of trying to get the balance correct.  Schools cannot be responsible for every single thing that happens in society but, at the same time, issues do come back into the school setting.  It is a matter of achieving balance, getting parents involved and getting the wider school community to address those particular issues.  Everybody wants a safe and harmonious school environment.  Issues that arise outside tend to end up in schools.  Schools are well versed in trying to restore harmony between parties when issues arise.  The Senator mentioned restorative practice.  Perhaps something more in that line would be appropriate.  The Professional Development Service for Teachers ran a pilot programme on that last year and produced a report on restorative practice.  It is about getting relationships re-established so that everybody can work together.</p></speech>

It is a very complex issue.  There are cases of bullying happening in schools and cases of bullying happening entirely outside of schools, for example, in a local sports club or between two next-door neighbours.  Such cases can and, in many ways, should be resolved outside of the school complex.  The complex bit is where something happens outside of the school environment but which nonetheless has an impact on the school, as Mr. O'Sullivan has mentioned.  An example might be something that happens over a weekend but which causes tension between two students to manifest in the school context on the Monday or Tuesday.  This then becomes an issue for the school to deal with.  It is a complex issue.  There are issues that are entirely within the school's remit and issues that are entirely outside it.  The difficulty arises in the grey area in the middle where schools have a responsibility but are often unaware of the background to a situation.  It is sometimes a matter about which they cannot do an awful lot anyway but that should not stop us trying.</p></speech>

I now have the opportunity to allow members in with some very brief questions.  Is anybody indicating?  If not, we can finish up.  Senator Dolan has already come in twice so I was going to see if anybody else wanted to come in before her but, if not, I will certainly let her in.</p></speech>

The witnesses have said that a lot of things happen outside of the school environment.  Is there any link with sports clubs and so on?  If a young person is having difficulties in one environment, is there any sort of connection or link with the other environment?  I am not aware of any.  I do not know.  Perhaps someone who sits of the board of management of a school might also sit on the board of a GAA club or something like that.  I suppose I am thinking more of rural areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.478" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2021051800002#L01000"><p>The Senator mentioned rural areas.  Often in rural areas the schoolteacher is the heart of the local GAA club.  There are often possibilities there with regard to the transmission of information.  We also need to be careful not to make schools responsible for investigating things that happen in the local GAA club which the club itself is well able to manage.  I am using the GAA club as an example, I am not referring exclusively to GAA clubs.  If the school got involved in such matters, it could end up making matters worse by spreading the issue across the community.  It is an issue of boundaries for different organisations.</p></speech>

They are often left in a very invidious position when trying to establish the facts of issues, whether they relate to matters within or without the school environment.  Sometimes parents may be upset with the outcome from either side.  We know that they may move on to other fora.  We help them with that.  They may go to the Ombudsman for Children or the Teaching Council to make complaints about teachers who are genuinely trying to do their jobs and trying to restore harmony in the school environment.  Such teachers may find themselves with complaints that may travel with them for a considerable period.  Education is also required for parents, as we mentioned earlier.</p></speech>

As has been mentioned, it is very difficult for the school to take on something that happens in a club just because it involved a student of that school.  It is a very grey area, but where I see a link is where derogatory language and so on is not challenged and allowed to happen in a club, from where it is brought back into the school.  That is the biggest link.  Education must run through the whole of society and everything in which students are involved.</p><p>We cannot put all of the work to educate the students on everything on schools.  It needs to be a whole-of-society approach as opposed to just saying that schools alone are responsible for ensuring that our students are educated because that is a mammoth task for them to undertake.</p></speech>

There used to be far more extra curricular activities in school in the past.  Teachers are worn out with workloads, particularly due to junior certificate reform and then with Covid we have not had all of that.  If workloads could be decreased in certain ways, there could be a focus on more activities, even just for students to feel good or to bond.  It might be worth thinking about trying to bring back what we used to have in the great way it worked.</p></speech>

This has been of enormous assistance to the committee in our examination of bullying and its impact on the mental health of our students.  I would particularly like to commend Mr. Ryan for coming before the committee and sharing his individual insights and knowledge.  As I said earlier, the committee is committed to hearing the voices of young people.  The one message that is becoming clear on this issue is that young people must be directly involved in the recommendations that we make and the solutions we will be suggesting to combat bullying and to promote positive mental health.  Mr. Ryan has certainly displayed and demonstrated with enormous conviction that young people must play a key role in resolving this issue.  That is not taking away from the engagement we have had with the ASTI, the TUI and the INTO.  That has been very positive and we appreciate the input of both Mr. O'Sullivan and Mr. Duffy.  I thank all of our members as well for their engagement.</p></speech>

In the first part of this afternoon's meeting, I welcome, on behalf of the committee, Mr. Christopher Holt and Mr. Simon Randles of the West Bank Protection Consortium.  They are joining us from Ramallah and Jerusalem.  We continue with our review of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory in respect of displacements and demolition of public and private buildings.  Later in the meeting, we will be meeting with senior officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin.  The committee has also sought written submissions from several interested parties and bodies.  On completion of the meetings and after consideration of the submissions received, the committee intends to publish a report on the process.</p> <p>  The format of the meeting is that we will hear the opening statements of our guests before going into a question-and-answer session with members of the committee.  As we are quite time limited, due to Covid-19 restrictions, I ask that our witnesses be conscious of the fact that we are under time constraint when initially addressing the committee.  Following the opening statements, there will be a discussion and questions and answers from members of our committee.  I ask members to be concise in their questions.  I will allocated three and a half minutes to each member.  Should time permit, we will open the meeting at the end to deal with other queries and questions that might arise.</p> <p>  Witnesses to this afternoon's session are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his or her remarks and it is imperative that such a direction is complied with.</p> <p>  Witnesses attending remotely, outside the Leinster House campus, should note there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present currently does.  Witnesses participating in the committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to any evidence given to the committee.  </p> <p>   Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses of the Oireachtas or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located in the Leinster House complex or in the Convention Centre Dublin, where the D&aacute;il and Seanad are meeting today.</p> <p>  For anybody watching this meeting online, some Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely.  Due to the unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask everybody to bear with us in the event of any technical issues arising.  I thank the logistics team for arranging this remote set-up.</p> <p>  With that, I welcome everybody and ask Mr. Holt to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Allow me briefly to introduce myself and my colleague.  I am the representative of the West Bank Protection Consortium and I am joined by Mr. Simon Randles, who is in Ramallah.  He is the advocacy co-ordinator for the West Bank Protection Consortium.  The consortium is a strategic initiative that was formed in 2015 to prevent the forcible transfer of Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.  We primarily programme in East Jerusalem Area C and H2 Hebron, where we identify Palestinians as most vulnerable.</p> <p>  We are a consortium of five international non-governmental organisations, NGOs, supported by 12 donors, including ten like-minded EU member states, including Ireland, and the United Kingdom.  As I mentioned, our primary objective is to prevent the forcible transfer of Palestinians in the West Bank.  We respond to incidence of demolitions and settler violence.  We also support the resilience of Palestinian communities in Area C through the delivery of basic and social infrastructure, including homes, schools and education facilities.  We also provide legal aid as well as humanitarian advocacy.  We reach approximately 15,000 Palestinians each year.</p> <p>  An important point to note before we get into the substance of the presentation in the context of demolitions and increased demolitions of humanitarian aid is that the consortium has provided thousands of structures, including homes and schools, since 2015 and 92% of those remain in use among the Palestinian community.  It is an important intervention and we have been able to protect the investment of donors, including Ireland.</p> <p>  We present here in the context of escalating violence in Gaza and in Israel and throughout the occupied West Bank.  I am sure the committee members are all following very closely.  It is important to note that this violence does not occur within a vacuum.  It occurs in the context of an occupation that is in its 54th year.  We often describe the occupation as a coercive environment, particularly in the West Bank.  That environment is defined by repeated violation of Palestinian rights and a lack of accountability for violations of those rights.  A key violation that we have seen escalate and repeat over the past five years, in particular, is demolition of Palestinian property.  That is a key element that places continual pressure on Palestinians to leave their homes and communities in Area C.  We want to focus particularly on 2020 and 2021 because that is when we have been seeing particularly concerning increases in demolitions.  I have figures based on the database of the UN Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs, UNOCHA.  UNOCHA, with the support of partners such as us, records every demolition of Palestinian property in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and, in 2020, there were 848 Palestinian properties either seized or demolished, which affected over 6,000 Palestinians, including 524 children.</p><p>This represents a 23% increase in comparison to 2019.  Alarmingly, in the first quarter of 2021 these trends have continued to increase.  In fact, we have seen a 90% increase in 2021 compared to 2020.  Of particular concern is a 108% increase in demolitions of donor-funded structures.  Most of these structures are funded by the EU and EU member states.  We have seen a particularly alarming increase in the targeting of humanitarian aid in the West Bank through demolition and confiscation.<br/><br/>An important point to note, of which committee members are all well aware, is that this is occurring in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is particularly acute in the West Bank.  While Israel's vaccination campaign has been quite successful, it is very much in its infancy in the Palestinian territories.  This dramatic increase in demolitions that we have seen in 2020 and 2021 is exacerbating the vulnerability of Palestinian communities to Covid-19.  When their homes are destroyed, they are forced to crowd into a small number of shelters and share facilities such as toilets and bathrooms.  This greatly exacerbates the risk and impact of Covid-19 on these communities.  Apart from the fact it represents a serious violation of international law, we are particularly concerned there has been no respite, in fact quite the opposite, in demolitions at a time when an already vulnerable community is battling the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/><br/>Questions often come up when we engage with interlocutors and our partners as to why we are seeing this dramatic increase, which is the second highest rate of demolitions in 11 years.  The question is asked as to why it is happening this year.  There are a number of factors that represent possible explanations.  In August last year, the Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, suspended plans to <i>de jure</i>annex further areas of the West Bank.  He suspended plans to apply Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank.  This upset elements of the pro-settler movement and it is a reasonable analysis to suggest that part of the reason for the increase in demolitions and settlement expansion is to appease the settler movement following the suspension of annexation.  This is borne out by discussion in the Knesset on the need to increase demolitions of Palestinian properties, which are seen by members of the Knesset as illegal Palestinian constructions.<br/><br/>Another element is the fact that this year we have seen the fifth Israeli election in the very short period of two years.  Part of this increase in demolition is perhaps motivation to capitalise votes for the Likud party.  There is a new Administration in the US.  Part of this increase may be testing the position and resolve of the Biden Administration.  Israel was able to continue quite freely with the settlement enterprise, with attempts to expand settlements and increase demolitions, during the Trump Administration.  Perhaps there is a moment now where it is testing the resolve of the incoming Democratic Administration to see how far it can continue with this expansion.<br/><br/>By far the most important factor is the historical absence of accountability.  We have seen repeated statements of condemnation and regret by member states in the EU in response to violations of international law by Israel, including the demolition of property.  What are glaringly absent are meaningful consequences and the commitment that member states will pursue meaningful consequences where these violations occur, particularly where the destruction of donor-funded aid is involved, including aid funded by the Irish Government.<br/><br/>We have spoken about the suspension of annexation plans last year.  It is important to note that although <i>de jure</i>annexation, which is annexation in law, is ostensibly suspended, what we are seeing is an acceleration of de facto annexation, which is annexation in fact and in practice.  In the map that committee members are seeing on their screen, the green area is what would be ostensibly a Palestinian state and the white area is slated for annexation in plans by the Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, and in the US Peace to Prosperity plan.  Almost exclusively, demolitions occur in areas slated for annexation.  This is by no accident.  In fact, based on UN data, 83% of demolitions occur within 2 km of settlement and 70% occur within 1 km.  It is quite clear that demolitions are among the tools used by Israel to annex Palestinian land and force Palestinians from areas that Israel wants to annex.<br/><br/>We would love to be able to host the committee in the Palestinian territories but with the current situation this is not possible.  We wanted to highlight visually what the settlement enterprise looks like on the ground.  In the first picture I am showing we see Ma'ale Adumim, which is an illegal Israeli settlement in the heart of Area C on the map.  It is the third largest settlement and is considered by many Israelis as a suburb of Jerusalem but clearly under the Oslo Accords and international law, it is an illegal settlement.  The red circle over the water tower on the next slide is Abu Nuwar, which is a Palestinian Bedouin community in which we work and in which the Irish Government funds humanitarian aid.  We can see stark differences between the two slides.  The reason for how this looks is the consistent demolitions.  All of the properties of the 700 Palestinians who live in this community are subject to demolition orders.  It is very difficult for them to build and to access livelihoods, water and resources.  This picture in itself presents a very stark reality of what annexation looks like on the ground.<br/><br/>We touched on repeated violations and the lack of accountability.  The West Bank Protection Consortium has mapped statements made by the EU and its External Action Service over the past three years.We have mapped 96 statements that really highlight what we describe as the condemnation approach.  We have mapped eight metrics, which are shown on the left hand side of the slide.  These include settlement illegality, opposition to demolition and forcible or forced transfer.  We have looked at the number of times or the percentage that statements made by the EU refer to these.  In 2017, we saw that approximately 74% of statements referred to settlement illegality, 43% referred to opposition to demolitions and 25% referred to forcible transfer.  No statement referred to meaningful consequences, individual criminal responsibility or grave breaches of the Geneva Convention.  If we look at 2020, there were some pleasing developments.  We saw an overall increase in references to the illegality of settlements.  There was an increase from 43% to 57% to references to opposition to demolition.  There was an increase from 35% to 48% in the number of statements referring to these violations as an obstacle to peace.  However, significantly, we still see no reference to meaningful consequences, to individual criminal responsibility or to the fact they represent a grave breach of the Geneva Convention.<br/><br/>What this means is borne out by the statistics in our final slide.  We can see that between 2017 and 2020, the settler population in the occupied West Bank increased from 628,000 to 683,000.  It is now larger than the Palestinian population.  There were 419 demolitions in 2017 and this almost doubled to 848 in 2020.  This is by no means to suggest we think the statements are ineffective or unwelcome.  In fact, the settlement population and demolitions would have increased at far greater rates without these statements.  The point we want to make clearly is that they do not address or mitigate these increases.  To address the increase in settler population, the increased demolitions and the increased violations, there must be more than just statements.  There must be meaningful consequences and lawful countermeasures pursued by member states.  I apologise for going slightly over time.</p></speech>

I also thank the consortium for a thorough opening statement and a PowerPoint presentation that has been circulated to all members as well.  I really appreciate that.</p> <p>  In the opening statement we heard of the 96 statements issued by the EU over the last year.  It is really concerning that the UN Security Council, which is the body tasked with dealing with wars, consequences and conflict, could not at its third attempt even issue a statement voicing concerns about the civilian casualties, either in Gaza or Israel, or call for a ceasefire.  That is very telling, given the backdrop to our meeting this morning where over 60 children have now been butchered in Gaza and more than 200 people killed in total.  Of course, this piece of work has been ongoing over the last while and we have had a number of witnesses in at this point.  What really spurred the committee into looking at this issue, prior to what is going on in Gaza and some of the events in East Jerusalem at Sheikh Jarrah, was the huge concern with which Members of the Oireachtas and members of the public witnessed the demolition of Irish-funded aid in Khirbet Humsah late last year.  That settlement was completely destroyed and there was very visible evidence of Irish-funded structures and aid, which were pictured with the stickers on them so it was very telling.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions I want to ask our witnesses.  I believe the Government became a member of the West Bank Protection Consortium in 2017.  Following a number of questions I put to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and for Defence, he has stated that Ireland has joined a compensation claim for the demolition of structures that has taken place and I believe a claim of &euro;625,000 has been lodged.  I ask our witnesses to speak to what exactly the claim is for.  When we hear about demolitions, can they elaborate on what exactly is being talked about?  I ask because it is being done to homes, schools and solar panels, that is, basic infrastructure.  On the claim that has been lodged, when was it lodged?  Were claims lodged previously?  How much money, if any, has been paid out in compensation for the claims that have been made?  On the prospect of upcoming demolitions, there is huge concern about a number of schools.  I think there are about 53 schools earmarked for demolition, the most prominent one at this point is probably the one in Ras al-Tin.  I would like to get the witnesses' views on that, it is probably the most high-profile of the schools that are up for demolition.  We hear about the statements that have been issued and the impact they have had on Israel in terms of its illegal activities.  I noted in Mr. Holt's opening statement he said it is a grave breach of the Geneva Convention and a war crime.  Can he elaborate on that?  He also mentioned the need for more meaningful countermeasures and the fact that there are no meaningful consequences for Israel's illegal actions.  The witnesses might touch on what they would suggest there as a countermeasure.  I would also like their views on the pattern which has emerged over a number of years, whereby we pay for houses, infrastructure, schools etc. and then the Israelis come along and demolish them.  We then condemn that and lodge compensation claims and finally we donate more money to build again.  In the meantime, from the families' perspective, God knows when the bulldozer is coming to demolish their properties.  How sustainable is that pattern, going forward?</p> <p>  That is all for now, I hope to have an opportunity to come in again later in the meeting when we have heard some of the responses.</p></speech>

I will go now to Senator Joe O'Reilly and then back to Mr. Holt and Mr. Randles.</p></speech>

I also thank our guests for their presentations, it is all very enlightening and helps us try to do our job.  I will read one paragraph from the consortium's written initial presentation, which is very salient.</p> <blockquote> 	In the first four months of 2021, 316 structures were destroyed, representing a 90 percent increase compared to the same period in 2020.  Of particular note, this period witnessed a 108 percent increase in destruction of donor-funded structures compared to the same period in 2020. </blockquote> <p>That is a very telling paragraph.  The chart on the last page is also very bleak and sad.  It shows the settler population consistently increasing up to 2020 and similarly, the number of structures destroyed increasing.  Of course, as we discussed last week, all this is contrary to international law and is completely against the wishes of the Irish Government, the EU and most of the UN.  It remains a very serious situation.</p><p>What has the impact of the recent horrific violence been on medical services, schools, streets, the physical landscape etc.?  How much does this exacerbate the situation and to what extent does it put the consortium's work in jeopardy or put an unreasonable burden on their work?  I ask given we have learned the M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF, clinic was destroyed, that the streets are being shelled and that apart from the tower which had the press organisations in it, a lot of other physical infrastructure has been destroyed.  I would like to get our guests' response to that.  Mr. Holt said that annually the consortium would give roughly 15,000 people practical aid.  He or Mr. Randles might elaborate on what happens to the refugees.  This was previously raised at the committee but they might chronicle the outcome for a person who is forcibly removed.  They might also address the process of removal, where people go then, the consortium's various interventions and the likely outcome of the refugees' lives, post demolition and removal.  Where they end up is an important thing.  Mr. Holt referenced in the presentation that the elections were a catalyst for making things worse in 2021.</p><p>Would it be their view that the post-electoral situation might help a little?  What will be the impact of the geopolitical situation?  There has been much condemnation and a focus on the latest outbreak of violence but when all of this settles, hopefully, and an armistice is agreed and peace returns, how will things develop then?  Despite the US performance at the UN at the weekend, do the witnesses think that the Biden Administration is likely to put pressure on Israel?  I gather there has been an intervention this morning.  Will the Biden Administration bring pressure to bear on Israel that will, hopefully, halt the demolition? </p><p> These are the issues I raise at this point in our discussions.  The witnesses make the case very clearly and we are firmly against the demolition.  We must work in concert at the UN and the EU to deal with it.  I hope that the European Council meeting today, involving various Ministers, including our own Minister for Foreign Affairs, will result in strong words and actions.  I take the point that words are not enough.  While a verbal response is necessary, it is just not enough.  This is contrary to international law and it is a very serious state of affairs that these illegal settlements persist.  I look forward to the witnesses' response to my comments and questions.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.499" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Christopher Holt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021051800002#D00300"><p>We will split up the questions.  I will take the question on compensation, the types of demolition and sustainability and Mr. Randles will tackle the questions on international humanitarian law, IHL, and breaches of the Geneva Convention.<br/><br/>I will start with the question on compensation.  It is important to clarify that when the donors to the West Bank Protection Consortium seek compensation, they do not do so before a court.  It is not a claim before a court.  The West Bank Protection Consortium records every single structure that is seized or demolished by the Israeli authorities in a database and has done so since 2015.  We also include threats to those structures.  We document the details of the incident, the Palestinians affected and the financial injury to our donors.  Then our donors collectively seek compensation from Israel through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories, COGAT, unit, which is responsible for operations in the West Bank.  We have been making such claims for more than three years and to date, we have not received any compensation although, to be honest, it is not something we expected.  The reason member states seek compensation is to preserve their legal rights.  We do it to put Israel on notice that we are recording these losses and their impact and to preserve the legal rights of member states to pursue further action if their compensation claim is unsuccessful.  Israel's response is generally quite clear, namely, that the construction supported by member states is not compliant with Israeli law and is illegal.  We have very robust and strong expert analysis that says we are providing humanitarian aid in occupied territory and do not need a construction permit from Israel.  What we are doing is very much in accordance with IHL.  Compensation is sought from Israel, either by <i>d&eacute;marche</i>or letter.  It has not been received but because we have recorded and preserved the legal rights, it gives member states the option to pursue lawful countermeasures against Israel for the destruction of humanitarian aid.  That could involve things like offsetting Irish aid to Israel or offsetting, collectively, the aid of consortium donors all the way up, at the very top end, to sanctions.  That is, ultimately, a decision for member states to consider themselves.  <br/><br/>On the types of demolition, we often talk about the demolition of structures, which is quite a vague way of describing what is happening.  What is being demolished are the homes of Palestinian families, the schools they attend, the health clinics they use, their water systems and solar panels.  This is much of what we support and deliver with our funding as well.  Some of these communities are quite remote and vulnerable already so if a health clinic or school is destroyed, it can mean that children then have to walk 10 km or 15 km past a settlement where they are exposed to harassment and violence as a result of that demolition.  The impact on vulnerable Palestinian communities is very significant.  <br/><br/>On the issue of sustainability, as I mentioned previously, we have delivered some 4,000 schools, homes and community centres since 2015 and fortunately, over 92% are still in place.  This is partly because when we deliver infrastructure, it includes the logos and flags of all of our member states.  We think that acts as a deterrent, which is borne out by the fact that 92% of the structures are still in place.  The demolition rate of consortium structures is far below that of other self-funded homes and of other donor-funded homes.  In that sense, we would say that it is still an effective investment but that is not to say that it is not imperative that Israel is held accountable for what is demolished.  In terms of the financial figure, the consortium has received some &euro;50 million since its formation and less than 1.3% of that has been lost as a result of demolition.  In that context, we would still say that it is an effective investment.More importantly, we are providing critical humanitarian aid that really does ensure the viability of the two-state solution and without the aid that we provide, the risk of forcible transfers of Palestinians would be greatly increased.<br/><br/>Committee members touched on the current situation and statements that have been made.  We welcome the statements made by the US State Department on behalf of the Biden Administration in relation to Sheikh Jarrah and the Al-Aqsa Mosque although it has been noticeably quieter on Gaza.  It is a good first step but as we have seen in the past and as we showed with our graphs, statements on their own without meaningful consequences will not be enough to deter demolition, evictions and violations.  We definitely welcome the statement by the US Administration on Sheikh Jarrah and the Al-Aqsa Mosque but it is imperative that such statements go beyond mere condemnation to meaningful consequences, including offsetting aid, withdrawing from voluntary agreements and at the upper end, sanctions.  <br/><br/>Finally, on the question of how the situation has affected us, the majority of our operations in the West Bank Protection Consortium are in the West Bank but all of our partners are operating in Gaza.  It is having an incredibly significant impact on staff and their families, especially those families with children.  A number of our staff have had their homes damaged or destroyed and the impact on their mental health is severe.  We have seen an MSF clinic damaged, which is affecting the capacity to provide aid.  In the West Bank, we are seeing a dramatic increase in violence perpetrated by the military, settlers and Palestinians as well.  This means that for us, it has been more difficult to access the communities we serve.  It has had an impact although in the West Bank we are still able to access communities and provide aid.  I will hand over to Mr. Randles now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.500" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Simon Randles" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021051800002#D00400"><p>I will take the two legally rooted questions first, on grave breaches and countermeasures.  By way of explanation, my background is in IHL so I can speak with some confidence on these questions.  Grave breaches, quite simply, are those enumerated as such in the four Geneva Conventions of 1949.  A grave breach refers to particularly heinous conduct within the context of armed conflict.  It would include, for instance, wilful killing, forcible transfers or the extensive destruction of property where it is not justified by military necessity.  Those same grave breaches, which relate to state practice and would bind Israel and other signatories to the Geneva Conventions, are also classified in different legal instruments as war crimes.</p><p>The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, for instance, considers forceful transfer and extensive destruction, absent military necessity, as war crimes as well, which in a sense means that individuals such as military commanders can be prosecuted.</p><p> As for what concrete measures states could take, there is a broad menu ranging in degrees of coercion.  At the top end, there are measures such as sanctions and restricted measures, as the European Union refers to them, asset freezes and so on.  I think we are quite far away from that in this context, but alternative measures such as measures of retorsion could be applied.  That might include the deduction of funds from bilateral agreements between, for instance, Ireland and Israel or the EU-Israel Association Agreement equivalent to that which has been lost through the destruction of property in the West Bank.  A range of measures may be taken.  We are emphasising with states that efforts should be made to formally map those options available to them.  To undertake and implement those measures, a state first needs to understand what it is entitled to do.  That is something on which the consortium is happy to assist and there is a range of ways in which that can be done.  That is more of an internal process, however.</p><p> To respond to the question on schools, it is absolutely correct to say that the education cluster within the West Bank has identified 53 Palestinian schools at risk of demolition.  That does not include kindergarten, so the number of educational facilities is likely to be much higher.  As Mr. Holt noted, the issues relating to threats to education are much broader than merely the destruction of schools.  There is also the risk of physical access restrictions, violence from settlers and harassment from soldiers.  That has significant and far-reaching generational implications for our beneficiaries.</p><p> Where people go following demolitions is a very good question.  In many cases, people seek to stay in the areas where those demolitions took place and emergency support is then provided by humanitarian organisations ideally, although that can be made difficult by restrictions on our movement put in place by the Israeli authorities.  Some people relocate to stay with friends or family and move away from the area because they do not wish to be displaced again, while in the case of others, frankly, we do not know where they go.  Demolitions have been such an historic issue.  Although we gave a five-year overview, they constitute a much longer-running issue.  Monitoring where people go can be quite difficult from a logistical perspective.</p></speech>

I do not intend to go over questions that have been asked, although I would like some further information on some of the comments made.  I fully agree this is an issue of occupation.  There is strong evidence that Palestinian people are living in a coercive environment.  I do not know anybody who has been able to watch the destruction, devastation, death and suffering of Palestinian people for decades without feeling utter disgust and anger, and that has never been more the case than in recent days.  We need to be mindful of those people who are highlighting and exposing on social media what is happening on the ground there following the destruction of the media site.  This is a moral and humanitarian issue and a building political crisis for the UN and the EU.</p> <p>  Mr. Holt stated that from an EU perspective, bilateral agreement deductions should equate to the value of property destroyed.  Based on his experience and expertise, what does he estimate to be the value of the destruction that has taken place?  What would be the timeframe for the rebuilding of same?</p> <p>  In the context of donor-funded structures, which have experienced an increase of 108% in the number of demolitions, Mr. Holt referred to structures that will be targeted for future demolition.  Does he have any idea what they may be?</p> <p>  On the impact of the continuing destruction on aid provision and donations, I fully agree that it is an effective investment.  What impact, on the human side, is the destruction having on the level of aid and of services that can be provided?  Mr. Holt mentioned the staff there and the experiences they are having.  What impact does it have on the consortium's ability to get staff to go into the area and continue to work and provide their services?  What does he consider to be the primary focus of the consortium's role in the provision of aid in response to the destruction of those structures?</p></speech>

My question is one that probably no one really wants to ask but I will ask it in any event.  Donations are coming in to support the erection of structures and in some cases, these structures are being demolished.  I am trying to understand why we would erect any building in a disputed area where, as soon as it has been built, the desire on the other side is to demolish it.  Before a structure is built, is there any engagement with the Israeli side to try to reach some agreement?  I refer to the foreign money.  I do not want to get into the conflict at this point.  I am talking about demolitions and what happens in that regard.  To avoid demolitions in the context of the foreign aid being given, is there no way we can engage with Israeli officials to agree on locations rather than build structures, have people move into them and then have them displaced as soon as the structure has been demolished.  I do not for one moment justify the demolition of anything but rather I am trying to understand why we would support building something that we know will be demolished.</p></speech>

A picture paints a thousand words, and the final slide that was shown certainly showed the reality.  On one side, there are heated swimming pools, lush green pasture and 21st century infrastructure, while on the other, it looks like it goes back to the 13th century.  The contrast is shocking.  There are 680,000 settlers in the West Bank.  Are incentives given to people from Israel to move into these areas as settlers?  Is the property free?  Should the international community be calling for some of these people to move back out?  It is quite a lot of people.  What would be the implications of that if it were to happen?</p> <p>  Mr. Randles made an interesting point when he mentioned generational implications.  It strikes me, when I look at the images of people, including children, on both sides being killed, with all the mayhem that is going on, that the hate being built up for future generations cannot be calculated.  The first thing that should happen is we should all call on both sides to cease hostilities immediately, and then we can move on from there.  The witnesses might respond on the possible incentives people are given to move there and whether we should be calling on some, if not all, of these people to move out.</p><p>The witnesses heard my other question about the generational implications.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.506" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Christopher Holt" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021051800002#F00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  I will start and then hand over to Mr. Randles.</p> <p>  On the value or the loss as a result of demolitions, it is important to note that we are only speaking to what the consortium has lost as a result of demolitions.  Obviously, the financial impact on Palestinians and other aid actors is much greater.  We can only speak to our interventions.  Since we began our interventions in 2015, the financial injury that has resulted from demolitions and seizures amounts to &euro;750,000.  As I mentioned, that is less than 1.4% of the overall investment.  Therefore, we still believe that it is an effective investment, particularly considering the fact that what we are providing is vital humanitarian aid.</p> <p>  In terms of what is at risk, around &euro;1.6 million is under threat.  That means they have either been issued with a demolition order or a stop work order.  In most cases, the matters are before the court, with our legal aid actors seeking to have those demolition orders overturned.  Generally, injunction orders are in place, preventing the demolitions.  As I mentioned, &euro;1.6 million is under threat.  That involves a large number of homes, and as discussed previously, some 53 schools as well as health clinics, community centres, water and energy infrastructure.  It is important to note that that is purely what is under threat in terms of what we have provided.  What is under threat of demolition beyond our intervention is far greater than that, and puts at significant risk the viability of the two-state solution.</p> <p>  In terms of the impact on our interventions and our beneficiaries, it is a very difficult operating environment.  We have chosen to operate in East Jerusalem and Area C because that is where the needs are greatest and Palestinians are most vulnerable, where they have the least access to livelihoods and essential services.  As humanitarians, we make these decisions based on humanitarian principles of where the needs are greatest.  That is why we choose to operate in Area C, but it is difficult.  The case of Humsa Al-Bqai'a, which was referenced previously, is a very good example of a situation in which aid actors were under considerable pressure and blocked from accessing communities.  Once we did deliver much of that aid, it was then seized and confiscated.  That does make it difficult to provide effective aid in an environment like that.</p> <p>  On the question as to why we deliver this assistance, despite the fact that we know that some of it will be demolished, going back to what we refer to as our retention rate, over 92% of the physical structures that we have provided remain in place with the Palestinian communities for which they were intended.  It is still an effective investment in that we have been able to ensure that most of the aid we provide remains with Palestinian communities.  </p> <p>  On the question of why we would intervene in "disputed territories", the first point to note is that the territory is not disputed.  It is occupied Palestinian territory.  That is almost unanimously agreed under international law by multiple UN Security Council resolutions, which are obviously supported by quite diverse permanent and non-permanent members, as well as resolutions of the General Assembly.  The majority of UN member states recognise that it is occupied Palestinian territory and not disputed territory.  That is the reason that we provide aid in occupied Palestinian territory.  We act in accordance with international humanitarian law.  We ensure that we comply with all of our legal obligations as humanitarian actors.  We provide the Israeli authorities with prior notice of our interventions.  All of our interventions are contained in the UN humanitarian response plan.  That is shared with the Israeli authorities, so they know that we are providing humanitarian aid that is based on humanitarian needs assessments, is vital to Palestinians and without which they would be at great risk.  However, the demolitions still continue. </p> <p>  Finally, on why we could not seek approval for interventions, for example, through the Israeli legal system, there is an inherently discriminatory illegal system that applies in Area C.  Less than 1% of territory in Area C is allocated for Palestinian development.  The vast majority is completely off-limits or is highly restricted, which means that it is almost impossible for any application for Palestinian construction to be granted.  Any sort of notion that there is a way to apply for a construction permit when less than 1% of the area is designated for Palestinian construction, is unfortunately a fiction.  However, the same authorities do grant permission for illegal Israeli settlements to be built in Area C and in fact, legalise, under Israeli law, what are illegal Israeli outposts.</p> <p>  I will hand over to Mr. Randles at this point to address the other questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.507" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Simon Randles" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021051800002#F00400"><p>To follow up on the question of disputed territories, as Mr. Holt has identified, we are talking about occupied territory.  It is fair to say that Israel rejects that diagnosis.  Israel asserts that these are disputed territories.  There are very few countries in the world that would agree with that.  We know that Israel asserts that, because if it is not occupied territory, international humanitarian law cannot apply.  Therefore, Israel frees itself of this multitude of very significant obligations it would have as an occupying power.  We understand the motivations for the assertion but we should collectively push back against it.</p> <p>  On the question of incentives for the settlers to live in settlements, a wide range of financial incentives are made available.  As far as I understand, they consist of reduced property prices, grants for establishing businesses and preferential tax rates.  I believe there is a fairly broad range of incentives.  That brings me to another point.  Israel has asserted that the transfer of settlers is not a legal violation because it is not physically transporting them to the West Bank.  However, it has been determined by far more authoritative legal voices than me that the creation of these incentives and the promotion of this transfer also constitutes a violation.</p> <p>  Should the international community be asking for settlers to be removed?  Yes, in essence.  Whether that would be successful is another question.  Israel has not been at all shy about this policy.  It has been identified as dating back to the 1970s.  Indeed, Ariel Sharon, former Israeli Prime Minister, stated: "everything we take now will stay ours", meaning the land in which they could put Israeli roots would become sovereign Israeli territory.  It is creating facts on the ground.  It is de facto annexation, which has been a pattern for decades.  It explains why it is something against which we are firmly pushing back.</p> <p>  I will close by making the point that we really need to focus on addressing the curve that we showed members in the final slide of our presentation, illustrating the trajectory of settlement expansion and settler population.  The only way that that curve looks acceptable from an international law perspective, is if it is going down.  That is the point on which I will finish. </p></speech>

I might ask Mr. Holt to make a final comment following his presentation.  Are there any parting words he would like to leave with us?</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for meeting with us, for preparing their presentation and for dealing with members' questions.  I regret that the time allotted was much shorter than our members would wish.  Nevertheless, it was an important engagement and most useful to us in terms of our study.</p></speech>

It occurs in the context and against the backdrop of a 54-year occupation - one that is defined by the violation of Palestinian rights and a lack of accountability, including demolitions, settler violence and settlement expansion.</p><p>We must move beyond mere condemnation to pursuing meaningful consequences if we are to have any hope of preventing further violations and ensuring the viability of a two-state solution, which is essential to the safety of Israelis, Palestinians and the region.  We must move beyond mere condemnation to meaningful consequences for the violation of Palestinian rights.  I will leave the committee with that message.  I thank the committee on behalf of the West Bank Protection Consortium for the opportunity to address the committee.</p></speech>

We would be happy to receive it.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the work the consortium is doing for and on behalf of the people of the ten states in the European Union.

As we are quite time limited due to Covid-19 restrictions, I ask that our witnesses be conscious of the fact that we are under time constraint when initially addressing the committee in order to allow for maximum engagement.  Following the opening statements, there will be a discussion and questions and answers from members of our committee.  I ask members to be concise in their questions.  I will allocate three and a half minutes to each member in the hope that we will be in a position to have a second round to deal with further outstanding questions.</p> <p>  Witnesses to this afternoon's session are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, the witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  However, I am quite confident that senior officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs will be more than careful in the exercise of their words and use of their language.</p> <p>  Witnesses attending remotely, outside the Leinster House campus, should note there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present currently does.  Witnesses participating in the committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to any evidence given to the committee.</p> <p>  I am pleased to call Ms Moran, followed by Mr. McLaughlin, to make their opening statements and I thank them for joining us.</p></speech>

We are conscious of the context in which we are speaking to the committee and of the events of the last week in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has made a statement to the Seanad on that matter yesterday with which members will be familiar.</p> <p>  I want to join with my colleague, Mr. McLaughlin, our director for global programmes in the Department, to briefly set out the context for Ireland's development and humanitarian assistance programme to the Palestinian people.  Ireland&rsquo;s objective is to achieve a just, enduring and stable peace in the Middle East.  This foreign policy goal frames and shapes the Irish Aid approach to the region.  Ireland&rsquo;s programme of assistance is an integral part of our contribution to a sustainable peace.  Ireland&rsquo;s vision for peace in the Middle East is a vision shared with our EU partners and is one for the realisation of a negotiated two-state solution with an independent, democratic, viable and contiguous Palestinian state, living side-by-side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.</p> <p>  Development and humanitarian aid from donors play a vital role.  However, they cannot substitute for the ending of the occupation, which alone can fully unlock a future Palestinian state&rsquo;s potential.  This understanding underpins Ireland&rsquo;s engagement in the occupied Palestinian territory.  Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme there is delivered in the context of a continued deterioration in the situation on the ground and a steady rise in needs among the Palestinian population.  The situation, as we have seen clearly in the last week, is volatile and unpredictable.  As I said, the Minister set out Ireland&rsquo;s position and gave a statement to the Seanad on the matter yesterday evening.  He also spoke on the matter at the UN Security Council on Sunday evening.</p> <p>  The occupation of Palestinian territory by Israel continues to be the single most significant obstacle to Palestinian development.  This informs Ireland&rsquo;s approach, both in our bilateral engagement and through multilateral channels, including at the European Union and the United Nations.  Ireland&rsquo;s position is based on a firm commitment to a negotiated two-state solution that ends the occupation that began in 1967; with Jerusalem as the capital of both states, on the basis of international law, including the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.  A series of negative trends on the ground, in particular the continued advancement of settlements, demolitions and threatened evictions on the West Bank, are undermining the potential for a successfully negotiated conclusion to the conflict.  Ireland works hard to address these issues based on international law and the agreed international parameters.</p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. McLaughlin, will address the committee on the Irish Aid programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.515" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Feilim McLaughlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021051800002#G00600"><p>As my colleague has just set out, Ireland&rsquo;s overall policy aim is to assist in securing a lasting and just political solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and to support the negotiation of a two-state solution with an independent, democratic and viable Palestinian state, living side-by-side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours.  Ireland has had a long-standing commitment to this objective.</p> <p>  Ireland was the first European Economic Community - as it was - member state to adopt support for the two-state solution as official policy back in February 1980.  Our development co-operation support to the Palestinian people flows from this policy and aims to contribute to maintaining the space for a two-state solution.  This work, which is part of the Irish Aid programme managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs, focuses on: supporting state-building efforts; the provision of humanitarian relief; the protection and promotion of human rights; and support for Palestine refugees.  Building the capacity of Palestinian governance institutions and civil society is an important underlying theme of our approach.</p> <p>  The Irish Aid Palestine programme has been in existence for just over two decades, since 2000.  This year, Irish Aid plans to invest almost &euro;16 million in the occupied Palestinian territory.  We, and Ireland&rsquo;s representative office in Ramallah, co-operate with the United Nations, other multilateral partners, civil society organisations, humanitarian agencies and the Palestinian Authority in delivering the programme.  Overall, the EU and its member states are consistently the largest donors to the Palestinian people, with total funding estimated at over &euro;600 million per annum in recent years.</p><p>In the area of state building, Ireland's particular focus is on strengthening the quality of education which will be essential to the long-term prosperity of the Palestinian people and the Palestinian state.  The Palestinian Authority's ministry of education has a particularly important function in what is a very young society, where nearly 40% of the population is under the age of 14.  The ministry aims to provide comprehensive and safe access to quality education across the occupied territory.  Our view is that a robust and effective ministry can help to foster social unity across the Palestinian territory and is indispensable in raising the skills and knowledge base of the Palestinian people.  Education also serves an important function in promoting critical thinking and enhancing job opportunities.</p><p> Ireland's aim is to build the capacity of Palestinian educational institutions and by extension, to empower the Palestinian population.  Our main vehicle for doing this is what is known as a joint financing arrangement.  This is, essentially, where we and a number of other countries pool our support to the Palestinian education ministry.  We support the ministry in areas such as curriculum development and educational reform.  Ireland spends &euro;3 million a year through this mechanism. </p><p> We also have a scholarship scheme for Palestinian students through which we bring promising individuals to Ireland to study for a masters degree.  The aim is to build the capacity of Palestinian society by giving individuals the knowledge and experience that they need to make a positive contribution in the future.  We presently award 25 of these Ireland fellowships per year.</p><p> The promotion and protection of human rights in the Palestinian territory is a fundamental pillar of our work.  We recognise the indispensable role of civil society in promoting and protecting human rights and the rule of law.  Respect for human rights, accountability and transparency facilitate peace and stability and contribute to better governance.  Our human rights and democratisation schemes support both Israeli and Palestinian NGOs in five priority areas, namely, freedom of movement, rule of law, rights of prisoners and detainees, women's rights and democratic development.  Our representative office works with partner bodies and has developed strong relationships with them over the years.  Our total funding in this area for 2021 will be &euro;750,000.</p><p> Of course, as the committee has just heard from representatives of the West Bank Protection Consortium, the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, DG ECHO, which is the branch of the European Commission responsible for humanitarian aid, as well as a number of other states are members of and donors to the consortium.  We have supported it since 2017 in its work to protect vulnerable Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.  As the committee has heard, the consortium provides material and humanitarian assistance in legal aid.  Our budgetary contribution to the consortium in 2021 is &euro;200,000.</p><p> Another pillar of our approach is our support to Palestine refugees through the UN Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, which provides education, healthcare and humanitarian relief to Palestine refugees.  There are approximately 5.7 million registered refugees living in the occupied Palestinian territory and in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs signed a three-year partnership agreement with UNRWA in March 2021.  Under the terms of that agreement, we will provide UNRWA with &euro;6 million per year in core funding to the end of 2023.  We also provide annual funding to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNOCHA.  We have provided &euro;500,000 in 2021.  That includes &euro;300,000 to a humanitarian fund, which can be drawn on by the humanitarian co-ordinator to respond to humanitarian emergencies.  </p><p> I will turn to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.  As with all of our developing country partners wherever they are in the world, the main issue around vaccination in the occupied territory is the global shortage of vaccine supply.  As members will be aware, Ireland is supporting the COVAX initiative, which aims to deliver 2 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines to 92 low and middle-income countries, including the Palestinian territories, by the end of 2021.  COVAX has also negotiated options on a further 1 billion doses.  In March, the EU announced it would double its funding to COVAX from &euro;500 million to &euro;1 billion.  When taken with the commitments of individual member states, this brings the entire EU pledge to COVAX to &euro;2.5 billion.  In February, COVAX confirmed that the occupied Palestinian territory was a priority participant in its programme.  The first COVAX shipment, containing 61,440 doses, was received in the Palestinian territories in March 2021.  COVAX deliveries to the occupied territory in the first and second quarters of the year are projected at 308,000 doses.  According to World Health Organization figures from this week, a total of 416,000 people in the occupied Palestinian territory have been vaccinated with supplies from COVAX and other sources.  </p><p> In addition to our COVAX support, we have provided additional resources to organisations working in the occupied Palestinian territory since the outbreak of the pandemic.  They include UNRWA, the UN humanitarian fund, the World Bank and Oxfam.  We have also provided funds via an EU mechanism known as PEGASE, which gives direct support to Palestinian citizens.  </p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s support to the Palestinian people through the Irish Aid programme has a number of aims.  They are to help maintain the space for a two-state solution, to build the capacity of the Palestinian people through the provision of quality education, to contribute to ensuring that human rights and accountability are upheld, that humanitarian relief is provided to those who need it and that the needs of Palestine refugees are met.</p></speech>

I will pick up where we finished off the conversation with our previous witnesses, that is, around the destruction of donations from member states etc.  Our previous guests outlined the compensation claim.  They have lodged a claim in the amount of &euro;625,000 for the destruction of aid that they have provided.  We are part of that consortium and compensation claim.  They outlined the process around that and the fact that it ultimately falls on the State to pursue that.  Can I get an update on that specific compensation claim?  Can I also have a broader overview of State-funded aid in the occupied territories, in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, that has been destroyed by Israel over, say, the past ten-year period?  Can our guests put a cost on the amount of Irish aid that has been destroyed by Israel?  What measures have been taken, apart from the compensation claim through the West Bank Protection Consortium?  What compensation claim has been lodged with the Israeli authorities in relation to the destruction of that aid?  We have seen demolition, and not only in recent times, in Sheikh Jarrah, East Jerusalem and the West Bank.  Schools have been demolished in Gaza.  It would be great to get an overview on that.</p> <p>  Our two previous witnesses stated that statements only go so far.  They do not have a significant impact on the Israeli assault on the occupied territories and the forced displacements and illegal settlements continue.</p><p>A range of civil society NGOs have asked for more meaningful countermeasures and consequences.  Has analysis been carried out in the Department on what countermeasures might look like?<br/><br/>We will have to agree to disagree on the matter of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018.  I know the response will be that the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice is the Bill is not lawful but I will argue all day and night against that.  Outside of that, what work has gone on within the Department to identify countermeasures that could be taken against Israeli actions?  Will the witnesses outline what the countermeasures could look like?<br/><br/>As for the Government&rsquo;s position on the two-state solution with a viable Palestinian state, what would a viable Palestinian state look like?  Can the witnesses define that?  Are we talking about the 1967 borders and if so, is the Government asking for the 680,000 illegal settlers in the occupied territories to leave?  The Minister has spoken previously about creeping annexation and it is happening on the ground.  Ms Moran should outline the Department's view on annexation.  We know <i>de jure </i>annexation has happened and only last year, former US President Trump recognised the illegal annexation of the Golan and East Jerusalem.  What measures were taken by the Government on the illegal <i>de jure </i>annexations I mentioned?<br/><br/>There is the question of the demolition of state buildings.  What is the up-to-date position on the 53 schools that have been identified in the occupied West Bank earmarked for demolition and particularly the Ras al-Tin school, which was funded by European aid?  Irish Aid may have been involved with it.  What is the current position in respect of the demolitions there?<br/><br/>What impact might be had, were Ireland to follow through on the unanimous D&aacute;il vote calling on the Government to officially recognise Palestine?  What impact, if any, would there be, were we to follow through and officially recognise the state of Palestine based on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as the capital?<br/><br/>What more can the Government and the international community do to protect human rights and the right of life of Palestinians?  Does Ireland support the investigation by the International Criminal Court into the human rights abuses and contravention of the Geneva Convention?  What is the view on the recent remarks of the Israeli regime that it will not participate in the investigation?</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their time and the ongoing work done in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I agree with Deputy Brady's comments on the value of the aid that has been destroyed and any actions taken in response.  I note that Irish Aid plans to invest almost &euro;16 million this year in the occupied Palestinian territories.  While there has been mention of education and other initiatives, will the witnesses provide more detail on what that &euro;16 million will look like on the ground to those in Palestine?  As for the 25 fellowships offered to Palestinian students, do the witnesses have information on what subjects those masters programmes are in and on the progression routes from them?  Given recent events, have plans been discussed to alter or review the targeting of aid funding?  I speak with the high level of destruction in mind.  What does accountability look like to the Department of Foreign Affairs?  What do human rights look like in this case, particularly in light of the recent events?</p></speech>

I will be brief.  I ask Ms Moran what is the official position of Ireland and whether we now regard what is going on as being de facto annexation.  Deputy Brady has already touched on that but I would like to know our official position.</p> <p>  I know what I will ask might irk some but with regard to Irish Aid, we are pumping money into Palestine, and rightly so.  The work being done is genuine and attempts to deliver what has been described by Mr. McLaughlin, including education.  We all have an interest in human rights.  I am concerned about money given particularly for buildings in disputed areas.  Some people call them occupied areas and others call them disputed areas.  It does not matter what we call them but we know that if a building is put up there, it will be knocked down.  Are any caveats attached to funds that are put in by Irish Aid for the construction of buildings?</p> <p>  Some of my colleagues are irked by me making that statement but at the end of the day my concern is that money spent to aid the Palestinian people should have a long-term effect.  For the life of me I cannot understand why we would fund something that may be bulldozed a couple of weeks after it is completed, which disrupts everybody.  I do not want to get into the argument of whether the land is annexed land or occupied territory.  I want to get into the discussion of demolitions and what we can do about them.</p></speech>

I am also conscious of the opening comments from Ms Moran, when she indicated quite rightly that matters are somewhat fluid, as well as being very sensitive.  A number of political questions have been directed at our witnesses and I remind members of the speech from the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to the Seanad last night and to which Ms Moran referred.

On the point on the compensation claim, as the committee's previous witnesses put it, this is not something which goes before a court.  It is something we collectively do with other donors and we raise it with the Israeli authorities and have done so on a regular basis at ambassadorial level and the Minister for Foreign Affairs has raised it with his counterparts as well.  We will continue to do so.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has also raised it regularly at the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels, in order to build coalitions across member states.</p> <p>  There was a question on the scholarship programme, the Ireland Fellows programme, and the range of masters programmes.  It is across a wide range of disciplines.  The programme is only its second year and a third intake is due to begin, all going well, later in 2021.  We have people from a medical background and people who are working in areas related to engineering, for example, so it is a wide range of disciplines.  The aim is to try to identify people who have the potential to make a difference in Palestinian society into the future and to give them the skill sets they need to be able to do that.</p> <p>  As for what it looks like, it looks like improved education in schools run by the Palestinian authorities, which is a primary outcome we want to see and one towards which we have been working for many years, with a better curriculum and better opportunities for children who are going through the Palestinian Authority schools.  It also looks like the services that UNRWA provides to refugees on a daily basis.  There are millions of refugees in the occupied territories and within the region more broadly.  UNRWA provides them with education, healthcare and, in many cases, shelter.  It also looks like the humanitarian aid being provided in Gaza and elsewhere at present, in terms of provision of emergency shelters, emergency water and sanitation and equipment.  It looks like the legal aid the West Bank consortium is giving people to take legal cases on forced evictions.</p> <p>  With respect to Senator Craughwell's point on the long-term objectives of the programme and the need to focus on those, that is at the heart of what we do.  That is why we focus on things such as the improvement of education.  That has the potential to empower future generations of people and that is a lasting legacy.  That cannot be demolished overnight.  Our focus is on capacity building, education, ensuring people's human rights are observed and they have legal aid to take legal action when necessary.  All of that longer-term strategic work is at the centre of what we do, so I take the Senator's point on that.</p> <p>  I will pass the floor to Ms Moran now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.527" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cait Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021051800002#K00200"><p>I thank members for their questions.  I will add to what my colleague, Mr. McLaughlin has said.  As we set out, the programme operates in a political context, both from a Department of Foreign Affairs perspective and from the point of view of our embassy in Tel Aviv and representative office in Ramallah.  We support the programme through political engagement, including in the problem areas when those issues arise and in terms of the difficulties that can arise in that respect.</p> <p>  Our representative office in Ramallah is active on the ground, as is our ambassador in Tel Aviv, in making representations to the Israeli authorities on the difficulties which arise in respect of settlements and demolitions and the threat of eviction.  Sometimes that presence is important in terms of the types of visits which our representatives in Ramallah have done in Jerusalem around the Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan neighbourhoods spoken about previously.  That demonstration, that public advocacy and that voice are important and this is something we do together with the EU and other like-minded partners.</p> <p>  On the actions available to the Department, as our colleagues from the West Bank Protection Consortium with whom the committee discussed the matter earlier will have pointed out, we act as a consortium with the West Bank Protection Consortium.  We act as a collective and it is important we look at those actions collectively, as a group.  That is the route we take.</p> <p>  Ireland also engages strongly at EU level, with the various mechanisms of the EU, in looking at these issues and their impact, so it is active engagement.  As I mentioned, Ireland also engages with the United Nations in terms of the kinds of statements it makes at the United Nations in highlighting what we see as the violation of international law and humanitarian law in respect of issues around settlements and demolitions and threatened evictions.</p> <p>  On Deputy Brady's question on annexation, on which Senator Craughwell also raised a point, the Minister clearly set out the position on that issue yesterday evening in the Seanad.  It is a clear position.  These settlements are illegal under international law and we operate on that basis and do everything we can do in that respect.  Our position is based on international law, on Israel's obligations as an occupying power under the Fourth Geneva Convention and on the resolutions of the Security Council.  That goes to the point discussed earlier in terms of the humanitarian imperative on Ireland to provide assistance in Area C, under difficult circumstances.  We are driven by that issue of responsibilities which we see being failed by an occupying power and the obligation on donors to step up and provide humanitarian assistance on that.</p> <p>  On the question posed on recognition, I regard that as a political issue and the Minister has set out the Government's position on that on a number of occasions, including last night in the Seanad.</p> <p>  On the point asked on the International Criminal Court, Ireland's approach to that and to the conflict is based on international law and parameters.  We are a party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and we are a firm supporter of the work and role of the court.</p> <p>  On the investigation of the situation in Palestine, Ireland is committed to preserving the independence and the impartiality of the court and its judicial processes, so we do not comment on ongoing legal processes.  However, we support the impartial and independent role the court plays.  It plays an important role.</p> <p>  Deputy Clarke asked what accountability and human rights looked like.  I thank her for the question.  I come back to the point on international law and respect for international conventions.  That is always Ireland's starting point.  As a small state, we depend on those mechanisms ourselves and that is our starting point across the board.  Deputy Clarke will have seen that at the March session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Ireland played an active role in the Human Rights Council, including through the various agenda items relating to the occupied Palestinian territory, OPT, and we work closely with EU partners on the ground there. </p> <p>  We look at the role of civil society as a partner on human rights and accountability and, as Mr. McLaughlin mentioned, there are funding mechanisms within the Irish Aid programme in Palestine to support the role of civil society.  As we have concerns about the pressure put on civil society and civil society space, we both fund civil society and advocate for the importance of its role.  We do that on the ground in the OPT and Israel and we do it in Geneva, New York and Brussels.  That is extremely important to us and they are an extremely important partner in terms of accountability, so both the multilateral framework and the partnership with civil society are important to us in that respect.</p><p> On the question about what a viable Palestinian state would look like, and I thank the Deputy for that, I set out the Ireland vision at the start, which is very much based on internationally agreed parameters and on the 1967 borders with Jerusalem as the capital of both states.  The key issue and the reason the committee is looking at this report is that this is under threat.  The action of the Israeli Government in expanding settlements and undertaking demolitions puts that under threat.  For Ireland, we are supportive of a negotiated two-state solution.  That means both parties coming to the table and negotiating, with the support of the international community.  The Minister is on record for expressing his frustration at the lack of process and political engagement on that.  Ireland has done everything in its power to try to advance that engagement both through the EU, and the EU is a member of the international quartet, and more broadly.  We have been very frustrated on that.  When one looks at the example of our peace process, which the Minister draws on very much in his engagement, it is very frustrating to see the lack of progress there.  However, that does not mean that Ireland does not continue to engage in that and to support that process, including through funding for organisations which contribute to the debate on that and also take lessons from the peace process on the island of Ireland and contribute at that level as well.  The fundamental point, and I hope the Deputy will agree, is the threat to the viability of a future Palestinian state.  Obviously, it is undermined when we see settlements and threatened evictions.  That is a very valid and important point.</p><p> I believe I have answered all the questions.  If there is anything else we did not cover, feel free to refer back to us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.529" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021051800002#L00200"><p>I will be brief.  I welcome our guests.  I note from the statement that 40% of the population is under 14 years of age.  I believe 21% of the population in Ireland is under 14 years of age, so that is extraordinarily high.  Are there any particular reasons for that?  Have the adults left or why is that the case?  The figure is extraordinarily high.</p> <p>  Mr. McLaughlin also mentioned that Irish Aid is working with some Israeli NGOs.  Perhaps he will say a little more about that.  I am sure I am right in saying that not everyone in Israel agrees with what is happening with demolitions, the forced movement of people and so forth.  He might say a little about the other side of Israel, whether there are people we know of there who are opposed to this and the NGOs the programme is working with.  He also mentioned there are 5.7 million refugees in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.  I take it that many of those are Syrian refugees from the other awful conflict across the border.  Do we know how many of them are Palestinians?  Mr. McLaughlin mentioned that we contribute to the EU fund mechanism PEGASE.  Will he say a little more about how much we contribute to that fund mechanism and the work it does?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.531" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021051800002#L00400"><p>I refer back to the compensation claims.  The witnesses said it is primarily the compensation claim through the West Bank Protection Consortium.  We raised concerns when we engaged with the Israeli ambassador.  The West Bank Protection Consortium only looks at projects which it has managed or put on the ground and Ireland only gave it &euro;200,000 last year or this year.  It is only a small fraction of the Irish Aid that goes to the occupied territories.  Unfortunately, it is not the only aid that is being destroyed by Israel.  The question there was to seek a broader picture of Irish aid that is being, and has been, destroyed by Israel.  Can we get a picture of what that involves?  Previous witnesses have put a value of &euro;750,000, over the last five years, on aid which they have managed that has been destroyed.  Can we get a picture of total Irish aid that has been destroyed by Israel over the last five years, not just in the occupied West Bank but also in Gaza?  What is the next step?  Once we have identified and put a cost on the destroyed aid, what next steps have occurred?  It has been suggested that we engage with the Israeli authorities.  If that is the case, what compensation, if any, has been paid to Irish Aid?</p></speech>

If I manage to find out, I will be happy to refer back to the Deputy in writing.</p> <p>  As regards the refugees elsewhere, that refers to Palestinian refugees who would be the descendants of people who were displaced.  For example, UNRWA works in Gaza but it also has operations in those other countries, particularly in Syria and Lebanon.  In fact, a very large percentage of the resident population of Lebanon is of Palestinian descent and are refugees.</p> <p>  With regard to PEGASE, it is a mechanism that is run by the European Commission.  It is something we have worked with, on and off, over a number of years.  We have provided a total of perhaps &euro;15.5 million over a number of years.  Last year, we provided it with &euro;1 million.  The way it works is that it provides an essential income support, some type of basic payment, to families who do not have any other means of support.  It is a way of providing them with some type of subvention.  In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, we thought it was an important vehicle to work with.</p> <p>  On the broader question of demolitions raised by Deputy Brady, as I said, the vast majority of what we do and the vast majority of places where we invest our money is in the direction of human capital.  We invest very much in the people of Palestine, their education and in the vindication of their human rights.  Infrastructural development in that sense is not something in which we have invested heavily in the past, so it is very difficult to give a figure.  It is not an area in which we would generally work.  In terms of structures built by the West Bank Protection Consortium and other organisations, it is very difficult to put a figure as to which percentage of which donor's funding went into it.  The figure our colleague gave earlier was a total of perhaps &euro;50 million in contributions from countries in the European Union since 2017.  Ireland has contributed &euro;1 million of that.  Again, that funding goes to legal aid and a series of different areas, not just the construction of structures, so it is very difficult to extract a figure in that way.</p> <p>  Ms Moran will respond to some of the other points.</p></speech>

There is funding for both Israeli NGOs and Palestinian NGOs through the programme and also through the Irish Aid civil society fund, which is managed from headquarters.  We are aware that Irish civil society will have partners, especially on the ground, where they will work with local NGOs.</p><p>That is very much part of the model of support for local capacity and NGOs.  As part of that support, there is a provision for families who are under threat of eviction to give them legal advice and support.  That is supported through the programme and the West Bank Protection Consortium.</p><p> Mr. McLaughlin touched on the point of Palestinian refugees.  One issue which we are conscious of is the vast spread of Palestinian refugees throughout the region, as well as the work done and support provided by neighbouring countries, like Jordan and Lebanon, in that respect.</p><p> Across the board, in terms of our approach, we always work with other donors and the European Union.  We also support the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Israel, the co-ordinator on the ground and the UN Secretary General's special envoy who took up the post recently in February.  All of those mechanisms are important.  The role of those offices is to engage with both the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli Government on issues such as humanitarian funding, access to humanitarian assistance, protection and the wider issues regarding the peace process.  The latter is difficult in the current context but that is very much part of the approach.</p></speech>

East Jerusalem is the most recent area where evictions have given rise to violence.  The committee heard last week from an international lawyer, Ms Natasha Hausdorff, who was very unambiguous when she stated that the title to the lands in East Jerusalem were never actually given by the Jordanians to the Palestinians.  How does that tally with the legal advice members of the consortium or other human rights organisations would give to people in East Jerusalem?  Have the courts on any occasion sided with the Palestinians?  Are we dealing with planning law or strict conveyancing?</p> <p>  It struck me from listening to people last week that this is an open-and-shut case and that there should never be any dispute as to title within East Jerusalem.  Nevertheless, earlier speakers and Ms Moran mentioned the importance of the legal advice.  Is it more than just an exercise in futility?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.536" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Cait Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2021051800002#M00300"><p>I may not have the details in terms of the title to the properties but we can certainly provide follow-up information to the committee on that.</p> <p>  The importance of providing legal advice is to support the families who are threatened in these situations to ensure they have access to legal processes.  This includes basic things like access to funds for that kind of legal advice and there is a route through the courts for it.</p> <p>  Obviously, Ireland's position is based on international law.  That would be the primacy we would attach to the situation.  Without having a detailed knowledge of the title and land issues around it, the general point we would make is that those families have been resident in those homes for an extended period of time.  It is extremely harsh, to say the least, that they face threatened eviction and to be frank, this level of intimidation.  We can see the wider impact, as the Minister set out in his statement to the Seanad, in terms of the situation on the ground and the tensions in East Jerusalem in recent weeks.</p> <p>  The role of the support through the consortium is to ensure that those who need it have access to proper legal advice.  We are happy to come back with any further information we can.</p></speech>

It is also about looking to the long term and trying to build the level of capacity that would be necessary for a viable Palestinian state in the future.  That is very much at the centre of the way that we work.  There is a strong focus on that whole state-building aspect.</p> <p>  Obviously, a country the size of Ireland cannot do everything.  Education is the area on which we have decided to focus for many years.  It underlines the important step we attach to a viable Palestinian state and a two-state solution in the longer term.  This is combined with support for UNRWA for long-term Palestinian refugees, both in Gaza and elsewhere in the region, with the provision of humanitarian relief.  It is a blended approach with that mix of dealing with short-term, immediate ongoing needs, as well as a more long-term focus on state-building.</p></speech>

To recap, I have responsibility at assistant secretary level in the Department of the Taoiseach for the shared island unit.  I am joined by Mr. Eoghan Duffy, principal officer with the unit.</p> <p>  As the committee will be aware, the programme for Government outlines the Government's commitment to working with all communities and traditions on the island to build consensus around a shared future underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement.  In October, the Taoiseach set out the Government's priorities and vision for the shared island in a major speech at an online event in Dublin Castle.  As the Taoiseach noted, the Government's priorities under the shared island initiative are: to work in partnership with the Executive, through the North-South Ministerial Council and with the British Government, to address strategic challenges facing the island; enable priority delivery of all-island infrastructure commitments and foster new investment and development opportunities on a North-South basis; and foster constructive, inclusive dialogue and deliver a comprehensive programme of research to support the building of consensus on a shared future underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>  As I think I said on the previous occasion, the Taoiseach established the shared island unit in his Department last September.  It is crucial that this matter is being taken forward as whole-of-government initiative.  While we are there, to co-ordinate, drive and motivate work, it is a cross-Government piece of work.</p> <p>  This is the first year of the shared island initiative.  Operationally, the unit's work is focused on three areas: commissioning research; fostering dialogue; and building a shared island agenda, including delivering on the commitments in the programme for Government.</p><p>Obviously, we are working closely with colleagues in other Departments who work on issues relating to Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement and, of course, through the mechanisms of the North-South Ministerial Council, the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</p><p> If it is okay, I thought it would be useful this morning if I gave a brief update of where we are under these three main areas of work.</p><p> On the first, in terms of building a shared island, the promotion of all-island approaches to the strategic challenges facing the island, North and South, and delivering on the programme for Government commitments are the key focus.  As many of the committee members will be aware, those programme for Government commitments are also reflected in the Government's commitments as part of the New Decade, New Approach, NDNA, agreement.</p><p> The committee will be aware also that, in budget 2021, the Government announced a Shared Island Fund of &euro;500 million over five years, that is, out to 2025, ring-fenced for capital investment in North-South projects.  It is important to point out that this is intended to be additional funding.  Where Departments are already spending on North-South issues, that should continue.  For example, where a Department has a budget for a North-South body or is supporting a particular programme of work, that continues.  This funding, under the Shared Island Fund, is intended to be additional and, therefore, bring the weight of the Government's commitment to the shared island initiative to the table.</p><p> What will we spend this on?  What are we funding?  Here, we are guided by the programme for Government and the NDNA commitments.  In summary, these include working with the Executive on cross-Border infrastructure initiatives, including the A5, the Ulster Canal, the Narrow Water bridge and cross-Border greenways; working with the Executive and the British Government to achieve greater connectivity on the island; new investment and development opportunities in the north-west and Border communities; supporting a North-South programme of research and innovation, including the possibility of an all-island research hub; and broader work on all aspects of North-South co-operation and the all-island economy.</p><p> The Taoiseach has emphasised the importance of moving ahead with long-standing cross-Border investment commitments, working closely with the Executive to achieve full delivery as rapidly as possible.  For example, on 28 April, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, launched phase 2 of the Ulster Canal restoration project with full funding of &euro;12 million now available for this.  That funding was put in place through &euro;6 million from the Shared Island Fund and &euro;5.6 million from the Rural Regeneration Development Fund.  Because in all of these cases it is about the work we are doing today but it is also about planning for tomorrow, the Shared Island Fund has also provided a further &euro;1 million for phase 3 of the Ulster Canal project to undertake feasibility and pre-construction work, and this has now begun.  The Ulster Canal is a good example of how, with political priority by the Government, a partnership approach with the Executive and with local authorities, and necessary additional resourcing provided through the Shared Island Fund, a major North-South project can move ahead under the shared island initiative.  Many of the committee members will be more familiar with places along the Ulster Canal than I but, clearly, in the case of the Ulster Canal, we are delivering a public amenity and sustainable tourism initiative that connects communities and supports jobs and business opportunity on both sides of the Border.</p><p> Another example is that, on 7 April, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Northern Ireland Minister for Infrastructure in the Executive, Ms Nichola Mallon MLA, launched an all-island strategic rail review - an important part of our commitments under the programme for Government and the shared island initiative.  The review will consider how the rail network on the island of Ireland can improve sustainable connectivity between cities, enhance regional accessibility and support balanced regional development.  Of course, it will also include those aspects that people talk about a great deal in terms of developing higher speed and spine rail connectivity on the island.  This builds on the commitment in the NDNA.  It is an ambitious review which we are taking forward in partnership and will look at opportunities to enhance rail right across the island.</p><p> I will mention one other point.  This is a first, but key, step in terms of the Sligo-Enniskillen greenway.  Leitrim County Council and Fermanagh and Omagh District Council have been working together and now have agreed a tender for joint technical consultant work to undertake preliminary design work and route selection environmental assessment on the Sligo-Enniskillen greenway.  It shows that many of these projects are at different stages but we need to continue to drive them through each of those stages as we move forward and then deploy the funding as and when the time is right.</p><p> The Government will make further allocations from the Shared Island Fund to invest for a more connected, sustainable and prosperous island consistent with the priorities set out in the programme for Government.  The Taoiseach has referred to the particular potential and priority of delivering a North-South programme of research and innovation, and of supporting enterprise growth in the Border regions, including through co-operation on technology parks.  These are areas where we are actively engaged in working through and developing ideas at present.</p><p> Throughout, the Government's approach is a partnership one, working with the Executive, with the British Government where that makes sense and with local authorities.  The local authority dimension is important.  There already is strong co-operation between local authorities in the Border regions, in the North West Strategic Growth Partnership, the Irish Central Border Area Network, the Dublin-Belfast economic corridor and the East Border Region.  The Taoiseach and a number of Ministers have engaged directly with these cross-Border initiatives in recent months to affirm the Government's support for their work and readiness to collaborate with them as part of the Shared Island initiative.  We are now following up with them in a more practical way around what might come out of the various strategies and priority plans that these groups have.</p><p> The Taoiseach himself has been engaging.  We are all limited by Covid restrictions but he has, for example, met virtually with the North West Strategic Growth Partnership, with the two local authorities, Donegal and Derry and Strabane.  The Taoiseach has met with the CEOs and chairs of the North-South bodies and he has also done a number of business engagements, including recently with the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce.  In all of these, there is an opportunity to both talk about the shared island initiative but also to hear from these bodies what their interests and ideas are.</p><p> Second, we see the research very much as about deepening understanding of the island and it is a core part of the shared island initiative.  We have developed a comprehensive programme of research, with the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and the Irish Research Council, IRC.</p><p> Yesterday, the shared island unit and the ESRI published first papers examining, "The Economic and Social Opportunities from Increased Cooperation on the Shared Island".  These were preliminary scoping papers but, effectively, the project of work for 2021 will focus on four areas: cross-Border trade in services; primary healthcare on the island, North and South; North-South patterns of educational participation and attainment and the lessons this might give us for the future; and enhancing the attractiveness of the island for high-value foreign direct investment.  That is the ESRI piece.</p><p> We have a separate partnership with NESC, which is preparing a report to Government on shared island this year.  Crucially, that will be informed by extensive engagement with stakeholders, North and South.  That will bring a different set of ideas and perspectives to the table.</p><p> The shared island unit is also partnered with the Irish Research Council's new foundations programme and announced recently a new funding stream of &euro;200,000 for researchers to apply to.  This will focus on: political, policy and economic co-operation; and civic, social and cultural connection and understanding on the island.</p><p> For all this research work, the idea is that it will inform policy and contribute to the conversation about how we can work together across the island, taking up the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>The third element of our work centres on dialogue, outreach and engagement.  This operates on two levels, one of which is the shared island dialogue series which the Taoiseach launched last October.  The series aims to foster constructive and inclusive civic dialogue engaging all communities and traditions on issues for a shared future on the island.  Some of the dialogues focus on themes which fall out of the Good Friday Agreement while others focus very much on sectoral areas and sectoral co-operation.<br/><br/>Before I go into the dialogues in more detail, I would stress there is also a huge programme of ongoing engagement from the unit with the full range of stakeholders North and South, albeit somewhat constrained by having to be done virtually.  We have engaged with more than 130 different groups or individual stakeholders separate to the shared island dialogue series.  This is very much about talking and developing an understanding of the shared island initiative but also very much about hearing from people what they want and what they want to see in the initiative.<br/><br/>In terms of the dialogues themselves, we have hosted four so far.  The first was launched by the Taoiseach on 26 November and was a dialogue with young people on the theme of new generations and new voices on the Good Friday Agreement.  On 5 February, we had a shared island dialogue on climate and environment on the island in which the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, participated.  On 25 March we had a dialogue on civil society engagement with participation from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and on 10 May the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, participated in a dialogue on equality on a shared island.  We are developing a programme of future shared island dialogues, the next of which will take place in early June focusing on the all-island economy.  Future dialogues will focus on health, education and other areas.<br/><br/>I will try to give the committee a sense of these dialogues.  Obviously they are taking place virtually.  We tend to have around 100 participants.  We could have a lot more because there is a lot of interest but we want these sessions to be a dialogue rather than a conference, as it were.  We put a lot of effort into ensuring a very diverse range of participants, both North and South.  One of the underlying themes in our work on the shared island dialogues has been to include voices and perspectives that are not traditionally so well heard, including those of women, young people and ethnic and minority communities.  Very often, their perspectives can be quite different from some of the more traditional ones.  We put a lot of work into participation, shaping the panel discussions and developing the themes.<br/><br/>We also do a lot of follow-up work, which is becoming more and more important for us.  Follow-up work can mean developing the connections that are made in the dialogue or developing policy ideas and initiatives.  We have seen really constructive, imaginative and practical discussion in these dialogues so far.  We have been quite pleased with the diversity of engagement and the extent of our reach.  Some of the suggestions and proposals, for example, on how civil society groups engage and work on the island are being followed up by us already in consultation with colleagues in other Departments.  The same is true for policy issues.  Reports and recordings of the dialogues are available on our website at <i>gov.ie/sharedisland</i>.  The idea of the dialogues is that they would contribute to wider civic discussion and inform how the shared island initiative is further developed.<br/><br/>I have given the committee an overview of our work in terms of the broader political framing as well as the three core areas of work on which we are currently focused, namely, understanding a shared island through research, the shared island dialogues, and building a shared island through delivering on commitments in the programme for Government and the New Decade, New Approach, NDNA, agreement.  I look forward to questions and comments from members.  My colleague, Mr. Eoghan Duffy, is also happy to answer questions.</p></speech>

On the A5, for example, there are ongoing planning issues in Northern Ireland.  It is a case of either talking to us in the unit or, in the case of the A5, for example, to the Department of Transport, which would have that information.</p></speech>

Ms O'Donoghue and Mr. Duffy are very welcome this morning.  Ms O'Dongohue has given us a very good outline of the work being done by the shared island unit.  I very much appreciate the work that is going on.  As a young councillor in 2000, I started a campaign with my council colleagues in Donegal on the A5.  It is one of a number of projects west of the Bann that have been neglected for decades.  However, the work being done by the shared island unit is resulting in the breaking down of barriers when it comes to an inter-agency approach, North and South.  We have been calling for this for years and it is now happening.  It galls me to read some of the media reports on this, which do not acknowledge what is really happening here.  The work that is being done on the ground by the shared island unit is transformative for this island.  It is time people realised that and started reporting it as it is.</p> <p>  I am familiar with a lot of what Ms O'Donoghue outlined but would like to delve further into the unit's work with the ESRI and the NESC on research.  Many people are knocking the work of the unit because they believe it is futile.  I am sure there has been much chat between the unit and others in the Taoiseach's office about this.  What is it really about?  Why is the unit considering doing all of this research?  What is the point of it?  What is the point of the research and the dialogue?  Some people are calling for a citizen's assembly.  What is the view of the unit on that issue?  Is now the right time for a citizen's assembly?  Some people believe a citizen's assembly would solve all of our problems and would get us to the point where we can all share this island peacefully.  What is the unit's view?</p><p> I hope that many in the media are listening this morning and that we get a broader approach and view of what is actually happening in the shared island unit.  Ms O'Donoghue spoke about dealing with 130 different groups across the island.  There is transformative work and the more dialogue and discussions we have like this, the better understanding people, including ourselves, will have of the work the unit is doing.  I wish it well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.562" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1556" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021051800002#E00200"><p>I, too, welcome Ms O'Donoghue and Mr. Duffy.  As the Chairman said, the scope of the work undertaken and being proposed by the shared island unit is very impressive and comprehensive.  Ms O'Donoghue said in her introductory remarks that the programme of work and the proposed investment are underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects.  I very much welcome the commitment by Ms O'Donoghue that the ring-fenced &euro;500 million that is available over the next few years, which is very welcome, is additional funding.  Too often in the past, when there was European funding specifically for cross-Border bodies and cross-Border developments, sometimes officials in the line Departments used that to substitute for what should have been line Department funding and we did not always get the additionality that was deserved and needed.  I am glad she is emphasising that this must be additional funding, not substitute funding by some Departments.</p> <p>  I am pleased that the shared island initiative has enabled adequate funding to be put in place for the restoration of the Ulster Canal.  As I represent the area, I am aware of its importance both North and South from the point of view of developing and contributing to the economic regeneration of rural areas on both sides of the Border.  I come from the immediate area of the former Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, which was restored in the early 1990s.  It is now the Shannon-Erne Waterway and it has been an outstanding success, contributing a great deal to the economy of Fermanagh, Cavan, Leitrim and further south.  I have no doubt that the Ulster Canal when completed, and it must be undertaken on an incremental basis, will contribute to and enhance rural regeneration and economic development in areas such as Clones, Cavan and elsewhere.</p> <p>  At our previous meeting, we discussed the importance of using the know-how, expertise and co-operation models that the local authorities have developed over the years.  That is very welcome, because there is a massive amount of know-how and knowledge among the local authorities and within their specific groupings.</p> <p>  Ms O'Donoghue mentioned that one of the pieces of research that will be undertaken will be in the context of the economy and regional development.  I come from the Cavan-Monaghan area and am very conscious that the central-Border area is the one that will suffer most from Brexit.  There must be a great emphasis not just on research into the regional economy but also on ensuring the investment that is required is put into those areas.  Let us face the facts.  The Dublin-Belfast corridor will look after itself regardless of the economic circumstances on this island.  If there are blips and downturns, cities of that importance will always survive and generally thrive, so there must be a special emphasis on investment in the least-developed areas, particularly the areas that have suffered most over the years.  I sincerely hope that will be taken into account when deciding on investment.</p> <p>  Ms O'Donoghue also mentioned that one of the pieces of research that will be undertaken will be in the area of education.  I have said previously that it has always been a source of regret for me that there has not been greater development of co-operation on an all-island basis in respect of education provision, particularly at the further and higher education level.  Education was one of the areas identified in the Good Friday Agreement for further close co-operation.  We are experiencing the creation of the technological universities in this State.  That will bring benefits to many areas.  Mr. Hannigan, the president of Letterkenny Institute of Technology, and his counterpart from Ulster University Magee campus gave us an outline of the great co-operation that exists between those two colleges and in the north west in particular.  I would like to see some initiatives that would grow co-operation in further and higher education in the north east of the country.  I have in mind the Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath area, which has an institute of technology.  There should be much greater co-operation and provision of education services in an all-Ireland context.</p> <p>  There are not nearly enough students from Northern Ireland attending college in this State or students from this State attending college in Northern Ireland.  Anything that could increase that participation would be very welcome.  Are any ideas being considered in regard to an educational initiative, be it a development of a capital nature or the collaboration being intensified, on an all-Ireland basis?  That would be particularly beneficial to the Border communities that I mentioned.  When the education architecture is being changed in this State we should not confine ourselves to the Border.  We need that co-operation on an all-Ireland basis in the area of further and higher education in particular.  It would be a great message to send out that the shared island initiative was the catalyst for further development, collaboration and progress in that area.</p></speech>

As good as Ms O'Donoghue is, I doubt that she will answer all those questions in that time.  To be helpful to everybody, I have no issue with the members using up the ten minutes but we are stuck with our timeline.  I will give five minutes for a reply and every other group will get the same facility, if that is acceptable.  I think that is fair.  I will go with that because I do not see anybody complaining.  Respectfully, Ms O'Donoghue has five minutes to answer those questions.  I realise it is a short timeline.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.564" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aingeal O&rsquo;Donoghue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021051800002#E00400"><p>Some of what was said is more for us to take away and reflect on, because there were some very interesting points.</p> <p>  Senator Blaney asked what the research and dialogues are for and raised the point about a citizens' assembly.  In terms of the research, Professor Alan Ahearne, head of the ESRI, made two points when we launched the scoping papers yesterday, and they are very much the product of our discussions with the ESRI as well.  One is that where jurisdictions are neighbouring, it is very common to do quite a lot of this type of research.  There are many of the same factors in the delivery of social services, be it health, education and so forth, but there are different systems and, therefore, there are different outcomes in many instances.  There can be a great deal of rich learning there in terms of understanding the factors that lead to good outcomes and how they impact on one another.  That is one point.</p> <p>  The second point is that we all feel that there are opportunities for increased collaboration and connection that are as yet untapped.  We can talk about them in broad-brush terms, but to understand them and to understand how to make them happen in a meaningful way requires much more research, in our view, certainly in areas such as public services or, indeed, understanding the economy.  For example, in the case of the economy and Brexit, there is a huge focus on the goods trade on the island and the what the impact of Brexit might be on that, but far less on services.  It is about understanding ourselves, how we work and how we do business, be it as a Government or in the enterprise sectors, and then looking at where that can be complementary.  That is what is behind the research programme.  We also see it very much informing Government policy choices and the discussions and dialogues.</p> <p>  As regards a citizens' assembly or other similar approaches, we believe the shared island dialogue approach is the right one now.</p><p>It has enabled us to reach out to a wide range of people.  It is a different type of engagement to a citizens' assembly, which involves 100 people.  Obviously, an assembly is quite representative but it is one set of 100 people.  Our view was that what was more valuable was a more broad-based engagement and, in particular, a real ambition for us is to bring new voices to the table.  That is not to take from the extraordinary commitment, expertise and insight of the many people who have been working on these issues for decades but if we are to talk meaningfully about our future on this island, then it must be a conversation that involves everyone.  Again, I am not just speaking about both communities in Northern Ireland; I am also speaking about people this jurisdiction.  As the Taoiseach said at one point, a conversation about what a shared island means is very different for a person in County Donegal than it is for someone in County Cork.  It has quite a different meaning, perhaps.  It is very different if someone is a migrant or from the Travelling community.  What matters to a person when he or she talks about the future can be quite different.  Thus, the objective here is to have those conversations.  It is a phase.  We will need to take stock after this round of shared island dialogues to see where we go next with them.  In particular, as we make the transition, we all hope, from virtual meetings to meeting in person, that opens up a whole way of engagement which we are trying to think about now.</p><p> Apologies, I am probably going on a bit long.  I thank Deputy Brendan Smith.  His point about all the regions along the Border is very well made.  We have engaged with the Irish Central Border Area Network, ICBAN, which is long-established in the Border region.  As can be seen, some of the initiatives we are concretely moving on are in that region but it is a well-made point.  Further and higher education is absolutely something we are doing quite a lot of work on.  We are working very closely with the new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and there is very strong commitment from it as well.  Some of it might be partnerships between higher education institutions on either side of the Border.  We too have had very good engagement with Letterkenny Institute of Technology.  With some of it, we would look to see can there be more structured engagement, for example around building research links, etc.  On the Deputy's point about how not enough students travelling to study both South to North and North to South, we are actually doing some work to try to understand why that is, what the obstacles are and what are the factors driving student choice.  It would be of incalculable benefit into the future if there was a growing body of young people who had worked, studied, made friendships and learned South to North and North to South, as I said.  It is certainly on our radar.</p></speech>

I am in one of these booths in the convention centre for the first time and it feels a bit odd.  I just managed to get the lights on.</p> <p>  My question relates to the North-South Ministerial Council.  It is obviously dependent on having a nationalist and a unionist Minister attend and we have seen non-attendance in the last number of months, thought there has been attendance as well.  When there has been attendance, the meetings have been very productive and we saw announcement regarding the Ulster Canal.  That is something which will benefit people's quality of life and that is really important.  There is a lot of emphasis on ensuring, post Brexit, that we are making the structures of the Good Friday Agreement work and that we are working on keeping the relationships and the work progressing, both east-west and North-South.  Has it affected the work of the unit, and if so, how?  Will it affect the work of the unit in future?</p></speech>

It is really excellent and interesting.  One of the things I am most interested is the feedback, particularly that from all the younger groups and especially the New Voices and New Generations on the Good Friday Agreement dialogue.  Perhaps the officials could address that.  One of the points that came out of the dialogue is that there is "a lower level of awareness and engagement among young people on the Good Friday Agreement, particularly in the South" and a feeling "that many of the enduring challenges for the Peace Process are related to socio-economic issues including education".  I am very interested in the work the unit is doing to bring new voices into this dialogue because that is really important.  People who are not engaged in this conversation are exactly those from whom we are interested in hearing in order to get new perspectives and, indeed, all the perspectives.  I am interested in that group in particular.  Will the officials detail how they have selected them and the sort of feedback they gave?</p></speech>

I will say something on the council and then ask Mr. Duffy to come in on the dialogue in a little more detail.</p> <p>  Clearly, the council is a critical part of the architecture of the Good Friday Agreement.  Following a plenary meeting of the council at the end of July, we had a full round of North-South Ministerial Council sectoral meetings last autumn.  We then had another plenary meeting in December.  It was virtual but it was a good meeting and there were good outcomes.  Obviously, there is politicisation around the North-South Ministerial Council right now with what we might call a mixed record of participation.  It has not stopped but a number of the sectoral meetings have not happened.  Some of them did not happen when originally planned to and some have not happened at all.  It was welcome to see the transport ministerial meeting happen on 5 May.  It was one of the ones which had been postponed and is actually particularly critical, given a lot of the infrastructure work I was talking about.  We have to see how this plays out, particularly around a plenary meeting we are aiming to have again this summer.  We will continue to push forward with our work and try to work with the Executive in whatever ways we can.  Obviously, certain things should go to the North-South Ministerial Council and we are certainly keen to see issues dealt with and formally discussed there but we can also look at other ways of working, as necessary.  Thus, it is potentially impactful but for the moment we have been able to keep the work moving forward.  I have given a little of the sense of the dialogues but I ask Mr. Duffy to come in at this point.</p></speech>

I am sorry but I dropped off the call earlier and did not quite hear the question from Deputy Carroll MacNeill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.575" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021051800002#F01100"><p>I was asking about the new voices the unit is trying to bring into the dialogue.  The New Generations and New Voices on the Good Friday Agreement report is very interesting because these are, by definition, very new voices.  I was struck by some of the comments in it.  It was quite interesting around the interest in social change and all that but also evident from the report is a lack of knowledge about the Good Friday Agreement, possibly, and a focus on socioeconomic issues.  I am wondering what is behind that comment, as a second question.</p></speech>

The overarching theme from the first dialogue with young people - and the Deputy mentioned a couple of points there - was a desire for more opportunities for connection between each other on the island.  It came through really strongly both as an end in itself and then in terms of an interest in having an opportunity to work together and talk together on particular issues.  The point was also made that both the North-South and east-west dimensions to those connections and relationships should be fostered.  That is something that has come up as well in subsequent dialogues when we have had a focus on, for instance, the environment.</p><p>There is recognition of how much civil society is a part of finding solutions on the environmental, climate and biodiversity crises and the need to take account of what people at community and civil society levels are saying on an all-island basis but also to provide supports so that can happen to a greater extent.  That is a really strong theme that has come through and we are reflecting in the unit and in Departments around how that could be better supported and taken account of.</p></speech>

It is great to see the different points of life being included, whether they are social, environmental or education issues.  How were those groups brought together?  How were they selected?</p></speech>

We started with key stakeholders and people who are deeply involved with the sector, whether in environment, youth work or civil society co-operation.  That was the starting point.  We pushed to bring participants together to see how we could get to new representatives and voices.  We proactively asked if people were working with women, young or new communities and we asked them to nominate people who could represent those new perspectives.</p></speech>

It is probably just the passage of time.  The major events in the peace process were 23 years ago, so younger people do not feel the same connection and have not had the same lived experience.  They see and understand things in a different way.  That is not to say there is a lack of understanding but there is certainly a sense of a generational difference and that there could be a better connection with what is happening with the peace process today.  It is a strong point that came through from young people participating that day.</p></speech>

It is around broadening the net and precisely about trying to bring into a discussion people who, as witnesses have mentioned, may not have had as much awareness or engagement around the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>

I share Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile's view that awareness is a bit low around this and I would prefer to see more insights coming out of this and the sharing of progress.  Is one of the outputs of the series that there could be an appetite to progress the North-South consultative forum and there could be engagement with enough groups for us to have some momentum behind getting that up and running?  It is another part of the Good Friday Agreement that has not been implemented.  Are there lessons from the dialogue that could bring us in that direction?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.586" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoghan Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021051800002#G01000"><p>The views and perspectives will certainly speak to the value of that kind of forum and the importance of getting the North-South consultative forum up and running, if that proved possible.  If it does not prove possible, we are also seeing that people at a civil society level are moving ahead and building or deepening connections on the island anyway.  That is also very worthwhile and valuable.  We are already following up with a number of groups and proposals where interesting suggestions have been made, such as to increase networking between women's representatives on the island and young people.  Short of the formal political decisions around consultative forums, much can also be done and we are following up on that.</p></speech>

Much of the work of the shared island unit is very useful in that respect.  I am thinking of the A5 project and the education and co-operation that has been mentioned.  Regardless of whether somebody has political views or none, the work will provide an economic benefit to the entire island.  Will the witnesses briefly comment on where they see that going or what new synergies, if any, could arise as a result of the dialogue?  That is the part of our island that is most disadvantaged, in many respects, despite having wonderful tourist attractions and resources in the form of its young people, who are the future of our island.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.588" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aingeal O&rsquo;Donoghue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021051800002#G01200"><p>We have had quite a lot of engagement with the north west.  I am very conscious I am speaking in the presence of Deputies from the region but there is no doubt when meeting people from Donegal County Council or Derry City and Strabane District Council - we normally meet them together - that the level of co-operation between them and the extent to which they see progress for the north west involving both sides of the Border are very striking.  We already have with these bodies a north west strategic growth partnership in which the Irish Government and Northern Ireland Executive put &euro;2.5 million each.  This is a sort of leverage fund to enable these bodies to do more work on what might be beneficial.  Some of that funding is coming to an end and from the Irish Government's perspective, we are very open to continuing it.  We will find a way to do that.</p> <p>  More important are the discussions beyond that into what we can do specifically.  The Chairman mentioned the A5 and higher education capacity for the region is a really big theme in the north west.  It is critical as a driver.  Again, I am conscious there are representatives from the region.  There is a sense that some of the initial or earlier infrastructure problems, such as broadband and connectivity issues, are no longer as pressing as they were and we now need to consider newer areas of development, including climate response, the climate economy and, as I mentioned, developing enterprise further with technology parks, etc.  There are many ideas and we are certainly working quite closely with these bodies.  We have a meeting scheduled with the north west strategic growth partnership for early July.  It is very active.  The education piece is certainly one of the strongest themes over and above traditional infrastructure.</p></speech>

Any conversation or dialogue must be commended and it is very important to start from that point.  The witnesses mentioned they have engaged with 130 different groups, which is impressive given the Covid-19 pandemic and restrictions on who could be spoken with and when.  I am surmising that was done over Zoom or MS Teams meetings but it is very important work.</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned they would speak more to some of the women's groups and youth organisations across the island.  How does this unit draw up the list of who it will speak to, as this is very important?  I have seen recently that there is much collaboration between some of the youth organisations that work across the Border.  Will the unit engage with those type of youth workers and leaders?  I am also thinking of some of the women's groups, such as the Shankill Women's Centre and the Falls Women's Centre in my constituency, which do very positive work across communities.  I know they have other engagements right across Belfast and beyond.</p> <p>  How does the unit draw up the list?  The witnesses said they engage with people in the sector but does this process reach the grassroots?</p><p>I know, for example, that over the last number of months, some of the youth groups in Belfast have engaged in a very positive way along the peace lines, preventing some of the outbreaks of violence and the riots on our streets.  They have worked tirelessly.  Has the unit engaged with those types of youth groups?  That is a most important piece of information.</p><p>On the issue of the train link between Belfast and Dublin, has there been engagement on the development of a high-speed rail link and the economic corridor between Dublin and Belfast?  They are the two largest cities on the island.  If that project is done right and well, everywhere else in between will benefit from it.  I would like to know if there has been engagement on that issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.591" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Chris Hazzard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021051800002#H00200"><p>I thank Ms O'Donoghue and Mr. Duffy for their presentation.  I have two questions.  The first has been touched upon already.  It concerns the development of the Narrow Water bridge and progress on that project.  It has been a commitment for some time now between the administrations, North and South.  Given that it was earmarked for development in the New Decade, New Approach agreement of last year, the local community would have expected more progress by now.  Certainly, they would have expected a more coherent public update as to the status of the project.  If that is not possible today, I would very much like to meet Ms O'Donoghue and Mr. Duffy in the weeks ahead to follow up on the issue.</p> <p>  Second, if the Narrow Water Bridge and projects like that are the hardware that we can enjoy going forward, we also need to look at the software, as it were.  I refer explicitly to Ireland's Ancient East, and the ludicrous situation that it stops at the Border.  I represent a part of the world that was the playground of C&uacute; Chulainn and Fionn Mac Cumhaill.  Our shoreline is marked with the legacy of St. Patrick, the Vikings, the Normans and the Planters.  Taking Downpatrick town, for example, the graves of St. Patrick, the viking king, Magnus, and Thomas Russell, the founder of the United Irishmen, are located there.  We have the only working heritage railway in all of Ireland.  The Struell Wells and St. Patrick's church at Saul, which is known as the cradle of Christianity in Ireland, are located in the area.  Despite this, we cannot tap into Ireland's Ancient East, which is a very rich and promising tourism initiative.  We have seen the positive impact that the Wild Atlantic Way has had on the west of the country.  Tourism providers in County Down are crying out for this type of investment and support, certainly on the back of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.  Now is the time to look at how it can be done and to work alongside people.  It is only right that Ireland's Ancient East should stretch right up through County Down and into County Antrim.  The Wild Atlantic Way goes right around the western coast to the Giant's Causeway and Rathlin Island.  Is the shared island unit working on that issue?  It is as important as investment in the hardware projects.  It is equally important that we also start to look at how we link up some of these tourism initiatives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.592" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1688" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021051800002#H00300"><p>Ms O'Donoghue referred to the programme for Government commitments.  Does the shared island unit see its role as specifically pertaining to the shared island aspects or the cross-cutting programme for Government commitments?  I have raised the point previously, but one of the obvious issues for me is the need for dialogue and preparatory work around the issue of proposed voting rights for Irish citizens based outside the State, which I believe chimes very positively and well with the work being done by the unit.  We need to have a conversation about that and it needs to be given a platform.  In the same vein, I wonder if there has been any engagement with our diaspora on the issue?  I refer both to the long-standing diaspora and many of the young people from across the entirety of country who have had to emigrate in recent years.  Due to the fact that the world has changed there is greater global access, the diaspora are very much connected into Irish life and want to be a part of it.</p> <p>  The issue of a citizens' assembly was mentioned earlier.  From my perspective, I do not see it as being one or the other.  That is to say, I do not see the shared island unit as being in competition with any citizens' assembly on this issue.  I put it to Ms O'Donoghue and Mr. Duffy that such an initiative by the Government would actually assist and be of additional use to their work, as opposed to taking in any way from the work the unit is doing.  It does not have to be one or the other.  I certainly do not envisage it being that way.  There is a role for the shared island unit and the work it is doing.</p> <p>  As well as growing calls outside the Oireachtas for a citizens' assembly - the committee heard from the Reverend Karen Sethuraman and Mr. Trevor Lunn, MLA, on the issue last week - it is now the agreed position of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, for example, that the Government should establish a citizens' assembly to plan and prepare.  That should not be downplayed or forgotten.  It is a political reality.  I wanted to make that point and ask the question specifically around the programme for Government commitments and engagement with the diaspora going forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.593" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aingeal O&rsquo;Donoghue" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2021051800002#H00400"><p>On the question of how we draw up the lists, to build on what Mr. Duffy said, I cannot say that we have reached everyone.  Part of it is numbers and part of it is knowledge.  Most importantly, we are not simply taking the tried and tested or the well-known stakeholders or interlocutors on a particular suite of issues, whether it is equality, the environment or whatever.  We are trying to push out the boundaries and very consciously look at more local groups or those which have not previously been involved in the work in any North-South dimension.  We are thinking about Traveller groups and minority ethnic groups.  Some of it is about a conscious decision to ask whether we have enough or the right set of people.  It is about pushing and asking who we could speak to about certain issues and who might be able to make suggestions for groups to be contacted.</p> <p>  Mr. Maskey knows better than I do that we are not starting this work from scratch.  A huge amount of work is already taking place on the island.  There is a huge amount of outreach and engagement that our colleagues, particularly in the Department of Foreign Affairs, do in Northern Ireland on a daily basis, including through the Belfast office.  Therefore, we have things to draw on.  When we are having a dialogue in an area like the environment, we obviously engage with the relevant Department and agencies and seek suggestions from them on who we can contact.  I am not saying that we get to everyone; I do not think we do.  However, we have made a very creditable effort at pushing the boundaries.  We can see that in the dialogues and the perspectives that are brought to them.  When we get to having face-to-face meetings, we will need to look at that strategy again and how we can really make it work on the ground for people.  We are always happy to get suggestions.</p> <p>  On the issue of the high-speed rail link, it is a key part of the strategic rail review, along with the idea of having a spine of connectivity.  It is part of the overall review.</p> <p>  I very much hear what Mr. Hazzard has said on the issue of the Narrow Water bridge project.  He is probably right that we may need to have a further conversation on the matter.  I can tell him that the project is very much on our list of priorities.  We have had a lot of engagement with the two local councils.  The Northern Ireland Executive's Minister for Infrastructure, Nichola Mallon, and her officials are also very positively disposed to the project.  However, there are still a range of issues around the project, linked to design, planning permissions and other areas, that we are working through.  Frankly, I would be happy to hear as many voices from the region and locality urging action on the Narrow Water bridge project as possible, because it is important that there is a real understanding that this is something that is valuable and wanted in the local region.</p><p> On the tourism point, even on the other side the Wild Atlantic Way also stops at the Border, even though it is picked up, as it were, by the causeway.  To look at something like that would require positive engagement from the Northern Ireland Executive.  The were some discussions the time we established the Wild Atlantic Way.  We would be happy to continue to discuss it, but I am not sure that we would get a positive response right now on that.  </p><p> On the referendum, this may seem like the opposite of the point about the money that we have in the Shared Island Fund being used.  The shared island initiative is not taking over all pieces of work that relate to North-South or all-island work.  Obviously, we have an interest in the referendum and we keep engaged with it, but it is being led by colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage who have responsibility for electoral issues and by colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It is not a project we are taking on separately.  It already has structures around it and a commitment from Government on it.  They will continue to deliver on that.  </p><p> We want to have engagement with the diaspora.  We have only had limited engagement so far.  When we started this, we would have thought about trips to the United States, many trips to Great Britain etc. and how we might begin to open up conversations there.  We have done a little bit of engagement with the diaspora, but not as much as we would like at this stage and we need to develop it more.  </p><p> I accept what was said about the citizens' assembly not being a choice of one or the other.  The Government's approach is the shared island approach through the shared island dialogues.  The Taoiseach and the Minister have both outlined their position on a citizens' assembly.  </p></speech>

The National Economic and Social Council is doing the kind of research that we have sought in partnership with the Irish Research Council and the research coach at the ESRI, which is all very much engaged research.  It is about talking to people in the different sectors and hearing from them as a fundamental part of the conclusions and recommendations that will be coming through from that.  That is of clear value.</p> <p>  It is very important that we can hear from people and that people can talk to us and to other Departments and agencies, but we are working on these issues.  We see connections between people as an objective of the initiative in its own right.  Under PEACE+, there will be a particular funding opportunity to enhance opportunities for North-South connections at community and civil society levels.  We are certainly encouraging people to consider that and to take up the opportunity that is there.  There are other funding streams from Government that can also provide support.  We are also focusing on that.  </p></speech>

I appreciate that is a different Department, but it is an important theme.  One of the big issues with the shared island initiative is that it also has responsibility under Article 2 of the Constitution to ensure that everyone born on the island has the right to be part of the Irish nation.  That cuts across what Mr. Hazzard and I have said.  I do not see the shared island unit having a role to do with that, but in the broader thematic discussions about how the Irish Government does not just facilitate a dialogue between communities and across the island which is very welcome and important, but also tells us what it will do within its power and within its gift, unilaterally - I do not say that in a negative sense, but in a positive sense - to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement and Article 2 of the Constitution are fully upheld and implemented.  I wanted to make that point to clarify.</p></speech>

I believe there is scope for much greater practical co-operation on the island, notwithstanding and without prejudice to whatever may happen on political and constitutional issues.  Much more can be done even on a stand-alone basis.</p> <p>  I wish to record my deep disappointment and concern at the current approach of the DUP to North-South co-operation, which is an integral part of the Good Friday Agreement.  If an effective sustained boycott emerges, it will be very damaging to everyone's mutual interest, including to the social, economic and environmental welfare of the people of Northern Ireland.  Co-operation in areas such as health is of intrinsic importance to people's lives.  </p> <p>  I appreciate my questions may slightly cut across areas that are the responsibility of the Department of Foreign Affairs and I apologise in advance if I do that.  I want to flag up four different areas.  I echo the comments Deputy Brendan Smith made earlier on about education, particularly further and higher education, which is an area that is significantly underdeveloped.  </p> <p>  Given that we are all mindful of the importance of addressing climate change, whatever we do on climate change policy both North and South in areas like renewable deals, it is important that we try to co-ordinate those as much as possible to try to find economies of scale that would be of mutual benefit.  Of course, the environment does not respect borders in any event.  That is an obvious area to highlight.  </p> <p>  I wish to highlight two further points arising from Brexit.  They are not necessarily part of the wider UK-EU negotiations but go to the area of North-South co-operation.  The first relates to the mutual recognition of professional qualifications.  Progress has been made on a bilateral basis, but that is largely happening between the respective professional bodies rather than necessarily being an overarching approach.  I think only about ten or a dozen areas have been agreed so far.  I would like to get a sense of where things stand in that regard.  </p> <p>  During 2017 and 2018 a very extensive mapping exercise was conducted as part of the preparations for Brexit relating to areas of North-South co-operation.  I believe about 140 areas were identified.  Is any work going on to audit where we stand on all those areas post-Brexit?  What areas are running satisfactorily and what areas are being significantly impacted?  We need to identify in a more systematic way areas where some degree of remedial action is required to protect the co-operation we had previously, before we consider new areas of co-operation.  </p></speech>

Hopefully an in-person meeting will be possible soon.  He is right to highlight further and higher education, and climate.  As he said, the environment does not recognise any borders.  We need to drill down into the specific things we need to do on an all-island basis, and the things that may be happening on the broader international scale because the UK shares the common commitments in terms of the ambition on zero emissions.</p><p>There is quite a lot of work going on.  To go to Dr. Farry's last point about the mapping exercise, it was one of the areas about which we were quite concerned, in the sense that much of the environment co-operation on the island is underpinned by the massive amount of shared EU regulation.  That is, therefore, an area we continue to watch quite carefully.  I might ask Mr. Duffy to come in on the mapping exercise.  If issues are becoming problematic post Brexit, however, obviously, there are ways for those to be flagged up through the North-South Ministerial Council secretariat and through the work of departments.</p><p> It is not possible to do a government-to-government bilateral agreement on the mutual recognition of professional qualifications because it is an EU competence.  We went into this fairly extensively during the Brexit preparedness phase and ended up having to look at profession to profession.  What has happened has not happened by chance, however.  It was a massive piece of work right across Government on our side, with every Department, through their agencies and out to their professional bodies, to try to ensure that the kind of recognition needed though the professional body link was put in place.  I am very open to hearing that there are problems.  Our assessment at the end of the year was that almost all of them were in place.  In some instances, that means it is not quite as easy as it was before but there are mechanisms.  A very significant part of our Brexit preparedness work was to make sure we could arrive on the other side of Brexit with at least sufficient scaffolding in place to allow this to happen.  Clearly, however, as it goes through, we want to see whether it is working or whether it is working in such a way that may still be having a chilling effect.  All these things have to be seen.  Does Mr. Duffy want to come in on the mapping exercise or anything else?</p></speech>

Briefly, as Dr. Farry noted, the mapping exercise was comprehensive.  It was also indicative in recognising that important co-operation also takes place in many other areas.  The North-South Ministerial Council meetings in recent months have all specifically considered the impacts of Brexit for the different sectoral areas.  As Ms O'Donoghue said, Departments and agencies, North and South, are also very much looking to see where there may be impacts and it is an area on which civil society has focused as well.  That is an important contribution.  Everyone is watching carefully and is concerned to see that difficulties do not arise.</p> <p>  A separate stream of PEACE Plus funding, which I believe will be important over time, is looking at administrative, regulatory and other barriers to co-operation across borders and at providing funding for research and stakeholder engagement for Departments and agencies to come together to identify and find solutions to those problems where they exist.  It will be important to see that stream fully taken up and directed to the kinds of issues that may arise.</p></speech>

I welcome both Ms O'Donoghue and Mr. Duffy.  I thank them very much for coming in and giving us this presentation.  I absolutely 100% welcome the shared island dialogue they are having with many diverse groups.  It is fantastic and really important to hear experiences and viewpoints from all voices throughout Ireland and that it is all-inclusive.</p> <p>  One question I was going to ask, which has been covered, concerns the citizens' assembly.  Last week, I was really delighted that Fianna F&aacute;il accepted my amendment to acknowledge the need for responsible planning and preparation for possible constitutional change, as anticipated in the Good Friday Agreement, and, therefore, supports the establishment of an all-island citizens' assembly to discuss options.</p> <p>  I love citizens' assemblies because they have worked in many different areas such as the marriage referendum and others.  I feel it is a really rational and respectful debate with thoughtful, considered discussion, which already begins in people's homes and spaces and is brought into the citizens' assembly alongside the expert evidence, passionate testimony and all those things.  They set the tone for public debate in a really respectful way, which is why I love the idea of them.  I understand that Ms O'Donoghue covered this and noted it relates to a different Department and it is not her area.  I imagine the work she is doing is really enjoyable.  As I said, I love dialogue and listening and talking to people.</p> <p>  Ms O'Donoghue has covered the citizens' assembly piece.  The shared island unit hinges on co-operation from the North and on all political views as well.  Dr Farry touched on the DUP withdrawing co-operation.  How much does Ms O'Donoghue think that will have an impact on North-South co-operation in the current circumstances?   How does that affect the shared island unit?</p></speech>

Obviously, a new dimension, which the Senator highlighted, is that Seanad vote on a citizens' assembly, on which the Government will have to reflect.</p> <p>  I see Ms Hanna is now back in the meeting.  The future of North-South co-operation is concerning.  We are obviously in a period of somewhat unsettled politics at the moment.  We need to see how that pans out in terms of both the formal work of the North-South Ministerial Council and broader co-operation and engagement around, as we always frame it, mutually beneficial North-South projects.  Clearly, there is a concern at the moment and the politics around the North-South Ministerial Council have been mixed into the politics around the protocol in a way we would not agree has an actual connection.  The North-South Ministerial Council is there as part of the agreed institutions under the Good Friday Agreement and it should operate on those terms.  It is something we are watching very carefully and engaging with.</p> <p>  While some of the North-South Ministerial Council meetings have not happened and we have seen what is around that, there continues to be quite good engagement at official level.  While I would not for a second imply that this is sufficient, it means we can keep going for the moment.  It is not the answer but I would say there is still quite good engagement around a number of the areas at official level.</p></speech>

While I am happy to take this away, that is a political decision at this point.   We have a work programme for the moment, which we agreed with the Government, and that is what we are working on.  We will, of course, be feeding what has been said to us today back to the Government.</p></speech>

I really appreciated the presentation and just how comprehensive the research scoping has been.  I say that as the proud owner of a big bound copy of the New Ireland Forum reports, which my hoarder father kept from the 1980s.</p><p>I enjoyed the ease with which I was able to browse through the papers and, obviously, the forum complements SDLP thinking in the years immediately after the Good Friday Agreement, the scope of North-South bodies that we tried to implement then, our thinking in and around 2007 and our North-South Makes Sense piece of work.  I am glad to hear the rhyme with that and the practical issues around health, primary care, education and skills, and foreign direct investment.  What is this project about if it is not about improving material well-being and outcomes for people across the island?  We also must consider how to capitalise other research and pieces of work that people in civic society and elsewhere are doing.  People will be aware of the SDLP's New Ireland Commission, which is picking up and running with some of these questions and hoping to spark off practical conversations.</p><p> It is possible that the committee has discussed this matter during the couple of contributions I missed, but I want to ask about the politics around the North-South Ministerial Council, the delivery of our shared island unit and what our guests think we can do to disarm any misapprehensions.  Are there things that our guests think the Assembly can take forward to enable some of the practical projects?  I am a representative in Westminster.  With that in mind, are there ideas for which our guests would like us to advocate?  I apologise again for missing the conversation and thank our guests for their presentations.</p></speech>

It is much appreciated and important because, as I said, this needs buy-in across government but also across the Oireachtas and other elected bodies.  I talked a little about the North-South Ministerial Council because I was asked about it.  It is a challenge for us now and for some of the parties in the Executive.  The North-South Ministerial Council is an integral part of the Good Friday Agreement and of the architecture around it.  It is also, as Dr. Farry was saying, critical to the delivery of practical work that will benefit people on the island.  It is a mixed picture at the moment.  It is clear that there are many areas of politics into which the politics of the protocol have now been inserted.  We will need to see how that plays out as we get into the next phase with a new leader of the DUP, what will happen in terms of its nomination for First Minister and what approach will be taken.</p> <p>  We continue to push for North-South Ministerial Council meetings and prepare fully for them.  We are preparing for our plenary at the moment, even though we do not have a confirmed date.  It is certainly something on which we continue to work all the time.  While it is not a substitute, there remains good contact at an official level, both through the North-South Ministerial Council and outside that framework.</p> <p>  When it comes to other enablers, I have always been of the view that the more that other voices point to the benefits of North-South co-operation in a practical way, including as many voices as possible from outside the political sphere, the more helpful it will be.  The more business is ready and willing to talk about the benefits of operating an all-island economy and the more higher education institutions talk about their appetite for doing more research on the island, the better.  That is an important point because it drives a message from a constituency level up to politicians.  It also helps to depoliticise some of the issues and to highlight the benefits.</p> <p>  Ms Hanna and I might talk separately about messages in Westminster.  We see an east-west dimension to the shared island initiative.  The initiative is about the island but there are places where we think there could be a good triangular structure between Dublin, London and Belfast.  One of those might be in the area of research and innovation where there is a Westminster wish to see research driven out into the regions.  There are a few areas in which we can link in and give Ms Hanna a sense of some of our thinking.</p></speech>

I thank our guests for their presentations.  This discussion is useful.

How is that managed, with everything being underpinned by the principles in the Good Friday Agreement as they refer to parity of esteem and all of that?  How is that engagement done?  That is probably my main question.  Some of the research questions I wanted to ask have already been answered.</p></speech>

I am sure that if our guests need a permanent home, there is plenty of scope for space in the North.</p> <p>  I am a farmer's daughter.  With the environment, talk about climate change and Brexit, our farming communities are feeling very vulnerable and, as custodians of the island, I would be keen for them to be represented.  I do not think they were represented in the dialogues event in February, although they may have been and I hope they were.  It is important to tie in with farming groups across the island.</p> <p>  I have a specific question about the allocation of &euro;500 million in the shared island fund.  I welcome any work that has been done so far on the Ulster Canal and the Sligo to Enniskillen greenway.  That is all very important for my constituency.  Have there been any conversations with the Minister for Infrastructure in the North about the Enniskillen bypass and whether any of that money is likely to be allocated from the fund to ensure that work goes ahead?</p></speech>

As a representative of the north-west region, I commend the work that has been done to date between the two council areas.  It has been fantastic and is a good example of North-South co-operation.</p><p>Following on from this, the potential of the north-west region in its entirety is dependent on the delivery of the A5 western transport corridor.  Unfortunately, we had a recent setback to the A5 but I hope that following the next public inquiry we will see the delivery of the project, which is crucial to the regeneration of the entire north-west region.  I want to touch on the fact that &euro;500 million has been allocated to the shared island unit.  Originally, the Irish Government had agreed to co-fund the A5.  It has now committed only &euro;75 million towards it.  Is there potential for the Irish Government to increase its contribution to the A5?  Will additional funding be made available to the shared island unit and cross-Border projects?</p></speech>

With regard to the A5, the Government has budgeted the &euro;75 million and it has not yet been spent.  It is going through a further process in the North following the interim report from the planning appeals commission.  There will then be a further round of consultation and a final report.  I cannot make commitments today but what I can say is that the A5 has always been regarded as a strategic project for the north west.  If we get to a situation where it is going to happen and where there will be shovels in the ground, then speaking today, and I cannot say where we will be in a couple of years time, the Irish Government will be up for a conversation on how much more or in what way it can further support it.  I do not think this conversation will happen until we get through these various planning cycles in the North.  This project has been around as a joint project since St. Andrews.  At this point, we would want to make sure it was moving into delivery phase, at which point we could have more conversations.  This is all without prejudice but there certainly would be an openness to having that conversation.</p> <p>  With regard to the farming community, our colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine make the point that in the Border regions agriculture is an absolutely critical part of the economy.  This is part of what we want to do.  There are also interesting ideas about women in agriculture that we would like to see developed.</p> <p>  With regard to the unit, we are quite small.  In addition to Mr. Duffy and me there are three other members of staff, with one more coming on board.  That being said, we work very closely with others, including colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and other Departments.  It is a small unit but we have been able to maintain focus and deliver.  People are not working in the office at present but we are Dublin-based.  We are thinking about how we will do more regional outreach on the ground once we can travel and, going back to some of the points others have raised, how we do more, particularly with the younger generation.  These are all issues we are looking towards to plan for the future.</p> <p>  I will have to come back on the Enniskillen bypass.  I do not know whether there have been discussions.  There may have been discussions between the Ministers, Mr. Mallon and Deputy Ryan.  I will check this and come back on it.</p> <p>  To respond to Deputy Conway-Walsh, engagement with political parties and how we do this is another piece we need to develop more.  These engagements for us with the committee have been very important.  We have had engagement with political parties in the North and we have been open to engagement with all of them.  Not all of them have met us but we have been very open to engaging with all of them.  There is a piece that needs to be further developed.  I know there are some initiatives in this area, perhaps looking at younger and newer members of the Assembly and the Oireachtas.  There has also been some outreach between the women's caucuses in the Oireachtas and the Assembly and we have had some engagement on this with the chair of the women's caucus in the Oireachtas.  It is a piece that as time goes on we want to develop more.</p></speech>

I do not have specific information on the project but focusing on strategic investment and public investment priorities in Northern Ireland through the strategic investment board process in Stormont and in the South through the national development plan review is an important part of getting strategic investment joined up between both sides.  On our side we are working on the national development plan.</p></speech>

With regard to engagement in Northern Ireland, our approach is to look to periodic engagements with all of the political parties in Northern Ireland.  We managed one live visit in the windows between the various Covid lockdowns.  That was our approach then and it continues to be our approach.  More broadly on Northern Ireland, I should add that since Easter the Taoiseach has spoken to the leaders of the political parties.  There continues to be that type of systematic engagement.  We have not developed ideas yet so I do not want to make it sound as though we are about to announce initiatives, and the committee might feel we should be.  As we look to a phase of in-person meetings we are looking at how we might structure this in a more developed way, particularly building some themes around it, as I mentioned.</p></speech>

Mr. John O'Dowd and I have launched an initiative to examine some of the barriers that have led to a reduction in student mobility since the Good Friday Agreement and what are their causes.  There is no point in us all reinventing the wheel.  If work is being done it is very important that political parties know about it and that there is additionality rather than reinventing the wheel.  We have an ever-changing political system and political environment and we all need to be ahead of the curve.</p></speech>

I cannot welcome the shared island unit enough.  How do we ensure there is buy-in from all groups?  Many groups have been established and are working on our future.  The best group to look at it is the one established by the Taoiseach of Ireland.  How do we get buy-in and co-operation from the other groups?  We are all better working together and we know this.  How do we get buy-in and engagement?</p></speech>

I take the Senator's point that many different groups are developing ideas.  It is not like we are the first to say that people involved in civil society should talk to one another or build connections.  We need to build on what has gone before.  I thank the Chair for this second opportunity for Mr. Duffy and me to engage.  We are happy to continue this engagement.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.639" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021051800002#A00200"><p>We are joined by the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage with responsibility for local government and planning, Deputy Peter Burke.  The opening statement and briefing material have been circulated to members.  Today we will commence pre-legislative scrutiny on the general scheme of the local government (directly elected mayor with executive functions in Limerick city &amp;amp; county) Bill 2021.  First, I will ask the Minister of State for his opening statement and then members be will invited members to address their questions.</p> <p>  Members attending remotely within the Leinster House complex are protected by absolute privilege.  This means they have absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say in the meeting.  However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and the convention centre.  For witnesses attending remotely, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege.  As such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a person who is physically present does.  The opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister of State to the committee.  We will commence pre-legislative scrutiny on the directly elected mayor Bill, an important and possibly landmark moment in Irish democracy, where we look at directly electing a mayor with real powers in the areas of transport, housing and planning.  Where we see a lot of that power vested in county chief executives at the moment, the directly elected mayor would obviously take on some of those powers.  I invite the Minister of State to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am joined by Ms Mairead Ryan and Mr. Paris Beausang from the Department's franchise section and by Mr. Diarmuid O'Leary, Ms &Aacute;inle N&iacute; Bhriain and Mr. Grant Couper from the Department's local government section.  I also thank the committee for agreeing to pre-legislative scrutiny of this general scheme of the Bill so promptly.</p><p>I look forward to outlining the policy proposals, which will significantly reform how local government operates in both Limerick city and county.  The general scheme sets out the major local government reform, providing for the establishment of an empowered mayor with democratic mandate from across the entire local authority area.  The office of the directly elected mayor will make Limerick City and County very different to the other 30 local authorities, but could also serve as a model for future directly elected mayors with executive functions.  It will have potentially a very positive effect and impact on the people of Limerick, but also could have policy implications across all of government and for the way central services are delivered to the citizen.</p><p>The general scheme takes account of the report of the implementation of the advisory group for the directly elected mayor in Limerick, published in November 2020 and provided to the committee at that stage.  The group's report is tremendously ambitious for both Limerick and for the role of directly elected mayor.  In the general scheme, the Government has agreed to include as many of the report's recommendations as possible at this stage.  Further consideration and exploration of other recommendations will continue with other Departments in the weeks and months ahead.  The general scheme provides for key pillars needed to create the office of the directly elected mayor with executive functions, including structures and governance, additional and enhanced powers, a mechanism to remove a mayor in limited circumstances and an electoral code to hold mayoral elections in Limerick.</p><p>The general scheme also includes provisions to allow for a plebiscite on directly elected mayors in other jurisdictions, as per the commitment in Programme for Government: Our Shared Future.  I will outline the main points of these distinct pillars.  Part two, office of directly elected mayor with executive functions, sets out the structures and governance provision for the establishment of the office of directly elected mayor with executive functions in Limerick, including the necessary governance structures underpinning that office.  The mayor shall be the head of the local authority and an<i>ex officio</i>member of the council.  Most of the existing executive functions that currently rest with the chief executive will become the responsibility of the mayor.  Once the mayor's office is established, the roles of cathaoirleach, leas-chathaoirleach and chief executive will no longer exist in Limerick.  These roles are replaced by new roles of directly elected mayor, pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir, and director general.  The pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir will be elected from among the members and will act as speaker of the council.  This is to ensure a separation of executive functions and reserved functions.  The director general will replace the role of chief executive and will be responsible for certain executive functions which will not transfer to the mayor.  These shall become specified functions.  The director general will also have a statutory role in supporting the mayor in the administration of the local authority.</p><p>It is important to stress that the directly elected mayor will be accountable to the elected council as well as directly to the people of Limerick.  Existing provisions relating to the oversight of the chief executive by the elected council are therefore mirrored and, indeed, strengthened in the general scheme to allow for the council's oversight of the mayor.  Key provisions relating to prior information to elected councillors, direction that works not proceed, and a requirement that a particular thing be done will apply equally to the mayor in the performance of mayoral executive functions and to the director general in the performance of specified functions.  There will be a formal structure to allow individual councillors to raise questions with the mayor, similar to the parliamentary question system operated in the D&aacute;il, in addition to other formal structures which will provide for the council to ask the mayor to report on activities.  Additional and enhanced powers are delivered by the creation of structures to enhance urban and rural development and the statutory right to contribute to and be consulted on all matters that impact on Limerick city and county.</p><p>The general scheme contains a specific chapter which provides for the creation of several new structures and mayoral functions.  These include the establishment of a ministerial forum at national level to aid in the future development of the role of mayor in Limerick.  The forum will oversee the smooth transition of executive responsibility to the mayor, examine new policy development and decisions at Government level and how they impact on Limerick, consider new functions and powers to be transferred to Limerick, and oversee implementation of the national planning framework in Limerick.</p><p>The general scheme provides for the establishment of a local structure in Limerick, led by the mayor, to support the delivery of the national planning framework and Project Ireland 2040 in the Limerick city region.  The purpose of the Limerick Project Ireland 2040 delivery board is to ensure the co-ordination of all strategic spatial planning and investment necessary to achieve the delivery of Project Ireland 2040 city growth for the Limerick city region, in line with the objectives of the national planning framework, NPF, the national development plan, NDP, and the regional spatial and economic strategy, RSES.  The delivery board will also monitor progress, including on development priorities for large-scale housing and regeneration, employment and enterprise and supporting infrastructure, amenities and investment in terms of transport, water services and climate action.<br/><br/>The mayor will have the power to convene a rural board to devise a programme of measures to support rural Limerick and to examine all aspects of rural life in Limerick.  These measures will focus on co-ordinating across all government supports in this sphere, with a particular role in co-ordinating the various funding streams available.  It is important to stress that the mayor will be mayor for all of Limerick, not just the city.  Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the mayor shall have the statutory power to convene stakeholders locally on matters affecting Limerick, and to be consulted by Departments on the dimensions of national policy that affect the well-being of Limerick.<br/><br/>Provision for a detailed mechanism for the removal of the mayor, as part of a suite of accountability measures, is included in the general scheme<b>.  </b>It is important to highlight that the removal of a democratically elected individual is a serious matter.  Therefore, the bar for such action is high and should only be pursued after careful consideration.  The process involves several stages in both initiating the action and successfully achieving an outcome, involving a majority of 75% in the council, an independent panel review, consideration by the Minister and a positive resolution in the Houses of the Oireachtas.<br/><br/>The general scheme also provides for the holding of mayoral elections, which will be conducted along similar lines to other elections.  The mayor will be elected by the direct vote of the people and voting will be by secret ballot on the single transferable vote system.  The system will mirror that used in presidential elections.  An officer of Limerick City and County Council will be the returning officer at the election.  All persons entitled to vote at local elections in the Limerick city and county area will have the right to vote at the mayoral election.  The general scheme also contains measures which would assist with holding an electoral event safely, should Covid-19 restrictions be in place.  These measures include conducting a poll over two days to facilitate social distancing and providing a postal vote for those on the special voters list should nursing homes and similar institutions be inaccessible.<br/><br/>The Programme for Government: Our Shared Future contains a commitment to the effect that plebiscites could be held in 2024 in any local authority that wishes to have a directly elected mayor.  Demand for a plebiscite will be demonstrated at the request of the local authority or by way of a petition from 20% of registered voters.  The general scheme provides for the holding of plebiscites on the issue in other jurisdictions in 2024, alongside the local elections.<br/><br/>As already stated, this general scheme represents a major reform of local government, one of the most significant since the foundation of the State.  Having a directly elected mayor will enable the people of Limerick to have a greater say over how services and infrastructure are delivered and how Limerick develops.  The new role as set out in this general scheme is a starting point and, in tandem with this legislative process, my officials are engaging with Departments across all of government to seek to identity more powers, including greater financial powers, to be assigned to Limerick over time.  I am happy to work with the committee in this process and look forward to constructive discussion on the general scheme presented to it today.</p></speech>

It is only right to acknowledge the voters of Limerick who voted in favour of having a directly elected mayor.  Voting took place in a number of other places in 2019 which came quite close to that result.  The reason we are here is due to a democratic vote.  The people of Limerick chose to pursue this.  The election of the mayor will be democratic as well, so it is an important step in representation for the people of Limerick city and county.  That should be emphasised.</p> <p>  I will now call on the members.  Deputy McAuliffe of Fianna F&aacute;il is first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.643" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021051800002#B00300"><p>The Chairman is right to point out that usually we discuss Bills prepared by the Government but that today we are fulfilling a mandate from the people of Limerick.  Whether we agree or disagree with the position of a directly elected mayor, it was a decision of the people of Limerick to opt for one and it is up to us now to work out the details.  However, we should be cognisant of the fact that it was a tight margin and that we still have a way to go to persuade many people that this is a positive step forward.</p> <p>  I doubt that there will be time for questions and answers in the five minutes so I will put as many of my observations as possible to the Minister of State and perhaps we can engage with his officials after the meeting on amendments to the legislation.  As a former member of a local authority and the corporate policy group and as a former mayor of my city, I hope I can provide some insights.  However, I am keenly aware of the one quality I do not have, in that I am not from Limerick.  I worked there for a short time.  I believe the pre-legislative scrutiny should formally engage with the local authority members, with the corporate policy group as a corporate body and with the Deputies for Limerick.  We can discuss that in private session.</p> <p>  I will deal with each head in the general scheme and focus on the heads in order.  The first matter that generated my concern was head 12 which would appear to give the mayor a vote in the council on matters of oversight.  If there is to be a separation of powers, I question whether the mayor should have a vote in the chamber on matters of oversight.  The Minister of State might explain that to us in a note afterwards.  In many of the discussions we end up almost making comparisons with American politics because we have never had a directly elected executive office in Ireland.  We have to draw on all the issues relating to separation of powers, impeachment and all that language we are not familiar with here.  Head 14 refers to a vacancy period of six months.  If a vacancy occurs six months prior to an election, we would not fill the vacancy.  I fear six months might be too short, yet a year would be far too long.  Perhaps we can look at that.</p> <p>  Head 24 deals with the role of pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir.  I would not like to think that any councillor is a principal councillor above others.  We obviously have shied away from the term "deputy mayor", but, having been a mayor, I am aware that one often has to delegate because one cannot be in every place at once, particularly for international events.  I am not sure the term "pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir" applies.  Perhaps the role of deputy mayor might be more formalised.  I do not believe the general scheme does that at present.  The current cathaoirligh carry out a very valuable ceremonial role and, no doubt, they will continue to do that.  Perhaps a system of deputising might be formalised.</p> <p>  Head 29 deals with the powers and functions.  I am concerned that it gives the mayor the power to delegate some of the functions back to the director general or the county or city manager.  The purpose of the proposed Bill is to ensure that the powers of an unelected person are brought into the remit of an elected person.  I think that perhaps the chamber would have to agree with any powers being delegated back to the director general because, by stealth or by cover of political cuteness, there could be a mayor who delegates much of the controversial stuff to an unelected official.  I would not like to see that.</p> <p>  Head 33 deals with the corporate policy group.  The corporate policy group is a very difficult beast in Irish politics.  It is a cabinet which includes the opposition.  I worry whether that model would work with a directly elected mayor.  It is not something that any other city has adopted.  We should look at the corporate policy group and whether it is fit for function under a directly elected mayor system.</p> <p>  Head 34 deals with the existing corporate plan.</p><p>There should be an alignment between the corporate plan and the mayor's local government plan.</p><p> The review of the functions under head 35 is perhaps a little late at 2024.  We should look at that.</p><p> The final section I will focus on is head 42, which formalises the power of the mayor to convene.  This is one of the principal powers that I experienced.  It is one of the soft powers and is very important.</p><p> I have other observations from head 45 onwards, but I realise that I have gone beyond my time.  I will hand on to the next speaker.</p></speech>

In that context, head 12(2) states: "The mayor shall exercise a vote in relation to all matters that come before the elected council, except where the vote is in relation to the council's oversight role in respect of the mayor."  That is not in the actual briefing note.  I apologise.  It is in the general scheme.</p></speech>

We were happy to make a submission.  As everyone has said, this is the democratic will of the people of Limerick.  It is very important and it is up to us to get it right.  I am conscious that with the establishment of any new powers, we must be careful that we do not take any existing powers away from our elected councillors.</p> <p>  I have some questions for the Minister of State, which I will ask together, and hopefully we will have time to get through them.  I am particularly interested in head 31.  What is the relationship regarding the current local authority annual budget and the three-year capital plan?  How will the mayor's programme of office work with that?  I would appreciate the Minister of State explaining the process to me.</p> <p>  Head 40 relates to the rural Limerick board.  Perhaps the Minister of State will talk us through the proposed appointments, in the context of the process and the tenders involved, and the relationship the board will have with the council.</p> <p>  On head 41, what role will the mayor have regarding the city development plan?  Many of us previously served as councillors and we know that this is, essentially, a contract between those who are elected and the people they serve.  Will the Minister of State please touch on some of those questions?</p></speech>

I acknowledge that she has been constructive, as have other members of her party.</p> <p>  On the powers of councillors, I am very keen that they keep their reserved powers.  This is why there is an essential tenet to robustly hold the mayor to account.  This is going to be key in how this process works out on the ground.  Councillors powers will remain unchanged.</p> <p>  The cathaoirleach of the council will step into the role as pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir, which is articulated in the heads of the general scheme.  In essence, the mayor takes his duties outside the council chamber.  That is key.  He will represent Limerick nationally and internationally and will be a beacon for the county in the context of putting it on the international stage, which can only add significant value to the area.</p> <p>  The question on the budget is very interesting.  I will explain how it came about.  In the original proposal, a two thirds super-majority was required to reject a budget, but the implementation advisory group and all the various stakeholders and actors in Limerick got together and felt that in the spirit of the way Limerick works and engages, and given its history of good working relationships, it would be better to have just a simple majority for passing the budget.  We decided that adopting that recommendation from the implementation advisory group was the way to proceed.  I am sure that, going forward, that will be the case.  It is important to note that the new democratically elected executive head - the new elected mayor - will have to put the programme for Limerick to the councillors and that its approval would require majority support.  If we were to opt for a super-majority in this regard, it might create unnecessary tensions within the working relationship and the dynamic that exists between the parties in Limerick.  This is a good start and we were happy to listen to all the stakeholders, who represented a really broad base of society.  They included the students' union, the chamber of commerce and the directly elected councillors.  We had a great base there.</p> <p>  At present, the capital budget per annum for Limerick is &euro;217 million.  It is not far shy of &euro;500 million when revenue and capital are taken into consideration.  We will be in negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with a plan for the new mayor of Limerick.  The implementation advisory group is very clear that the mayor needs to deliver on the mandate for Limerick.  As we progress through the legislative process we will be engaging with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and with other stakeholders to try to get as many powers and as significant a budget as we can, to give them the best start there.  We have a number of capital envelopes to which we expect the mayor's office will have access.  These are set out by the implementation advisory group.</p> <p>  On head 40, the mayor is to be the mayor for Limerick county as well as for the city.  This is why I referred to the matter in my opening contribution.  We would expect that the measures to be derived from the rural development policy for the period 2021 to 2025 will be included in negotiations with the Department of Rural and Community Development and will link in with it so that the mayor will have strong ties in delivering for rural Limerick also.  This is so important in the process.</p></speech>

It will be the responsibility of the new mayor to present the development plan to local authority members.  People must visualise that the current chief executive has the executive function of presenting the plan to the councillors.  The councillors adjudicate on it, go through the process of putting in amendments and deletions as they see fit and then it goes out to public consultation.  It is now proposed that it will be the responsibility of the mayor to present that draft plan to the council, which will then adjudicate on it and work through a plan that reflects the ambition of the mayor and the national plan.  We will have a strong, shared vision, but in the end the regional plans and the county development plans will have a strong link together.  As already stated, the mayor will be head of the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board for Limerick.  It will be the mayor's responsibility, working with the local authority, to bring that forward to the council.</p></speech>

The general scheme is very exciting.  I went to college in Limerick for four years and had a great four years of education down there.  As Deputy McAuliffe stated, I am conscious that, with the exception of Deputies Mitchell and O'Donoghue, none of us is from Limerick.  I compliment everybody who has been involved in this process to date for the work they have done to progress the legislation to where it is at now.  I was a supporter of the directly elected mayor proposition in my county of Waterford.  It was only defeated by 719 votes.  In Cork, the proposal was defeated by fewer than 1,000 votes.  To be honest, I believe that these were missed opportunities for both counties.  I certainly hope that it will be looked at again in the future.</p> <p>  We must get this right.  Limerick is a case study for the entire country.  It is essential that we get it right.  If we get it right in this instance, there will be a willingness and a drive in other counties to move towards this model of governance, which gives people direct say in who leads their council.</p><p> I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could outline the role of the director general, who will be operating alongside the directly elected mayor.  What specified functions that the chief executive has now - over and above those of the directly elected mayor - will the director general retain?</p><p> There is the speaker or chairperson role but there is no provision for someone to deputise for that person.  If the speaker or chairperson is not available to chair meetings of the council, will there be a formal deputy who can stand in for him or her?  It is important that this matter be clarified.</p><p> It would be appropriate for the committee to engage further with the elected members in Limerick and with the County and City Management Association, CCMA, as part of this process.  As already stated, it is vital that we get this right.  If the Minister of State could touch on the terms and conditions relating to the various roles, I would appreciate it because it is important to put those on record.</p></speech>

It is very much </p> <p>  In terms of a deputy mayor, it is important to state that we did not create a position that would be directly below that of the mayor in terms of name, particularly in view of the fact that it is a body holding him to account.  The councillors will hold him to account.  I draw the Deputy's attention to the position of pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir and the fact that where he is not be available as a result of illness or whatever, the provisions of the principal Act, at Schedule 10(10)(3), relating to the chairing of council meetings would apply and the members would elect a temporary chair at that stage.  The general scheme quite clearly sets out the provisions in the principal Act apply.</p> <p>  The Senator, quite rightly, mentioned the position of the director general.  As he can imagine, the director general will take over specified functions.  For example, he would be the accounting officer for the local authority and would manage its finances and be accountable in that regard.  All HR and staffing matters will remain the responsibility of the director general.  On the administration of schemes and grants, as the Deputy can imagine the specific adjudication in respect of particular schemes and grants is very important.  The director general will also retain responsibility for adjudicating on specific planning applications and dealing with enforcement matters that are before the courts, legal proceedings, etc.  In the normal course of events, that would be the case anyway because we do not want political involvement.  The directly elected mayor will set the policy, the parameters, etc., and then the director general will be responsible for the administration side.</p> <p>  As mentioned before and as referenced in the data, the directly elected mayor will have a salary equivalent to that of a Minister of State, which is in the region of &euro;137,000.  The salary for the director general is being worked on at the moment with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but we are saying it will be one point above the point on current scale that applies.</p></speech>

Not to labour the point in terms of a deputy, I appreciate what the Minister of State said regarding the title of deputy mayor.  I do not suggest using that title but perhaps there could be a formalised procedure within the council so that matters would not just be dealt with on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis.  If the speaker or pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir was unavailable, perhaps there could be a formal deputy who could stand in for the pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir.</p></speech>

The implementation and advisory group, the people of Limerick and various actors in Limerick were very strong on the point that they think it will be sufficient to have just a pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir and that in the specific instance in which he is ill, the provisions of the principal Act will kick and a temporary chair or speaker will be appointed.  Potentially, there will be four positions.  There will be three new positions so we just want to be careful in terms of those.  We can discuss the matter further as we go through the legislative process.  I am sure that there will be more debate on it.</p></speech>

I previously served as a county councillor and many of the issues I had at the time related to the fact that powers were being taken away from councillors.  The Minister of State indicated that the council will retain its existing powers.  The councillors of Limerick were directly elected by the people of Limerick.  They need to get back the powers they had previously and they must be given further powers.</p> <p>  We are talking about &euro;135,000 for the salary of the directly elected mayor, approximately &euro;330,000 for the office staff of the mayor and between &euro;30,000 and &euro;35,000 for the mayor's driver.  That amounts to an overall cost of roughly &euro;500,000 for a directly elected mayor.  I presume that the cost for a pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir will remain the same and that the overall amount will still be &euro; 500,000.  From the documentation that is available at the moment, I understand the Department will cover the cost relating to the mayor until the next local election and that it will then become part of the local authority's annual budget.</p> <p>  The other issue I have is that if something happens to the mayor, none of the relevant functions or powers can be transferred to either the pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir or the chief executive, who will in future be known as the director general.  I ask the Minister of State to come back to me on those points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.662" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021051800002#D00900"><p>To correct the Deputy, in an instance where, due to incapacity or something happening to the mayor, all the powers revert to the pr&iacute;omh comhairleoir.  This will mean that he will have to exercise the duties and functions of that office until there is a replacement becomes available following an election that has to be held within six months.  The latter will also depend on the electoral cycle.  In that context, matters would be different if a national election were due within three months.</p> <p>  I am a strong advocate for increasing the number of reserved powers for local authority members.  I have engaged with them up and down the ,through various fora such as the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA, and the Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, in that regard.  It is extremely important that their powers will not be watered down.  This Bill will not water down the reserved functions of local authority members.</p> <p>  I note the Deputy's comments on costs.  I estimate that the overall cost will be in the region of &euro;313,000 because some of the staff will come from within the local authority system.  It is important that we do not lose sight of the value this will give to the citizens of Limerick.  We are going to have someone who will be able to represent Limerick internationally, put it centre stage and reach into the heart of Government in terms of devolving powers back to Limerick.  As we know, local authorities are responsible for more than 600 services that are directly aimed at citizens.  This means that they comprise the closest arm of government to citizens.  It is important, therefore, that we do not lose sight of the value of what we are trying to create for Limerick or of the different funding streams we hope to bring, through negotiation with various Departments, to Limerick.  The mayor will have real power and a real opportunity to deliver on the mandate that he or she has been given by the people of Limerick city and county.</p><p>We should not lose sight of that in the discussion in terms of the value of this and what it would mean for County Limerick.  A chief advocate has the power to mobilise stakeholders and put Limerick at the centre, both in terms of Government and on an international level.</p></speech>

My job, as a Deputy representing County Limerick, and that of Deputy Quinlivan is to represent the voters and the democratic vote they have cast and to scrutinise this matter to the best of our abilities.</p></speech>

We were just at the five-minute mark but I can let Deputy O'Donoghue back in to finish his point later, if he so wishes.  It is my slot now.</p> <p>  It is important to reiterate the point the Minister of State and Deputy O'Donoghue made.  There is a cost applicable to this, but it also brings tremendous value.  For somebody to be directly elected and accountable to the people who elected them is an important part of democracy and will bring great advantage to Limerick.</p> <p>  Head 36 gives rise to an important policy development in that there will be regular meetings involving the directly elected mayor and the Minister regarding the formation of the committee.  That gives Limerick an advantage.  I hope it will not disadvantage other local authorities, particularly those where public representatives often seek to have direct involvement with the Department and the Minister.  What is proposed may also signal to other local authorities that the election of a directly elected mayor brings about a positive development in terms of direct engagement with the Minister.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on that.</p> <p>  I also have a question on the finances.  Will the directly elected mayor have any input into the setting of rates or into development contribution schemes?  The Minister of State can come back to me on that if he wishes.</p> <p>  Deputy Mitchell touched on head 41 in the context of the specific role relating to the development plan process.  The Minister of State indicated that the mayor would present the development plan to the elected members to modify or vote on it.  We often see the role of the chief executive of a local authority, in terms of the planning staff that prepared the development plan and the response to amendments, as upholding and defending national planning policy on which elected representatives may seek to be as flexible as possible.  In the presentation of the development plan, I presume the recommendations that come from the chief executive would be similarly prepared in order for the mayor to present them or to accept or not accept an amendment to the plan.</p> <p>  My final question is on special advisers.  Head 22 states that the mayor would have a team of advisers.  That is quite right because it is a highly responsible job.  Will there be a requirement for those advisers to be qualified or competent in specific areas such as transport, planning, housing, engineering or project management?  Given that the candidate will be elected by the people to represent them, it is important that his or her advisers will have that type of experience and ability to advise the mayor as best they can.</p></speech>

I will go through his points one by one.  The development contribution schedule and rates will be the responsibility of the mayor.  It will be his job to liaise with the executive.  Let us think about what is happening here.  All the powers the current chief executive has will be transferred to the new democratically elected mayor, except for those core powers that relate to administering schemes and grants, enforcement and planning.  We are talking about the basics when it comes to operating schemes, which would never be dealt with in the context of the political realm.  The powers to which I refer will be transferred to the mayor and, obviously, he, in conjunction with the executive, will be putting forward the development plan for adjudication by the members of the council.  Clearly, he would have his policy in respect of and stamp on that.  When he is elected and puts forward his programme for Limerick to be voted on by the members, that will shape what county development plan he will have.  The corporate plan will flow on from that.  It is important to recognise that significant powers being conferred upon the mayor in that regard.</p> <p>  On what the Chair said in respect of head 36, it is important that the new mayor will have a strong link to the heart of Government, insofar as it affects County Limerick.  I hope this will not disenfranchise other democratically elected local authority members throughout the country.  In that context, provision is made for the holding of plebiscites within other local authority areas.  As some of the committee members stated, we have to get this right because people will be observing how this process goes and assessing the value it will add for the people of Limerick city and county and what the mayor will be like in terms of fulfilling his or her duties.</p> <p>  We all have a major responsibility in respect of this matter and that is why I value the committee's work in terms of stress-testing many of these proposals.  I look forward to its report in terms of what it can bring to the process in order to ensure that we get the best possible outcome for Limerick and ensure that this will be a success.  It is important that engagement is being stitched into the process in the context of section 18 of the Local Government Act 2019.  We will be keen to engage and assist the new mayor because he or she will need help when the process begins.  This is the biggest reform in local government since the foundation of our State and it is exciting to be involved.</p></speech>

I would be careful, however, of pigeonholing the new mayor by insisting that the person to be appointed should or should not have specific qualifications.  It is a strong role in terms of a democratically elected mayor and he or she will want to ensure huge dividends for Limerick city and county in the context of shaping the future.</p></speech>

This is an exciting proposal for political reform which has the ability to transfer local government, not just in County Limerick and I hope this will be used as a template going forward.  I hope I misunderstood the Minister of State when he referred earlier to the powers that "he" may exercise in the context of what we are discussing because it is just as likely that the directly elected mayor could be a woman.  I would be careful of not using gendered language before we have an election.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions on the responsibilities of the directly elected mayor that follow on from the Chairman's questions on special advisers and the chief executive.  Is it anticipated that the powers which will be transferred to the mayor are the powers the chief executive has now regarding the council?  What will the HR functions of a directly elected mayor be in dealing with some of the current chief executives and their functional areas of responsibility with regard to people reporting to them and being able to direct them?</p> <p>  Why do we think it will be so long until an election can take place?  Could we be looking at one in the autumn, particularly in view of the fact that a by-election is due to be held in July?</p><p>We will probably be passing elements of the electoral reform Bill in order to hold that by-election in July.  Does the Minister of State believe that we will potentially be able to do something similar regarding the holding of election for mayor in the autumn?</p><p> I am aware that other members have asked about devolved powers.  When will the relevant powers be devolved?  What is the timeline for the devolution powers following the election of a mayor?</p></speech>

I apologise.  When talking about the position of mayor, my language may sometimes slip.  I hope the work I am doing with our female councillors, giving them the human rights they deserve and have been denied for so long in terms of maternity leave, and my work with Women for Election, will demonstrate my commitment to our female members and female councillors.  I really look forward to the next D&aacute;il in which, hopefully, we will have a lot more women Members, more women candidates and more diversity due to local elections, and specifically because of the measures I have taken in recent months and proposed to take in the months ahead.</p><p>All the HR functions and the local authority staffing matters, with the exception of the special adviser, will rest with the director of services.  It would not be a role for the mayor.  That is for very good reason in the context of the specific staffing matters.</p><p>On the elections, my job is to try to guide the Bill though the legislative process.  Up until last week, the D&aacute;il has been sitting for only two days per week.  It is gathering pace now.  I acknowledge the Office of the Attorney General for giving us a drafter for this and for prioritising it.  We are working as fast as we can.  From talking with and listening to other members, I am keen to really get this right.  I want to get a good balance between getting it right and not overly rushing it, but I also want to see it happening as soon as possible.  This is so important.  We do not want any undue delays but I want to get it right.  We will really try to do that.</p><p>The Senator made a good point, and identified the kernel of the issue, in the context of additionality and what we can start with on day one.  In other words, when the new mayor is <i>in situ, </i>when he or she will be able to say &quot;These are my powers&quot;?  Of the 69 recommendations, 38 are in this general scheme.  A further ten are partially addressed within the general scheme and we are working hard on the remainder.  As this process is going on, we are engaging with other Departments to try, insofar as we can, to get additional powers.  I highlight the fact that some powers will be difficult to get.  One or two will be very challenging, for example, conferring specific rights in respect of national funding streams.  We hope that we will see significant powers coming from some of the other Departments.  One significant power relates to climate action and the infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians.  There are a lot of budgets to oversee in that regard.  I would hope to have the lion's share of the recommendations in the report for the mayor.  There is also a review mechanism built in whereby we can monitor how things are going and by means of which we can add in more powers later on.  My hope and aim is to have as many as possible <i>in situ</i>on day one.  I would value the committee members' assistance in doing that.</p></speech>

I am very supportive of a directly elected mayor.  Democratic accountability is a key function.  The Minister of State and the other members are correct to say that it is very important to get this right.  What happens will be watched by people in other parts of the State.</p> <p>  What is the thinking on the timing of holding a plebiscite in Dublin?  The people of Dublin have not yet been given an opportunity to indicate whether they would like to have a directly elected mayor.  It is important that they be given that opportunity to have their say and indicate their choice.  Perhaps the Minister of State will comment on that.</p> <p>  In the context of getting public support for this and getting it done right, a good few people have mentioned that it was a very close vote.  Has an analysis been carried out in respect of the reasons people had for voting against it?  Has this fed into the drafting process?  If not, does the Minister of State believe it would be worthwhile to carry out an analysis in that regard?  Sometimes valuable things can be picked up from people who do not support proposals.</p></speech>

I look forward to working with him in delivering it.</p> <p>  On Dublin, following its decision on gender equality, the Citizens' Assembly is now taking a look at the four local authority areas of Dublin.  This will be a significant body of work.  The Department of the Taoiseach is leading on this.  We will feed into the process through our Department.  With the four local authorities, the national planning framework reaches out much further in the context of the metropolitan area.  It is a huge and ambitious decision.  We really value the work of the assembly.  It has stood us in good stead in other approaches to issues that were outstanding, especially in a social context.  We look forward to the assembly's report and to working with this committee in how we go forward from that.  This will be very important.</p> <p>  As the Deputy has rightly stated, the people of Limerick voted in favour by a narrow margin.  I am aware that Tim O'Connor and the implementation advisory group engaged in a great deal of discussion on the matter.  When Covid struck, the group went to incredible lengths to carry out its consultation process online.  There were more than 1,000 respondents.  They had really strong engagement from the people of Limerick, on foot of which a number of recommendations were made.  Public information is key.  There were a number of elections on the day the plebiscite was held.  From talking with people in Limerick, the view expressed to me was that it received very little attention.  There was a meeting with the Limerick Oireachtas Members in the Custom House.  I was feeding into that process in the context of advising about the narrow margin and what people were feeling.  It is very important that before elections we have public information campaigns.  Such a campaign could have been used to advise the people of Limerick of the gravity the question relating to a directly elected mayor.  This individual will have to demonstrate his or her capacity to the electorate to manage a complex set of relationships in the context of the director general, the reserved functions of the council and the whole of Limerick city and county.  It will be a unique undertaking.  We will need a strong public information campaign.  In response to the Deputy's query, I would say that information is key.  With three plebiscites, including those Cork and Waterford, held on the same day, that was one of the key challenges.  So many elections were on at the time.  As a former councillor, the Deputy will be aware that local authority election campaigns tend to be frantic.  European Union elections held on the same day as the local elections and the plebiscites in this instance, so there was too much information to absorb.  We really must work on that.</p></speech>

As someone who ran in the elections at that time, I am aware that one does tend to concentrate on one's own electoral success without being able to put the time into, for example, campaigns relating to the EU elections or other matters.  Limerick has a fantastic opportunity to lead the way and set the example that other local authorities will look at to say that it is a good advancement in the way we run local government, especially in the context of accountability.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.677" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1566" speakername="Emer Higgins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021051800002#F00700"><p>I congratulate the Minister of State and his team on all the work they have done in respect of this ground-breaking proposal for legislation that will have a lasting impact, not just in Limerick but also, possibly, in other cities too.  The proposal for directly elected mayor of Limerick was voted on by the people of Limerick.  As my colleague, Senator Cummins, stated, Limerick could become a pilot for the roll-out of this type of office in other cities.  That is why it is so crucial that this is a success.  Councillors are elected to represent their local areas and they reflect the democratic will of the people.  The success of a directly elected mayor will be based on the collaboration and the relationship with those local councillors.  This is why councillors being treated as the democratically elected representatives of their communities and ensuring that their experience is appreciated and their voice always heard and respected will be critical to the success of this project.</p><p>It is really important that councillors' powers, responsibilities and influence be protected in order to ensure local democracy continues to flourish; it is also really important to ensure local democracy remains an attractive proposition for people because without candidates or councillors we simply would not have local democracy.  That is why the significant difference between the pay of the mayor and that of councillors is so noticeable.  I welcome the rumours - for that is what they still are at this stage - that the remuneration and conditions of councillors are to be revised in line with the Moorhead report, which is fitting for the level of work that goes into the role of councillor.  The mayor of Limerick will have a key strategic role when it comes to the big-ticket items like the national planning framework and Project Ireland 2040 in the Limerick City region.  I, for one, am excited at the prospect of candidates outlining their vision for Limerick as we approach the inaugural mayoral election.</p><p> I take this opportunity to thank the Minister of State for the work he is doing to make council chambers across Ireland more diverse and inclusive.  He has done a huge amount of work with Women for Election and with cross-party representatives of female councillors on issues like maternity leave.  It is fantastic to see him taking such a strong leadership role on that issue, so well done on that.</p></speech>

There is a huge amount of reform going on in the local authority space.  I am very proud to work with a Department that is really to the forefront of delivering that change.</p> <p>  The Deputy referenced a number of items.  One thing that really struck me looking around the various different local authorities is that it is key an authority absolutely reflects the society it is governing in diversity, gender and all those key areas.  We are really working hard to deliver that.  Aside from the Moorhead report, we also have many non-pay items we are working hard to improve, including, as the Deputy rightly mentioned, conditions in our council chambers.  Obviously, maternity leave will be a key focus in that and we have our group of women councillors meeting.  What they need is an option that will really work for them and deliver rather than just being told and not embracing this.  That is why I was keen to meet all the councillors down in Limerick, which I have done.  I have done a number of Zoom meetings and look forward to going down there soon and talking to the members, the cathaoirleach and all the various different actors down there because I, like the committee, really need to be informed to try to deliver the best possible start for a mayor.  Deputy Higgins rightly referenced that this is going to be a pilot and Limerick will be judged on how it performs compared to our other 30 local authorities around the country and it is very important we do a good job on it.  I am very happy to work with committee again on it and thank the Deputy for her positive comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.680" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021051800002#G00300"><p>I will start by thanking the Minister of State and the officials for the ongoing briefings they are giving us and the meetings we have been able to attend.  I put on record my thanks to the people of Limerick who voted for a directly-elected mayor in 2019.  Unfortunately people in Waterford and Cork did not do that so we have in Limerick an opportunity to get this right not just for Limerick but also so other local authorities will see the benefit of having a directly-elected mayor.  That is really important.</p> <p>  In the short time I have available, I have a couple of questions for the Minister of State.  He presented the heads of the Bill there but how close are we to having a final sign-off on the Bill itself?  Does he have a timeframe he could outline to us of where he is hoping to get to with that?  I have a few questions prompted by his contribution as well.  He said it is important to stress the directly-elected mayor will be accountable to the council as well as the to the people of Limerick.  What did he mean by that exactly?  He might clarify that a bit more.  He also mentioned the setting up of a board to support rural County Limerick, which is critically important.  It is really important the people of Limerick, city and county, are taken into consideration.  There is a sense in many of the rural areas that they were left behind when the amalgamation happened in 2014.  I strongly recommend and support that proposal for a rural board or whatever the Minister of State is talking about putting in there.  I welcome his comments earlier that he envisages a public campaign being put on prior to the election of the mayor because it is critically important.  As we said, although the majority in favour of the proposal totalled over 3,400, the number was still quite narrow in the scheme of things.  As I said, my colleagues Deputies Mitchell and &Oacute; Broin have been very constructive on this.  We believe it is a huge opportunity not just for Limerick but that we should let Limerick be the beacon and lead the rest of us.</p> <p>  To get back to my questions, how close are we to getting the full Bill and what timeline does the Minister of State envisage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.681" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021051800002#G00400"><p>I absolutely appreciate the Deputy's ongoing role as we develop this process.  First, on the question of where we are, we have our general scheme.  As I said, I have been in close contact with the Office of the Attorney General trying to get priority in terms of a drafter.  There should be a drafter available this month and we will keep in close contact with the office.  However, the office did say - and this is always a risk - that there are a number of priority pieces of legislation, particularly in the housing space, that will be coming in and out.  On the positive side, D&aacute;il capacity has increased now that we are at three days a week and that will assist us.  I would be hopeful that by the summer we will have a Bill ready.  Obviously, it will then have to go through the legislative process in the Houses.  I am very keen for the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which the Deputy chairs, to feed into that process as well to try to improve that piece of legislation.</p> <p>  The Deputy also referenced that the propositions for mayors in Waterford and Cork did not get through but in a way there is a silver lining to that insofar as it gives us time to really focus on Limerick and get a product that is going to stand the test of durability.  We want people in other counties to look at it and say it is adding huge value to the citizens of Limerick, the city and the county and that it is absolutely the way to go with devolving more powers to their local authorities.  The members obviously have a key role in holding the mayor to account in the context of the programme for Limerick the mayor, when he is elected, will have to put forward for adjudication by the local authority.  Every year he will have to produce an annual performance statement which will have various key performance indicators the local authority can use to hold the mayor to account.  In my statement I referenced the structure being accountable to all the reserved members of the local authority by means of questions which is very important to ensure they are being informed of progress on the various different aspects.  On keeping up a good relationship, the mayor will have a right to be heard at municipal district level and be present at the local authority main plenary meetings.  That is all so important.  As I said, for the budget, a simple majority is one of the key indicators the implementation advisory group brought forward.  It feels that should be the case to keep the good working relationships with County Limerick.  The powers of local authority members are not changing; they have a big role now in holding the mayor to account, as do the people of Limerick.  I do not want to devalue that in any way.  It is going to be a huge opportunity for the citizens of Limerick to elect a democratically-elected executive head of the county and city so hopefully we can all embrace that.  I thank Deputy Quinlivan for his questions.</p></speech>

The people of Limerick will never give up an opportunity presented to them and we will do our best to make this work.  For everybody in Limerick, whether they grew up where I did, in Ballynanty, or in Ballysteen out in the county, we will all benefit from a directly-elected mayor.  As I said, the vote was close so it is important that we bring along those people who, for whatever reasons, did not vote for this and get them enthused about why a mayor will be really good for Limerick.</p> <p>  I have a quick question about additional plebiscites the Minister of State envisages and he might clarify what he was speaking about there.  He talked about 20% of registered voters.  I personally think that is very high.  I do not want to be political about it here but the electoral register is not in the best shape.  There are lots of people on it who are dead, have moved or emigrated so it could probably be higher, at 25% or 30%.  That is quite a significant number of people to get involved before the election can even be had.  We are lucky to get 50% turnout in local elections.  Will the Minister of State consider reducing that or will significant work be done on the register to ensure it is  accurate before we look at additional local authorities having plebiscites on mayors?  I ask because I am sure we in Limerick will get this right and they will all want to copy us.</p></speech>

In the first instance there can be a positive resolution by the local authority members.</p><p>If the local authority resolves to have its own democratically elected executive head, that is sufficient.  Demand for a plebiscite can also be demonstrated by petition of 20% of registered voters within an authority's functional area.</p><p> I would point out that my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, is making swift progress with the electoral reform Bill.  I expect that will clean up the electoral system.  We have our own committee adjudicating and the oversight of an independent electoral commission.  That will feed into a more transparent process for all.  I acknowledge that a significant body of work has to be done in respect of our electoral register to achieve that.  For the moment, the committee can make its own deliberations.  A democratically elected executive head can be put in place by a positive resolution of the local authority or the petition of 20% of the registered voters in the local authority area.  I ask the committee to consider that in tandem the work being done by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.</p></speech>

We are looking at the compilation of the electoral register and also seeking to increase inclusivity in the voting system and to get the voter turnout numbers up.  I accept the comments of Deputy Quinlivan in respect voter turnout in certain situations.</p></speech>

I also thank him and the Ministers for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Public Expenditure and Reform because they have all been most responsive to my representations and those made to them by other Senators on behalf of local authority members.  I am very encouraged to hear that the Moorhead report will finally be signed off by Cabinet today.  I hope that is the case because it is long overdue.  That is good news.  It is an important signal to send to our local authority members.  They are invaluable to their communities and to our democracy.  They are on the coal face of our democratic process.  They are the go-to people in their local communities, streets, villages and towns.  Right throughout the pandemic they have been fronting Government response and local authority response.  The efforts they have put in and the supports they have provided for their communities could never be really properly rewarded in a monetary sense.  However, it is important that the Government recognises their contribution and values it.  Signing off on and implementing the Moorhead report should go a long way to beginning to do that.</p> <p>  I welcome this pre-legislative scrutiny process.  I am acutely aware that the vote in Limerick was very tight.  At the time, I was most disappointed that a plebiscite was not held in Dublin.  I spent a good number of years living in New York city.  Over the period of a decade or so, I got to see upfront how impactful a directly elected mayor can be in a city of almost 10 million people, comprising five boroughs and with only 51 councillors.  A directly elected mayor can have an enormous impact, both in supporting communities and the economy and championing the city and the county.  I am really disposed to this concept, but I am also acutely aware that our local authority members' powers have been greatly eroded in recent times.  If this is to be a success, not just for Limerick but also for our democracy and our country, it must be of incremental value to our democratic process.  It is not enough for it just to amount to the creation of a new office and role.  It must be demonstrated to the people of Limerick and to the rest of the country that there is an incremental value in it.</p> <p>  One of the concerns that has been expressed to me is that it is a precursor to the further erosion of local authority members' powers and that it will lead to a reduction in the number of local authority members in Limerick city and county.  I would like the Minister of State to address that issue.  The point was made to me that under the New York model, where there are five boroughs and approximately 8 million people, there are only 51 councillors and one mayor.  In comparison, in Limerick city and county, with a population of in the region of 94,000, there are 41 councillors.  That is a concern.  As I said at the outset, the local authority members who are elected are the representatives of the people of Limerick city and county.  They are the expression of the democratic will.  I ask the Minister of State to address that point directly.</p> <p>  I have listened to the Minister of State and I believe he has very sincere intentions to take the potential of this legislation to enhance the democratic process to strengthen local democracy in Limerick and to create a model that can be replicated in other parts of the country.  However, as a committee, we also need to engage directly with the currently elected local representatives of Limerick city and county in the context of our pre-legislative scrutiny process.  We should hear from them and engage with them.  It sounds to me that we have a bit of leeway in terms of the timeline.  Therefore, I think that we, as a committee, need to engage directly with the elected members.  We should invite them to participate in this process. </p></speech>

I acknowledge her work and her representations on the role of our local authority members in respect of to their pay and conditions specifically.  I appreciate the engagement from the Senator and her colleagues in connection with the legislation.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the need for engagement with the council.  We have done a good bit of that.  I absolutely agree with her point.  It would very interesting for the committee to hear the views of Tim O'Connor and the members of the implementation advisory group of which he is chairperson.  To be fair to them, they have undertaken significant engagement with the citizens of Limerick in very exceptional circumstances throughout the pandemic.  I acknowledge their work.  They are very impressive.  I found it striking that attendance at all the meetings was high.  They were most engaged in the process.  I had honour of addressing them on a number of occasions and it was most interesting indeed.</p> <p>  We do not want to reduce or dilute in any way the powers of our local authority members.  We are not proposing to do that in any shape or form.  I really value local government.  It is the closest arm of government to the citizen and provides many services.  We really want to strengthen and support it; we do not want to dilute it.  That is why having a new role of a democratically elected executive head of a local authority will provide huge powers locally for the citizens of Limerick.  That must add value.  It is key that we are focused on that to ensure that the citizens of Limerick see value in this office and do not just regard it as an office.  Anyone can provide an office in respect of the governance and structure.  However, it is about the powers of that office and the mandate and means that go with it to ensure that it can deliver on the mandate that the people of Limerick city and county actually bring to it.  That is most important.  At this point, I would not see there being a reduction in the number of council members in Limerick.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the work our local authority members have done.  They achieved so much through the pandemic.  I recall, at the beginning of the pandemic in response to the Community Call, how quickly our 31 local authorities mobilised and supported citizens, some of whom were very vulnerable, to get key services out to them, including deliveries from shops, pharmacies, etc.  I had the privilege of addressing the Dublin local authority and the team there.  I could see how they were dealing with the underlying social problems that were growing through the pandemic.  They had actors from Tusla and other organisations and social workers feeding into the process.  It was great to see.  A huge amount of respect has to go to our local authority members and what they achieved during that period.</p></speech>

We had representatives from the AILG and LAMA before us last week.  Every member of the committee thanked local authority members and councillors for the way they stepped up over the past 15 months.  The response to the Community Call was fantastic to see. It was acknowledged last week.</p> <p>  I note Senator Fitzpatrick's suggestion, and that of Deputy McAuliffe, that we engage directly with the representatives in Limerick.  We will make a decision on that in private session.  It is quite possible that we will engage again with AILG and LAMA on the matter.  The suggestion is noted.</p></speech>

We believe it brings governance closer to the people.  As previous speakers indicated, it was a pity that there will not be directly elected mayors in Waterford, Dublin or Cork at this time.  However, the Limerick mayor will pave the way and show that this type of politics is good for communities.  This is a process whereby the power is being moved away from central government and will be shared between the chief executive and his or her directors.  From my experience as a councillor, I have seen how hard it is to propose and deliver a mayor's objectives in one year.  Having a five-year term and the necessary staff will allow the mayor, whoever it may be, to manage and develop his or her objectives with time and resources.  I fully welcome what is proposed in the general scheme.</p><p> I have one minor question.  What is the main difference between the director general and the chief executive?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.691" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2021051800002#J00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I acknowledge his work in this area as well.  I have had great engagement with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and his office through this process and as the leaders were meeting to try to progress the heads of Bill through the Cabinet process.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, over in the Custom House has also been very helpful to me in going through this process so I acknowledge that.</p> <p>  There absolutely has to be a difference and the key one is obviously that the director general will focus on staffing.  As already stated, his focus will be on delivering and administering schemes, dealing with applications for planning permission, enforcement matters, court orders and all staffing matters.  Critically, the director general will also be the accounting officer for the local authority.  Those are the key functions.  That envelope will encapsulate the director general.  All other functions will essentially transfer over to the democratically elected mayor.  We are talking about putting together a programme for Limerick - like we do with a programme for Government over a five-year D&aacute;il term - that will shape the future of the city and county over a five-year period.  This will involve the presentation of a county development plan to the city and county council, how the county will be shaped through the planning process, which, as the Deputy knows, is the cornerstone of our development, linking that in with our national strategies and ensuring it is presented in a strong form in order to allow councillors to have a robust debate and adjudicate on it.  Obviously, the presentation of a budget will be part of it as well.  Again, all of these things are currently done by the chief executive.  The newly elected mayor will present a budget to the local authority and, again, the members will have to adjudicate on it.  The members will hold the directly elected mayor to account because his annual performance statement will be presented to them for adjudication.</p> <p>  It is very important to note that between rates, income-raising measures and all of that, the policy that shapes the county will be set out by mayor.  There are huge powers involved.  This is a major revision of local democracy, of that there is no doubt.  I always imagine it this way: if one thinks of a director general, one is thinking of the key role of allocating a house to a vulnerable family, administering a grant for someone who has a disability or for an elderly person who needs better access or trying to approve funding for a rural town or village.  Once the mayor sets out the parameters and the policy, it will be up to the director general to implement it .  He will be the implementer of all those things and will adjudicate, under the parameters set by the mayor, which applicants will be successful, how an application for planning permission should go, etc.  None of those matters should ever be the subject of political interference.  That will be the director's role and he will fulfil it within the parameters of the guidelines set out to him by the mayor.</p></speech>

What let things down was that we lost two young female councillors and one male councillor who found it impossible to continue in their roles, because of the amount of work involved, while trying to support themselves.  Some of them had families and some not but they were very good councillors, exceptional in their work.  The way things were going, it seemed that they could not support themselves or their families.  It was like it was a retirement stop for an awful lot of people on the councils, with the pay and conditions they were on.  Councillors do Trojan work.  As the Minister of State said, the first person somebody will contact is the local representative, no matter what party they represent.  The workload involved is absolutely huge and I hope the report will reflect that.</p> <p>  The general scheme states that the mayor will have the power to convene a rural board to devise a programme of measures to support rural Limerick and to examine all aspects of rural life.  I hope that rural areas will not be left behind urban ones.  We saw that recently with the Land Development Agency whereby all the investment was going into the cities rather than into rural areas.</p> <p>  I am from rural County Limerick.  It is a fantastic place to live.  If it got investment, it would be a fantastic place for other people to live too, for families to be reared in and for people who left our shores to work in other places to come home to.  The bottom line in this is Limerick will have its own mayor.  Will we have our own "Project Limerick 2040" or are we only implementing Project Ireland 2040?  Will our mayor have functions such that we can actually come up with our own project Limerick 2040 and work it around the structures in the city and county?  Every county is different and I would like to think the mayoral function that will be in County Limerick will represent County Limerick as a whole and not Ireland as a whole, especially where infrastructure and rural areas are concerned.  I hope that would also be reflected in the city areas.</p> <p>  This is my final question.  A person running for mayor must be over 18 years of age and a resident of the State and must get either 60 nominations from councillors or pay &euro;1,000 to run.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Like him, I had the privilege of serving on my local authority in County Westmeath.  I was humbled to, and had the privilege of, serving as cathaoirleach and mayor of my town of Mullingar.  I could really acutely see the pressures of trying to raise a young family as well.  It is so difficult to balance the work of being a councillor, and being the first point of contact for citizens in one's local authority area, with family life.  This is in addition to trying to hold down employment, which many local authority members do because the remuneration is so low.  It is very difficult to balance family life with politics.  It is always going to be a huge challenge.  I had a good look around and saw a lot of it in County Westmeath.  We absolutely lost some star performers, young female councillors and male ones as well.  I hated to see them leaving the system.  They were not only from my party but from all parties and none.  So much value is lost from the system.  That is why, incrementally, my approach is to try to leave the best mark I can for the time I am in the Custom House to improve the conditions our local authority members operate in, improving the office they have, the supports they have and the mechanisms surrounding that.  We will absolutely do our very best to deliver on that.  Having a young family myself, I could see it.  I remember when my first baby was born in December 2015, working on the local authority and then trying to run in a general election the following February.  It is so hard on a young family and we really must work on that and think about maternity leave and all those supports we need in order to help young families be involved in the electoral process.  It is the only way we will get council chambers to reflect society.  The chambers that govern society must be diverse and must reflect that society.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Donoghue is right in what he said about candidate eligibility.  It is double that of the two D&aacute;il constituencies because they mirror Limerick city and county.  The figures of &euro;1,000 or 60 signatories he referenced are based on the two constituencies.</p><p> It can often be a source of contention, but Project Ireland 2040 will remain the overarching policy for the State.  It is a planning framework for the whole country.  It is up to Limerick to make its plan flow from that, to have a shared vision and to develop.  If we say that there should be X number of housing units zoned in Limerick, it is up to the local authority, in the context of its functional area, to decide where in the county and city growth is needed, where its infrastructure should be built and whether it should follow its infrastructure to get best value for the State.</p><p> I am doing a large amount of work on rural planning.  I know this is an area Deputy O'Donoghue is keenly and acutely aware of.  I am codifying a successor to the sustainable rural housing guidelines from 2005.  Those guidelines are outdated so we are working on new ones.  Coming from a large rural constituency, I am acutely aware that rural housing occupies 25% of our outputs each year.  People who live in rural areas should have and will have - I want to be very clear on that - the right to build in the communities they live in once it is done in a sustainable manner and all the basic metrics and normal safety requirements, such as site lengths and percolation, are met.  I am very keen on that.  It is up to each local authority to decide how that will be delivered in its plan.  It is interesting to note that my county, Westmeath, has a very robust rural housing plan, which has passed through the new independent Office of the Planning Regulator.  The development plan for the county has finally been approved.</p><p> There will have to be a threshold somewhere along the line and I think most people accept that.  Figures are consistent in County Limerick.  I took a deep dive into the figures there and discovered that 85% of all rural housing applications have been approved.  I examined how many were withdrawn and found that the number was less than 3% each year from 2016 to 2019.  We need context when framing the debate on planning.  I want to ensure that I have a codified document which provides for sustainable rural planning under the national planning framework, which fleshes out social and economic objectives and which works for people.  I am from a large rural constituency and, consistently, 25% of our outputs are from rural planning.</p><p> To cut to the chase, Project Ireland 2040 is the overarching document.  Documents relating to Limerick will have to flow from that and share its vision.  The Deputy can flesh out what he needs for his area.</p></speech>

Limerick cannot be built without infrastructure.  There have been promises made by successive Governments over the past 30-odd years in respect of infrastructure.  The current Government is saying that it will invest in the infrastructure that is there but that it will not increase capacity.  The Minister of State referred earlier to following the existing infrastructure.  There is 27% of infrastructure left in Limerick and it is based mainly on the west side of the county.  Investment in infrastructure is not done on a whole-of-county approach.  As I said, they have been waiting 30 years for an expansion of infrastructure in the area.  The only way we will get equality in our county is if the infrastructure commitments are fulfilled within the lifetime of this Government.</p></speech>

As I go around the country and talk to people, I am finding that wastewater and water infrastructure are key stumbling blocks to development.  We are trying our best in the context of the new capital envelope that is being negotiated.  We all have to be honest.  Irish Water was deprived of many of its funding streams.  If that had not been the case, it could have stood on its own two feet and raised the money to allow it to deliver key infrastructure.  Obviously, it cannot do that now.  We rely on the State to step in with regard to capital plans.  That is what has been agreed.  We are trying to do that now, but I am acutely aware of the developments up and down the country that have been delayed because key infrastructure is not in place.  A &euro;100 million fund for towns and villages was announced.  We have much more to do and I fully accept that.</p></speech>

We have had a good discussion on the role of the director general.  I can understand why staffing is not included within the mayor's remit, but we must look at introducing an element of control because much of the budget and strategic decisions in the council are based on staffing.  While I do not expect the mayor to deal with individual one-on-one staffing matters, I think including some input into staffing with the director general should be considered.</p> <p>  On head 47 and the specified functions, I was disappointed to see waste management as one of the specified functions of the director general rather than the directly elected mayor.  While I hope we will see other cities take this up, waste management is something we in Dublin would like to see under the control of the mayor rather than the county manager.  It has been one of the big gripes between the two camps.  Head 45 allows the director general to enter into contracts.  My concern is that this could include the purchasing of land, subcontracting services and so on.  Providing a level of oversight of that might make it more palatable.</p> <p>  Head 53 relates to the removal procedures.  The Minister of State was very clear that the removal of a directly elected official is a serious matter.  We have designed a process that creates a political football and that would essentially lead to the holding of impeachment hearings similar to those in the US being the ultimate outcome.  We should avoid that.  The problem with Irish politics is that it is very fractured.  In that context, a party that may have only 10% support can be in government.  It is possible that, regardless of who is in government, those in opposition could rally the support of 70% or 80% of all councillors in respect of a national issue that might not relate to the mayor at all.  The process would then be referred to the Minister, who would appoint a panel of people.  Ultimately, it is the Minister who makes the decision on removal from office.  This means that those in opposition on the council could kick the mayor around in order to try to get the Minister to make a decision to remove the mayor.  We need to be careful about this process and, in that context, I ask the Minister to review it.</p> <p>  Many directly elected models involve a recall option.  This is a very serious option.  Perhaps, however, removing a mayor should be considered the most serious option.  Anyone proposing it should bear in mind what it means.  I am worried that we are setting up a procedure which essentially allows the issue to be kicked around between national and local government.  The mayor, regardless of which party he or she represents, will suffer as a result.</p> <p>  Head 56 relates to the plebiscites for all cities.  The process for approving such plebiscites is not clear.  It would be useful to provide clarity on that.</p> <p>  The remainder of the Bill deals largely with issues relating to the running of elections.  With the electoral reform Bill and the electoral commission being established, would it be better to deal with some of those measures in overarching legislation rather than having different electoral procedures governed by different Acts put in place as decisions are made to directly elect mayors in other cities?</p> <p>  I will leave it to the Minister of State to consider those questions.  This is a hugely ambitious and exciting opportunity to devolve powers away from unelected officials to people and to give councils more powers.  The final version of the Bill must do all those things.  I congratulate the Minister of State on the work he has done so far and wish him the best with it.</p></speech>

To be fair, he is putting work into it.  Head 46(4) provides some detail.  It states: "The mayor and the director general shall agree a programme of delivery of local authority services following the budget meeting.."  It gives the mayor reach in terms of the staffing element.  It is codified to a certain extent but in the context of HR matters, we will have to have clearer demarcation lines between the mayor, as the democratically elected executive head, and the executives, as is the case in employment legislation.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a valid point about waste management.  We have had discussions about that.  Limerick, as a region, was involved in discussions with the Department and was against handing over responsibility in that regard to the directly elected mayor.</p><p>We are going to be engaged in a lot of discussion.  I would be the first to say that we had a lot of work to do in putting this Bill together and that there are a great deal of discussions still to be had.  Such discussions with various other Departments will continue as we try to reach in and take as much devolved power for Limerick as possible.  Devolved power is one aspect, another is the statutory consultee aspect.  This refers to a requirement to consult the mayor regarding issues affecting County Limerick.</p><p> The Deputy has highlighted the issue of removal.  We have had a lot of discussion with the Attorney General in connection with this.  I can see how difficult the process is.  The Deputy has made reference to the risks involved and to how negative connotations could very easily develop.  A very high bar must be passed to remove an elected official in this country.  The Deputy must accept that.  It is a very serious thing.  The Constitution underwrites the office of the President and the Supreme Court.  That shows the gravity of the removal of any elected official from office.  The Attorney General was concerned about the recall mechanism.  He suggested the ideas of stated misbehaviour and seriously dysfunctional performance.  Those are the two indicators.  We have framed it as best we can.  At the very outset, three quarters of the full complement of councillors, rather than three quarters of those councillors present, must act.  There are very significant safety measures at each step.  There is reference to the necessity of appointing a committee.  When this committee adjudicates on the mayor's performance or on any allegations made against the mayor, the mayor will have a right to reply as part of the process.  That is very important with regard to the direction of travel and the views the committee takes on the matter.  It then goes back to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

That is the worry.  While the Minister will ultimately have the power and may choose not to remove the person, we could be locked in a procedure which frustrates the work of both the mayor and the council.  We need to be very careful about that process.</p></speech>

Strict deadlines are included in the legislation which would have to be adhered to when embarking upon the process.  I hear the Deputy's concerns.  There will be a certain element of risk involved in introducing any process to remove an elected individual which, as I have said, would be very serious.  I hope it is a process on which we will never have to embark but, notwithstanding that, within the legislation, we have to prepare for all eventualities.  We commit to working with the committee in trying to finalise that.</p></speech>

I am sorry; I misunderstood how this committee works.  I thought I was on the roster and that the Chairperson would come to me.  I apologise for that.  I have a comment for the Chairperson.  I know it is not for me to tell him what to do but, when the committee has its private meeting, it might be useful to consider inviting people from Limerick before the committee.  I refer not only to Deputies, Senators and councillors, but also to Limerick academics and community groups.  As the Minister of State has said, many people contributed to the consultation carried out by Tim O'Connor, so it would be very useful to do that.  As I said, what the committee does is not for me to decide but it would be quite useful to consider that when it goes into private session.</p> <p>  I will go back to a question I have raised with the Minister of State.  I am still unclear as to what still needs to be done.  I will not say the Bill is delayed because it represents a very large amount of work and, in fairness, the Minister of State and his officials have done a good job on it, but what additions are we waiting on?  Where are we with that?  Will the Minister of State give us a timeline as to when he anticipates the President signing the Bill?  What is his hope or anticipation in that regard?</p></speech>

I am brave but I am not brave enough to say when the President will sign the Bill.  Obviously, there is a very significant amount of work that needs to be done to get us to that juncture.  Matters are still unpredictable.  As I said at the start, the D&aacute;il has been sitting only two days a week until recently.  I spoke to the Attorney General about the Bill last week and he assured me that he will give the matter priority insofar as is possible.  There is, however, legislation in respect of housing and other very important emergency legislation coming down the track.  Much of this is already in the public discourse.  I want to be careful when it comes to hanging my hat on a specific deadline.</p> <p>  I will say one or two things.  In the first instance, we really want to get this right.  We want to make sure the Bill we present to the Oireachtas is as complete as possible and that we ensure as much devolution of power as possible, reaching into all of those other Departments.  Second, we want to get priority time in the Oireachtas.  We have been assured that we will and I hope that will be the case.  As I have said, there are risks to that but I hope that we will have something published for summertime.  We will then be at the mercy of the Whip's office as to getting it through the Oireachtas.  Speed is very important but it also very important to get it right.  The risks of something going wrong are very high.  We will work with the committee.  The Cathaoirleach and the members have been very kind in prioritising this Bill.  It is very important that I listen to the views of members of the committee, including members of all parties and Independent members, and take as many of them on board as possible.  I am really committed to doing that.  If anyone wants to have a meeting with me, I am very open to facilitating that.</p> <p>  With regard to the 69 recommendations, 38 are already included in the Bill.  A few will be more difficult.  I will not go through any of them at length.  The recommendation regarding a recall provision is gone because the Attorney General has ruled it out.  That is one of the 69 recommendations.  In an earlier contribution, I made reference to the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund and getting into banking and the Department of Finance.  There are risks attached to that.  That is part of the bigger picture.  It will take a while to deliver something as ambitious as that.  The implementation advisory group report is very ambitious.  I thank the group for that because that is what we want.  We really want blue-sky thinking when talking about a new office and that is what the group has provided.  We have to get it down to a deliverable product.  That is another issue that will take a little time to work on.</p> <p>  With regard to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Garda Commissioner has specific rights with regard to budgetary matters and policing.  That is paramount.  It would be very difficult to give a directly elected mayor a say with regard to the requirements of the policing budget.  We can use joint policing committees and other mechanisms to get around that.  </p> <p>  Those are the kinds of difficulties involved.  There are only a small number that will present real difficulty.  Some 38 of the 69 recommendations are before the committee now.  Another ten are partially before it and we are working on a further 11 as we embark on the legislative process.  With the consent of the Houses, we hope to bring in amendments on Committee Stage as negotiations with the various other Departments progress.  At the end, only a handful of recommendations will not have been addressed.  We have to be open and honest about this.  A handful will have to await the bedding-in of the office of the mayor before we can see how they might potentially be brought in at a later stage.  These will take additional work at Government level.</p></speech>

I agree with him that it is really important that we proceed on this at pace but that we take the time to make sure we get it right.  As to Deputy Quinlivan's comments, I fully encourage Oireachtas Members from County Limerick to engage with the committee in this regard.  In our next private session, we will come to an agreement as to how we are going to engage with local authority elected representatives for the county.  It is quite possible that we will also engage with the Association of Irish Local Government and the Local Authority Members Association.</p> <p>  This is an incredibly exciting time for Limerick.  Limerick is centrally positioned along that western economic corridor through Galway, Clare, Limerick and Cork on the western side of the country.  We talk about balanced regional development.  It is important that this does not become just a throwaway term.  It is important that we get the balance right.  In light of the current emphasis on strategic rail reviews and the potential for rail, Limerick's place in the rail infrastructure allows its connectivity to places all along that western corridor and to Waterford.  There are two deepwater ports there, which will be central to the offshore renewable energy industry.  There is a great future for Moneypoint.  The Limerick and south Clare area has so much going for it.</p><p>The right candidate for the job of mayor of Limerick will have a huge amount of scope.  There is massive potential for that individual to really make a difference for Limerick.  It is an enticing prospect for a good candidate whose approach is policy driven.  I look forward to seeing the election take place.</p><p> As the Minister of State will know, the committee has an extremely heavy legislative workload in the context of  the important areas that we have been discussing today and for which a mayor will have responsibility.  That includes housing, marine planning and electoral reform.  The members of the committee are committed to the pre-legislative scrutiny process and we are trying to manage the legislative workload to which I refer.  We will continue with our pre-legislative scrutiny of this important Bill for local democracy.  I thank the Minister of State and his officials for attending.  We look forward to continuing this process and to supplying out pre-legislative scrutiny report to the Minister of State as soon as we can.</p></speech>

Senator Horkan is attending in substitution for him.  The Senator is very welcome.  The purpose of the meeting is to have an engagement with a number of stakeholders who have made written submissions on the general scheme of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2020.  All witnesses are appearing virtually before the committee this afternoon from a location outside the Leinster House precincts.  I welcome the witnesses to our meeting.</p> <p>  We are joined from the Law Society of Ireland by Mr. James Cahill, president, and Ms Mary Keane, director general; from the Council of the Bar of Ireland, Ms Maura McNally, chair, and Ms Mema Byrne, member; Dr. Patrick O'Brien, from Oxford Brookes University; Dr. Laura Cahillane, University of Limerick; Dr. Tom Hickey, Dublin City University; and Dr. David Kenny, Trinity College Dublin.  I congratulate Ms Keane on her recent appointment.</p> <p>  I ask members and witnesses to mute their devices while not contributing to avoid picking up background noise or feedback.  I also ask that they use the "raise hand" function when they wish to contribute.  As usual, I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent mode.</p> <p>  Before I invite the witnesses to deliver their opening statements, I advise them of the following regarding parliamentary privilege.  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does.  Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to any evidence they may give.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  For members who are participating remotely, I ask them to keep their devices on mute until they are invited to speak.  When speaking, where possible I ask that they should have their camera switched on and be mindful that we are in public session.</p> <p>  In addition, I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate in the meeting from outside of the precinct will be refused.</p> <p>  I remind members and witnesses that they are expected to strictly adhere to the subject matter scheduled for discussion today.  Any deviation from these matters will be addressed through the Chair.</p> <p>  I will invite each organisation in turn to make an opening statement for a maximum of five minutes.  Once all the opening statements have been delivered, I will call on members of the committee in the order that they indicate to me, to put their questions.  In the remaining time there will be an opportunity for supplementary questions.  The duration of the meeting is limited.  Therefore, we must strictly adhere to the time allocated.  All speakers should focus on that in their contributions.  I invite Mr. Cahill to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.717" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. James Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021051800002#A00300"><p>The director general and I are very pleased to attend this event.  The necessity to introduce a reformed process for judicial selection becomes more urgent with each passing year.  Our recent submission is the third we have made.  The others were made in 2014 and 2017.  I wish to highlight five areas which require further careful consideration during the drafting process.  They are: membership of the commission; the procedures committee; merit, gender and diversity; legal academics; and miscellaneous matters.</p> <p>  We make a number of points regarding membership of the commission.  The 2016 Bill provided that "a practising solicitor nominated by the President for the time being of the Law Society of Ireland" would be a member of the commission.  The provision has not been retained in the general scheme.  It is critically important that a representative from each branch of the profession is appointed to the commission.  The general scheme provides that the Attorney General will participate in the commission as a non-voting member.  The society's long-held view is that it is not appropriate that the Attorney General would have a dual function in the process, both at the commission and the Cabinet table.  The reasons for this are listed in our submission.</p> <p>  The society cautioned against creating a commission which was top-heavy in terms of senior members of the Judiciary, at the expense of judicial representatives of the courts of local and limited jurisdiction.  We continue to believe that balance among the judicial membership of the commission is crucial.  However, the scheme provides that a Judicial Council nominee will chair the commission in the absence of the Chief Justice.  The chair of the procedures committee will be the Chief Justice or his or her nominee.  In any other committee which is formed to assist the commission or the procedures committee, the chair will be the Chief Justice or a nominee determined by the Chief Justice.  These substantial responsibilities raise a question as to whether the Judicial Council nominees are more likely to be senior, long-standing members of the Judiciary.  If so, their experience of legal practice - as court users rather than as members of the Judiciary - will be at a considerable remove from their present-day experience.  I reiterate that the Law Society welcomes the participation of lay members on the commission in the manner proposed by the general scheme.</p> <p>  The procedures committee will be the engine room of the process.  Our previous submissions advocated for more formal evaluation procedures in the consideration of judicial appointments.  We believe that is necessary to streamline and aid transparency in the process and, as such, the creation of a procedures committee to perform prescribed functions is welcome.  The question has been raised whether sufficient detail has been provided under heads 55 to 60 to deliver that transparency.  Transparency has been the subject of debate.</p> <p>  The credibility of the commission will be greatly enhanced by a solid start.  At the outset, we suggested that the commission conduct a detailed analysis of international best practice in judicial appointments so that the best elements of other systems can be considered in an Irish context.  It will also be critically important to ensure that sufficient expertise is available to the procedures committee to enable it to draft and deliver to the commission comprehensive "Statements of Procedures" and "Statements of Relevant Skills and Attributes" for each class of court business and every area of law.  The expanse of that task cannot be underestimated.</p> <p>  We believe the commission should carefully reflect on the range of skills it wishes to consider as contributing to the concept of "merit" in recommending persons for appointment.  It should also consider the European Commission's extensive work on judicial training and education in EU law as well as the Law Society's work on gender equality, diversity and inclusion in the Irish legal system.</p><p> As regards diversity between the branches of the profession, we have proposed that a comparable approach should be taken in order to increase the number of solicitors being appointed to judicial office.  There is the potential to provide greater diversity in eligible candidates for judicial appointment.  However, head 38 could be widened to increase the pool of legal academics who are eligible, which, in itself, has potential to achieve greater diversity among the members of the Judiciary.  We consider that the requirement for legal academics to have 12 years' standing and to have practised for at least four years is at odds with the general thrust of the scheme, which is to make judicial appointments on merit.  We propose removing the four-year threshold and propose that an academic will be deemed to be appropriately qualified where, at the time of such appointment, they are a legal academic of 12 years standing, or then just a solicitor or barrister within the meaning of the Legal Services Regulation Act 2015.</p><p> A further point relates to confidentiality and the conditions to be satisfied in recommending names to the Minister.  I wish to also highlight the issue of judicial references.  On that, I would simply say that the practice of submitting references from sitting or previous members of the Judiciary as part of the application process should cease.</p><p> We welcome the legislation.  Judicial appointments are, of course, a vital component of the proper administration of justice in the State and we look forward to today's debate.  I thank the members for their time and attention.</p></speech>

I totally agree with you on the point about judicial references.  It has been a bizarre oversight, both for legal professional independence and judicial independence.  It has been very curious over time.  On the procedural point, although, arguably, it could always have been done under the current arrangements, the Law Society has been totally consistent on the need for representation of solicitors, and they have been an important counterpoint to the "being known" phenomenon that has operated for many years within the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board for lack of other procedures to identify whether people were appropriate.</p> <p>  We move to the Bar of Ireland.  I call Ms McNally.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.720" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maura McNally" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021051800002#B00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting us today.  This opening statement is premised upon our earlier submission of 2021 but we also made submissions in January 2017.  I do not intend to open those submissions but they should both be on the committee's files.</p> <p>  We are of the opinion that it is crucial the Judiciary maintains the highest standards of competency, impartiality and fairness, and it is essential that the public retains confidence in its Judiciary in order to ensure appropriate rule of law.  The judicial appointments process is a vital mechanism for ensuring that those aims and objectives are achieved.</p> <p>  There are many aspects of the general scheme of the Bill which take on board our previous suggestions, including the balance of lay members on the commission, and the number of members of the Judiciary and of the Bar and of the Law Society.  However, there are a number of concerns in respect of the new judicial appointments commission as proposed.  There is no automatic inclusion of the chair of the Bar of Ireland, nor automatic inclusion of the president of the Law Society.  It is our submission that those two persons, whoever they may be in the future, are best positioned to advise as to the suitability of either a practising barrister or practising solicitor.  For example, in my role as chair of the Bar of Ireland, I am conversant with the reputations, standing, competency and areas of speciality of the members of the Bar of Ireland, and I am in a position to advise the Government, which is basically the role of the commission when it comes to appointing new members of the Judiciary.  I submit that, in those circumstances and premised upon that unique knowledge, the chair of the Bar of Ireland and, in the case of solicitors, the president of the Law Society, should be included on the commission.</p> <p>  There is logic to reducing the number of those on the commission, such as, for example, that smaller numbers can lead to greater consensus, but I would also submit that judges, whether they be of the superior courts or, for example, of the Circuit Court or District Court, should also be included in the following circumstances.  For example, if it is an appointment to a position of the Circuit Court, the president of the Circuit Court should be invited to that commission to make a submission as to precisely what it is he or she is looking for in a candidate, and, in addition, that president will be aware of the reputation of the person applying.  I say that in circumstances where one of the criteria for application is that one must have experience in the practice and procedure of the courts when applying.</p> <p>  There is a limit in the wording of the new Bill.  For example, when applying for an appointment to the role of judge of the superior courts, one must show experience of practice and procedure in that court and one must show knowledge of the case law and determinations of that court.  However, that is not carried backwards, for example, to the Circuit Court or the District Court, where, we would submit on behalf of the Bar of Ireland, persons who are conversant with the practice and procedure in those courts must show that competency.  For example, they must show they are aware of the practice and procedure in the Circuit Court, if that is the position they are applying for, and of the judicial decisions and determinations of that court, and it is similar in respect of the District Court.</p> <p>  As to selection and recommendation, again, I am not going to reiterate the point about experience and having knowledge of the practice and procedure.  However, there is an anomaly whereby barristers and solicitors who are in practice are required to show their experience and not only their knowledge of the case law, knowledge of determinations and knowledge of statute, but more particularly knowledge of the practice and procedure.  Yet, academics are only required to show four years experience.  If anything has taught us since March 2020, it is that we have had some 18 months during which there has been very little learning in the area of practice and procedure for younger barristers and younger solicitors.  For example, 18 months of that four years could well be considered written off because they have not seen in practice what happens in the very court to which the person is applying as an applicant to be appointed.  There is a very big difference between academic knowledge or knowledge of practice, and experience of practice and procedure in those courts.  I submit that the practice and procedure and the experience should be equal for all across the board, whether they be barristers, solicitors or academics.  There is no point, for example, having four years of knowledge of practice and procedure from 2000 to 2004, and then applying 17 years later, in 2021, to be appointed to a court that they have not set foot in for almost two decades because they are not knowledgeable in the area of practice and procedure in that court.</p> <p>  Another issue I would like to raise is in respect of the appointment or the replacement of individuals on the commission.  For example, if the Attorney General is an applicant for a position, we think it is very obvious that he or she should recuse himself or herself and that she or he should be replaced by an alternate when an application is being made.  It is similar when it comes to judges who have already, shall we say, passed the test at the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board as exists at present.  Therefore, where a person was deemed suitable for the Circuit Court but, for example, might now be applying for a position on the High Court, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court, we would submit that that person should go through the same rigours as any barrister or solicitor applying, in that he or she may very well have been suitable to the District Court or Circuit Court but that does not automatically mean she or he is suitable for the higher courts.</p><p> I think I have taken up my five minutes.  I will answer any questions members may have.  I refer also to our two previous submissions, particularly the most recent one of this year.  I thank members for listening.</p></speech>

On a technical point, the 2017 submission is not on file as such, the reason being that it was submitted to a previous committee, which has essentially died.  However, we are aware of the submission, it is available and I have read it.</p> <p>  I ask Dr. Patrick O'Brien from Oxford Brookes University to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.723" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Patrick O'Brien" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021051800002#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me.  In this opening statement I will focus primarily on the treatment of diversity in the Bill.  Broadly speaking, I think the Bill is a step forward and a good thing but I am concerned about the way in which diversity is treated under head 6.  Head 6 introduces three different issues: the idea of merit; diversity, first in terms of gender and then in terms of the make-up of the general population; and linguistic competence criteria, that is, competence in the Irish language.  I am concerned that, as drafted, the Bill's focus will be primarily on merit and that this is likely to crowd out concerns about diversity.  This is based on the experience of the various UK judicial appointments bodies, of which there are four.  UK processes have been formalised steadily over the past 20 years.  Part of the reason for doing this was to increase the diversity of appointments made.  The practical experience of this, however, has been that it has not happened because there has been a fairly resolute focus on merit in very traditional terms.  Diversity is therefore increasing but only very gradually.</p> <p>  Looking at the statistics, the Irish Judiciary under the current system outperforms all the various UK jurisdictions.  For example, in England and Wales 32% of judges are female whereas for Ireland as a whole the figure is 38%.  If the two supreme courts are compared, it is two out of 12 on the UK Supreme Court and three out of nine on the Irish Supreme Court, although granted that is with some vacancies.</p> <p>  Why has this happened?  Particularly in England and Wales we can point to two or three things.  First is this strict focus on merit, which privileges traditional qualifications and traditional candidates rather than the potential of candidates.  Second is the removal of the capacity to tap eligible candidates on the shoulder.  One important thing that has been shown internationally is that if people who might not be traditionally represented are approached directly, often they have not really thought about applying or have not thought of themselves in those terms.  That is good at bringing people in.  Third is the involvement of politicians.  Again, international comparisons show that politics is important as a driver to diversity because if politics accepts diversity as a goal, it can introduce that element into selection.</p> <p>  Given the way in which the Bill is currently structured, I recommend that head 6 be amended to require the commission to present the Government or the Minister, as appropriate, with a balanced slate of three to five names of which some - at least one - should be someone whose appointment would advance the diversity of the Judiciary as a whole.  This could be a way of avoiding what appears to be the slowing down that has occurred under the various UK appointment bodies.</p> <p>  The other submissions I have made are a little smaller.  First, regarding the membership of the commission, again the experience in the UK in particular suggests that not a great deal turns on this.  Judges tend to have a great deal of influence by virtue of their status and expertise.  The omission of representatives from the professional bodies is anomalous and should be looked at in some capacity.</p> <p>  Second, regarding recommendations to the Minister, another anomaly of the Bill is the potential, in circumstances in which the commission has felt unable to appoint anyone, that the Minister could then still proceed to an appointment based on the same names.  Given that the new processes are supposed to be more closely focused on merit and modern selection processes, it seems anomalous that someone whom the commission has decided should not merit appointment should then be appointed by the Minister.  I think there should be more political accountability for this, possibly in the form of a requirement that the Oireachtas be notified if the Minister appoints off the list, as it were.</p> <p>  Third, I understand and I can see the reasoning behind the criminal offences introduced under heads 30, 31 and 65.  They do seem a little disproportionate to me, particularly the confidentiality offences, which have indictable versions.  There is maybe more to discuss here, but they have at least a potential for a chilling effect, possibly from a merit perspective, in terms of getting people to approach potential candidates informally.</p> <p>  Finally, legal academics have been mentioned already.  I suggest, given the Bill's current form, that no legal academic is likely to be appointed because the modern structure of academic careers is such that professional experience of the kind suggested is simply not an option.  It is very unusual.  Therefore, if it is considered that the appointment of legal academics is a good thing, this will need to be looked at again.  Certainly, the structure of head 38 seems to me to be extremely convoluted and needs some further thought and clarification.</p> <p>  I will stop there.  I think that is roughly five minutes.  I am happy to take any questions as required.</p></speech>

There has always been provision for the Minister to notify the public through <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>of any appointments off the list, as it were.  I am delighted Dr. O'Brien could contribute because the research he did with Robert Hazell and Kate Malleson on the UK system provides a really important political counterpoint whereby politics was taken entirely out of that system.  The narrative here has been one of reducing political influence, but I think Dr. O'Brien found that diversity had actually been better achieved through the political system.  I think he pointed to the Supreme Court profile.  It might be interesting to come back to some of that because the narratives are going in opposite directions, which is quite interesting in jurisdictions so similar.</p><p>We will move on to the next group: Dr. Laura Cahillane, Dr. Tom Hickey and Dr. David Kenny from the University of Limerick, Dublin City University and Trinity College Dublin, respectively.

I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak.  I should note that this statement represents the views of three legal academics from three different institutions.  We have all researched the area of judicial appointments and wish to highlight the most important points from our longer written submission.  We are very enthusiastic about this proposed legislation.  This reform is long overdue and we are delighted to see progress on so many areas in the general scheme.  We are concerned, however, that unless certain changes and improvements are made, this opportunity will be potentially wasted and the commission may be no more effective in improving our judicial appointments process than the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, has been.<br/><br/>The first matter we wish to highlight is the absolute necessity for more specificity in the recommendations from the commission.  It is widely acknowledged that JAAB had little effect in influencing the Government's decisions on appointments because it sent forward too many candidates and did so with no ranking or order of preference and in fact very little evaluation.  A smaller number of names is proposed in this Bill.  We feel it is still not small enough.  The commission should recommend no more than three candidates per vacancy.  It is crucial, in our view, that the commission be required to rank these candidates in order of preference.<br/><br/>We expect that the commission will carry out detailed assessment procedures.  It may be very obvious that certain candidates are more suitable for appointment.  It would be appropriate that this be conveyed to the Government.  If candidates are unranked, governmental discretion will once again be largely unguided and any assessment procedures carried out will become somewhat nugatory.  To be clear, the Government will still be entirely free under the Constitution to pick whomever it wishes for any judicial vacancy either from the list of recommendations or outside of it.  The only consequence would be, as under the current system, a statement to that effect in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>.  It is certainly not unconstitutional to provide for a three-name list or a ranking of candidates because legally the Government's discretion is not fettered.<br/><br/>The second matter we wish to address is the criteria and process used by the commission to recommend candidates.  Compared with international best practice, the proposals in the general scheme are very scant.  In fact, they do not add any additional detail to the existing criteria for appointment, which have long been criticised as being too vague.</p><p>The commitment to a merit-based process is welcome but further detail is needed to elaborate on what merit actually means.  The detail is crucial here because merit on its own is not a very useful guide to judicial appointments, unless it is elaborated on, in guiding the commission on what types of candidates are desirable and meritorious.  England and Wales might be consulted as jurisdictions where this has been done, for example.  Further detail on suitability on grounds of character and temperament would be desirable, as well as a direction on how the committee would actually establish this.</p><p> A crucial omission is that the scheme does not detail the process that the commission should undertake in assessing candidates.  It allows for various procedures such as interviews but does not specifically require them.  </p><p> Currently, JAAB also has the power but has chosen not to exercise it.  We believe the legislation should be stronger and should specify the procedures, such as interviews, for example, or perhaps case studies or role-plays, as is very common in other jurisdictions because if these decisions are left to the discretion of the committee afterwards, then procedures may simply be dispensed with.</p><p> We also welcome the introduction of a commitment to diversity and equality in appointments.  It would be useful to include a requirement for a diversity strategy and for diversity data management, or at least a requirement for the commission to report on diversity in its annual reports.</p><p> We are also of the firm belief that the central role of the Attorney General in the commission should be reconsidered.  If the Attorney General is removed from the membership of the commission, it would then have equal lay and legal representation, which reflects international best practice.  Also, the Attorney General, as legal adviser to the Government, will have an intimate role in the discussions of the Government&rsquo;s final choice.  Having the Attorney General also sitting on the commission gives the Government an outsized influence on the process.  In fact, it is the only figure involved in both parts of the decision-making process.  The commission is being set up as an independent assistant in the Government&rsquo;s selection of candidates.  It should not, therefore, have this overlap with the Government&rsquo;s process and its chief legal adviser.  We see no merit in the inclusion of the Attorney General on the commission and this should be reconsidered.  </p><p> It might also be considered appropriate to exclude the Attorney General from eligibility for recommendation by the commission for a period of time after leaving office to avoid any potential conflict of interest in the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice to Government on appointments.</p><p> Finally, this legislation is a very critical opportunity to provide for fairness and transparency in a process that is flawed at present.  It is crucial that this opportunity is taken to ensure real reform and to guarantee that the existing process is not going to be replicated under the guise of reform.  I thank the committee again for this opportunity to present our views and we will be happy to discuss any questions its members may have.</p></speech>

It is remarkable how similar they all are in respect of the need for a proper system of appointment.  Have they any thoughts as to why the system is so vague at present and as to why the opportunity has not been taken to strengthen it?  That is probably a rhetorical question and may not require an answer.</p> <p>  Dr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s contribution on the UK system pointed out that the political representatives have been taken out of the system and that this has affected its diversity.  Are those two things similar?  I would have thought that taking politicians out of the system might ensure diversity, rather than restricting it, as might be the case on an Irish basis.  Is the cause and effect there, in that the removal of the political representatives in the UK has led directly to a less diverse range of appointments?</p> <p>  In all the contributions, the point has been made that the process of selecting candidates has not been specified clearly enough in the legislation.  Obviously, all of our witnesses would like to see this specified and laid out clearly in legislation.  That is vitally important.  The proposal to remove the Attorney General from the selection process is also a valid point and makes perfect sense.</p> <p>  In our witnesses&rsquo; view, if all of those things were achieved, would this lead to a more open and transparent system, rather than what we have at the moment?</p></speech>

It is important not to be too definitive because, as with anything to do with people, social science and culture, there is a lot of stuff going on.  Under the pre-existing system, where one had political commitment to diversity, that encouraged diversity.  One issue to consider is that if one has politicians who are committed to this goal, the fact that they are more involved in decision-making and choice will have a knock-on impact on who gets chosen.  The second aspect of this is an indirect one, which is that if one takes politicians out, in the sense of taking outsiders out, there is a possibility that judges will engage in something more like self-replication.  I need to be very careful here because there is a very strong culture of appointment on merit in the UK system and I do not quite mean that as a positive thing.</p> <p>  By contrast with the Vice Chairman&rsquo;s excellent book on appointments, which I have consulted extensively, most female judges in England and Wales to whom I have spoken are adamant that they have been appointed exclusively on merit and not by reference to any kind of broader consideration of the make-up of the Judiciary.  The Vice Chairman&rsquo;s book suggests that the opposite may be true to an extent for Irish judges.  One has to bear in mind that that background characteristic or cultural norm is there.</p> <p>  That said, in any system where one gets a greater involvement of existing incumbents in choosing who succeeds or joins them, one ends up with a degree of self-replication.  Everyone wants the people who come after them to have done it the same way in which they did it.  There are broader political and cultural reasons why that might be the case and I do not think that we can see it as baldly and as simply as saying that if one has more politicians, one gets more diversity.  There are, however, more complex and nuanced reasons why that might be a beneficial side-effect of it, if not a direct consequence.  I will pause there as many others may want to contribute.</p></speech>

That was a political decision and it did not matter what names arose, women were going to be appointed and that was the end of that.

I have a number of observations to make on the points they made and I would ask that they might extrapolate and tease them out a little bit further.  On the point made by Mr. Cahill on a wider pool of legal academics, could he extend those thoughts and ideas for me?  On practice and procedure, I fully get what Ms McNally is saying there.  Could she perhaps expand on the point about judges serving currently on the District and Circuit Courts?  I believe she is saying they do not go through the same robust interview process or anything like that in their application process, as opposed to an application made for the superior courts.</p><p>Will she expand on that?  I like the point about their suitability for a different court.  As was said, they may have sat on the Bench of a Circuit or District Court from a number of years and are going into an area that is vastly different.  What is the difference in their applications for that higher court?</p><p> Dr. O'Brien spoke very eloquently about diversity and equality.  I think no one would disagree with that.  The point he made about the positive aspects politics has played in achieving that was interesting.  He might make a further comment on that.  His comment on the Attorney General serving as a member of the commission while serving the Government is a valid and obvious point, which was made very well.  I commend and agree with him on that.</p></speech>

Our view with regard to legal academics is geared towards the higher courts such as the Supreme Court, for example, where very precise legal issues are dealt with at a much more detailed and in-depth level than would occur in local courts day to day.  The issue of practice by an academic for four years in the general scheme of things could include a need to demonstrate an appropriate knowledge and experience of the decisions and practices before being considered for appointment.  The notion of academics having to cease work in a university, take out a practising certificate and then develop a business for four years in the Bar or the solicitors' profession would damage their capacity as academics to move then to one of the higher courts.  Ms Keane may want to add to what I have said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.738" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021051800002#E00300"><p>On the issue of academics, we see the four-year requirement as a barrier to entry.  It is hoped that what is being put together here is a system of eligibility to apply.  The procedures commission will set out all kinds of merit, criteria, professional skills, and other qualifications.  Our view is that the broadest range of legal professionals should be able to access consideration for appointment.  Therefore, we believe the four-year requirement should be removed.  As the president, Mr. Cahill, has said, there is a particularly compelling argument for the appointment of academics to multi-judge courts, such as the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court, where there could be a mix of academic and trial lawyers.  They would bring different perspectives and enrich the decision-making process.  That is our view on the point of academics.</p> <p>  There would have to be a definition of a legal academic and of an understanding of experience in law as opposed to experience in a court.  England and Wales, very helpfully, introduced a provision, especially section 52, in the 2007 tribunals and enforcement Act.  It provides for the eligibility of a broader number of academics compared with what is proposed here with, effectively, a four-year bar or barrier to their becoming eligible.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.741" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maura McNally" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021051800002#E00600"><p>I have two comments to make. The first one is about diversity on the Bench.  It would be incorrect for anyone to look at the Judiciary as a whole and say that the percentage of women satisfies a reflection of society, because it certainly does not in this country.  When we talk about diversity, in the opinion of the Bar of Ireland, we must ensure there is diversity in each branch of the Judiciary.  There is no point in putting all the Judiciary together - Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, High Court, Circuit Court and District Court - and saying that we have done a great job because thirty-something per cent are women if the majority of them are in the lower courts.  To ensure there is a reflection of faith in the system and a reflection that the system of the administration of justice mirrors what is going on in society, we submit that diversity should apply with specificity to each level, not just as a prism but on each separate level.</p> <p>  Looking at head 40 and how it looks for difference experience, at present under the system, a person who is a judge of the Circuit Court, High Court or District Court has already gone through the JAAB process, if I can call it that, and has passed that particular hurdle.  However, when that person made the application, he or she made it, if was to the District Court, to be a judge of the District Court.  If it was to the Circuit Court, it was to be a judge of the Circuit Court.  Under the new mechanism, and-or as present, a person does not have to apply separately.  For example, if I want to apply to be a judge of the Court of Appeal,  I have to show my experience in practice and procedure in that Court of Appeal.  How can a Circuit or District Court judge do that?  It is creating an imbalance in diversity and a dichotomy in respect of applicants.</p></speech>

Ethnic diversity is something we would to have a completely different conversation about as well.  It is going to become increasingly an issue we will all need to grasp.</p> <p>  In terms of politics being a driver, the Chair gave a great example, better than any I have on file, which was that if politicians are committed to this as a whole, they can push it through.  Couple that with the capacity to approach people directly, which I fear may be lost under a much more formal process, there is the potential for things to slow down.  This is hemmed in by all sorts of caveats.  That is my concern about moving to a more formal process.</p></speech>

I was attending a public session of the children's committee.  I have read the statements, however, and prepared questions.  My first question is for either Dr. Cahillane or Dr. Kenny or anyone else who was part of that submission.  Instead of introducing new a offence regarding canvassing for judicial appointments and disclosing information, in particular confidential information, to people connected to the commission, would the previous practice and provision of the duty of confidentiality be sufficient?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.746" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. David Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021051800002#E01100"><p>I agree with Dr. O'Brien's characterisation of it, that it is perhaps disproportionate to frame the offence in the way it has been in the heads of the Bill.  It is very important that confidentiality, data protection and various other desiderata in these processes are taken seriously.</p><p>The heads of the Bill probably go too far, both in terms of the scope and scale of criminal offences and perhaps the need for a criminal offence in general.  What was done previously would have been acceptable.  I do not know that it needs to go that far.<br/><br/>If I could weigh in briefly on the previous conversation as well, without taking up the Senator's time, I echo what was in the submission of the Law Society in respect of academic appointments.  We often see in various jurisdictions around the world effective academic appointments in particular to appellate courts.  We need to be mindful of procedural knowledge not being something that even every practitioner picks up in respect of the practice in individual courts.  Ultimately, if we insist on decades of practice in a particular court being required, we will only appoint litigators and that will, <i>per se</i>, massively reduces the pool of appointments that we have.  We need judicial education in practice and procedure for all judges because we cannot guarantee that people's professional experience has prepared them, nor should we.  We should train people in the art of practice and procedure, so I might add that as well if I could.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.748" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1681" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021051800002#F00200"><p>That is brilliant.  I thank Dr. Kenny.  I agree with what he said about training.</p> <p>  I understand the importance of the Irish language in the function of the courts system and being able to provide a space for people to have hearings in Irish.  I accept that we need to protect it, but I also wonder about the knock-on effect it has on increasing diversity in and of itself.  We talk about having it as a criterion, but we also talk about increasing diversity in other key areas such as gender, ethnic and social diversity, and I wonder how we reconcile those two issues.  Do the witnesses think we should create a quota of how many members of the Judiciary have proficiency in Irish rather than ending up in a space where we say that everybody must have proficiency in Irish?  We see from other sectors where we are fighting to have diversity, such as the teaching profession and the Garda, that even in order to be able to study in the area, having a proficiency in Irish could reduce diversity before anyone even has the opportunity to apply to the Bar, for example.  Sometimes the situation has already been determined much earlier.  Could Dr. Cahillane comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.749" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Laura Cahillane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021051800002#F00300"><p>A requirement to consider a particular competency in the Irish language would not necessarily be a bar to diversity in general.  In one way, it could be a way of encouraging diversity in terms of representing geographical areas where Irish might be a primary language.  We must be very careful because the Irish language is given primacy in the Constitution and we must protect that.  People have a right to have their cases heard through the Irish language.  We would have to maintain that criterion in the legislation, but we could make the other criteria around diversity stronger in the Bill itself if we want to broaden it out along the lines of what Dr. O'Brien set out.  As we heard from previous speakers, for a long time in Ireland diversity is an area we have not really considered to be necessary and taking action, for example, such as broadening the pool and allowing legal academics apply for judicial eligibility, but making that a reality rather than having restricted barriers to entry is going to be a major benefit in terms of increasing the potential pool.  The same is true of trying to encourage solicitors as well as barristers.  We know that judges are predominantly taken from the pool of barristers rather than solicitors.  Perhaps having specific references to that in the legislation would enable the procedures committee to then build its processes around having diversity as a goal.</p></speech>

My next question is for Ms McNally of the Bar Council.  When it comes to the selection process and procedure, what are the issues that could arise due to the absence of a formal interview and application process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.751" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maura McNally" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021051800002#F00500"><p>The present system does allow for interview but at present the JAAB does not hold interviews.  Personally, I do not see any difficulty with interviews in circumstances where it would be the equivalent of a test of that person's knowledge of the case law, in particular the leading cases in the court to which that person is applying to be a sitting judge.  It would also have to question the practice and procedure which would include rules of evidence, the rules of public law and administrative law.  All of that would have to be part and parcel of the application and possibly part of the interview.</p> <p>  To recap on the issue of Irish, given that it is our primary language, it is currently one of the questions on the application form under the current JAAB system when people apply to be judges.  The number of judges with a proficiency in Irish is diminishing, rather than the opposite.  The difficulty boils down to two if not three separate issues.  One is entirely to do with the educational system where we all seem to stop speaking Irish as soon as we leave school or college.  Second, under the Judicial Council, to my understanding, there is no funding at present in order to support training in the Irish language in order to re-ignite or awaken one's memory of knowledge of Irish because a few weeks or months of speaking Irish would lead to greater capacity to hear a case in Irish and give a determination as Gaeilge.  Here at the Bar of Ireland, for example, we recognise that, and we have now established Cumann na Barra, which is a specialised Bar group comprising Irish speakers.  Irish is the primary language of the group.  They practise primarily in Irish and not only do they do so, but they are trying to involve the rest of us, including me as a dinosaur who has not spoken Irish in 30 years to try to re-ignite my knowledge of the language.  Similarly, we are trying to encourage young people coming into the Bar to continue speaking Irish.  We are encouraging it across the board, not only from the perspective of judicial appointments or progress at the Bar but as a recognition of it being part of our heritage and culture.</p></speech>

That is no difficulty.  Given that Ms McNally has raised it a couple of times, I wish to follow up with a question about interviews.  Who does she think is the appropriate person to interview a legal practitioner who is applying to be a judge of the High Court?</p></speech>

I must hold my hand up and say that I sit on the JAAB, but I do so purely from my position as chair of the Bar of Ireland.  That is similarly the case with Mr. Cahill who sits on the JAAB.  We are on the advisory council.  It would be up to the chair of the JAAB, who at present is the Chief Justice, to appoint a committee, either the entire committee to hold an interview or persons in that committee.  Personally, if it was down to me, if there was to be an interview I would recommend that if a person was applying for the Circuit Court then the president of the Circuit Court should be one of the persons on the interviewing committee because that person knows exactly what it is that he or she is looking for in a candidate, the kind of experience required, the practice and procedure and whether the person has the correct temperament or answers the questions that would indicate correct temperament, etc.  It is down to the Chief Justice.</p></speech>

It might be something we could talk to Ms McNally about later because I am conscious that Senator McDowell is next on the list.  We might come back to that and let Senator McDowell come in.</p></speech>

One problem that I have with the scheme of the Bill that is now before us is, curiously, one which caused a problem with the previous Bill, that is the membership of the commission.  It seems to be a body corporate consisting of nine people, but one of those nine people is a kind of rotational person.  I cannot follow exactly how this is supposed to work.  Perhaps I am missing something and somebody else understands this better than I do.  I refer to the second item, which is a court president, if it depends on what appointment is being made as to whether one is on the commission, does the commission have any continuing existence if it is appointing a procedures committee and preparing its annual general report?  There seems to be a lacuna there which I cannot quite follow.  The committee should signal that to the Department.</p><p>It is a strange corporate body that has a rotational person depending on one aspect of the commission's business, which is simply the appointment to a particular court on a particular day.</p><p> I am concerned about the whole notion of the Judiciary selecting a tame barrister and a tame solicitor for a three-year term.  The legal professions deserve some standing in this.  This is not a trade union point of view.  It is simply that the members of the professions have representative bodies and a chairperson or president of that body.</p><p> It seems odd that this can be completely sidelined and the Judiciary can select a solicitor for three years, say that is it and it does not want any further input from the Law Society of Ireland.  It has selected Joe or Josephine Bloggs from McCann Fitzgerald and that is the input from the solicitors' profession.  Likewise, it selects some barrister who it favours, or thinks is wise or unwise or house-trained or whatever, and that is the entire input or insight from the profession that one of its members has been selected by the Judiciary.</p><p> Perhaps Dr. Cahillane, Dr. Kenny and others will come in on this.  Is that normal or is this something new that is being brought in?  If one wants the professions to have faith in the whole system, I cannot see why it is the case that the Judiciary chooses which member of each body has a function.  The first question I pose is about this rotational issue, which I believe is a bit strange, and then the appointment of a barrister and solicitor by the Judiciary for three years, which is strange.</p><p> I then come to the question of interviews.  One of the things during - we will not call it a filibuster - the detailed investigation of the previous Bill was this whole question of interviewing sitting judges.  What questions will the commission put to them?  Will it ask how judges decide cases?  Will it ask if they are even-tempered and what their general attitude is, or whether they are liberal or conservative?</p><p> What questions can be put to a High Court judge by an interview process that are of any real assistance to a committee?  Is it purely to find out if the person is pleasant or unpleasant or is it to find out how he or she has functioned as a judge?  Is it to ask that person about the decisions they have made, or might be able to make, or his or her capacity to work with other people?  I find the whole interview process at the higher level a little bit problematic.</p><p> I will make a point that is missed by some people.  Once a person is appointed as a High Court judge, however he or she got there, be that person a barrister or a solicitor, he or she is entitled to serve on the Supreme Court when asked by the Chief Justice.  That person is entitled to serve on the Court of Appeal.  He or she is eligible to act up and to serve on those bodies.</p><p> What is the purpose of an interview in this context?  What kinds of questions could be asked?  The independence of the Judiciary is lurking in the back of my mind.  Are the laypeople on the commission going to ask whether Michael McDowell is a conservative on the pro-life issue and ask me questions to bring this out before I get onto the Court of Appeal?  Is that what they are going to do?  There is a real problem here.  I will leave it at that.</p><p> Obviously, the two professional body witnesses have an interest in this selection of a tame barrister or tame solicitor.  There is, however, this wider systemic issue of the composition of the commission and having a rotating person, and whether the commission is really a body corporate if its composition changes depending on the afternoon's business.</p><p> Supposing there are three vacancies in the District Court, four in the Circuit Court and one in the High Court, who is the commission at any given time?  Head 9 seems to me to be very strange in the way it approaches that.  I will start off by asking the two professional body witnesses what their attitude is to having one of their members selected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.758" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Keane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2021051800002#G00200"><p>I thank Senator McDowell.  On that point, we are obviously concerned about the exclusion, after 25 years of faithful service to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, to get sent outside the door on the proposed Judicial Appointments Commission.  We hope that will not stay as part of the new Bill.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's question about the tame solicitor and tame barrister, my reading of Head 9 is that because of subsection (3), it is actually a judge who was previously a solicitor or a judge who was previously a barrister.  It is, therefore, two members of the Judicial Council, one of whom in a previous life was a solicitor and one of whom was a barrister.</p> <p>  To our reading, that is even worse because it could well have been a long time since they practised in either branch of the legal profession.  If they are going to be elected as Judicial Council members who can substitute for the Chief Justice, for example, if the Chief Justice is not available, they are likely to be very senior Judicial Council members and, therefore, even more at a distance in terms of years from the practising professions.  We do not like it either but we do not like it for a different reason.</p> <p>  We do not embrace the reduction in numbers to nine if it means the representatives of the practising professions are excluded.  We also believe if it is to stay at four judicial members, that maybe the four judicial nominees should come from courts of local or limited jurisdiction.  We also do not like the suggestion that there are equal legal and lay numbers because there are not.  There are equal judicial and lay numbers on the proposed commission as it stands.</p></speech>

I thought Head 9(3) was to say that the barrister or solicitor it chose had to be qualified to have been a judge at the time of appointment, in other words, to have ten years' practice.  I agree with Ms Keane that it is loosely worded.  It could carry the meaning that she is supposing-----</p></speech>

We have addressed it in our submission.  If it is referring to standing as a judge at the time of appointment then that person is a judge.

We thought perhaps it was an attempted standard operating procedure, SOP, to our removal that at least one of the judges would have once been a solicitor in a previous life.  We do not like it one bit, however.</p></speech>

I agree entirely with that.  As stated in our previous submissions and as I said at the start, there is no inclusion of the Chair of the Bar of Ireland or the President of the Law Society of Ireland.  Our reading is that it is not a tame barrister and a tame solicitor but a tame judge who was a barrister and a tame judge who was a solicitor.  That is what is meant by subsection (3) as to the two appointments by the Judicial Council.</p><p>The equality of arms the commission seeks means there will be X number of judges and X number of laypersons without any input whatsoever from the two professions that have to appear in front of judges and that are aware of practice and procedure and so on.  We do not even get a tame barrister or solicitor, if there is such a thing.</p></speech>

I will not be too unfair but the process was strange because this provision was not referred to in the explanatory memorandum to the pensions Bill in question.  This effectively means that, if someone has not been appointed by the age of 50, he or she cannot get a full pension.  It must dampen people's willingness to become judges if they have effectively have to begin mobilising at the age of 48 to put themselves forward.  There is an big issue there in respect of experience.</p></speech>

I recall a president of the District Court telling me that, when he was on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, he would always listen very carefully to the Law Society representative because he or she would know whether the applicants had blotted their copybooks in any way.  What he was really saying was that this representative knew exactly what was going on in the profession at any given time and that he or she had a contemporary insight into practitioners and the conduct of practices, which is extremely important and telling in respect of judicial experience.</p></speech>

I will address the points he has raised.  On the matter of pensions, there is an additional problem in respect of the taxation burden on past pension provision because of the accelerated accumulation under the scheme that was drawn up.  I do not know if that issue has been resolved but it should be examined as a matter of urgency if it has not because I have heard of it causing problems.<br/><br/>I agree with his point on the rotation of membership.  When the final text is revealed, careful consideration should be given to whether there would be any problem with the group acting as a unit because of that rotating member.  That is absolutely worth looking at.<br/><br/>The second point, on the comparative question, has been addressed but it would be unusual not to have some sort of representation from the professions.  This sort of indirect representation by way of a judicial member is unusual in the context of the schemes of which I am aware.  It is a question of ensuring that any representation of the professions is used appropriately.  There is a risk that members of some eminence such as our colleagues here, who are chairs of their respective professional bodies, might bring such a degree of extra process knowledge to the table that transparency issues could be created.  While the very detailed knowledge the head of a particular body might have about people's backgrounds is very valuable, we have to make sure that does not turn the process into something else.  It should be a matter of an application being made and a process being followed in which all members can participate rather than some members bringing to the table knowledge that is entirely extraneous to that process, which was not gathered through the process and which is not transparent in the process.  Professional representation is important but perhaps it should be a member chosen by the head of the respective professional body rather than the head himself or herself.  That could be a good compromise.<br/><br/>On the Senator's final point, which had regard to questions in interviews, this is a challenge.  It is a challenge to decide what one can ask a judicial candidate to determine merit, temperament and so on.  There are questions that can be asked that are common in general interview practice.  For example, candidates can be asked to tell the board about a time they encountered a given situation.  From their answers, one can try to draw out the various <i>desiderata</i>of merit.  This is seen in the appointments process in England and Wales, for example.  The reason it is important to try to include candidates for judicial promotion within the same process is that we have seen the problems that arise when there is a parallel process for people who have applied, formally or informally, for promotion.  If one ends up with a parallel process in which applicants are treated differently, it can result in either set of candidates being treated unfairly or not being given the same fair and equal consideration based on the same factors.  There is a challenge to be faced in determining what can be asked in a judicial interview without getting into questions of judicial ideology, which none of us wishes to see being central in the process.  General emotional intelligence interview-style questioning provides some questions that could be asked which would be relevant to all candidates.</p></speech>

From the perspective of the profession, when a practitioner, either a solicitor or a barrister, applies to Government for patents of precedence to become a senior counsel solicitor or senior counsel barrister, the latter additionally being a member of the inner Bar, he or she seeks a recommendation from the legal services regulatory advisory committee.  Both the Bar Council and the Law Society are represented on this committee.  They are on this committee precisely because they are able to explain the applicants' experience, temperament and so on.  The corollary is not applied in this particular Bill, which we find illogical in the circumstances.  I just wanted to add that.</p></speech>

As I was saying, the Judiciary in this State has served us well.  This may be a philosophical question or observation but, if the Judiciary has served us well, then the manner in which judges are appointed, which has evolved substantially and which will evolve further, cannot be all bad.  It appears to me that an attempt is being made to reduce the influence of elected representatives and Government in the appointment of the Judiciary and, in so doing, to cede to others including, in many respects, vested interests greater influence over the appointment of the Judiciary.  It is a point worth making.  It is also worth asking whether our guests accept that we have been served well by our Judiciary.</p> <p>  There is much talk about the requirement for diversity.  The legal profession is not exactly a bastion of diversity.  I do not want to go down the road of saying it is male, pale and stale, but it certainly might be pale and stale.  While we have moved far beyond the requirement for diversity in terms of gender balance, there is a far greater challenge in reflecting the diversity of the modern Ireland of today, a challenge we need to embrace.</p><p>Is the legal service fit for purpose to lecture us on diversity given that the professional is not exactly a bastion of diversity?  I acknowledge the Vice Chairman's expertise and academic publications in this area.</p></speech>

What the Deputy said is interesting.  Head 44, relating to the discretion that the Government of the day will have, is at the heart of this legislative reform.  Dr. Cahillane made this point at the outset.  The commission recommends five names and Government then has discretion - one might say absolute discretion.  We do not want the committee to have the impression - it is interesting that Deputy Creed may have this impression - that we favour an absolutely technocratic model.  We do not.  Dr. O'Brien, another academic, certainly does not favour an absolutely rigidly technocratic model and neither do we.<br/><br/>This is the critical point.  Along with some other members of this committee, Deputy Creed is not a lawyer and he may sometimes feel he can get bamboozled and so on.  This is really simple.  Under the old system, the JAAB recommended seven names and Government had absolute discretion.  Under the new system, the Judicial Appointments Commission recommends five names and the Government has absolute discretion.  I am confident my colleagues will agree with me when I say that the Constitution requires political discretion, Government discretion.  Even as a matter of public policy, for reasons relating to what Dr. O'Brien said, political discretion is valuable.<br/><br/>As Deputy Creed stated, this approach has served us reasonably well over the years.  Patronage or even the perception of patronage is important.  What also matters is merit over time.  Ultimately, we are saying that instead of recommending five names, three should be recommended.  In addition, we are saying that the names should be ranked 3, 2, 1 or if necessary 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  We are also saying, I think this is the key point, that the Government of the day should have unrestrained discretion to appoint anyone from among the top three names.  We feel there are good public policy reasons for that, never mind the Constitution.<br/><br/>The Judiciary should reflect whoever is in government for 25 of the next 40 years.  If there is an absolutely rigidly technocratic model in place for the next 25 or 30 years, it will not reflect that.  We are saying that it should be three names, with absolute discretion.  If the Government wants to choose a person who is not on the list, which may happen, that is fine but it should make a statement in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>to that effect.  We appreciate that this is a practical constraint; it is not a legal or constitutional constraint.  We acknowledge that it is a political constraint but there are good reasons for having that constraint.  We believe there ought to be absolute discretion with respect to the best three candidates.<br/><br/>Obviously, I heartily agree with what Dr. Cahillane and others have said about having an interview process.  As outlined in my first statement, I acknowledge Senator McDowell's concerns about that.  Of course, this needs to be thought through.  We need to remember that head 44 is the key provision.  It would be an insignificant shift if we end up with the Government choosing from five as opposed to choosing from the seven.  If that is what we get, it will represent a failure.</p></speech>

I have consistently disagreed with Dr. Hickey on that point, as he knows.  I have also consistently disagreed on the issue of ranking.  It is interesting that a tension between who decides and the level of political discretion is emerging in this conversation.  Also in this conversation, there is a leaning towards pulling it away from politics because politics is bad, it does not have a role and it could not be trusted to perform that role if it had it.  The proposal seems to be to hand responsibility over almost entirely to a judicially dominated model, which we know from international experience can contribute to judicial self-replication.</p> <p>  Michael Kirby, the great High Court judge and the first openly gay judge in Australia, said he would never have been appointed by his peers because they were too conservative.  It took bravery, forward thinking or just being ahead of politics to enable his appointment.</p> <p>  This tension flares up every few years in different jurisdictions in the context of what the right balance is and proposals to take politics out of it.  However, the discretion in politics has engendered diversity and a measure of accountability.  As Dr. Hickey knows, they were not recommending seven names.  They were recommending considerably more names than that until about 2014 or 2015 when it was reduced to seven, as the legislation had prescribed and, indeed, they had the power to reduce fewer or more than that.  It is very interesting to hear this tension.</p> <p>  It is not a reduction from seven to five.  Typically, there would be approximately 150 applications for the District Court.  The reduction in discretion is from 150 to five, which is a very considerable reduction in discretion.  Therefore, it is not from seven to five; it is from 150 to five in real terms.  Dr. Hickey has made the point about the unconstitutionality of ranking.  Many people from various universities have disagreed with him on that point.  I do not take it as a given in any sense.  It has been disagreed with for many years that it is an unconstitutional restriction.  The reason for all that is that the indirect involvement of politics provides a cover of legitimacy for the appointment of judges who have no other connection with the electorate and no other connection with the people, whom their decisions directly affect in the very core of their lives.</p> <p>  Dr. Kenny, Dr. Cahillane and I had this conversation in 2016 and we will have it again.  It would always be about this tension between politics and judicial self-replication.  It is interesting to note the very strong comments of those from the professions who know the practitioners who are likely to become judges.</p></speech>

In answer to Deputy Creed's question, as the first woman in 41 years to lead the Bar of Ireland, I am more than conscious of how the bar is perceived.  I apologise to Senator McDowell and anybody else here who is from the Bar of Ireland.  It is perceived as old, stale, grey, cigar smoking and claret drinking.  I have drunk a few glasses of claret in my time.  However, we are endeavouring to change not just the perception of the bar but what the bar is.</p> <p>  I have no connection with the law.  I come from Leitrim.  I have had to fight for everything I have here at the Bar and I encourage everyone, male and female, to do that.  Do I believe that Ruth Bader Ginsburg was correct when she was asked how many women she wanted on the Supreme Court?  Her answer was that all of them should be women.  Do I believe that?  Yes, I do.  I would say that would be diversity and progress.  However, if we can get 50% of our membership to reflect what society looks like, that would be an achievement.  The same applies for solicitors.  We need to do it across every profession - doctors, nurses, teachers and politicians.  It must reflect society.  We are aiming for that and we are doing so through educational processes.</p> <p>  We have the Denham fellowship, scholarships for people from DEIS schools.  We have our transition year programme, where this year instead of 100 pupils looking at what the bar might offer as a career, when it went online we had over 10,000 pupils, many from my own county and other areas in the west of Ireland.  I was delighted with the number of people who viewed what we have to offer.  Therefore, we are aiming for diversity and there is a change.  This is the first year at the Bar of Ireland that 50% of our intake were women and 50% men.  We are getting there, but it takes time.  It will not change overnight, but we are getting there.  We are progressive in our thinking and we are aiming for diversity across all sections.  Race, colour, creed or religion should not matter.</p><p>One of the other contributions to diversity is made by solicitors, who represent a very broad geographic spread, which is most important.  In respect of the concerns about judicial self-replication, by favouring judges on this board and then allowing them to appoint three ranked candidates, we are almost certainly going to contribute to judicial self-replication.</p><p> I believe Senator Martin is next.</p></speech>

It is good to see her today.  We soldiered together for many years on the northern circuit.  We were called to the inner Bar on the same day.  She has described one of the big challenges facing us, namely, the extent to which the area that we are trying to diversify is itself diverse.   It is not diversified in the first instance.  Not everyone can be a judge.  Judges are chosen from the ranks of solicitors, barristers or perhaps academics.  We must ask how diversified that group is in the first instance, apart from the obvious categories of diversity.</p> <p>  I am glad to hear that Ms McNally is making strides with her work, but what about the representation among barristers and solicitors of those who attended non-private schools, or state schools, as they are called in England?  A short generation ago, the vast majority of those in the High Court came from a few schools in Ireland.  Until we address the issue at a more fundamental level, we are just tinkering with it.  The actual raw material is not there to achieve the diversification that Ms McNally is trying to achieve.  However, I commend her on the work she is doing.</p> <p>  Ms McNally stated that she would like a candidate to have experience in a court of limited or local jurisdiction, and to paraphrase her, if such a candidate has not worked as a barrister in those courts for 20 years, he or she will be out of touch with practice and procedure.  However, that may close the door on senior lawyers- for example, senior counsels - coming down to enrich the Circuit Court, because they have not put a foot in the door for a number of years but did their time a while ago.  Indeed, it has been a long time since we had a senior counsel appointed to the District Court.  I believe the last appointment might have been that of Judge Desmond Zaidan, which is perhaps over 20 years ago.  Those appointments are for prestigious positions that should be sought after.  However, the appointment of senior lawyers to courts of limited or local jurisdiction does not happen at the moment.</p> <p>  I would like to hear the views of the academics on having a greater level of attrition.  Apart from some noted exceptions, a judge does not normally move from the District Court to the Circuit Court to the High Court.  Is that a good thing?  Should it not be an incentivised attraction of appointment or is it a distraction for the judge in how he or she performs his or her duties?  Has any work been done on levels of attrition?  Would the academic witnesses be in favour of increased levels of attrition?</p> <p>  In respect of the superior courts, I am not saying there should be positive discrimination, but a candidate who has jury trial advocacy experience is very well positioned to hit the ground running and go into the Central Criminal Court for a trial on day 1.  I believe a candidate who has never addressed a jury is at a disadvantage unless intensive training is provided although I am not saying it cannot be done.  I take Ms Keane's point about academics.  I believe they can enrich the court.  Indeed, solicitors have enriched the court.  The appointments of Mr. Justice Michael Peart and Mr Justice O'Donnell were fantastic.  I believe they were the first solicitors to be appointed.  I would be more in favour of academics in the divisional courts, be it in the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court, where perhaps they will not be found wanting in the experience of the cross-examination of witnesses of advocacy because that does not normally happen in those courts.  I would like to hear the academics on that.</p> <p>  Finally, I do not support the decision made by the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, in respect of the pension.  It is not a reality for some solicitors and barristers to take the plunge at the age of 50 to get the most out of that pension, which was a very attractive pension.  It meant that we had great quality on the bench.  If solicitors and barristers do not go at 50, they are not incentivised to go at 55 since the pension years were increased.  Perhaps the learned chair of the Bar Association would know if there is any talk or speculation about increasing the age of retirement.  We have lost some good judges.  I am thinking about the last month.  Mr. Justice McKechnie was in his prime and he has retired.  The late Mr. Justice Kearney was a super judge and was a reluctant retiree.  He was still in the full fettle of his mental and physical health at the time of his retirement.  We lost him a few years early because judges had to retire for that reason.  Is there talk or speculation of the retirement age in all the jursidictions increasing to 72 or 73 years of age?</p></speech>

In terms of the promotion up the ranks, we have had a number of judges who have been promoted, including, notably, Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness who began at the Circuit Court and ended up at the Supreme Court.  It raises a broader question of whether there should be something of a professional track, without going into the idea of professionalised judging as we see in civil law systems on the Continent.  There might be something to be said for trying to have more movement within the different ranks of the Judiciary and to try and encourage that with ongoing judicial education perhaps.  This goes to the broader point about training.  While I agree with the Senator's point that the greatest role perhaps for academic appointments exists at the appellate level, that is proven to be the case across common law jurisdictions of our peers in this respect.  There is also something to be said for having an intensive programme of training to get people ready to walk into a trial court and to oversee it.  If we do not have that, we will forever and perpetually only appoint litigators to be judges in those courts.  If we recognise, as has been said several times, that the solicitors' profession may hold a great opportunity for finding some more diverse candidates because it is larger and has more routes to entry, then that is something that have to look at.  Not all solicitors will have engaged extensively in advocacy at the particular level or done a lot of courtroom work themselves.  That may change, but it also may not.  We may actually benefit from people having different backgrounds in regulatory law and other bodies of law in various judicial roles who do not yet have experience running a courtroom.  That is something that we can provide.  It would be an intensive training exercise, but it can be done and we should look into it as a matter of urgency in respect of the judicial council and its education programme that it will be setting up shortly.</p></speech>

There seems to be a theme developing on a point with which we do not agree.  That is the suggestion that is made that in order to be eligible for appointment to a particular court, there should be some statutory nexus between the candidate's experience before that court and eligibility for for appointment.</p> <p>  It is a multi-step process.  The first hurdle is eligibility.  After that comes the criteria that must be met on a basis of merit for appointment to any and every court in the land.  In actual fact, in our submission we have called for the removal of the anomaly that is in Head 21 B(1), which applies to the superior courts rather than its extension to the courts of local and limited jurisdiction, as suggested by the Bar.  We would like eligibility to be harmonised across all courts, but not by extending a restriction, rather by removing it.  Once people are eligible and get across the line and the more solicitors, academics and barristers that are eligible, then there is a much broader and more diverse pool from which they can be drawn.  By its nature it will be more diverse if more people are eligible.  That will increase diversity in respect of geography, gender, sexual orientation and everything that exists across all walks of life, whether it is the Bar, solicitors or the academic world.</p> <p>  Another point I would make is that it is all very well talking about diversity - and diversity in eligibility - but there must also be diversity in appointment.</p><p>Solicitors have been eligible for appointment to the superior courts since 2002 but the percentages are appalling.  We have not crunched the recent numbers but we crunched numbers for the last scheme.  Between 2002 and 2016, solicitors were eligible for appointment to all of the courts.  There were 90 appointments to the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court, that is, the superior courts, eight of whom were solicitors.  We can have all the diversity we want in eligibility but people are not actually being appointed.  There is a phrase which I love, which is that diversity is being invited to the party but inclusion is being asked to dance.  We would like diversity and inclusion, please.  We would like to see more solicitors being asked to dance, and we would like to see more people of different backgrounds being asked to dance, and it being reflective of society.  That is how we feel on diversity and inclusion because, nowadays, one is no good without the other. </p></speech>

I was actually in court and it took a little bit of time to get across the city.  I was listening in the car on the way over and I have been following what is being discussed.</p> <p>  I want to raise a couple of issues.  I will start with the last point in respect of diversity.  I was delighted to hear what Ms McNally said on behalf of the Bar because I was a little bit involved when I was in the council of King's Inns and we set up the Denham fellowship.  There are two things about that.  First, both the Law Society and the Bar Council would cut off their left arm to have more diversity, and they are doing everything they can to achieve it.  The reality is that, if we compare the legal professions to others like medicine or engineering, the skills or qualifications are not as transferable internationally, so it is much more difficult to attract people in from internationally than it is in other professions.  If someone is building a bridge in Galway or in Santiago de Chile, it is the same skill set and the only thing different is the language.  It is much harder to introduce diversity into the legal professions because they are very national-specific.  That diversity is coming as Ireland itself becomes more diverse, and the populations of the two professions are reflecting that, but it takes time for those people to come up through the system.  We cannot have somebody who is a newly qualified solicitor or newly qualified barrister occupying a judicial position.  We all know that is not going to work as there is formation and experience involved.  It is important to recognise that both professions are working very hard to increase diversity and, in the lower ranks of the professions, the results are clear to see.</p> <p>  The other group that is very strong on diversity is governments.  I agree with what the Vice Chairman said earlier about the importance of, if not political input into judicial appointments, democratic input into judicial appointments.  As other speakers have said, the reality is we are appointing a person for his or her working life, often for 20 or more years, although probably not often enough, and I agree with what Senator McDowell said about the changes in the benching regimes having locked many people out of judicial office in real terms.  Nonetheless, governments are the will of the people in terms of judicial appointments.  When appointing a person into a branch of government for a long time, where they are largely unimpeachable - or if not quite unimpeachable, we know they are largely untouchable by the other branches of government - it is very important we have some democratic influence in that decision-making process.  The way that happens is through the political process and through appointment by the Government as another branch of government.</p> <p>  I absolutely understand what the academics in particular have said about this and the misgivings they might have.  However, I would be concerned about the narrative that is abroad that, in some respects, all judges are political cronies.  I know academics are not suggesting this but some politicians are suggesting it.  There is a concern that people only get appointed to judicial office if they are involved in a political party.  Of course, as the academics or anybody who has looked at this will know, there is a raft of very senior judicial figures who have never been involved.  Mr. Justice Peter Kelly is the obvious example of a man who always eschewed any kind of politics and became one of the highest judicial officers in the State in recent years.  It is important to challenge that narrative and to remind people just how many people are appointed to judicial office by party-political Governments but who have no involvement either in party politics or in the parties who are in power.  It is a very important thing to say.</p> <p>  On that point, I want to agree with the Vice Chairman in respect of the proposals in this Bill.  I do not agree with the academic position that we should again reduce the discretion with which the Government should operate, that is very important.</p> <p>  There is a point I would like to put to the professions.  I accept the solicitors' profession is more diverse and I believe the reason for that is that it is a more stable profession.  To become a solicitor is to become an employee, in the first instance, and to have one's way through the Law Society paid for by the employer and to enter into employment, ideally, after qualifying as a solicitor.  The role of a barrister is akin to a person who is self-employed from the word go.</p> <p>  I do not come from a legal background.  I always joke that the last lawyer in my family was Daniel O'Connell, and I can assure people he had no influence on any work I ever got but he is there somewhere in the background.  I am the first person in my family to go to university and I became a barrister.  I worked full-time when I was in King&rsquo;s Inns for three years.  I put myself through and then I went down to the Bar, having worked for two years and having built up, I suppose, a fund to help me through my first years.  However, one is a self-employed person.  In the same way that it is difficult to set up a business and there is risk associated with it, that is true of the Bar.  For that reason, there is necessarily greater diversity in the solicitors&rsquo; profession.</p> <p>  However, when it comes to the judicial role, and Senator Martin touched on this, it is important to acknowledge the reality that not all lawyers are courtroom lawyers.  I have many friends in big commercial firms who have never been inside a courtroom, except when they were in the Law Society or whatever it was.  This is what I want to ask the professional bodies.  I do not agree with the notion that a person who is a highly qualified, highly specialised, highly expert lawyer would necessarily be a good judge if that person does not have the litigation experience that is necessary.  Some of the most expert lawyers in the State do not go to court because they are experts in their field and maybe there is not a litigation side to it, or maybe it does not pay them to go to court, or whatever it might be.  I wonder if account is to be taken of the fact judges are an extension of that litigation role and they must have experience of that litigation role to function properly.  We have seen, in all courts, judges who may have less experience in that regard struggling, certainly in the initial years, when they are appointed to judicial office.  I wonder if the professions have a view on whether that, therefore, reflects what Ms Keane was saying on the disparity between the number of barristers and the number of solicitors appointed as judges.  Does it account for that?  Is it reasonable?  Is it something they think needs to change or do they think that where we are at the moment is the right balance?  What should we be doing to change it?</p></speech>

I suppose it is back to what I was saying earlier.  We believe this is a multi-step process and, for eligibility purposes, we do not believe that people should be able to display a certain number of years of experience.  We particularly do not agree that it should be before the court to which they are applying.  It is because there is no good reason for that.  The skills and the qualifications needed in a good judge are not just about the capacity to be able to research case law and argue in court.</p><p>Of course, it is fine to have more experience and skills but much of it is to do with personal qualities, such as being a good listener.  As for this thing of advocacy or nothing, most judges say very little.  Why is having years of experience of saying an awful lot of some great benefit when sitting on a bench from which he or she is supposed to listen, neutrally, about both sides of an argument and look at the cases put before him or her?</p><p> Nobody likes some judges who are too interventionist and forget they have left the Bar or the solicitor's profession behind and are now in a different role.  There are many characteristics society should want in a good judge which have nothing to do with standing on one's hind legs in a court.  That is our view.</p></speech>

When one is sitting on a bench listening to arguments being made, one has to understand the parameters of what is allowed.  Is it hearsay?  Are the questions leading?  Is it within the rules of evidence?  Is it allowed on a regulatory basis?  Is it defamatory?  Various questions must be understood by the person who is listening to an argument.</p> <p>  It is similar to managing a football team.  One can have as many selectors as one wants but the person who makes the decision about who the best players are, is the manager.  I would rather have the manager making the decisions than all of the selectors coming together trying to make a singular decision, when it comes to a determination in court.</p> <p>  Head 40 provides for knowledge of the practice and procedures in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal and the High Court.  That is a necessity.  If one will have a brain surgery, one wants the surgeon who has experience in brain surgery carrying out the surgery.  It is as simple as that.</p> <p>  To go back to other points raised earlier, about the access to the professions, I wanted to mention the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, LSRA, is doing a study and has invited submissions from both the Law Society-----</p></speech>

It is quite interesting.  Senator McDowell spoke about interview questions and entitlement.  One of the first questions should be on whether he or she feels entitled to this position.  Does he or she know what clarion is?  Does he or she know what a smoking jacket is?  Then he or she should be automatically excluded from the rest of the process.</p> <p>  On diversity, I think it is interesting.  My question is on the conversation which was just happening between Ms Keane and Ms McNally.  I have been working closely with the Bar Council and its equality and diversity committee on looking at the blockages at every point.  It goes back to what Senator Martin was saying on whether we had the diversity material to meet the eligibility.  We have been looking at that right through and have carried out a large amount of research.</p> <p>  There are so many blocks and barriers to people progressing, right down to being able to attend dinners, social events and everything that comes with that on a cultural level and how one is excluded if one cannot participate at that level, such as if one is a single mother.  All these different things are coming up.  The solicitor one is interesting because it automatically increases the pool and will have a knock-on effect on diversity.</p> <p>  How would Ms Keane address that in this legislation, if it were to be addressed?  Has she thought about how this Bill could reflect that?</p></speech>

I also referred to the one in head 21(b) whereby if one has not stood in a particular court and shown one's wares over a considerable period of time, one should be automatically not allowed to apply for appointment.</p> <p>  The real detail on this will be done by the procedures committee.  We are only talking here to a general scheme, which is high level, but in that it is indicated there will be a procedures committee.  We would like to see a bit more diversity in who would sit on the procedures committee.  If one does not have representatives of the practising professions on the commission, does that mean they will not be on the procedures committee?</p> <p>  I am chair of another board and we have external members on our committees.  I know the procedures committee of this new commission will have some lay members, but it may be a good idea for it to have external members for the purposes of drawing up its procedures and criteria and identifying where the balance should be between the legal qualifications and the personal attributes or skills, or maybe there should be some sort of diversity requirement.  It would be great to see that more people being involved in the procedures committee, besides the judicial and lay members who are appointed to the overall commission.</p></speech>

I wanted to make it clear our submission is not recommending political discretion be reduced.  I am sure the proposals we have made do not reduce political discretion in any way.  We see the value of that democratic input.  What we are trying to say is the Government's choice in terms of the candidates should be guided by professional selection procedures, which are carried on at the JAC level.  The importance of interview, role plays and everything else which happens beforehand would culminate in a recommendation to Government with three names ranked, in order to demonstrate one candidate has demonstrated a particular competence or has shown himself or herself to be a better candidate than another.</p> <p>  At that stage, the Government should have full discretion to choose from that list or from outside of it, if that is its choice.  Certainly, it is not reducing governmental discretion.  We want to be clear this whole point is about fairness for judicial candidates and, for example, the judges' submission made in 2014 made the point that our great reputation in terms of Irish judges is in spite of, not because of, the appointments process we have.  There are a great many potential candidates who were never appointed, because of our current system.</p></speech>

The 2014 submission never reflected their own role in having deviated from the legislative process and substantially increased the political discretion, so I will set that one aside.  Reducing the number of names and ranking them necessarily reduces political discretion.  We need is more qualitative information coming from the JAAB or the JAC.  That is absolutely true.  The processes by which that is garnered are important.</p> <p>  What Senator Ruane is saying about diversity is so important.  Ms Keane has identified a couple of things in terms of removing restrictions.  We have seen concern about it becoming too judicial at every stage.  I dare say the role of politics has an influence on diversity.  In terms of the procedures committee, it goes back to what Senator Ruane says about being available to go to dinners, conferences or whatever it happens to be.  It is the being known phenomenon, that is, "Do you know Jennifer?  Yes, I know Jennifer, she is grand."  It is a phenomenon of self-replicating networks which contribute to being visible and known to decision makers and which not offset by the procedures of the JAAB or the JAC.  How does one deal with that?  How does that prejudice somebody practising in County Kerry over County Dublin, for example?</p> <p>  I am conscious Dr. O'Brien has not had an opportunity to contribute.</p></speech>

That is not to disparage anything the representatives of the professions have said.</p><p>These are different issues and it is possible to have a more diverse Judiciary without waiting, as a former judge of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom called Jonathan Sumption said, when he indicated it would take 50 years to wait for gender diversity.  We do not have to do that.  We can have separate conversations and judicial diversity.  Without wishing to disparage what anyone else has said, these do not all have to be part of the same conversation.</p></speech>

I look after social policy for IBEC, Ireland&rsquo;s largest business representative and lobbying group, and I am here with my colleague Ms Meadhbh Costello.</p> <p>  The significant employment gap between the Traveller community and other groups within the population has been well documented.  It is a gap that has persisted regardless of periods of economic prosperity or recession.  Covid-19 and its impact on care, construction, and service occupations, which Census 2016 data suggests many Traveller men and women work, will compound this employment situation further.  The reasons for this employment gap are complex with multilayered challenges contributing to the stark figures.  Research suggests low levels of educational attainment, disincentives built into the social welfare system, inappropriate activation supports and discrimination while job seeking among these challenges.  However, these barriers to work seem to have their roots in systemic societal prejudice and exclusion of generations of the Traveller community, which have resulted in low confidence for action and support in achieving employment goals.  As such, a structured whole-of-society approach with tailored interventions will be required to address the multifaceted issues and repair the damage done with collaboration from all stakeholders, including business.  While my submission to the committee has greater detail, I will touch on some key areas IBEC believes are impacting the situation and where there might be scope for change.</p> <p>  Travellers have been omitted from Government activation or employment strategies, like the Pathways to Work 2016-2020 strategy or, if featured, the strategy lacks detailed targets, timelines and owners to ensure they are achieved resulting in the Traveller community often being invisible in labour market policy.  In the wake of Covid-19, and as labour market activation measures are engaged to support people back into employment, it is essential that the Traveller community is named in these activation and employment strategies to ensure it does fall further from the labour market in the recovery.  Given the significant levels of Traveller unemployment, as well as including Travellers in such policies, further targeted supports may be required.  It is essential that Intreo addresses these needs and that there are specific actions and approaches to increase Traveller engagement.  Using the adage &ldquo;nothing about us without us&rdquo; it is also important that these supports are properly researched, funded and developed in collaboration with Traveller organisations.</p> <p>  In general, the Traveller community has been seen to have lower levels of education than the population at large, which can hamper access to employment.  As such, a fully integrated approach to education and training, apprenticeships and pathways to employment, needs to be formulated in line with various Government strategies.  Removal of the challenges within education for members of the Traveller community would also be key, as many report instances of discrimination or harassment, or having to hide their identity for fear of same.  Employer involvement in the content of work-ready programmes offered by Traveller and partnership organisations could also support the development of in-demand skills, and ensure that participants are kept as engaged with the labour market as possible through work experience and placement opportunities.  The Traveller graduate network currently being created by Travellers for Travellers has the potential to provide peer support, role models and mentors for young Travellers coming through second and third level education and making the transition into employment.  This needs to be supported by Government and employers to ensure its success.</p> <p>  The experience and perception of prejudice and discrimination towards Travellers in education, training and employment is a significant barrier which will require intensive work to mend relationships, address stereotypes and debunk these beliefs if real participation is to be achieved.  We have seen the impact the use of personal stories can have in other marginalised groups in breaking down assumptions and stereotypes, and cultivating empathy and compassion.  Therefore, opportunities to portray Travellers, their cultural heritage and the roles they play in Irish society, including in the workplace, should be taken to change the narrative and address unconscious bias and prejudice.  This can be included in the media, teacher training, the education curriculum in schools, as well as part of diversity and awareness training in organisations.</p> <p>  Tackling discrimination against Travellers in the workplace should be supported by a wider public awareness and anti-racism campaign which specifically addresses anti-Traveller racism.  This would be particularly valuable to address racism against employees in public-facing occupations and the creation of workplaces where a person can feel safe and respected in bringing his or her whole self to work.  Such a campaign should be considered as part of Ireland&rsquo;s upcoming national action plan against racism.</p> <p>  For many employers, the Traveller community is an unknown entity and, as such, this may result in a failure to encourage participation.  An awareness campaign to educate employers and showcase some of the successful case studies around the country in social work, recycling, caring and landscaping, to name but a few initiatives, may help to influence employers to actively engage with this often talented and skilled untapped pool of labour.  The work done in 2006 with the integrated workplace initiative co-ordinated by the Equality Authority, and supported by trade unions and employers, could be revisited to encourage the valuing of all cultures and ethnicities, and the creation of truly integrated workplaces.  A successful initiative under way to support people with disabilities into work and provide an employer disability information service called Employers for Change is currently being run by Open Doors.  This initiative offers employers information, advice and support to enable them to confidently recruit and retain people with disabilities.  A similar model could be undertaken for the Traveller community and employers.</p> <p>  Opportunities for work experience or internship programmes should also be considered, possibly through the Open Doors initiative or a bespoke collaboration between employers and Traveller organisations.  This would equip Travellers with the necessary experience that is sometimes lacking, offer mentoring, build their networks and smooth their transition into the workplace.  This would require commitment and co-operation of a cross section of leaders, including members of both the Traveller and settled community, Government, Traveller groups and employers.</p> <p>  To be fully inclusive as a country, we must ensure that Traveller men and women are provided with the necessary supports, resources and services to enable them to fully realise their potential as active members of the Irish population.  As other commentators recently said, there have been a number of reports about the Traveller community over the years and now is the time for concerted action.  We have work to do to restore trust and belief within the Traveller community to expect success in education and employment, and work to ensure that we tackle racism and discrimination within those experiences that are hindering engagement.  Changing embedded and systemic issues will require a whole-of-society approach involving all stakeholders, and, when successful, will impact positively on individuals, organisations and Irish society.  I thank members of the joint committee for the opportunity to present IBEC&rsquo;s views on this issue.</p></speech>

Of course, this figure is quoted from prior to the pandemic, so we do not really know what impact that will have on the Traveller community.  Due to an absence of ethnic equality monitoring in the collection of employment data, the rate of unemployment among Travellers post Covid is not known at this stage.</p> <p>  As Government supports people back into employment post the pandemic, it is imperative there are positive action measures which ensure that Travellers, and other under-represented groups in the labour market, are not left behind.  We sent in a written submission earlier this year and it outlined a history of standing by and supporting Travellers and Traveller organisations in our movement.  I do not intend to go over that today because of time constraints.  We stated in our submission that, welcome as it is, the recognition of Traveller ethnicity alone will not deal with the 80% unemployment rate, a statistic underpinned by a range of issues affecting Traveller participation in the labour market.  Factors such as severe educational disadvantage, inequality and discrimination in the workplace all contribute to this situation.  It is clear that rights must follow, and that an institutionalised policy response is needed to address all of these issues.</p><p> We went on to outline the policy framework, including the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, and the shortcomings and limitations of the strategy, in respect of both its programme and targets relating to Traveller employment enterprise.  We have also participated in the St. Stephen's Green Trust Traveller enterprise and employment policy programme and believe the project has had a significant input in that the findings relating to employment are a lasting legacy for this work and include areas such as the need for national strategies underpinning growth, recovery, employment and enterprise to name Travellers as a target group; strong encouragement of the incorporation of the census question on ethnicity into the work of all statutory bodies; positive action measures to increase supports for Travellers into enterprise and employment; consultation with Traveller organisations, which is key to developing appropriate and accessible programmes; and the need for all measures to include monitoring, evaluation and learning frameworks which capture the impact on Travellers.  Positive action measures should also be gender-proofed in respect of Traveller women.  Lessons from the public sector duty and the diversity and inclusion strategy of the Public Appointments Service could be used to model changes being sought in the private sector.</p><p> We also believe investment in workplace integration can help to make our workplaces effective role models for wider society.  As Dr. McGann mentioned, in 2006, in the context of the national action plan on racism, we worked with the Equality Authority and other partners to develop the concept of the integrated workplace.  By that I mean workplaces that are free from discrimination and harassment; that are welcoming to all migrant workers and other black and minority ethnic groups, including Traveller employees and customers or service users; that acknowledge and provide for cultural and linguistic diversity among employees and customers as well as making adjustments for diversity among all employees; that take practical steps, including workplace anti-racism training, in order to achieve full equality in practice for all workers and employees; and that communicate a message promoting greater equality within the wider culturally diverse community served by the enterprise.  It is timely now that, along with IBEC and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, we are seeking to revive some of this work in the hope of contributing towards securing better employment outcomes for excluded groups, including Travellers.  Our general secretary, Patricia King, also participates in the anti-racism committee that will make recommendations to the Government later this year on how best to strengthen its approach to tackling racism.  The anti-racism committee's work will culminate in a new draft national action plan against racism for consideration by the Government.</p><p> As all this renewed focus comes about, it is worth mentioning - and I know the committee discussed this in its previous session - the publication of the research titled "Travellers in the Mainstream Labour Market: Situation, Experience, and Identity", which explores the experiences of Travellers who, despite the many barriers, have successfully negotiated a pathway into mainstream employment.  The research findings are in three areas, namely getting work-ready, getting into employment and experiences in development and progression while in work.  We read with interest the committee's engagement with two of the authors of the research, Rachel Mullen and Niall Crowley, at a previous session and note the barriers that were identified at that meeting, including people not being comfortable with being open about their ethnic identity in the workplace and not being afforded opportunities to progress as well as the fact that many felt this was directly because of their Traveller identity.</p><p> The research also reinforces the critical need for Travellers to be named in mainstream labour market policies and the fact that the key policy in this regard would be the new pathways to work strategy being developed in the Department of Social Protection.  Underpinning the policy strategy should be the more effective implementation of the public sector equality and human rights duty.  We also agree that systemic work experience programmes across the public sector that involve internships specifically targeting groups that are very distanced from the labour market would be very useful.  The last recommendation, involving the importance of guidance and supports for employers and trade unions, is an acknowledgment of our role to play in employment pathways for the Traveller community.  One of the key elements emerging from the research was the importance of workplace cultures that allowed people to reconcile work and family life, which is crucial for access, particularly for Traveller women but also, interestingly, for men in the Traveller community.  We have been working to ensure the effective transposition of the EU work-life balance directive, advocating for workers' rights to request flexible working arrangements and generally trying to make improvements in that area.  The personal accounts in the report will, it is hoped, inform the development of policy and actions to address the challenges experienced by Travellers.  We in the trade union movement will not be found wanting in continuing our work with the Traveller community to achieve better outcomes.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak.</p></speech>

The Travellers in Prison Initiative is a St. Stephen's Green Trust programme and is part-funded by the St. Stephen's Green Trust, the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service.  Its overall aim is to embed changes in policy and practice that will have a positive influence on Travellers in prison and their families and communities.</p> <p>  The committee has heard over past weeks about the stark unemployment situation for Travellers from others including the St. Stephen's Green Trust, Values Lab and the Galway Traveller Movement.  I will not go through those statistics today except to say that the chances of accessing employment are bleaker still for Travellers with a criminal record.  Today we want to focus on possible practical solutions to improve employment rates among Travellers.  I am particularly pleased to introduce Martin Ward from the Galway Traveller Movement, who manages Bounce Back Recycling, a social enterprise employing 16 Travellers.  Joanna Corcoran made a presentation on BBR to this committee recently, but Martin is here today to talk specifically about how this type of social enterprise could be scaled and replicated.</p> <p>  As many of you may be aware, Travellers are very over-represented in prison.  This over-representation is not unique to Ireland; there is the same trend among indigenous and minority ethnic groups in many other countries.  Hopefully I will have an opportunity at some other date to speak to the committee specifically on the issue of Travellers in prison, but today we are focusing on employment.  When I go into the prisons, the main questions I get asked by Travellers in prison are "Can you help me to make a living to support my family when I come out of prison?", "What can you do to help me get a job?" and "Where can I get help to get work?".  Unfortunately, there are some Travellers in prison for whom employment is not their priority due to other issues such as poor mental health, addiction, trauma, homelessness and other issues.  I really welcome the establishment of the Government task force to consider the mental health and addiction challenges of persons interacting with the criminal justice system, and we would welcome the opportunity to work with them.  In any case, in response to the requests from prisoners for help with employment, the Travellers in Prison Initiative looked at positive action measures in other jurisdictions to address this issue.  We soon realised doing this research that while we are talking about this from the perspective of Travellers with a criminal conviction, our recommendations apply to all Travellers and indeed also to other under-represented groups.</p> <p>  What do we mean by positive action?  When we talk about positive action, we are talking about things that employers, including State agencies and Government Departments, can do to increase Travellers employment in their workplace.  We have identified some key factors organisations need in planning and introducing positive action measures.  First, there needs to be leadership and senior management buy-in.  We need "senior champions" in organisations.  Organisations need to have an understanding of the issues for under-represented groups, and for this we recommend some cultural competency training, where people have opportunities to address their own unconscious biases.</p><p>There needs to be zero tolerance of discrimination and no place for derogatory language, stereotyping and so on.  We need a recruitment process that is simple and easy to navigate.  New employees need mentor support and support for promotion and progression in the workplace.  Internships must result in opportunities for permanent positions.  We have had pilot programmes over recent years but it now needs to be mainstreamed.  We have had enough pilots.</p><p> Mr. Ward recently spoke on the radio and referred to the fact that there are 400,000 people working in the public sector in Ireland.  He said that if even 0.1% of these employees were Travellers, we would have 400 Travellers working in the public sector.  Of course, if the public service was truly representative of the population of Ireland, the number of Travellers employed in the public sector would be much higher.  It is very disappointing to think that we have not even achieved this tiny percentage.</p><p> What needs to happen?  The Government needs to commit to a public sector that is representative of the population.  Any new public sector recruitment campaign must include provision for targeting Travellers.  We need a Government internship programme, similar to those in Australia, across all Departments and public bodies.  These should follow the good practices identified in our research and lead to proper jobs.  These programmes need to be led from central government.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should be the lead Department as issues of public sector reform fall within its remit.  This matter also directly relates to one of the pillars of the Department's policy, Our Public Service 2020.  </p><p> Local and national Traveller organisations need to be resourced to support Government agencies in undertaking these positive action initiatives.  These organisations are well-placed to assist Travellers in taking part in these programmes.  It is also really important that criminal convictions do not automatically exclude people from recruitment opportunities.</p><p> We know that the public sector is only part of the solution.  We must also support Travellers' access to employment in the private sector, the social enterprise sector and to self-employment.  We welcome initiatives and strategies such as the Irish Prison Service and the Probation Service's strategy, Working to Change, which aim to help ex-prisoners access employment.  Our recommendations include doing a lot more so that Travellers in custody who are preparing for release are job-ready on release.  With regard to social enterprise, Bounce Bank Recycling provides an excellent model for good practice.  We need to build on this model to support the development of social enterprises for Travellers.</p><p> We need to be ambitious.  We cannot be having these conversations again in five years' time.  Now is the time.  The solutions are there and the benefits will be felt by this generation and future generations.</p></speech>

The recommendations are very clear.  Anything is possible if the will is there to roll out the recommendations which have been put forward.  We have showcased what can be achieved if opportunities are given to members of the Traveller community by growing a social enterprise from three staff members to 16 in three years.  We have busted the myth that Travellers do not want to work.  We have people knocking on our door looking for jobs every day of the week.  The sad fact is that we have to turn them away because we cannot be the only employer of Travellers in Galway.  We believe there is a lot of potential for jobs in the public service but there are also opportunities in public procurement, on which &euro;20 billion is spent every year.  If some of that was ring-fenced to ensure the delivery of social impacts, we would be well on our way to creating some jobs.  Let us start with laying down some targets.  These targets would be realistic and would grow year on year.  As other speakers have said, we feel we have been overanalysed as a community.  Many reports have been done.  We are losing a great deal of time.  A report comes out every three to five years.  The statistics have not changed.  It is not the community saying the statistics have not changed, but report after report doing so.  As other speakers have said, it is time to get on with it.</p></speech>

In five years' time, we need to be able to say that the percentage of Travellers who are unemployed has decreased.  In other words, if actions do not lead to results, those actions are not good enough.  It is as simple as that.  What strikes me from today's debate is that the approach must be multifaceted.</p> <p>  I was on Galway Bay FM this morning.  Keith Finnegan was reading out the questions and comments.  One of the comments made a few times was inevitably that Travellers do not want to work.  I have heard that before but not about Travellers.  When I was a child, I heard that Connemara people would not work.  I think that view has been disproved.  Given an incentive, most people want to work and do work.  We should therefore dismiss this as a valid argument.  </p> <p>  I was particularly interested in one thing on which Dr. McGann touched because I am a member of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and we are, at the moment, preparing a budget submission.  She said that there are disincentives built into the social welfare code.  I am interested in her view as to how that could be changed.  There are lots of things in the social welfare code I would change.  I will be pushing for lots of change.  What are these disincentives?  Is means testing one?  Obviously there has to be a social welfare code.  I certainly would not be in favour of disimproving it in any way because most of us would find it hard to live on what people who are in receipt of social welfare get.  What are those disincentives and how could we improve on them?  There are possibly very simple things we could do.  When I started working and was employing small farmers, I certainly came across many disincentives that were quite bizarre.  Some still exist but we have managed to improve in respect of others over the years.  I am interested in Dr. McGann's view on that.</p> <p>  I was very interested in what Ms Costello had to say.  I am interested in the idea of taking very specific actions this time.  Would Ms Costello agree that one of the best ways to break down prejudice is to get Travellers into work so that people get to know them intimately as workmates and find out that, like everybody else, they are not so different?  Would she therefore agree that, regardless of all our courses and talking, unless we get a significant number of Travellers into work, we will not really overcome people's underlying prejudices?  The best way to overcome such prejudices is for people to become friends and workmates with people from communities they find strange.  In that way, they become people they trust.  Would she agree that there are some places in which such recruitment will be easier than in others?  An example is the public sector.  We should focus big time on that.  Ms Costello was involved in setting up the social enterprise in Galway, which has been very successful.  Unfortunately, it was difficult to achieve the contract for the insulation.  It immediately did what a good business would do; it reformed itself and came back again stronger than ever.</p><p>Do the witnesses feel that more of these schemes around the country and a programme administered by the Department of Rural and Community Development could play a significant role in creating a bridgehead into other types of employment and, again, that people would get used to services being provided by people in the Traveller community?</p><p> There is the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016.  Are employers still looking for records?  Is there a massive prejudice against anybody with a record?  Presumably, somebody with two, three or four convictions is in an exponentially worse position.  Do significantly more resources need to put into interacting with people during the first time they go to prison so that they do not go back to prison and thus do not create a double jeopardy for themselves?</p></speech>

Looking at how we address this must be quite multifaceted.  For somebody to even consider that would have to trust enough to take the opportunity for employment, and trust that it was going to work out.  There is work that we could look at on the Department's side and, equally, on the employment side to tackle the issue.</p> <p>  We are working on spent convictions with Working to Change.  My colleague, Ms Costello, sits on the that working group.  Broadly in respect of criminal offences, and not specific to the Traveller community, we are bringing a focus group of employers together in the coming weeks to understand where the challenges and barriers are, and what we can do to change that going forward.</p></speech>

Let us say we introduce a fixed term for a medical card of three or five years for all of society, irrespective of income changes, that period would be sustained so people would have a guarantee of the time they would have a medical card and would not have to worry that as soon as they got a job, they would lose it.  Would that simple step make a difference?  This medical card issue has done my head in because it relates to all sorts of issues such as exam fees.  The problem with it is it is not just a health card.  Do the witnesses think it would be helpful if the powers that be put a fixed time on a medical card and that it could not be reviewed unless the Department could prove that someone had told utter lies in the initial application, irrespective of any income change?</p></speech>

An article was published in <i>The Irish Times </i>a few weeks ago in which Ms Ronnie Fay, co-ordinator, Pavee Point, called for medical cards to be provided to low earners within the Traveller community.  Because of the health inequalities, Travellers are not looking just a free medical card.  Some Travellers can afford healthcare but many Travellers cannot because of unemployment.  Then, if Travellers do seek employment, say, in a primary healthcare programme or in other areas they should be entitled to a medical card because of the health inequalities.  Pavee Point is doing an awful lot of work on this issue at the moment and the initiative would be a solution going forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.837" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Costello" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021051800002#E00600"><p>I fully agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that we need to see Travellers in employment to start to break down some of the myths but we need to make workplaces safe for Travellers.  I constantly hear from people who are in workplaces, including a young man who is training to be an electrician, about the constant micro-aggressions and the comments about Travellers and other groups.  That has a hugely negative impact on people's mental health, where they either deny that they are Travellers or they face a barrage all of the time and have to try to defend themselves.  We know from Galway and Mr. Ward's experience that he is inundated with applications for any vacancy that he has because Travellers know that it is safe to work there and the environment is not going to impact on their mental health and well-being.  We have outlined how workplaces can be made safe.</p> <p>  The South Dublin County Council introduced internships for Travellers 15 years ago when I worked in Clondalkin.  Mr. Joe Horan was the county manager at the time but, unfortunately, he is now deceased.  He was at the top of the organisation and he changed its culture because he said that he would not accept racist comments and discrimination.  His action had a domino effect on all the other staff and that is why it is so important.  If the manager or leader of an organisation says no to discrimination then that mindset will  filter down to other staff.</p> <p>  I agree that the public sector must show leadership in this regard.  It is the biggest employer and it has the resources to support the employment of Travellers.  When Travellers are employed in the public sector, and I am not saying that the private sector should wait until that is in place, but that can really show the huge contribution that Travellers can and do make.</p> <p>  The issue of spent convictions is huge.  Let us say an 18-year old commits a number of crimes.  After he or she turns his or her lives around, he or she can never get convictions wiped to access opportunities.  Again, the public sector is the first organisation that needs to consider this matter and ask whether a conviction matters to the post that is being applied for.  If it does not, then it should not be taken into account.</p> <p>  Mr. Ward will talk about social enterprise.  He can talk about First Class Insulation and what happened with that very strong social enterprise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.838" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021051800002#E00700"><p>We believe that social enterprise is part of the solution but we are talking about jobs in the hundreds when the Traveller community needs thousands of jobs.  Social enterprise is part of the solution and breaks down many barriers.  We have first-hand experience because we went into homes to deliver the warmer homes scheme to the fuel poor across Galway city and county.  In the beginning, homeowners said that they would not allow Travellers in to complete the work because there was that much racism and discrimination against the community.  However, we had the full backing of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, which was a positive action measure so there was no tolerance.  So if a homeowner made racist or discriminatory comments towards the community we had the backing of the SEAI because we were on the panel of contractors and delivered a 100% pass rate and quality on the work.  For us, as a team, that gave us an awful lift to believe that we had the backing and such weight behind us that there was going to be no tolerance.  Before that, we would have probably shied away from the work and viewed the scheme as a challenge.  A homeowner talked about going on the radio and the whole team was deflated because we believed we were going to be out of the jobs and were never going to be able insulate a house in Galway.  That backing was a very positive action by a contractor.</p><p>A number of calls should be made for community services programmes, with Travellers taking them up across the country, and the special initiative for Travellers.  That was key for us in the beginning, to look at the development work, at mainstream and public sector jobs, and at the roll-out of social enterprises.  None of the Traveller projects is resourced to take this on right now, which is a pity.  The peer-led primary healthcare model was such a success during the pandemic, with people being reached out to, connectivity on the ground, and working with Travellers to bridge them into the services.  We would definitely call for the special initiative for Travellers to be housed in the Traveller projects.</p><p> Many of the supports right now are for an individual changing, but even if an individual makes all those changes and upskills, it still does not result in a job.  That has a ripple effect back in to the community.  We are such a small community.  If Martin goes the whole way through college and it does not conclude with a job, people will say that it has been a waste of Martin's time, because even though he is well educated, he is still not in control to change mindsets.  It is a case of no tolerance, starting with the public service and the social enterprise model, because then we can start to break down so many barriers and go after the public sector.  It has been well-supported at Government level, so where are its inclusion and diversity policies for Travellers?</p></speech>

I said last week that it is always a pleasure to see the trucks going around Galway.  It makes a big difference because of the impact that it has not just on the community that the witnesses are serving but also because everybody sees that and it is almost an advertisement for the work that Travellers are doing around the county.  I have met the witnesses several times and have mentioned that outreach in universities is critical.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has worked with the Traveller community for many years and has a great record.  He has also worked with those who have been in prison.  I am delighted to be on this committee and to support the work that everyone is doing.</p> <p>  One issue that raised its head is the idea of the Traveller community's history of entrepreneurship.  Do the witnesses have thoughts on how that can be better supported?  That is why social enterprise can be really successful, being creative about the kind of work that people want to do and have skills in, historically and otherwise.  I agree with the comments about the public service.  It is being funded by the public and has an obligation that can be measured.  I note the comments in one of the opening statements, that there is an obligation for the public service to reflect the community that it is serving.  We always talk about that with regard to gender and minorities.  This is critical and could be able to mend relationships, apart from just in the workplace but because it has a public-facing role in many instances.  As the witnesses outlined about the SEAI, it has a ripple effect.  It is not just about the job but everybody that comes into contact with people.  As Mr. Ward said in a radio interview, if 0.1% of people in the public service were Travellers, that would be 400 jobs.  If it was truly representative of the Traveller community, I worked out that there would be 570 jobs, so 400 is not even getting to the level of being truly representative.</p> <p>  What are the witnesses' other ideas about entrepreneurship?  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that we have an opportunity now.  Much of the work and the plans happening at present are good, such as the pilot programme in the Department of Justice, but we can all do that when it comes to internships.</p></speech>

Self-employment is a popular choice among Travellers because their tradition is one of self-employment.  They have always been the entrepreneurs.  It also protects them from discrimination in the workplace if they are employed by themselves.  I have only begun to explore the back to work schemes.  I was hoping that it could be introduced into prisons so that Travellers in prison and other prisoners could start preparing for this back to work scheme while in prison and doing up their business plans so that, when they come out, there is not a long gap before they can start back in to employment.  My understanding is that the back to work scheme has got much more complicated, bureaucratic and difficult to navigate.  We need to look at back to work allowances that work, are real and will make a difference for people who are distant from mainstream employment and are choosing to work as entrepreneurs.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the internship in the Department of Justice, which is welcome, but it is just four or five positions.  We are glad that the garda&iacute; have also introduced an internship for Travellers but this needs to happen across all public bodies.  It has to be mainstream.  We have done pilots.  We did pilots 15 years ago which show that this works.  Those internships have to lead to jobs.  That is the only way.  It is about word of mouth in the community.  If somebody goes in for a year to do an internship and leaves without a job, that does not give the community hope.  If people are able to do the job, then the internships have to lead to a job.</p> <p>  Mr. Ward might speak on self-employment because that is his area of expertise.</p></speech>

As Ms Costello says, that is because that was really the only option available.  Many Travellers have to become entrepreneurs in order to survive at times.  They face the same challenges operating a business.  One could look at the public procurement directive and whether social considerations were given to that and how Traveller entrepreneurs or businesspeople might be able to get some of those small contracts and so on, while addressing the bigger picture and the changes needed in attitudes and behaviour against the community.  My background is one of running business.  We had to hide our identity in order to get contracts and had contracts pulled when competitors referred to us derogatorily.  Contracts never came to us in the post even though we won them in paper.  The biggest advantage that somebody had over me in business was my ethnicity.  People still face similar barriers.  They are dealing with many overheads when trying to take on staff and run a building.  It can be tough to be a Traveller running a business.</p></speech>

The conversation about the importance of a focus on employment in the public sector is important.  We are aware that the public sector is where best practice exists.  There are strong policies and procedures in place across the public sector.  The benefit of those is that they are negotiated with the trade unions to ensure that our members are free from discrimination and disadvantage within the workplace.</p><p>It is important we ensure Travellers within the workplace are free from any potential discrimination in terms of their access into the public sector.</p><p> The trade unions are becoming a lot more comfortable with and aware of engaging with the public sector duty.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has been particularly helpful in organising sessions on what the public sector duty looks like.  It is important there are frameworks in place and we ensure they are implemented in our negotiations with employers within the workplace.  Certainly the conversation on the public sector is important in terms of focus.</p></speech>

In January 2019, the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection examined the experience of JobPath and heard from researchers from the Waterford Un/employment Research Collaborative.  One of the first things the researchers mentioned was the experience of the Traveller community on JobPath.  Among other nasty experiences there was a young man who not only was put on the wrong course but was enrolled by JobPath on a course that required what were described as reasonable levels of literacy despite the fact he had low levels of literacy.  The worst part was they forced him to amend his CV against his wishes to hide his ethnicity.  The Department responded to the claim saying it had no awareness of such an allegation nor had any complaint to that effect been made.  That is fair enough but these JobPath services are provided by the Department of Social Protection through Turas Nua and Seetec.  The services are outsourced and a lot of money was paid for them in the past.</p> <p>  I am frustrated and wish to ask Dr. McGann a question, and not in an entirely negative way.  Where are the protocols, standards and training when it comes to JobPath, Seetec, Turas Nua and even the members of IBEC?  Whatever about the public sector, it is outrageous that such a situation happened to the young man although an official complaint was never made.  I know, having lived in Ballyfermot, that when young Travellers have sought jobs, in particular in shops, the negativity from employers they were met with was humiliating to say the least, and these employers were members of IBEC.  Have protocols, standards or training for employers been put in place?  I ask because shops are the first port of call, particularly for young Travellers who may only want to take up temporary jobs during the summer or at Christmas time and do not necessarily wish to have a permanent job or go into a public sector workplace.</p> <p>  I totally agree with what has been said about using the public sector to give people a chance to get work experience and training.  Dr. McGann referred in her submission to "The work done in 2006 with the integrated workplace initiative co-ordinated by the Equality Authority, and supported by trade unions and employers".  I ask her to expand on that aspect because that was 15 years ago and I have no recollection of the initiative or any involvement in same.  She proposed that it would be worth revisiting the initiative and considering what it achieved.  What did it achieve?  What was the value of it?</p> <p>  I wish to comment on the experience Mr. Ward described.  He told us a wonderful story about Travellers working on the warmer homes scheme and being backed by the contractor against the negativity meted out by people whose homes Traveller workers had to go into to carry out the necessary adjustments to people's homes.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  This is a great opportunity for us to be inclusive of Travellers doing work because ti is not just about moving away from our carbon footprint being too high but also about providing green new jobs.  If there are green new jobs available in insulating homes and improving people's life experience by not having to use too much carbon to heat their homes, would it not be a good suggestion to ask the Government to box off a certain amount of these jobs for the Travelling community, to upskill both men and women of the Travelling community to carry out this work, and for the Government to see this initiative as part of a green new deal?  The whole basis of a green new deal is about being more inclusive, sustainable and having a fairer and more caring society.  The initiative would be a good example of that.  If all this money is being put into warmer homes schemes, retrofitting and improving people's lives, it should be used to the advantage of the Travelling community.</p> <p>  I totally and utterly agree with the public sector being obliged to give Travellers a chance, in particular local authorities because that is where Travellers will be seen, whether it is working in the public domain, in the parks or, indeed, on public desks dealing directly with the public.  As is always said, if you cannot see it, you cannot be it.</p> <p>  I agree with all that has been said about having safe workplaces and having local authorities.  I am very interested, however, in finding out how we impose standards and protocols on both employers and companies like Turas Nua, Seetec and anybody who must deal with Travellers either by refusing them employment or by helping them to attain employment.</p></speech>

That is just the structure.  The important work is on the inclusive and belonging piece, and on ensuring we stamp out things like racism and discrimination.</p> <p>  As I said in my opening remarks, trust is a huge issue where, as has been mentioned, people have gone looking for jobs and the humiliation they have experienced.  That cannot be allowed to continue in 2021.  It was never acceptable and it absolutely is not acceptable with all that we know.  We need to tackle that head on and overcome the systemic social prejudice and exclusion of generations of the Traveller community.  Employers have put in place awareness-raising and training programmes on diversity and inclusion.  The Donegal Traveller group has a diverse aware programme that I know a number of our employers have gone through.  We need to see greater uptake of that and that is something we are strongly encouraging and seeing good uptake on.</p> <p>  We had one of the Traveller advocacy groups in to talk to IBEC's diversity forum, which would have 200-plus medium and large public and private sector employers.  The group is about networking, sharing best practice and talking about initiatives.</p><p>This was in January of last year.  We found that there was major interest in understanding what were the challenges facing the Traveller community, how those challenges impact members of the community when they look for employment, or, indeed, those already in employment, and what, therefore, we needed to do.  The ladies who came to speak to us were phenomenal.  They were really engaging and we had very positive feedback from the employers we represent.  Then Covid-19 hit.  I feel we would have gained some momentum and seen some initiatives come to pass if the timing had been different.  We are hoping we will see that situation revisited now.  That is where we are with that aspect.</p><p> Turning to the integrated workplace strand, this undertaking was made up of a range of different initiatives concerning the area of cultural integration, and unions and employers engaged with the endeavour.  Mr. Joyce and I worked together on several different elements of it.  To give one example of the projects we worked on, we rolled out an initiative on cultural integration in the workplace.  That involved addressing what the latter looked like, talking about language and banter and all these things that are often excused as just being a joke or the way we do things around here.  However, in reality, that involved examining those elements of behaviour under an equality, diversity and inclusion lens and then considering how we could do things differently.</p><p> That was at a time when we had moved from being a homogeneous society - organisations are very much a microcosm of society - towards looking at how we were integrating the range of cultural diversity which existed.  The project did not focus solely on the Traveller community, and that is something we could build on now.  However, it was very successful in raising awareness and educating people about the importance of integration, as well its value.  It also raised awareness among employers regarding how this type of undertaking benefits not only them but the individual and society as well.  In that sense, it is a no-brainer.  Mr. Joyce may have more examples of the other initiatives that were a part of that integration project.</p></speech>

We had some funds to support projects within trade unions and to organise migrant workers in different sectors of the economy, including in the mushroom industry at the time.  Unfortunately, the initiative died a death with the onset of the financial crisis.  We are now engaged in conversations with IHREC with a view to revitalising some of that work.  This can be part of the building back better facet, in that we are not talking about going back to business as usual post-pandemic, but about moving beyond what was the situation before Covid-19 struck to a more inclusive future.</p></speech>

I am taking on board many of the things people have been saying.  I often wonder how much things have changed, because sometimes in the community it is difficult to see that aspect.  I have developed many relationships in dealing with people in places like Finglas.  We have a large Traveller community in our area.  I am in and out of different locations and communities and changes come very slowly.  When Dr. McGann was talking about IBEC, do we know how many Travellers each year are employed through IBEC and its associated groups?  Do we have any idea of the figures in that regard?  I ask that because it seems that everything is happening very slowly.</p> <p>  Within the Traveller community, people have their own minds and a blockage in that regard in respect of certain things.  I refer to the attitude towards women in the Traveller community, which can be a bit difficult to understand for many people.  I certainly agree that the local authorities and organisations such as the Civil Service should be taking in people, particularly those with disabilities, from the Traveller community.  There should be positive discrimination in that regard.  There is positive discrimination in general in the Civil Service in respect of people with disabilities.  However, I would love to see the figures for the local authorities and the Civil Service in respect of how much things have improved over the years.</p> <p>  Turning to people from the Traveller community with criminal records, that is a difficult issue.  From what I can see, employers are very reluctant to employ Travellers who have criminal records.  Regarding how we go about tackling that issue, I was interested to listen to some of the ideas suggested in this regard.  That aspect needs to be carefully thought out and worked on, because it is very worrying.  I refer, in particular, to people having convictions held over them.  It is an area which needs to be looked at very carefully.  Much comes down to education as well, and to trying to get people into the workforce and break down these barriers which exist in certain jobs and in taking up certain types of employment.  I believe sometimes we come across people in the Traveller community who do not feel that a certain area is for them, and we must break down those barriers.</p> <p>  Work is needed in organisations such as the old F&Aacute;S, now replaced by SOLAS and the education and training boards, ETBs, and other training centres to get people past that step.  We can sometimes get people in and get them training, but then getting them to a stage where they pick up permanent jobs or some other employment is really hard.  There is a great challenge involved in trying to bring people on, as opposed to just getting them trained.  We need more stable jobs, more consistency in jobs coming up and to try to target people and get them into those jobs.  Those are my thoughts in respect of this matter.</p></speech>

First, I will return to the earlier conversation concerning the issue of inclusion in the workplace.  The upcoming national action plan against racism is an excellent opportunity to provide a framework for this type of action that can be undertaken in the workplace.  I refer to building an initiative within employment, where employers can become leaders in this area.  The opportunity with this national action plan stems from taking a whole-of-society approach that really tries to address the underlying institutionalised elements of discrimination in society and that can provide an opportunity through resourcing and guidance for employers to take an active role in tackling racism and discrimination.  It has been almost ten years since we have had an action plan like this one, and it has also been some time since we have had an integrated workplaces initiative.  This is, therefore, an excellent opportunity to consider how we could feature some of these types of activities in that upcoming strategy.</p> <p>  My second point concerns the issue of spent convictions.  IBEC is increasingly involved in this issue with the Working to Change strategy.</p><p>In fact, as Dr. McGann mentioned, in the coming weeks we are going to have a focus group on this issue with the Department of Justice to best try to understand what the challenges, attitudes and behaviours are in the workplace that are preventing that pathway to employment for people with previous convictions.  We are trying to set a baseline there and trying to understand the issue as it stands and then to develop from that resources that can best support employers to better integrate people with previous convictions into the workplace.  That is something we are seeking to be active on with employers who are currently engaging people with previous convictions or who perhaps have not considered this as an opportunity before.  Again, that is something that we are looking forward to working on.</p><p> The second part of the strategy is about trying to get people who are active in the social enterprise sector into mainstream employment.  There are possibly some learnings that can be taken from this strategy in terms of many of the issues raised in the discussion by Ms Anne Costello and Mr. Ward.  We will consider how we can adopt them to help to support people from the Traveller community who are currently working in social enterprises into mainstream employment.  That is something we are also going to be active on this year.</p></speech>

In the UK it has been shown that people with convictions are very good, loyal employees.  In the UK, companies have gone into prisons, met prisoners, done training with them in prison and then they have gone straight into jobs when they came out because they met them as people.  That is the kind of initiative we need to take.</p> <p>  A number of Travellers have told me that prison was their first positive experience of learning in either the education or the training centres.  They have such a negative experience of education in schools that they were reluctant to go to the school in the prisons but when they did, many of them were pleasantly surprised that it was a different approach and a different attitude.  It is so important that we do more while we have a captive audience with men in particular.  A number of them raise issues around the type of skills they are interested in and the jobs market.  We could do an awful lot more to match people up with their interest and skills and get them the training in prison to access the jobs when they come out.</p> <p>  Did Deputy Ellis ask me another question?  I am trying to remember what he asked.</p></speech>

I have not heard the oral presentations but I have read the written submissions and I get the drift of what has been said.  I am very encouraged by the submissions and what has come up in the discussion among my colleagues, in that we are focusing on prospective actions that could be taken.  Each one of us attending the meeting is capable of spending an hour each discussing the reasons for the under-involvement of Travellers in employment.  There is not one of us that could not discourse on that for an hour but that is no use in the long term.  It is important that such research was done and that we had context, but now it is time for action.  I am very pleased that is the mode of the discussion today.</p> <p>  I would like to mention a number of issues.  There is no question about it but we will have to push this agenda as a committee.  Those present might hear the bells in the background.  I am in the convention centre.  If people can hear me then I will continue.  We need quotas in the public service, on community employment schemes, as well as on JobPath and other schemes.  Each Government initiative in the employment and training spheres needs realistic quotas, as in the case of people with disabilities.  The same is true of the public service.</p> <p>  I am interested in hearing the responses of witnesses and any I do not hear, I will read.  We need support for employers.  The Government must get involved in actively supporting employers to deal with this question.  It is not enough to wish employers would take on Travellers and have anti-racism and anti-discrimination policies in their workplaces.  That is a fine aspiration, but to give it expression we need practical support for employers and we should not shy away from that.</p> <p>  When they get the opportunity, the capacity of Travellers is very well chronicled in the Bounce Back Recycling business in Galway.  That is a great example of success for Travellers and it should give heart to others.  There is merit in giving support to Travellers for their own enterprises because that tradition is very deep-rooted.  That should parallel the provision of support for employers to get involved, as well as putting in place a quota system.</p> <p>  If one wants to look at it in purely clinical or cold economic terms, there will be an economic output to such an approach, as taxes will accrue, as will savings.  This is not a wasted investment or expenditure.  There will be an output and an outturn from it and it is important to be aware of that.</p> <p>  The point about the prison situation is interesting and valid.  In another context, I came across the fact that in London and other parts of England youth workers are employed who have had a challenging youth experience themselves.  They may have had addiction issues or they went off the rails in some area and they are now employed by the state to work with other young people.  The output has been impressive.  I attended a seminar where it was discussed in detail.  I will not bore the meeting further on it.  I do not have the figures to hand but the output from it was impressive, hence the merit of the interventions in prison.  One of the witnesses, possibly Ms Meadhbh Costello, who made that point is onto something big.  There is enormous potential in that regard.</p> <p>  All in all, I just want to make those comments and to support the thrust of what other colleagues said.  I agree with what Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said about warmer homes.  That is another area where an inbuilt quota system could be put to work.  That idea has potential.</p> <p>  I no longer have the bells ringing in the background.  Those are the points I wished to make.  I look forward to the responses.  I will listen to them and then I will leave to go on multitasking.</p></speech>

Supports for employers are important and the public sector is a big employer that needs to lead by example.  The learning from that can give confidence and hope to private employers.  We are focusing today on the public sector because sometimes one can put a lot of effort into the private sector with very little result.  I agree with the Senator around the need for targets.  We need realistic targets for Travellers in employment and the Government has control over the public sector.</p> <p>  The issue around supports for prisoners is important.  It costs a lot to keep somebody in prison and it is a shame not to take advantage of that time to give him or her skills that make him or her less likely to return to prison.  Prisoners who take up employment are much less likely to return to prison.</p></speech>

On the point he made about employer supports, and taking Ms Anne Costello's point into consideration, I think that some employers, if they were to decide now that they would like to employ members of the Traveller community, would not know where to start.  Raising awareness and the piece of work Ms Meadhbh Costello has already mentioned around anti-racism and anti-discrimination need to go hand in hand as we consider how to move forward.  The Senator is absolutely right when he says the time for talking is over.  It is the time for action and there is willingness for that.  We have engaged with employers to look at marginalised groups and how we move forward with this.  We can get supports in place, put in structures around the issue and move forward with action.</p></speech>

There is also an opportunity to co-create those supports with members of under-represented communities, whether they are members of the Traveller community or other individuals who the strategies are targeting.  It is a good opportunity.</p> <p>  I raise the point that as part of the working to change strategy, there will be opportunities for employers to engage in mentorship with people who are currently in the prison system, as well as a couple of other initiatives like that.  It will be worth watching that area and seeing how those initiatives can be rolled out or shaped in the future, and what potential exists.</p></speech>

First Class Insulation was a social enterprise we set up in 2010 and we delivered on the panel of the warmer homes scheme from 2010 to 2020.  We had ten years' work done on that.  We think it is important that social considerations are built into any procurement process.  That is a European directive that is now in Irish law.  We were lucky enough to sit on that panel for five years because we were a community-based organisation, like a number of others throughout the country.  In 2014, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, decided that it would put contracts out to tender and part of the direction for the first two tenders put out by the SEAI was that a special lot was put in place for community-based organisations in order for us to compete and maintain the jobs.  We were successful twice in that regard.  There was a change in directive thereafter which meant there were no more separate lots so we would have to tender against the big contractors.  We are, therefore, no longer on that panel, which is a shame because it meant we lost seven jobs in that area.  We completed 2,000 homes under that scheme.</p> <p>  Through our social enterprises, we are delivering social, economic and environmental impacts.  Our application of the warmer homes scheme was about targeting who we considered the real fuel poor.  We went out of our way to deliver to a lot of the Gaeltacht areas.  We took the scheme into the Aran Islands and delivered deeper measures.  For us, it was not about targeting 40 homes in the one housing estate, as a big contractor would, but was about finding that one home that was never going to be found and ensuring it got over the line to enable it to get the service.  It would be great if there was a push by members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action to ensure that separate lots are brought back and that community-based organisations can take up a contract because many organisations throughout the country have lost their contracts for the warmer homes scheme.  We will be here for the long term whereas the bigger contractors might come and go when the boom starts again.  It would be good if that issue was brought up at the climate committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2021-05-18a.865" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TCJ2021051800002#K00500"><p>I will be brief and only ask about a few things.  Mention was made of extra complexity to the back-to-work scheme.  When I was in the Department, I always said that big policy is easy but problems arise in the detail.  Most schemes have become more complex just because somebody somewhere might have got something to which they were not fully entitled.  It would be useful for us if somebody with experience of looking at and applying for contracts was to disassemble the process on the form and tell us what could be taken out and what could be made simpler.  I have always reckoned that a scheme must have a certain amount of risk of abuse, or whatever, because if a scheme is made 100% tight, it often locks out 100% of the people.  Schemes have been introduced in recent times with very little pick-up.</p> <p>  To give an example of what I am talking about, some of the forms for small grants were far too complicated during my time in the Department.  One night, I stayed up late and rewrote some of the forms much more simply.  We had a meeting the next day and I sat down with the officials and told them what information on the form was essential and could be filled in by anybody without expert advice.  I suggested we get on with it.  I would be interested in that possibility.</p> <p>  Departments are meant to proof all the forms and processes against real people and I am sometimes not sure if that happens.  I had a very simple test that I used to ask my officials to use.  I suggested that somebody in a different section to the person who created the form would be asked if he or she could fill out the form.  If somebody who was already working in the public service could not fill out the form, if their attempt to fill it out got a blank as an outside system would, it would obviously be hard to expect the public to fill out the form.  There is a lot that can be done here.  It is fairly micro work but an awful lot of people are getting caught on the micro stuff.  I am interested in this.  If somebody wants to come back and tell us all of the conditions on the form that could be changed, it would be very useful to us.</p> <p>  First Class Insulation was hugely successful and there is no question or doubt about that.  It happened in my constituency and I know how successful it was.  It was a tragedy when First Class Insulation lost the contract.  Did the SEAI ever give a valid reason, based on law, EU law, competition law, or some other reason, as to why it changed the process?  That is something on which we have to follow up.  Mr. Ward should just tell me if he knows of a reason or not.</p> <p>  On the issue of internships in the public service, my view is that to give people a chance to prove themselves, internships have to be reasonably long and stretch to six or seven months.  Has any consideration been given to the idea that if an intern subsequently applies for a job in the public service that the internship would be a credit, like an exam credit, for interviews and processes?  Does that idea have merit?</p><p>If an internship is completed successfully, it could count as bonus points in going for a job at the level equivalent.</p><p> In the context of education and training in prisons, Ms Costello's comments are very important.  Could we do much more in prisons with regard to academic work and practical training and linking them to jobs on the outside so that people could make a smooth transition when leaving prison?  Could we do more than what we do now?</p></speech>

There is certainly more we could do.  There is disparity across prisons, with some doing more than others in equipping prisoners with skills to make them more job-ready when they leave prison.  We should do more around career guidance.  Many people in prison have never had an opportunity to pursue formal education.  They have no idea what kind of opportunities they could aspire to.</p> <p>  I have a young man on work experience with me and he has done approximately ten years in prison in all.  He is now back studying community and youth work in Maynooth.  He said it was never an idea for him but the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed sent people to Coolmine to speak about those possibilities.  He is now thriving in college and he will be a really good community worker.  That man was not drawn to paving, welding or some of those other jobs but I have met a number of men in prison asking for practical skills.  Many of them do not have formal education but they are saying that if they were trained as mechanics, tilers, drivers, or similar jobs, they could fend for themselves when they leave prison.  Unfortunately, some of them say they are doing lollipop stick stuff in prison and that does not lead to jobs.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, although prison staff are allocated to training, if a security emergency arises anywhere else, it is the first element shut down.  Even if somebody must be escorted to hospital or court, a training workshop for woodwork might be the first area to be cut.  Security must be a prison's priority.  Unfortunately, that is what happens.  Many people in prison tell me they never get access to training.</p></speech>

The question of targets is important as a marker of how to get things moving.  We could recommend or insist that Departments or parts of the public sector have a percentage of jobs going to the Traveller community.  It might be more difficult with social enterprises but we could actively advocate programmes to link with social enterprises.</p> <p>  It is more difficult to see this being done in the private sector.  Have parts of the private sector been targeted to engage in this, such as the supermarket or trade sectors, including registered mechanics?  Is there engagement on cultural and equality rights and encouragement to recruit Travellers?  We should target jobs in the private sector for the Traveller community as well.  I know a 50-year-old Traveller who was sleeping rough and he is now in a bedsit.  He wants to work but does not know where to go to get it.  The Department of Social Protection does not know what to offer him.  These issues affect middle-aged men or women in the Traveller community, or even people in all communities.  Has a pilot been tried in the private sector to bring about positive discrimination in the workplace for the Traveller community?</p></speech>

The short answer is I do not know of anybody who has specifically run a pilot or targeted programme for the Traveller community in employment.  We have seen different sectors, after the previous economic crash, looking at specifically targeting people on the live register and trying pilot programmes that encourage people back to work.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility.  It is important that to set this up for success, we need to ensure awareness training is done, with strong and engaged cultures ready for this.  The last thing we would need is more betrayal of trust in the community.  It is something that employers should want to engage in again and again.  The Deputy is right in that if we get this up and running successfully, the momentum would build and go from there.  I do not know of any particular sector that has run such a pilot but, equally, I do not see why we could not look at something like that.</p></speech>

We have just heard on the ground in Galway that the majority of Travellers who apply to that scheme are not accepted.

As a Traveller woman, I hope with all my heart that in five years' time things will be better.  Things cannot get any worse for Travellers in the labour market.  I really hope we will never need to have discussions like this again.  It is very disheartening, with many different layers of inequality affecting Travellers' well-being and education.  When I hear people referring to having certain schemes for Travellers, it is even more disheartening.  Travellers are sick of schemes and legislation that exist but that do not work.  I am a bit fed up reading about legislative policies.  I speak to people in Traveller non-governmental organisations and currently there is discussion about a quota for the number of Travellers to be employed in the public and private sectors.  That is a step in the right direction.  It could be a recommendation in our report but it must be acted upon.</p> <p>  Many Travellers have completed second level education and may have done a course, such as the hairdressing course done by many Traveller women or nail and beauty courses.  My uncle drives for a bus company in Bluebell and he has just been named driver of the year.  We should look at some of the good practices.  He is able to bring the bus into Labre Park and there is no prejudice from the company.  That is lovely and we must see more of that.  We must see action.</p> <p>  I said at a previous committee meeting that if Travellers were not employed by Traveller organisations, including non-governmental organisations, there would be more than 80% unemployment in the community.  Employment for Travellers must be meaningful.  Tokenism and positive discrimination can be beneficial.</p><p>Being in a job and not being successful in the workplace is not a nice feeling.  People are being set up for failure and we have to look at this as well.</p><p> I have a question for the unions.  How do they think we can get Travellers to be open about identity?  I have an aunt who works in a nursing home and does not identify as a member of the Traveller community because she cannot do so.  Many Travellers cannot identify as Travellers because straight away they are put at a disadvantage.  During the week I saw on social media that a Traveller qualified as a consultant and another is a doctor in a hospital.  This is very good and positive and it should be in the media.  We need stories that are positive towards the Traveller community.</p><p> I have a question for Ms Costello on something Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked earlier.  I have a great interest in the intersectionality between being a Traveller and a woman, being a Traveller and being in prison and being a Traveller and having a disability.  We say the prisons could do more.  Many Traveller men drive lorries and buses.  Yesterday, along with Oein DeBhairduin, I was in a conversation about how everything today is about being green and recycling but Travellers have always recycled through wheeling and dealing and street markets.  My family was a market family in Athy, which was lovely.  We come from this and it is part of our survival as a community of people.</p><p> What do the witnesses believe we can do better in our prisons for women and for men?  I also invite the witnesses from the unions to respond to the other issues I have highlighted.</p></speech>

There is agreement that it is the period in the few months immediately after release that is a very precarious time for prisoners.  It is the time they are most likely to reoffend and end up back in prison.  This is why it is so important that they are prepared for this pre-release and that there is proper preparation.  We have organisations such as the Irish Association for the Social Integration of Offenders, IASIO, and we are working closely with them but we need more.  We need proper training in prison so people come out with real skills and have career guidance in prison to look at where their skills are.  Many of them have no idea of their potential because it has never been tapped.  This is why this type of career guidance is important, as is looking at the jobs market and trying to match up the training people get in prison with real jobs in the community.</p> <p>  Traveller organisations are open to supporting travellers when they come out of prison.  Again, resources are so scarce in Traveller organisations that they are often torn between who they can support and they do not have enough resources to do this work.</p> <p>  Traveller women in prison is a heartbreaking issue.  At least 15% of all the women in prison are Traveller women.  We have interviewed them and written up their stories.  We spoke to 12 women in particular in the D&oacute;chas Centre and Limerick Prison about how they ended up there.  Their stories are of trauma, abuse, neglect, being in care and their children being in care.  We speak about the Magdalen laundries and this is it all over again, not just for Traveller women but for so many women in prison.  We need to put the spotlight on them.  Unfortunately, many of them are so broken and traumatised that employment is not on the cards but for those who are anywhere near it we need to do a lot more to support them.</p></speech>

We have touched on how we create the type of atmosphere in workplaces that would allow Travellers, and indeed anyone else, to be themselves at work.  The whole concept of the integrated workplace, which I outlined in my opening statement, is one where people's differences are accommodated and that it is upfront.  It is about workplaces committing to ensuring everyone who comes to work can do so in an atmosphere that is free from discrimination.  This is very important.</p> <p>  I am very glad the Chair mentioned the concept of meaningful employment.  We often speak about decent work.  We are on the same page on this.  This goes back to something Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and Senator Joe O'Reilly mentioned about the opportunities perhaps that might be created in the new green economy, be it through a national retrofit programme or whatever, to try to use these programmes to achieve social objectives such as the employment of groups which have traditionally been excluded from the labour market.</p> <p>  The sustainable development goals are deliberately very broad.  They include environmental goals because clearly there are no jobs on a dead planet but they also cover social and economic issues.  Goal 8 of the sustainable development goals refers to ensuring decent work for all by 2030 and includes a target of achieving full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, young people and persons with disabilities, and equal pay for work of equal value.  We are in the middle of 2021 and we have less than a decade to go to achieve this goal.  This is something that governments voluntarily agreed to try to do.  We have heard many practical suggestions today as to how it can be achieved for the Traveller community and we wish the committee the best of luck with this work.</p></speech>

While internships are important, they are not sufficient in terms of meaningful and long-lasting employment.  We need to make sure that in employment Travellers are safe, their dignity and respect is upheld in the workplace, discrimination is not allowed and the duty of care to all staff is upheld in the workplace.  It is very important that employers ensure they have unconscious bias training in the workplace to ensure these provisions are met.</p> <p>  At present, quotas are in place in the public sector for employing people with disabilities.  There is certainly no reason we cannot look at this for members of the Traveller community.  When such quotas are not upheld, it is important that we look at what happens subsequently to ensure employers meet these quotas and other requirements.  The role of the trade union movement is that we have the ability to collectively bargain on a sectoral basis to ensure some of these provisions are met.  Certainly the public sector is a very important area.  It is about decent employment and decent employment prospects.</p></speech>
