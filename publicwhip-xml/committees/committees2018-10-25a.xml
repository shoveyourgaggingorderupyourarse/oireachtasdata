He is joined by Deirdre Quaid, senior auditor.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Deering.</p> <p>  I am holding over the minutes of the previous meeting and we will come to clear a few of them, in a group manner, shortly.  Therefore, no matters arise from them as we have not dealt with them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-25a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018102500002#B00300"><p>I appreciate we have correspondence and a good deal of work to get through but given the seriousness of the issue involving the 40 schools and media indications that the number will be even more than that, we need to allocate an unforeseen but serious level of priority to examining that issue.  When the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills appeared before the committee when we were dealing with Cork Institute of Technology, CIT, the Marine Institute and problems that arose there, I asked about reviews of public private partnerships and the very lengthy periods that are allowed to elapse before they are reviewed and now, at least in one instance but potentially in more than 40 others where there may be difficulties, schoolchildren will have no school to go to in the next few weeks.  In terms of value for money, this is a very serious issue.  Clearly, a level of oversight, enforcement and inspection took place during the construction of those schools but the problems that have emerged certainly seem to suggest those processes and procedures were defective.  Perhaps there are new procedures.  We should move quickly to request the people from, I presume, the building unit of the Department of Education and Skills to come before us to give an account of what seem to be clear failings in the system that operated at the time these schools were being constructed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-25a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018102500002#B00400"><p>I support what Deputy MacSharry has said.  This is a very serious issue.  It involves more than 40 schools and it may involve more.  We all saw the images of the schoolchildren and their parents locked out of their school yesterday.  I imagine temporary arrangements will have to be made which will involve a cost.  There will be a cost involved for the taxpayer even in relocating the students.  We do not know what remedial works will have to be carried out in all these schools to bring them up to the required standards.  There are issues regarding contracts, regulation, enforcement and the other issues that have been raised.  Would it be wise for us to request a detailed note from the Department on the number of and nature of the contracts for each of these schools and the number of schools involved?  When we request that note, perhaps unfortunately more schools might be added to that list.  We need a very detailed note on that.  We also need to know the nature of the problems involved.  We need as much information as we can get on it for the next meeting and we can determine then how we can map this from this committee's perspective.  We should definitely write to the Secretary General of the Department today and get as much information as possible.  The big issue is the way it will affect the children concerned, but from our perspective there is the value for money aspect and the additional costs involved, which I imagine is a guaranteed.  Unfortunately, there will be an additional cost involved for the taxpayer.  We need to understand what happened, why, and what lessons will be learned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-25a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018102500002#B00500"><p>When the tender was done, one of the factors that saved money at the time was not having somebody on site to monitor the building.  It is always harder to identify the faults that lie behind the walls once a building is completed.  We need to focus on that particular aspect.  Next week is the mid-term break in schools and assessments will be done and probably more information will become available after that.  It might be useful to delay sending the letter until the end of next week as more information may have come into the Department, by which time it will have had sight of, or even a cursory glance over, the remaining schools that have to be examined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-25a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018102500002#B00600"><p>I support that point and I do not need to repeat it.  Regarding the ongoing inspection by the Department, I understand from an interview I heard that the Department was active in its inspection.  We might have that clarified also in terms of what role it had when the schools were being built.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-25a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018102500002#B00700"><p>During the course of construction.</p></speech>

It has been alleged that it had an active role and that it went out to inspect the buildings at various stages.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-25a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018102500002#B00900"><p>Fine.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-25a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018102500002#B01000"><p>That is an important point.  I note from media coverage that the company involved raised the fact that the Department was there every week or every two weeks inspecting, but who was inspecting?  Was it administrative staff, a structural engineer or a quantity surveyor?  Also, there are issues around planning enforcement in terms of planning and building regulations with respect to the impact there.  If those questions could be included in the letter to the Department, that would inform our decision on this issue next week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-25a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018102500002#B01100"><p>We are agreeing to write to the Department on those lines.  We should ask it at this stage for the contract price for each of the schools involved.  If we are sorting out the money side of this issue, we need to know the global cost of what is involved.  We want to be specific on that.  I propose that we write to the Department and ask that it reply by 13 November, as we have a meeting on 15 November.  The Department will need a week or two to reply.  If we get a quick reply, it will not be remotely complete.  We will give it at least a fortnight and there will be updates on that.  I am sure the Joint Committee on Education and Skills will deal with this issue but we will focus on the points that were mentioned, namely, the teaching, alternative accommodation, and the health and safety of students.  The joint committee will inevitably deal with that latter aspect.</p> <p>  A substantial element of the issue, however, involves the contract, the procurement process, the tendering, supervision and cost of the project.  Regarding each contract, and the Department can give us the information in a variety of ways, but, in terms of the company that won the contract to build the schools, I want to know what was the next highest price submitted by the alternative contractors.  Did the company that was awarded the contract come in as the cheapest all round?  In terms of its bid, where was it in the ranking?  Was it marginally below the second one on the list or was it well below it?  We would be worried if it was very well below the industry norm at the time.  If it was, that in itself should have set off alarm bells.  We want to examine that tendering process.  We will seek that additional information from the Department on each of the tenders.  We will ask it to give us as much information as it can supply by 13 November.  That is a good two weeks away, and at that stage we can assess the issue at our meeting on 15 November.  That is very helpful and I thank the members for raising that issue.</p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence received since the last meeting.  Under category A - briefing documents and opening statements, No. 1668 A is from Ms Karen Murphy from the Irish Council of Social Housing, dated 19 October, providing a briefing note for today's meeting, including an overview of social housing provided by approved housing bodies, progress on publicly funded social housing outputs 2015&ndash;2018, the total amount of funding approved and received from public sources, and details of lands transferred by any public bodies between 2015 and 2018.  We will note and publish that.  We will return to this topic in November.</p></speech>

We are holding it over.  All items related to the housing issue will be noted for today but they will be on our agenda for when have our second meeting on the housing situation, which will be on 29 November.</p></speech>

Chapter 10 in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report today, on which we have commented, is on the approved housing bodies.  There is no statutory regulation there.  The Comptroller and Auditor General made that point very clear in his report last month.  We will be dealing with that issue and it is fair to raise it today.  While the people from the Irish Council for Social Housing are not here today, the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will be before committee.</p></speech>

Can we ensure that we get that as soon as it comes in and that we do not have to keep chasing it up?  As soon as the Department has that, it should come to us as quickly as possible.  It will be an interesting observation.</p></speech>

That was an important issue which came out the last day.  The next items are No. 1670 A and 1671 A from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, dated 18 October, providing briefing information for today's meeting on Vote 34, specifically, details on lands transferred to approved housing bodies, details of publicly owned land, the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, and a note on the funding progress on a county-by-county basis.  We will note and publish this.</p> <p>  No. 1680 A is from Mr. John O'Connor, CEO of the Housing Agency, dated 23 October 2018, and it is his opening statement.  We will note and publish this.</p> <p>  No. 1681 A is from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and it is his opening statement.  We will note and publish this.</p> <p>  The next category is B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers as a follow-up to the Committee of Public Accounts.  We held over the following items and are continuing to hold them over.  There are a number of items from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform responding to our previous periodic report.  There is detailed correspondence, running to hundreds of pages, from the HSE, following up on our earlier meeting.  We held over quite a lot over the summer because we had 100 items to deal with.  I propose that for each meeting, we take one chunk and deal with it.  I propose that, at the next meeting, we deal with the responses from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with regard to our previous periodic reports.  It was slow to get to us so we do not want to be any slower following up.  We will move on and clear a large chunk each time.  I will note the reference numbers, which we have noted before.  They are Nos. 1482 B, 1486 B, 1490 B, 1502 B, 1510 B, 1513 B, 1526 B, 1528 B, 1530 B, 1538 B, 1560 B and 1561 B.  We have held all those over from the previous meeting and we will deal with them as well as we can from the next meeting onwards.</p></speech>

I note that we had that before and it is being held over again.</p> <p>  No. 1640 B is from Mr. Timothy Owens, chief executive of Cork Education and Training Board, ETB, providing further information requested by the committee regarding employment policies in Cork ETB.  The item was held over from last week's meeting.  It was agreed to circulate the transcript of a meeting of the committee in 2015 and this was circulated to members yesterday.  I wondered what was going on when I got that 90 page email.  I was scratching my head, wondering why that was asked for, and this is the answer.  In the meantime, the correspondent who made the original enquiry and is the subject matter of the case has contacted the secretariat for a copy of the letter from the ETB and I propose to send this to the correspondent.  We will also note and publish the correspondence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 1649 B is from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;.  It relates to a previous item and is a response to a question regarding the possible prohibiting of people from applying for employment or re-employment as part of any legal settlement.  This came to our attention in relation to Cork ETB.  We will note and publish this and send it to the correspondent who has contacted us on this topic.</p> <p>  No. 1650 B is from Ms Kerrie-Anne Galvin from the National Treatment Purchase Fund on a review of the pricing mechanism for long-term residential care in the private and voluntary sector.

We dealt with this issue with private nursing home providers when we had them in before us.  I am not sure why it is taking so long.  They say they were tied up with budgetary matters and other issues but I think it is unacceptable.  It has implications for private and voluntary nursing homes because they will be setting a new pricing mechanism.  They have said they will have it next month.  They are meeting the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

If the steering group is in place to do a particular job, it should have done it.  It seems the issue is sitting there, with a steering group which meets whenever it feels like it rather than having any sense of urgency.  I advise that we go back and say that we think it should happen as quickly as possible.  As soon as they have that report, it should be provided to the Committee of Public Accounts.</p></speech>

At this point, they are holding up the committee in its work on completing our periodic report.  It is only as a result of that that they are now saying that they will meet next month.

We will ask the officer liaising between the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and our committee to circulate a note on that issue rather than going around the houses asking the Departments and everyone else.  That will be sent out to us during the week and we are going to keep track of it.</p><p>Next is No.<b></b>1657 B from Ms Mary Lawlor, communications department, NAMA, providing an information note requested by the committee on the &euro;24 billion sale of underlying assets with a geographic breakdown of where the purchasers were located.  She does not answer the question.  The information is interesting, but when I read it for the third time, I realised she did not answer the question.  There is a very short paragraph that I want to read out.  We had asked for a note on the &euro;24 billion sale of underlying assets with a geographic breakdown of where the purchasers were located.  That was straightforward.  The reply is three sentences:</p><blockquote>Since inception, &euro;24 billion has been generated from the sales of secured assets by NAMA debtors and receivers.  Of this, &euro;13.2 billion was generated from the sales of assets located outside of Ireland.  Based on our analysis, the geographic location of the purchasers of assets located in Ireland is set out in the table.</blockquote> <p>They have given us a table but we asked for a breakdown of the &euro;24 billion and the geographic breakdown of where the purchasers were located.  In the second sentence, she confirms that &euro;13.2 billion or 55% of the assets were located outside Ireland, but the banks and loans fell to the Irish taxpayer.  I am not worried about where the property was that fell to the Irish taxpayer.  Then she proceeds to give us a breakdown of the locations of the purchasers of the 45% of the assets that were located in Ireland.  She only gave us a breakdown of a subset of the &euro;24 billion.  We will send it straight back and say we want the original question answered.  She broke our question into two halves and answered one half of it.  That is not satisfactory.  We will note and publish it but we are writing back for a proper answer.</p><p>Next is<b></b>No. 1659 B from Mr Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, providing information requested by the committee on the costs incurred by the State for the recent visit by Pope Francis to Ireland.  The original inquiry referenced article 44.2 of the Constitution, which provides that the State guarantees not to endow any religion. We will note and publish the response.  The response says that the Papal visit will not cost any more than the &euro;20 million budget approved for the visit.  That is one figure I want to put on the record.</p></speech>

That will be accounted for in respect of this visit.  There was quite a short lead-in time in terms of the known date and procurement for other aspects such as fencing and so on.  It does not strike me that there was time to have adequate procurement on this with multiple tenders and so on.  There is an issue around that.  What are the various aspects under the remit of the Office of Public Works, OPW?  We know about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  What are the other headings?  I think there is an issue in respect of one or two things.  It would be useful to write to the OPW asking for the headings of those so we can see if there is an issue with the fairly sizeable amounts.  I am not talking about high-visibility jackets and things like that.  I am talking about the serious spending.</p></speech>

Here we are told the OPW has advised that expenditure to date is &euro;14.1 million.  Then they give us a remark about Garda overtime which might be approximately &euro;5.2 million.  We need a breakdown of the &euro;14.1 million from the OPW.  That is reasonable.  We will write directly to the OPW as the Deputy has suggested.  In the meantime we will note and publish this.</p> <p>  Next is No. 1662 B from Mr Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, providing an update to the committee regarding the transfer of properties in respect of contributions from religious congregations towards the costs incurred by the State in responding to residential institutional child abuse.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-25a.54" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018102500002#D00500"><p>I welcome the update from Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;.  It is clear.  What is not clear is why it has taken so long.  Going back to the 2002 indemnity agreement, 16 years later, five properties remain to be transferred fully.  It was expected that four of these properties would have transferred by the end of quarter 3 of this year.  The current position is that three of the five will transfer by the end of the year, one by the first half of next year, and I do not know when the fifth will transfer.  That is outstanding.</p> <p>  If we go to the 2009 voluntary offers, I have followed matters up with the assistance of the Chair, who has been very attentive to it.  They arose as a result of the Ryan report and its damning findings.  Properties were offered on a voluntary basis.  We were led to believe there would be no difficulty.  That was in 2009 and of those 18 properties, nine still have not been transferred in 2018.  I see that there is progress and that a lot of those buildings and properties are in use by various State bodies.  I welcome that.</p> <p>  Coming to Galway and St. Anne's, Lenaboy, if anything typifies or brings into acute focus this whole scheme it is Lenaboy in Galway, which I think is empty since 2009 although I am told it has been empty officially since 2011.  Galway City Council announced it was a gift.  I have gone into that background and will not do so again.  It was not a gift.  It was given by way of redress.  It has, inexplicably, remained empty since 2009 or at least 2011, and now we are told that a geophysical survey was carried out.  I realise that was under way.  I did not realise the city council had requested it.  I understand that the results of the geophysical survey have not yet been provided to the congregation.  A geophysical survey was commissioned.  It is very important to see the results.</p> <p>  The context of the mother and baby home in Tuam is only relevant to today's proceedings insofar as we again have a Minister saying that the sisters of the Bon Secours are willing to give so much money.  We are back again.  We do not know the circumstances.  It seems the Minister approached them for a contribution but it is not put in context.  It is very important to give context in these matters.  The context here is that this particular building at Lenaboy was never given as a gift.  It was given as redress and it is inexplicably empty and deteriorating at a terrible rate since it became empty.  In this regard and in respect of the other ones, I simply do not understand the role of the Department of Education and Skills or how it failed to ensure these agreements were complied with in a more speedy fashion.  I do welcome the Department's continual updates and I welcome the progress.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-25a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018102500002#D00600"><p>Some of these are from 2002 and 2009.  Obviously the 2002 properties are a legal obligation and the 2009 ones are a moral obligation.  Given the particular sector in question, I would have thought the moral obligation would have been almost on a par with the legal obligation, but so be it.  We have all said this kind of stuff before.</p> <p>  I want to find out about one or two practical things.  The HSE and the Department of Education and Skills are pursuing the matter with different organisations because some of the facilities are being used, for example No. 15, the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  There is work being pursued on one of them.  I am talking about No. 15.  This offer comprises the lease of land for the operation of the National Rehabilitation Hospital and the transfer of a 33 acre site.  It is stated that this transfer will facilitate the redevelopment of the hospital.</p><p>That project is under way.</p><p> The final paragraph states that work on this complex transfer is progressing but is taking longer than expected.  The estimated timeframe for completion is the third quarter of 2019.  Is the lack of clear title and spending of public money on a development delaying that?  Is there duplication going on between the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE?  How is that working in practice?  It costs money to follow this up.  Is the lack of clear title causing a problem?  Since the HSE has an involvement, perhaps we should ask it about that and about how it relates to the Department of Education and Skills.  A few relate to the HSE, not just that one.</p></speech>

Let us be honest about it.  This scheme, which was put in place in 2002, is a joke.  Many of us commented on the fact that the religious orders got off the hook almost completely.

This has been going on for 16 years.  I want to say to the Accounting Officer that it says something about how the Department of Education and Skills follows up issues relating to taxpayers' money.  I hope it does not have broader implications across the public service.  As a result of our previous meeting, the committee asked for a breakdown report by report.  On 23 July, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; wrote to us with a detailed breakdown.  He gave us those commitments, we did not ask him to do so.  In respect of each of the outstanding properties, we asked him to provide a breakdown as to the position at the end of June 2018 and the timescale for completion.  That letter was dated 23 July.  I am referring to the commitments he voluntarily gave last June.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; outlined which items would be completed by the end of September.  We gave him further time.  At the end of September, we asked him how he had got on in respect of the commitments he gave to the committee in writing in June.</p> <p>  I will now outline the current situation.  I have the letter Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; sent to the committee in June.  The heading is "Properties not fully and finally completed under the 2002 agreement".  We are discussing the 2002 agreement.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; told us in July that the estimated date for completion regarding the property at Waterpark, Newtown Road, County Waterford, was the end of September.  That was his commitment.  Today, he states that the estimated timeframe has moved to the second quarter of 2019.  Not only did he not meet the commitment he gave to us for the end of September, in his most recent letter he has moved the completion date out by nine months to the end of next June.  That is unacceptable.</p> <p>  The next property Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; mentions is Coisc&eacute;im, Cappoquin, County Waterford.  The commitment he provided in respect of that property was that the estimated timeframe for completion was the end of September.  That had been revised from the previous quarter.  What happened with that commitment for the end of September?  The estimated timeframe is now the end of the fourth quarter.  That has been moved back by three months and the commitment not been delivered upon.</p> <p>  The next item on Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;'s list was the fifth item on his list for the last day.  It refers to the Sacred Heart centre in Waterford.  The estimated time he gave the committee for completion in that instance was the end of September.  That had also been moved already from a previous commitment.  His response to us today is that it is now being pushed back a further three months.</p> <p>  In the context of the 2002 agreement, none of the three commitments Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; gave to us in writing has been honoured.  That is the problem.  I do not mind once it has been done but I am not going to have people give commitments to this committee in writing and then fail to honour them.  There has been 100% failure to meet the deadlines.  They are Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;'s deadlines.  We will accept the current deadlines he has provided.  They are the ones he has chosen for the second or third time, but they had better be honoured in full.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; is not to come back seeking a further update.  If he has a problem, he must inform the committee.  If he does not believe those commitments are achievable, why is he stating in writing that they are achievable?</p></speech>

The question is what has happened?  Did he not give proper consideration when he provided the initial deadlines or has something happened in the meantime?  We want to know.  I will finish the record then and speed matters up a bit.  This is no better.  Appendix 2 lists properties accepted for transfer under the 2009 voluntary agreement.  The situation in this regard is something similar.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; has moved the commitment in respect of St. Bernard's group home, Fethard, County Tipperary.  It was to be completed at the end of the third quarter.  That has now moved to the end of the fourth quarter 2018.  On lands in respect of Convent Road, Cahir, County Tipperary, that was to be completed at the end of the third quarter 2018 and has now moved to the end of the fourth quarter, another three months.  The property in Ballyjamesduff in County Cavan had a revised timeframe that was to be the end of 2018 and Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; is now moving it to the end of June 2019.  He is moving that back by six months.  We also had Scoil Ph&aacute;draig primary school, Altamont Street, Westport, County Mayo.  The estimated timeframe there has been moved from the end of 2018 to the end of June 2019.  As far as I can see, none of the commitments given to the committee has been honoured.</p></speech>

That is what has happened for 14 consecutive years.  It is not going to continue.  Somebody has to call a halt.  I am saying to the Department of Education and Skills that the Office of the Chief State Solicitor or whichever State body has responsibility is not getting the business done from a legal perspective.  I do not want to have to bring Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; back before the committee to deal with this matter.  We will have to do so, however, if this keeps happening.  I do not intend to do it at this stage.  We will accept these current deadlines but we want to know why Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; provided the original deadlines, why these were not me and how confident he is in the context of the new deadlines.  If Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; does not meet his new deadlines, he will be explaining why on a case-by-case basis.  I am sorry for going on about this but if the committee is to be thorough in its work, that is the nitty-gritty end of the business we have to do in order to send a signal.</p><p>In the future, we will not accept letters containing commitments if we can identify, with the passage of time, a failure to honour previous commitments.</p><p> No. 1664B is correspondence from Mr. Jim McGlynn, director of organisation support and development, Donegal ETB, dated 17 October 2018, providing information requested by the committee regarding a payment made to the Revenue Commissioners on foot of an underpayment of PRSI in the period 1997 to 2011.  We will note and publish this.</p><p> No. 1666B is correspondence from Mr. Ray Mitchell, assistant national director, HSE, dated 18 October 2018, in response to two requests from the committee for information on the direct and indirect costs of the Portlaoise review group and the charging of residents for incontinence wear at the Brothers of Charity Services in Roscommon.  On the cost of the Portlaoise review group, the HSE confirmed the legal fees.</p></speech>

The legal fees were &euro;94,340 and the cost of the investigating team was &euro;305,320.34, giving a total cost of &euro;399,660.34.  There were no significant indirect costs because the members of the review group were all external to the service.  We will note and publish that information.</p> <p>  On the charging of residents for incontinence wear, we will note and publish the response and send a copy to Deputy Fitzmaurice, who made the original inquiry.</p></speech>

I am concerned that the HSE is not fully up to speed with the situation.  The HSE did not exist in 1997 so, presumably, the reference is to the relevant health board.  This group was charging a daily rate, in the normal way, of &euro;12.50 and, in addition, was charging people for incontinence wear.  The issue was pursued by a long-term resident's family and eventually the HSE and the group were dragged, kicking and screaming, to reimburse some money to the individuals' families.</p> <p>  The note before us states that those involved have got all their money but I have information to suggest otherwise and that some people were not reimbursed for the period 1997 to 2001.  A family raised the issue in 2013 and was refunded &euro;6,000 out of a possible &euro;21,000, meaning &euro;15,000 remained outstanding.  On the back of the 2005 change, the Minister of the day, Mary Harney, introduced legislation to deal with illegal charges.  However, for this one resident, the service decided to impose a retrospective, long-term-stay charge to reduce the &euro;15,000 that it may have been applicable to return.  The situation continued for a number of years, with families being put through an extraordinary level of difficulty.  Questions were not answered and there is a deeper problem than is covered in this note.  I would like the section 38 organisation, along with the appropriate people from the HSE, to join us in order to discuss the matter in more detail.  This note suggests that the synergy project, Mary Harney's legislation and the HSE's own initiatives, dealt with the problem but that is not the case.  The evidence will show that those involved were dragged, kicking and screaming, to acknowledge this as an issue and to refund the money in full.  To this day, moneys from the period 1997 to 2001 remain outstanding for some families.  I also have concerns that the Ombudsman closed the case without adequately dealing with all the facts.</p> <p>  Public money has been provided to the Brothers of Charity Services - most recently &euro;105,335, on a once-off basis, for this year - so we could usefully have this section 38 organisation before us, together with the appropriate people from the HSE.  In advance, and, if necessary, with names redacted, they might provide us with details of how much was charged to these individuals, how much was refunded and when.  It could be a short deliberation but it is necessary because I am not entirely comfortable with the idea that this might be replicated elsewhere.</p></speech>

In my previous job, I had reason to notice that it is not just incontinence products that are not covered, or "coded", by the HSE.  Complex syringes are not covered either.  We often hear of residents getting a bill for blister packing of medications, for catheters and for incontinence wear.  Incontinence wear is generally provided for in a public health place and people put it in the boot of their cars.  There is luxury incontinence wear for which there is a differential in price, and people sometimes have a preference for it over the product provided by the State.  It might be wise to look at the charges for people in nursing homes on top of their basic rate.  One hears of charges for certain activities and for mass, for example, so it may be a wider issue.</p></speech>

The Ombudsman was before the Committee on Public Petitions to discuss the report into additional charges in the nursing home sector and the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, also appeared before the committee in recent weeks.  There are detailed reports on it.  The private sector is beyond the scope of investigations by the Houses of the Oireachtas but it is worth noting.</p></speech>

I have come across matters such as mattresses being required.  It is across the spectrum.</p> <p>  The other response concerned the Portlaoise review group.  I recall somebody stating that other inquiries that were carried out should not just sit there and be viewed as nothing more than a cost and that lessons should be learned from them.

This is an issue to which we will return when the representatives from the State Claims Agency appear before us in a fortnight to discuss medical negligence.</p> <p>  In the meantime, I have given an undertaking to follow up on this matter. I will communicate further with the family I met during the summer in order to touch base with them before we make direct contact with the section 39 organisation.  Deputy O'Connell suggested that we broaden our examination to include other matters.  However, Deputy Cassells indicated that the Ombudsman has compiled a report.  The first action we must take is to have that report circulated to members in order to discover whether it contains information on which we can follow up.  We are not going to redo the Ombudsman's work.</p></speech>

I welcome it.  This is something on which we are keeping a close eye in view of what happened with the P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema in Galway and the failure of governance and Department oversight there.  The letter reassures us that the Department is monitoring this matter closely and that an audit committee, on which the Minister is represented, has been set up and meets regularly.  I remain concerned, however, that there is no performance delivery agreement for the Galway 2020 programme.  I have asked numerous parliamentary questions and followed the issue up here.  I have been informed that it is coming and that the terms of the agreement set out the conditions for the release of the funds.  Presumably, this means that they will do so.  We are talking about &euro;15 million.  Some &euro;250,000 has already been disbursed and a further &euro;6 million will be disbursed in 2019.</p> <p>  I am raising this matter because we have been here already with the P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema.  We have been here with a special chapter from the Department.  All of these are very good ideas.  The P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema was a very good idea.  It is a privilege for Galway to be named European Capital of Culture 2020, but the operation of it is a completely different matter.  The performance delivery agreement is at an advanced stage of negotiation.  In the meantime, a series of people have left the board in Galway.  It is interesting that we have a head of programme, a head of production, a director of communications, a director of finance and operations and a head of human resources for Galway 2020, but we do not yet have anyone in charge of the culture and leadership role.  The Department recognises that this is important.  The Galway 2020 programme seriously lacks of someone in charge with, in the Department's terms "the required creative talent".</p> <p>  I highlight this because we look back on the P&aacute;l&aacute;s Cinema story and we cannot do anything about it.  We can certainly do something about the governance of this from the Department's point of view and from our own.  I would like to see a performance delivery agreement or whatever it is called.</p></speech>

As I mentioned, due to the fact we are dealing with housing, we had asked the county and city managers to send a representative in view of their very senior positions and key role in delivering social and affordable housing.  As we know, the CCMA is not under the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts but I propose we write to it again asking it to assist us in a voluntary capacity and to be helpful to the committee and the Oireachtas in examining the housing issue.  The CCMA has knowledge and information that could be helpful to the public.  It has a key role and I do not mind whether the individual chief executives come in or whether they come in formally representing the CCMA but we need to see some people who can assist this committee in its work.  We will write back in that vein.</p></speech>

Like the Chairman, I do not mind if the CCMA sends in one representative, be it the chairperson or someone else, or if individual CEOs come in.  We can bring in the 40 or so CEOs and get deck chairs but I have consistently said that they have a statutory responsibility to this State and its citizens and they are as important to delivery of services as any Secretary General or Minister.  They are a linchpin in the delivery of services in society because at this level in the Houses of the Oireachtas we allocate money on a headline figure basis and the implementation of that then goes to the chief executive officers who are given a high standing within this society.  It is imperative that the CCMA sends a representative and participates in this committee on these matters.</p></speech>

I refer to drilling down into some of the aspects.  Housing goes across a range of different departments within a local authority - for example, the oversight of approved housing bodies is one while the likes of the delivery of local authority housing and builds is another.  Then there is the finance section that would deal with everything from local authority loans to HAP, rent and issues like that.  There are elements to it and it may well be worth our while identifying the elements that they could be helpful to us on because the oversight is fragmented and it is not possible to close that circle without having that side of it reflected.  It might be worth our while identifying specific pieces.  It may well want to bring in the director of service of a particular local authority where there are many approved housing bodies.  That can provide a more nuanced understanding of it where there is a day to day responsibility.</p></speech>

We will write back to CCMA because we need the CEOs, as very senior public servants who have a key role in delivering houses, to assist the Oireachtas.

We will note and publish this.  This is an effort to ensure the work of the Joint Committee on Health, which is also looking at this, is not duplicated by the Committee of Public Accounts.  In terms of value for money, tendering for contracts with the laboratories and financial matters, the Committee of Public Accounts can deal with those issues.  It is good to clarify that.  </p><p>No. 1676 B is correspondence received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, regarding the appointment of Mr. Brendan Gleeson as Accounting Officer for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We will note and publish this.</p><p>Moving to category C, No. 1595 C was held over from the last time.  No. 1652 C is correspondence received from an individual dated 16 October 2018.  The secretariat has sought the permission of the individual to forward an earlier query regarding waiting lists for psychological assessments to the HSE.  Since then, the individual has let us know there have been some developments.  However, she raises a question in relation to what she suggests may be <i>ad hoc</i>administration of the waiting list.  While this may be a matter for the Joint Committee on Health to look at, I propose we request a note from the HSE in relation to the matter.Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 1654 C is correspondence received from an individual dated 16 October 2018, regarding the funding and ethics of research undertaken by higher education institutions.  The correspondence has also been sent to the Department of Education and Skills.  The matter raised falls within our remit, or forms part of our engagement with the third level sector.  We will continue to work on that area.  No. 1658 C is correspondence received from an individual dated 16 October 2018, raising matters with the committee in relation to electricity interconnector.  I propose we seek a note from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on the points raised.</p><p>No. 1661 C is correspondence received from an individual dated 17 October 2018, regarding the University of Limerick.  I propose we write to the individual to inform him that the committee will be examining the matters relating to the University of Limerick when it receives an upcoming report from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We will be in further contact with the individual at that stage.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 1663 C is correspondence received from Deputy Catherine Murphy, regarding the Hannaway report.  We previously requested the report and the HSE provided a number of slides, but according to the information provided to Deputy Catherine Murphy, this is not the full report.  We will again request that the HSE provide the full report.  Is that satisfactory?</p></speech>

The original contract was up to 2019 but in 2017 it was extended to 2030 without a tender.  Another entity was looking to tender for the contract, prior to it being rolled over.  Essentially, I am asking if value for money was obtained from rolling it over to 2030, particularly when three or four months later a State entity purchased a more lucrative contract.

Therefore, this is the first of two meetings.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off entirely or to aeroplane mode.  Merely putting them on silent will still interfere with the recording system.</p><p>I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 186 that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions put by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.</p><p>We will take the opening statement from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-25a.190" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018102500002#K00600"><p>The 2017 appropriation accounts for Vote 34 - Housing, Planning and Local Government records gross expenditure of just over &euro;2 billion in 2017.  As the figure indicates, housing-related expenditure accounted for 63% of that expenditure.  The Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, usually referred to simply as the Housing Agency, operates under the aegis of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The agency&rsquo;s role is to provide a range of support services to assist the Department, local authorities and approved housing bodies in the discharge of their functions.  This includes implementation by the agency of the pyrite remediation scheme.</p> <p>  The Housing Agency is mainly funded through State grants.  Its income in 2017 was just over &euro;34 million.  Expenditure in the year was &euro;33.1 million, of which payments under the pyrite remediation scheme accounted for &euro;25.3 million.  The agency has two roles relevant to housing provision that might not be immediately obvious from the principal financial statements.  First, in 2016 and 2017, the agency received capital grant funding of over &euro;70 million from the Department which it used to establish a revolving fund for social housing acquisition.  Using the fund&rsquo;s resources, the Housing Agency acts as an intermediary, purchasing targeted suitable residential properties from banks, investors and other owners.  The properties are then sold on to the relevant approved housing bodies, which are not-for-profit organisations that provide and manage housing for people with a housing need.  Second, at end-2017, the agency held 243 ha of residential development land in 72 locations.  This land was transferred to the agency from local authorities under the land aggregation scheme that operated between 2010 and 2013.  The agency does not have the authority to dispose of or develop the land without ministerial sanction, and carries the land at a token value in the financial statements.</p> <p>  I turn now to chapter 10 on funding and oversight of approved housing bodies.  Both local authorities and approved housing bodies are outside my audit remit.  As Members are aware, the local authorities are subject to audit annually by the Local Government Audit Service.  I felt it might be useful to examine how the Department gains assurance about the effectiveness of the use of the resources being channelled through the local authorities to the approved housing bodies.  That examination resulted in the chapter that is before the committee today.</p> <p>  The report sets the context for operation of the approved housing bodies by outlining the range of schemes used to provide social housing or to support households in rental accommodation, and the associated costs in 2017.  When we tried to match the scheme expenditure with output data, we found the Department does not currently report outputs on a scheme-by-scheme basis.  We also found that the Department does not report the size of the social housing stock.  It has figures for local authority stocks but not for social housing held by the approved housing bodies.</p> <p>  In 2017, the Department provided capital funding of just over &euro;180 million to the approved housing bodies through four schemes.  The schemes involve varying degrees of complexity in terms of flow of funds between the Department, the local authorities, the Housing Finance Agency and the housing bodies.  We have tried to summarise those fund flows in diagrams in the chapter.  The key message from this analysis is that the bulk of the capital funding for the housing bodies' stock of properties comes from public sources.</p> <p>  We found there is currently no statutory regulation of the housing bodies.  An interim regulation office was set up within the Housing Agency which launched a voluntary regulation code for such bodies in July 2013.  By mid-2018, 246 bodies had signed up to that code, which represents less than half of the housing bodies registered with the Department.  However, the Department has pointed out that the bodies that have signed up for the voluntary code account for an estimated 95% of the housing stock of the sector.</p> <p>  The chapter recommended introducing a process for identifying inactive housing bodies so that they do not retain approved status indefinitely.  The Department has committed to tidying up the register prior to the introduction of statutory regulation.</p> <p>  In December 2015, the Local Government Audit Service published a report on the oversight role of local authorities in the provision of social housing by approved housing bodies.  That report recommended that a review and reconciliation of all mortgages charged on housing body properties should be carried out and that a comprehensive management information system should be put in place in local authorities to record details of properties and their tenants.  As we were completing the chapter in September 2018, the Local Government Audit Service was reviewing the implementation of its recommendations.</p> <p>  The chapter also makes a recommendation aimed to ensure that the standard requirements in regard to the management of Exchequer grants are met in regard to the oversight of public funds provided to approved housing bodies.  The Department is undertaking a review of all circulars relating to approved housing body activity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-25a.191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018102500002#L00100"><p>Chairman and members, I am pleased to be here this morning, as Accounting Officer, to assist the committee in its examination of Vote 34, insofar as it relates to housing supply issues, and its consideration of chapter 10 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report 2017, concerning the funding and oversight of approved housing bodies, AHBs.</p> <p>  I am joined by a number of colleagues who the Chairman has already introduced.  As requested, I have provided some advance briefing on housing expenditure and delivery, as well as a range of notes on specific issues of interest that had been raised by the committee, so I will keep these opening comments brief.</p> <p>  In terms of Vote 34, the Department&rsquo;s gross voted expenditure on housing programmes, as set out in the subheads of the appropriation account before the committee today, totalled some &euro;1.3 billion in 2017.  This includes an additional &euro;100 million that was provided to the local authority housing and regeneration subheads by way of Supplementary Estimate towards the end of 2017, to meet costs arising from the level of housing-related activity then under way across the country.  A further &euro;98 million was also made available in 2017 from surplus local property tax, LPT, receipts to fund housing programmes, bringing the overall total resourcing for the Department&rsquo;s housing programmes to over &euro;1.4 billion in 2017.</p> <p>  The implementation of the Government&rsquo;s Rebuilding Ireland action plan is the core focus of our daily work in the Department and, indeed, across central and local government, as we strive to make meaningful, tangible and sustainable progress towards a better housing landscape.  I and my colleagues in the Department, together with our Ministers, are firmly committed to achieving the maximum outputs possible from State investment, both current and capital, while ensuring that close attention is paid to delivering value for money and tangible housing outcomes for citizens.  We are committed to regular review of policy and delivery and work very closely with colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in this regard.</p> <p>  Rebuilding Ireland is a six year action plan, with a very firm emphasis on delivery across the full range of housing mechanisms.  All stakeholders agree that accelerating the delivery of new build activity is absolutely critical.  At the outset of the programme, however, we knew that establishing viable pipelines and building local authority and AHB capacity to expand new build delivery would take time, taking particular account of the significant extent to which house building, both in the general market and of social housing, had contracted.  Therefore, in parallel with driving increased capacity building, we focused also on harnessing the potential of the available housing stock.</p> <p>  In summary, Rebuilding Ireland seeks to achieve the delivery of some 50,000 additional social housing homes through build, acquisition and leasing schemes, out to 2021.  A further 87,000 households will have their needs met under the housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation, RAS, schemes.  The relative contributions of individual programmes to overall delivery is to shift significantly over the course of the six years, taking particular account of the substantial increase in the delivery of new build social housing homes as the programme progresses.</p> <p>  During 2017, significant progress was made to deliver on the commitments in Rebuilding Ireland.  In overall terms, housing supports were delivered to some 25,900 households last year, through the range of social housing measures in Rebuilding Ireland, which were significantly ahead of the target of 21,050.  Within this, almost 2,300 new build social housing homes were delivered, more than three times the level in the previous year.  In addition, wider housing supply continued to grow, with the number of new homes becoming available for use reaching 18,222 in 2017, an increase of 29% on 2016.</p> <p>  Significant progress was made in 2017 in advancing many social housing projects, through the range of delivery mechanisms and programmes.  By the end of last year, a substantial construction pipeline was in place, which will result in further increases in the number of new social housing homes being built this year and in the coming years.</p> <p>  This year is a critical year for delivery.  Pipelines established over the last two years, in particular, are yielding fruit, with the number of private and social homes on-site and completions increasing quarter on quarter.  While this is welcome, there remains very significant further progress to be made right through to the end of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan.  There is absolutely no room for complacency and we continue to actively monitor, refocus as necessary and mobilise the range of players involved in order to achieve our ambitions in what is a very challenging landscape.</p> <p>  Nowhere is this more evident than with regard to homelessness.  It is essential that supply continues to increase if we are to address both the backlog of housing demand in the system, and also new demand arising.  While Rebuilding Ireland is heavily focused on this, in the interim we must, and are, continuing to work to provide the most appropriate accommodation possible for those of our citizens who find themselves in immediate housing need.  The programme of family hubs is intended to provide more family-friendly transition accommodation, and the implementation of the HAP placefinder service will further assist families in various types of emergency accommodation to transition into more long-term housing solutions.  One of our key areas of focus is on prevention and avoiding the use of emergency accommodation wherever possible by matching families and individuals in need with appropriate accommodation.</p> <p>  While the numbers presenting to homeless services continue to be very challenging, the numbers for whom pathways to more sustainable housing solutions are secured are also increasing significantly.  A record 4,729 adults exited homelessness into an independent tenancy in 2017, with a further 2,332 adults in the first 6 months of this year.</p> <p>  Overall, in the first two and a half years of Rebuilding Ireland up to the end of the second quarter of 2018, housing solutions have been delivered for over 57,000 households across all delivery streams.  The impact of this delivery can be seen in the year on year reduction in local authority housing waiting lists.</p> <p>  In addition to highlighting outputs, it is critical to mention the pipelines for future delivery, particularly new build homes, that are now being put in place.  The latest social housing construction status report published on the Department&rsquo;s website provides significant detail on projects at various stages of advancement across a range of delivery schemes led by local authorities and AHBs as at the end of the second quarter of this year.  Overall, we can see a substantial increase in the scale of the build programme since end 2016, when it included over 500 projects, delivering more than 8,400 homes.  By end of the second quarter of 2018, the programme had virtually doubled in size to over 1,060 projects and 16,350 homes.  Some 3,518 of these homes have already been delivered, 4,602 more were on site and under construction, and a further 1,577 were at the final pre-construction stage, with the remainder progressing through the various stages of planning, procurement and design.</p> <p>  In the second quarter of 2018 alone, projects delivering almost 1,100 homes went on site, an increase of 27% on the previous quarter and an increase of 239% on the second quarter in 2017.</p> <p>  Table 1, which I have circulated in the briefing paper, sets out for the information of the committee the key Rebuilding Ireland targets for the period 2016 to 2021 and details the progress that has been made to mid-2018.  Delivering on this scale, and committing to doing even more, is crucially dependent on effective cross-organisational co-operation.  Within the policy and legislative decisions made at political level, the Department provides the funding streams to support delivery.  However, on the ground activity and delivery can only be accelerated by local authorities, the Housing Agency and AHBs working in partnership.</p> <p>  Turning to chapter 10, as I have highlighted, AHBs play an important role in our work to address housing need.  Indeed in terms of social housing delivery, it is expected that AHBs will deliver up to one third of all build, acquired and leased social housing homes out to 2021.  Given that the sector has been mandated to deliver on this scale, it is imperative that appropriate structures and oversight mechanisms are in place.  Chapter 10 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report provides an account of the range of the housing programmes generally, including detail on AHB delivery and the associated funding and oversight arrangements for local authorities to deliver social housing supports in partnership with AHBs.  Funding under these programmes is provided by</p> <p>my Department directly to local authorities, which in turn advance the funding to AHBs, as appropriate, with robust arrangements and agreements in place in order to ensure value for money and quality delivery.</p> <p>  A number of years ago, the Department recognised the need to put in place a more comprehensive regulatory regime for the AHB sector, beyond that which had been put in place historically under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  Rather than wait for the development of legislative proposals for this purpose, in parallel, a voluntary regulation code, entitled, Building for the Future - A Voluntary Regulation Code for Approved Housing Bodies in Ireland, was put in place as an interim step.  The implementation of the code is overseen by the interim regulation committee, IRC, based in the Housing Agency.  Since the code was put in place, any AHB applying for housing funding from the Department and local authorities must furnish proof of compliance with the code.  This interim arrangement will be built on by a new statutory regime, which will include placing the code on a statutory basis.  The Department is at an advanced stage in preparing the necessary legislation under which the regulator will be responsible for approving and registering housing bodies, setting standards for the sector and ensuring AHB compliance with the standards, and will be provided with the necessary powers to fulfil that role.  Subject to Government approval, it is expected that the Bill will be published in the coming weeks.</p> <p>  In these opening remarks, I have touched on the important work of my Department, local authorities, the AHBs and other partner bodies to address the housing challenges that we face and to support our most vulnerable citizens, while managing long-term programmes to create a clear pathway to a more stable and sustainable housing sector.  I and my colleagues will be happy to respond to questions or issues that emerge in the course of the committee&rsquo;s work today.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

The Housing Agency works with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, local authorities, approved housing bodies and others in the public and private sectors in meeting the current and future housing needs and demands.  For example, in the last few weeks, the Housing Agency has provided an apartment building to one of the homeless charities; has concluded an agreement to deliver a large housing project for Dublin City Council; and has finalised an agreement to deliver 155 housing and apartments for social and affordable rental housing on Housing Agency land in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.</p><p>The Housing Agency supports direct delivery initiatives such as the acquisition of vacant properties from banks centrally through the use of a &euro;70 million revolving fund.  A total of 487 properties have been acquired to date.  The agency also sources properties and potential developments for local authorities and AHBs.  It addresses homelessness by acquiring and refurbishing vacant properties for permanent accommodation, including suitable homes for families and for the Housing First initiative.  The agency sources properties for family hubs and supported temporary accommodation.  It works with NAMA and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in the acquisition of properties from NAMA's loan portfolio.  A total of 2,475 houses and apartments have been delivered to date.  The agency provides procurement services for local authorities and AHBs.  It manages and develops sites that it owns.  It centrally supports the implementation of the housing strategy for people with disabilities.</p><p> The Housing Agency undertakes a significant amount of work in research and supporting policy development.  Specifically, it prepares the annual summary assessment of housing need report and the national statement on housing supply and demand.  The agency works on supporting affordability measures through the central management of specific schemes such as the mortgage to rent scheme, the underwriting of local authority Rebuilding Ireland home loan applications and the provision of support for the Department as it develops affordable housing purchase arrangements and a cost rental scheme.  It provides the interim regulatory function for AHBs and is working in partnership with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government towards the transition to a statutory regulation.  The agency remediates homes under the pyrite remediation scheme and has remediated 1,237 homes to date.</p><p> The primary objective of the Housing Agency is to promote the building of sustainable communities that last in places that are well planned.  We promote the development of good quality housing in places where people want to live and have opportunities.  The four key features of good housing are security, quality, affordability and appropriateness.  Our housing stock needs to be appropriate in size and accessible.  The location of housing should meet current and future needs.  The Housing Agency has undertaken a great deal of additional work in the past two years to assist in dealing with the significant housing challenges we face.  We are committed to ensuring financial probity, good governance structures and efficient measures are in place to meet the remit and objectives of the Housing Agency.  </p><p> I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for their assistance and courtesy during the conducting of the audit.  I also thank the Chairman and the other members of the committee for their attention.  I will answer questions they may have.</p></speech>

I would like to ask Mr. McCarthy a straightforward question before I call the opening speaker.  He rightly said in his opening statement that "delivery [of housing] can only be accelerated by local authorities, the Housing Agency and AHBs working in partnership."  Will he give me a report on the most recent meeting that would have taken place, having been called by the Department as the funder, with the local authorities, the Housing Agency and the major AHBs?  Obviously, that is the hub where everything should happen.  When was the last meeting the Department had with all of these groups?</p></speech>

I will try to keep my questions focused.  I would appreciate succinct replies in order that I can get in as much as possible in the 20 minutes available to me.  </p> <p>  I would like the Comptroller and Auditor General to clarify something on page 125 of the report.  He mentions in chapter 10.35 that he audits the accounts of the Department and the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency and that they "are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and by implication, to direct examination by the Committee of Public Accounts".  We are trying to have clarity on a range of topics.  There are levels of responsibility and audit.  That makes it difficult for us to have clarity.  Given that &euro;2 billion was spent across all of the headings in 2017, is this degree of fragmentation of oversight unusual?  Does it occur in other sectors, to the best of the Comptroller and Auditor General's knowledge?  Is it desirable?</p></speech>

In the health sector there are section 38 and section 39 bodies, for instance.  Most of the section 39 bodies are not within my remit.  A lot of the spending is happening in such agencies.  It is not completely unusual.  One of the reasons I wanted to have this chapter was to get a sense of where the money was going and where it would be expected that the delivery of service would be seen.  I hope we have succeeded in providing clarity.</p></speech>

There are approximately 500 approved housing bodies.  Obviously, there are tiers.  How many of them would be tier 3 bodies which I understand are the larger ones?  What percentages fall into the other two groups?</p></speech>

There are 232 registered AHBs, accounting for 95% of the stock, with 73% of their homes under the control of 17% of tier 3 AHBs.  While in excess of 500 organisations have historically applied for and received AHB status, 90% of the regulated stock is owned and managed by 50 of them.  It is quite concentrated.</p></speech>

There are a number of sources of funding from the Department, including capital to build in the first instance.  An amount for the maintenance of housing stock can also be drawn down annually as long as there is compliance.  From what I am reading, I presume that the latter would only have been drawn down by the organisations that were complying with the voluntary code.</p></speech>

The drawdown of funds on an annual basis is related to project related costs and operated on a scheme by scheme and project by project basis.</p> <p>  Regarding financial standards, with the Chairman's indulgence, I might ask the regulation office which is based in the Housing Agency to respond.  The interim regulatory arrangement that has been in place since 2013 has focused on three areas - governance, finances and, more recently, performance standards.  The submission of annual accounts and so on is part of the voluntary regulatory process, about which Mr. Fitzpatrick might wish to say a few words.</p></speech>

The annual reports produced in that regard consolidate the global accounts of the tier 3 bodies.  There is considerable interaction with the larger bodies in the form of meetings.  For example, the regulation office meets each of the larger AHBs at least once a year, examines their financial, business and growth plans and considers the organisations' viability.  The larger AHBs are delivering a significant number of units and taking on a great deal of debt finance.  Since they pose the greatest risk, they are the ones on which the regulation office focuses most of its regulatory efforts.</p></speech>

Paragraph 10.25 on page 123 reads:</p><blockquote>In addition, the local authority pays the AHB an annual management and maintenance fee for each unit.  These fees are also recouped by the local authority from the Department under the scheme. </blockquote> <p>How is that decided?  How much was drawn down in 2017?</p></speech>

It is being replaced by a new scheme.  Apart from the management and maintenance fee, the moneys were used to pay off borrowings undertaken during the scheme's 20 years of operation.  Between Exchequer and local property tax funding, just under &euro;67 million was spent in servicing the loans in 2017.</p></speech>

The Department has provided us with some useful documentation.  This is the reply we received on 25 October, PAC32-R-1670 A.  It shows the various subsidy and grant levels, including the local property tax.  It states there has been a surplus of local property tax receipts to fund housing programmes and gives figures for 2016 to 2018, inclusive.  This year's figure is &euro;92 million, for example.  The Department confirmed to us not that long ago that a review of its baselines was under way.  The amount of money involved could change significantly.  Population has not been accounted for in determining the baselines since they were established in 2000 or thereabouts.  There is a significant shortfall in some of the larger local authorities, which are the ones contributing to the local property tax pool.  Not all local authorities make a contribution to it, only those in the likes of Dublin, some commuter belt counties, Galway and Cork, which are the likely winners in a reconfiguration if the baselines change.  In that context, what consideration has been given to the future sustainability of the tax as a source of funding, or is that more of a policy area?</p></speech>

I know that this is an issue the Deputy has raised many times.  We undertook to carry out a review.  We kicked it off this year and it is at an advanced stage.  I cannot say what its outcome will be, but it has been designed to try to provide a mechanism that takes account of a wider range of factors in determining how local property tax proceeds are to be distributed.  We are probably not too far away from wrapping it up completely.</p></speech>

He said: "The numbers presenting to homeless services continue to be very challenging."  He also referred to "pathways to more sustainable housing."  He stated: "A record 4,729 adults exited homelessness into an independent tenancy in 2017."  Nearly 10,000 people were in homelessness in 2017.  If we add the 4,729 adults who experienced homelessness, does that not mean that the situattion was much worse, in that 14,000 or more experienced it?</p><p>I do not understand why the fact that people exited homelessness is almost presented as a positive.  The very fact that they were homeless to begin with reinforces the point that the overall number who have experienced homelessness is more than 10,000.  Does Mr. McCarthy agree that that is the case?</p></speech>

There are two things.  The figure of just under 10,000 that Deputy Catherine Murphy referenced relates to a point in time.  The figure of 4,729 is over the course of a year.  Therefore, they are different.</p></speech>

It is not that there is a huge difference between July and September, either last year or this year.  This number is one to be added to the number at the end of the year who will have experienced homelessness.</p></speech>

The point I am trying to get across is that the number for whom we are finding solutions is also increasing significantly but not at a fast enough pace.</p></speech>

To be honest, one of the things that prompted us to have this session and the other later in the autumn session is the lack of clarity and transparency on the various housing solutions.  Very often there is a degree of spin, not necessarily from the Department but politically, on the number of houses built, as opposed, for example, to housing assistance payments, HAP, leasing and various other schemes.  One of the things that is referenced in the report is the lack of clarity.  A recommendation was made on foot of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that there was a need to have a more transparent approach.  The Comptroller and Auditor General said that, in addition to the current output report, the Department should consider reporting on the output of social housing support schemes on a scheme by scheme basis, both to assist its oversight and increase transparency.  Has that recommendation been fully taken on board and, if so, what initiatives will feed into it?</p></speech>

We started out in the middle of 2016 with Rebuilding Ireland.  We set very clear targets and the process of trying to measure, report on and be held accountable for delivery against these targets was something with which we grappled very early on.  In fact, when we started out initially, we would probably have had more scheme by scheme-type specific reporting of the kind to which the Comptroller and Auditor General referred.  We would have said so many homes had been delivered using the capital advance leasing facility and so many under the capital assistance scheme, but the view we were getting back was that they were terms we understood but that people generally did not.  We moved from it to a programme of reporting.  We publish data every quarter, fundamentally built around the build, acquisition and lease scheme, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and the HAP scheme.  In terms of the recommendation from the Comptroller and Auditor General, the form of reporting we have and what he is recommending are not incompatible because we can tell behind these broad categories what the individual schemes are.  The reason we have the type of reporting we have is the suggestion we were getting was that it was more simple and straightforward for people to understand.  We said in response to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that we had the underlying scheme by scheme data.</p></speech>

For example, the Budget Statement outlined that there was leasing, acquisitions and builds.  Very often the way it is reported to the public is that there are 10,000 new homes when in actual fact some of them are not new.  In the leasing category the figure can include the leasing of existing houses.  It is important that we find out how many publicly funded new builds there are, irrespective of whether it is through approved housing bodies or the scheme to which it relates.  The important thing is the total number of new builds.  That is the piece.</p></speech>

Local authorities go through a four-stage process from beginning to end, from identification of a site to tender stage.  A single-stage process was initiated, but it appears that there is a very low uptake.  Why is that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-25a.246" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018102500002#O01200"><p>Initially, when we introduced the one-stage process, there was a very poor take-up.  We investigated and engaged with local authorities and there was a sense that it was too risky for them, that, in effect, they would sign up to a project and an associated budget and that if they encountered unexpected costs, they would be left to meet them.</p></speech>

We modified the one-stage approval process in order that we would allow latitude for a local authority and if it encountered certain types of issue, for example, unknown ground conditions that gave rise to a significant cost, it could come back to the Department for an increased budget for the project.  However, the financial risk piece does not seem to have been got over because in the latest construction status report we published on the position at the end of quarter 2 in 2018 there are probably around 200 projects of a scale that could go through the one-stage process, but, from memory, only about 12 have used it.  A more general review of the public spending code is being initiated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is an issue at which we are going to have to look again as part of it to see how we can have an improved take-up of the one-stage process and get things moving, rather than have local authorities going backwards and forwards to the Department when they do not need to do so.</p></speech>

I can understand why local authorities would try to make sure they would not be financially exposed, but it should be possible to work through it internally.</p><p>I wish to focus on the various schemes in terms of value for money achieved.  Has the Department examined, for example, the HAP scheme over the lifetime of a typical mortgage of about 30 years?  I refer to building, as opposed to rental.  Rents are very high, but I hope they will not continue to stay at that level.  The HAP scheme seems to be a very expensive and unsustainable approach.  What background work has been done in that regard?</p><p>There were approximately 10,500 subsidised leases in 2018, which breaks down at 22 leases for every new build in the country.  According to an article in <i>Village</i>magazine, penned by Mel Reynolds who has been very vocal on the issue of housing, a subsidised lease is twice as costly as a local authority new build on State land.</p><p>Would the Department look at that aspect of it from a value for money perspective?  Has the Department done any work on that or carried out an actuarial assessment of the various schemes including the housing assistance payment, HAP, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and leasing arrangements?  If we are looking for value for money, we need to have those comparators and if that work is already done, it would be very useful for us to have a look at it.</p></speech>

Clearly, on the basis of capital cost, it would not have been possible to fund that because the capital resources were not available.  It would also not have been deliverable in the timeframe required because construction takes time and, as we know, construction had virtually ground to a halt.  The mix of approaches between construction, acquisition, lease, RAS and HAP, that are in Rebuilding Ireland reflect a policy balance between getting as many units as possible through the capital side while also determining what was needed on the current programme side to be able to achieve the 50,000 by 2021.</p> <p>  Historically, we got into the business of leasing-type programmes in 2008 or 2009, when the market had crashed.  In 2010 or 2011, an analysis was done by the Housing Agency that examined capital and current models which showed them to be broadly similar in terms of costs, depending on the assumptions one makes.  More recently, as part of the 2019 budgetary process, we asked the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service to undertake an analysis of the kind to which the Deputy refers.  That was published as part of the budgetary process.  The conclusion that the service came to was that in certain parts of the country, it may be more expensive, while in other parts of the country, it is less so.  The broad conclusion arrived at was that the change in the mix of housing delivery mechanisms more towards capital delivered mechanisms over the course of Rebuilding Ireland was the way to go.  When we get to 2021, for example, we will deliver more housing solutions in that year through build, acquisition and lease rather than through RAS and HAP.</p></speech>

My focus since I came into the D&aacute;il has mainly been on health, and HSE representatives tend to get a fair beating in the media when things are not going well.  I am very conscious of the fact that many of the witnesses here today also get the raw end of the stick sometimes, even though they are doing their very best.</p> <p>  I will start with Brexit.  I believe the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government has commissioned a report on the impact of Brexit on the housing and homelessness situation in this country.  This is coming down the tracks, possibly very quickly.  It has been suggested that up to 500,000 people in the UK exist in a sort of no man's land and that after Brexit, there is a risk that they may end up here.  This could cause problems and exert serious pressure on our system.  If the witnesses know anything about that or have done any preliminary work on it, I ask them to speak on it and outline how we might deal with it.</p> <p>  Last week or the week before, representatives of the OPW were before this committee.  They told us that they use the British standards of the Royal College of Chartered Surveyors when calculating the size of a building.  In terms of buildings, if we photocopy what is done in the UK and use it here, what impact will any changes in regulatory alignment have on our system?  Will there be any issues with regard to materials or products that we import from the UK and the related building standards associated with those products? </p> <p>  The second issue I want to raise is Traveller accommodation.  It is my understanding that local authorities have a ring-fenced budget for accommodation for members of the Traveller community but it is often not spent in its entirety.   At the same time, as is evidenced by recent media reports, there are still many people from that community seeking accommodation.</p><p>Perhaps Mr. McCarthy could give me some indications of the barriers in the development of Traveller accommodation despite the resources being there?  What are the additional complexities that may be associated with the housing of members of the Traveller community?  Perhaps it is not as simple as giving a house or a bed and there are far more complex issues to consider.  I am thinking of lifestyle issues such as connections with the equine industry.  I am also speaking about complex medical needs that require additional equipment at home.  Will Mr. McCarthy outline that it is maybe not as simple as putting somebody in a bed.  Will Mr. McCarthy answer those questions first and we will go back then?</p></speech>

On the first issue, I cannot attest to the figure of 500,000 people the Deputy referred to.  There is a difference between the UK and Ireland.  In Ireland if families or individuals present as homeless, even though they may not strictly have entitlement to housing services within the law, they are provided with emergency housing supports on a repeated short-term basis.  In the UK, as I understand it, those services are not provided to anything like the same extent.  In a post-Brexit situation, the movements of people both legally and otherwise is an issue that is being looked at.  The Dublin Region Homeless Executive has formed a group to look at the possible implications for homeless services and we are liaising with it.  We are about to engage in a liaison with the Department of Justice and Equality because there are connected issues across the system that we will need to join up.</p> <p>  On the issue of standards, the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, is the key accreditation body for products generally in the construction industry and otherwise.  The key thing from a building point of view is that products will continue to have the relevant CE mark, meaning they meet the relevant standards.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the NSAI have been looking at this.  There have been some inquiries from some certifying bodies - I forget the technical term - looking to relocate to Ireland so they can continue to provide those kinds of CE marking services.</p> <p>  In terms of Traveller accommodation, we have certainly had difficulties in recent years in terms of the drawdown of funding from the Traveller accommodation budget.  Looking back as far as the year 2000, not far off 20 years ago, we have invested a total of just over &euro;350 million in Traveller accommodation.  Looking at more recent years, particularly in 2017, for example, the allocation for capital was &euro;9 million, yet &euro;4.8 million was drawn down.  There are problems in particular areas.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, has established an expert group to dig into this to see what issues are giving rise to the poor drawdown of the available funding.  I do not want to start talking about specific cases that have been in the media.  Local authorities will be able to provide plenty of examples of where there can be difficulties getting projects through the planning process.  There can sometimes be local opposition.  As we have seen in some cases when projects are delivered, they can run into issues at that stage.  A group has been established by the Minister of State, Deputy English, to drill into it to see what the issues are that need to be tackled to get the Traveller accommodation programme back delivering at a rate equivalent to the funding that is available for it.</p></speech>

With regard to the issue of the delivery of homes and supply, we have a skills shortage as a result of emigration and a drop in the number of people entering the sector.  Are we doing anything to attract people back home to work in the sector?  Will Mr. McCarthy outline any measures his Department or other Departments are taking to deal with this manpower - or womanpower - issue?</p> <p>  Targets are set by local authorities.  In the case of Dublin City Council we have had recent examples of councillors voting against projects.  In South Dublin we had 1,000 homes at Kilcarbery voted against.  I do not want to be drawn into the issue of what the average house price is or what is affordable but those houses would have been in or around the property price index average price.  That is 1,000 homes that could have been delivered that were voted against.  Will Mr. McCarthy talk us through how the Department has a field that is zoned for housing yet there are no houses on it 18 months later?  Will he walk me through the steps and barriers people meet on the journey to making houses appear in the field?</p></speech>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has established a group with relevant Departments, the Construction Industry Federation and others to look at this and to engage with the likes of SOLAS on apprenticeships and skills but also to engage with the construction industry on modern methods of construction and to determine whether the industry is engaging with those to the extent that it needs to.</p> <p>  In terms of attracting new workers, from an overall perspective one would nearly prefer people already in the country to be upskilled into the construction industry.  Attracting more people into the country will result in an increased demand for housing.  I am not saying we will get all the skills we need from within our own space but efforts are being made.  That is why the likes of SOLAS and activation measures by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection have to be an important part of the solution as well.</p> <p>  On the issue of going from a field being zoned to the appearance of houses, Deputy Catherine Murphy referred earlier to the one-stage approval process.  I am talking purely about social housing projects.  I will come to private ones in a minute.  We have a four-stage approval process for the bigger type social housing projects that do not come within the limits of the one-stage process.  That four-stage process is borne out of the public spending code and the capital works management framework the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has in place for capital projects generally.</p><p>I am sure most of the members are blue in the face, as I am blue in the face, from hearing about the four-stage approval process and projects bouncing backwards and forwards.  To try to deal with this, we sat down with the local government system and set timelines for each stage of the process.  We benchmarked getting from the first idea of a project to getting on site with comparable private sector delivery.  It is as good as what can be delivered in the private sector at 59 weeks.  People speak about it as 59 weeks to get approval but it is 59 weeks to do the design, get through the Part VIII process with the local authority, do the procurement and do all of the work on assessments at various stages of the process.  If we look at how the 59 weeks break down, approximately 45 weeks involve work that the local authorities are required to do at various stages.</p></speech>

For stage 2, 16 weeks are allotted and 22 of the 33 projects got through stage 2 on time.</p></speech>

Is it family breakdown, substance misuse or stigma?  Other than the bed or the solution, and I hate the term "housing solution" because it seems so made up, and other than a place to stay and a roof over someone's head, what is the reason?

Obviously there are the other cases the Deputy described, where there are very complex health and social care issues that require a different form of solution.</p> <p>  We have a tenancy sustainment service in place with Threshold to try to promote tenant rights.  I do not have the figures with me but it supports quite a significant number of tenants in the private rental sector in staying in their own homes.  We have also made changes in the residential tenancies legislation to introduce longer periods of notice to quit so there is that longer time period within which services can engage with people who are at risk of homelessness.  When people present as homeless, particularly families, the new housing assistance payment place finder service is playing a part in terms of trying to source accommodation for families so that in some cases they do not have to enter emergency accommodation or, if they do, it is for short periods of time.</p></speech>

We had a lengthy discussion on many of these issues a number of months ago and it is good he is back.

The people see the politicians and talking heads on the television all of the time, but the witnesses before us, whether the Housing Agency or the Department, are the public and civil servants tasked with building the homes and supplying the solutions, as an Teachta O'Connell spoke about earlier, to meet the demands and needs of people.  I want to put myself in the shoes of the people who come to my constituency office every day.  It is almost like a conveyor belt of people asking me to make representations for housing, which pretty much does not exist.  People who are on a social housing list come in, but unless they have been waiting seven or eight years and have a particular set of circumstances, there is very little prospect of them getting a social house.  Do the witnesses accept this?  The vast majority of people's housing needs are now met through the private rented sector.  Is this a fair assessment?</p></speech>

I imagine, however, that it is the same for other Members of the D&aacute;il here.  People come into my office with a housing need.  They want social housing and there is no chance of them getting social housing.  I can make as many phone calls as I want to the housing office but the homes are simply not there.  The response in any event would be that the housing assistance payment is the only solution.  We send all of these people into the private sector to find solutions.  What has happened as a consequence of not building social housing is that we now have everybody competing in the same space as social housing applicants.  That includes people who can afford to rent and want to rent.  As a consequence, the price of rent has been driven up.  Does Mr. McCarthy agree that is the reality for people?  I also want to know if he agrees that is the reality because the State has not built social housing.  Does he accept that?</p></speech>

If we go back to 2013 and 2014, the level of social housing building hit the floor.  Rebuilding Ireland is framed on the basis of getting back substantially into that space, but it is going to take to the end of Rebuilding Ireland before the mix of the various delivery streams-----</p></speech>

I have Rebuilding Ireland as one of the topics I want to get to.  My point is that, as a consequence of policy, rents have now gone up to record levels and to what many people see as unsustainable levels.  That is especially the case in Dublin but also in other parts of the country.  Part of the reason for that is everybody is now in the same space.  Private rented accommodation is the only solution for the housing needs of the vast majority of people.  What socio-economic analysis has the Department done over recent years on the decision of the State to stop building social and affordable housing and the implications of that on the private rental sector?  What analysis, research and reports have been done by Mr. McCarthy's Department?  That is where the buck stops in many of these areas.</p></speech>

Rebuilding Ireland was initially 47,000 houses, now it is 50,000 houses.  That marries pretty much with the committee's report.</p></speech>

That is the future.  We have landed in a situation and we are looking back.  We can look to the future and we want to look to the future, but as a committee we primarily look back.  Over the past five or ten years, decisions were made to stop building social and affordable housing.  As a consequence, the vast majority of people now have their housing needs met through the private sector.  That has pushed up rents to unsustainable levels.  Over the period that was happening, what analysis was done by the Department?  Was it pointed out to people like Mr. McCarthy and the Department that as a consequence of not building social and affordable housing, rents would be driven up and that was going to affect our competitiveness?  Was any such research or analysis ever done?  Was that advice ever given to the Department in the past ten years?  I am not referring to what might happen in the future.  We now have to correct what has happened.  I refer to why we got into this situation in the first place.</p></speech>

My point is that as we sit here, in real time, here and now, too many people are in private rented accommodation where the rents are too high.  I am asking a simple question.  Did the Department see that coming?</p></speech>

Did it see it coming that the vast majority of people in need of social housing would not have those needs met by local authorities but by the private rental sector and in so doing that would push up the price of rents?  Was that foreseen by the Department?  I refer to being in the position we in are today.</p></speech>

From our point of view, however, we saw very clearly where we were in 2014 and 2015.  What led to Rebuilding Ireland in 2016 was that we had a shortage of housing.  It was housing delivery generally and not just social housing.  The housing spectrum is a continuum.  What happens in the private purchase sector affects what happens in the rental sector, the social sector and in respect of homelessness.  The Department certainly recognised that housing supply needed to be massively ramped up.  Apart from the social housing measures in Rebuilding Ireland, there are a whole range of other measures to try to support that as well.</p></speech>

I want to come now to the issue of Traveller accommodation.  Alarm bells went off in my head earlier when Mr. McCarthy spoke of an expert group being established.  Frankly, I could not care less what the expert group states.  I am sick of expert groups.  Mr. McCarthy is the Accounting Officer before us.  He is the person responsible for making sure policy is implemented.  Setting up an expert group is a classic Civil Service governmental response to a problem.  It will discuss the problem until the cows come home, there will be a report at some stage and then we will discuss that but nothing changes.  Money is allocated to local authorities on the basis of need for Traveller accommodation and it is not being spent.  I want to know from Mr. McCarthy, as the Accounting Officer, why that is still happening and what he and his Department have done.  I am not asking what some expert group might say in the future or its opinions.  I am sure they are wonderful.  I want to know what Mr. McCarthy and his Department have done in response to what is a real problem.  Local authorities are given a budget on the basis of need and it is not being spent.</p></speech>

We provide them with as much forward visibility as we possibly can on the available funding so they can plan for what they need to do to be able to draw it down.  For some authorities, we even move money around because there are local authorities that go beyond their allocation.  We get a clear supportive arrangement in place in respect of finance and any issues with which we can possibly help.  It does, however, come down to the local authorities themselves-----</p></speech>

Let us cut straight to the chase.  I do not need an expert group to tell me what the problem is.  I was a councillor for many years.  I was in a minority of councillors at times who supported Traveller accommodation when it came before me.  We all know what the problems are and we do not need an expert group to tell us why there is a problem in some local authorities.  The reality is that there is.  If there is, and it is continuous and ongoing, then I want to know what more can be done by the Department to make sure the housing needs of Travellers are met and that money allocated on the basis of need is actually spent.</p></speech>

I am sure he knows the reasons in his own area.  I am not disputing that at all, but we need to get a proper understanding of the range of things affecting the delivery of the Traveller accommodation programme.  If we do not have that, then any measures we choose to take will not be taken on the basis of a proper understanding that they are responding to the problems.</p></speech>

This is my own point of view.  I do not believe the system wants to change.  It is almost acceptable that the local authorities do not do it.  The money comes back and, sure, it is only Traveller accommodation.  There is no real focus on it.  I do not see any focus or urgency and it is a real cause of concern for me.

Therefore, at the start of the year we published a target for each local authority for 2018 and we also gave them targets for 2019 to 2021.  These are published and they are the targets against which delivery is-----</p></speech>

From the figures for Waterford city and county, I see the target for 2018 to 2021 is 687 units, and we must bear in mind that is acquisitions, lease and build.  The figures I got from the local authority show that, up to September of this year, 288 new families were accepted and came onto the housing list.  I am looking at the figures for actual people coming onto the housing list with a housing need and I am then looking at the target, which will not even meet that need.  By 2021, we will not have dealt in any way with the existing housing need in Waterford.  In fact, it will have become greater.</p></speech>

As I said, I have the figures from the local council showing 288 applications were approved up to September of this year alone.</p></speech>

It is the overall figure.  I am talking about the number of approved applications.  We are not even at the year end, so it will exceed 300, yet the number of units that will be built under Rebuilding Ireland will be much less than that.  We then look at the number of units that will be built up to 2021.  My point is that the targets we have set are woefully unambitious and will not in any way tackle the housing crisis in the county I represent.  I am saying that is a microcosm of what is happening in the State.</p> <p>  I know others want to come in so I will leave it at that.  Mr. McCarthy might come back on that and I will wait until the second round to raise other issues.</p></speech>

That is the level of ambition.  While the Deputy is talking about the number that have been added to the list, others will have come off the list as well.  The reason I point to the 1,117 figure, which is as of June 2018, is that it is a point in time figure and the 687 out to 2021 is designed to contribute to dealing with that need, along with the housing assistance payment.</p></speech>

A total of 239 people are homeless and while there are 154 in the west.  Those figures do not cover people living in cars, staying with friends and living in refuges or direct provision.  I am from a city that did not build a single local authority house in the period from 2009.  I am just providing the context.  It was inevitable that there would be a major housing crisis.  I think we have now built 14 houses and I am not sure if they are even available.  That is the length of time it has taken.  We received quarterly reports to which I will refer.  We bought land at astronomical prices partly under the land aggregation scheme to which I will return.  We received quarterly reports.  From 2010, our housing programme was laid out.  The final column contained the word "suspended".  There was no construction.  Today, I looked at the empty properties in Galway as of the end of August.  A total of 60 houses were empty.  I can tell Mr. McCarthy that I am most unhappy with the oversight of the Department with regard to these houses.  As the crisis intensifies, less information comes out.  We were told when the houses became vacant in these quarterly reports.  This significant piece of information is now gone.  Reasons why they are empty include "pre-tenancy works completed", "under consideration" and "under offer".  I do not know the difference between the latter two.  Other reasons include under offer or offer accepted pending allocation.  A total of 60 houses are empty, most of which are in the middle of the city or very near the outskirts.  That is the background to my questions.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. John McCarthy for all of the information, which has been very helpful in clarifying matters.  There are 547 voluntary bodies, the Department, the Housing Agency, the Land Development Agency and the Housing Finance Agency, which does not come under the committee's remit.  A new agency is about to be set up to lend because the banks are not lending.  In the midst of this, we have the most significant housing crisis, which I am glad Mr. John McCarthy has acknowledged.  I acknowledge that 95% of the 547 voluntary bodies come under a small group.  What did the Department do about regulation?  Why has it taken up until now to talk about it?  How has this sector remained unregulated for so long?</p></speech>

We had a choice to make at some point.  I have been around long enough to know that if we put all our eggs into the legislation basket in the first instance, we could wait a very long time to get anything so we made a conscious decision that we would put a voluntary regulation system in place that had implications.  Number one, a body had to subscribe to that regulation system in order to get funding and, number two, body that subscribed to it but was not complying would not get funding either.  That was where we took our first significant initial step.</p></speech>

There is a serious report from the Comptroller and Auditor General in which he refers to where mortgages related to three schemes were not fully executed and recommended conducting a review and a reconciliation of all mortgages charged on approved housing bodies.

The Housing Agency has been involved along with the Local Government Management Agency to support local authorities in pulling that full picture together.  They are at the point of data exchange with the Central Bank with regard to that.  The Local Government Audit Service is working on a follow up so it is carrying out a comprehensive exercise to look at all of the recommendations and see what has been delivered.  I hope to get that report by the end of the year or very early next year at the latest.  There are two things here.  We are clear that there is no statutory regulation beyond section 6 of the 1992 Act.  However, I do not think it is accurate to say there is no regulation because the voluntary regulation system does have teeth and produces very comprehensive analysis and reports.</p><p>If a body was not in compliance with the regulatory regime it would not get funding from us.  The important point from a regulatory perspective is the regulatory step we took in 2016 to bring the approved housing body sector within the remit of the Residential Tenancies Board.  Tenants have added protections from that.  The bodies are subjected to standards and-----</p></speech>

The Department is only targeting 25% and it should be targeting 100%.  Somebody made up this 25% figure and there is no legal basis for it.</p></speech>

The 25% figure is for all private rental accommodation.  There are some 320,000 tenancies, many of which are not supported by HAP or any other scheme.  That 25% is of all private rental tenancies.  The other target is a statutory requirement that neither I nor anybody else - other than the Oireachtas - can change.  That requirement remains.  When I was before the committee last I said that the Department was doing a piece of work that we would finish by the end of the year to pull various data systems together that would actually tell us how many are HAP properties.  That statutory requirement has not changed.</p></speech>

For each property they get approximately  &euro;480 per annum as a management and maintenance allowance for every HAP property under that scheme also.  That is approximately &euro;5 million per year.  In addition to the differential rent collected on those properties a management and maintenance allowance is provided.</p></speech>

There are so many schemes here and the Comptroller and Auditor General refers to the complexity.  Because of this complexity it leaves less oversight.  This is of serious concern.  Does the Department have data on how the total number of social houses and the nature of the tenures that are held by the voluntary bodies?  When I started out as a councillor, we were told there was no difference except that a person could not buy the house.  I now learn that over the years there are different tenure times.  Instead of having a house for life, a person now might have it for ten or 20 years.  I would like to come on to a different question before I am stopped; what is the exact number of houses held by the voluntary bodies?  What is the nature of the tenancies and what are the durations and the maintenance fees paid?  If I could have that information, it might come back later through the Chairman.</p> <p> I have looked at the Housing Agency reports and have no idea why the agency is necessary.  Forgive me; it is not personal.  I have no idea.  The agency gets a &euro;70 million plus revolving fund and in addition there are all the salaries and administration costs.  I do not like the word "quango" but to me it appears to be another unnecessary level of bureaucracy.  The money should be going straight to the local authorities.  That is my preface.</p></speech>

I thank them all for their work and support.</p> <p>  At this committee last month Mr. Brendan McDonagh, chief executive officer of NAMA, was questioned on its remit in respect of the role of housing in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and disclosed that 6,984 social housing units were offered to local authorities in the State, but only 2,717 units were availed of.  Following on from that, I asked the Minister, via a parliamentary question, the reason not all units offered were availed of.  The answer I received was that the Department, the Housing Agency and the local authorities worked systematically through the full list of homes supplied to determine if there was a social housing demand for the properties identified.  There are tens of thousands of people who have been languishing for years on waiting lists.  The average waiting time in my county is around eight years.  I am sure that it is similar in other constituencies.  The word "systematically" was used.  Huge resources are being expended on the housing assistance payment, HAP, increasing with every budget.  Can the witness please explain what the Minister meant in his reply?  He specifically mentioned the Housing Agency.  How is it the case that 61% of the properties offered by NAMA were deemed not fit?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-10-25a.557" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Connor" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018102500002#X00200"><p>To put this in context, we have been working with NAMA, along with the Department, to get as many houses as possible from NAMA's loan portfolio for social housing.  I have one clarification in terms of the numbers provided.  The original number identified by NAMA was 6,951 properties.  Of those, 1,843 were sold, so the actual number available from NAMA was 5,108 properties.  It is important to clarify that.  More than half of those properties that were available from NAMA will be provided as social housing.  The properties that were deemed not suitable by local authorities included holiday homes and large houses in golf villages, but more importantly there were some very large developments in parts of the country, for example over 500 apartments in one local authority area in one development, which had already been partially allocated to local authorities under Part V provision.  It was decided that 65 additional apartments was an appropriate number so as not to cause an over-concentration of social housing in that area.  Similar scenarios played out in other locations.  There were large concentrations of social housing and it was decided to only take some of those properties.  In my opinion, the decisions taken by the local authorities as to what properties were suitable were reasonable.</p></speech>

There is no way that NAMA offered 2,500 holiday homes to the local authorities.  The Secretary General has said that he does not want the Department to issue missives or directives in terms of what the local authorities do.  When I asked this question I was told that as part of the process the Housing Agency has been liaising and in direct contact with all the relevant local authorities to discuss the demand requirements, and that it was for the Housing Agency to co-ordinate the response to NAMA.  It seems to me that is exactly what is happening here.  The Secretary General has said that the Department is not issuing directives or missives, but the Housing Agency seems to be acting in a very controlling way, deciding the properties that were picked and were not picked.  It is not the CEO of the local authorities deciding things here, but rather the Housing Agency.  Mr. McCarthy used the phrase "an over-concentration of social housing".  In the midst of a housing crisis, that is a terrible statement.</p></speech>

We worked with NAMA.  Indeed, we provided staff to NAMA to identify all of the residential properties.  Having identified the available properties in NAMA's loan portfolio, the Housing Agency approached each local authority with a list of properties in each area and asked the local authorities to decide which of those properties they considered suitable for acquisition for social housing.  We liaised with each local authority and acted on their responses.  If we thought the local authorities were rejecting properties we thought suitable, we pushed them on that.  However, at the end of the day we accepted the view of the local authorities.  They had to be supported, and in my opinion they took reasonable decisions.</p></speech>

We are now hearing that rejecting 50% of a portfolio of homes offered for social housing is reasonable.  It is not reasonable.  The response goes to the heart of the matter in terms of what is deemed suitable and not suitable.  Elsewhere in the answer we were told that some of the homes offered were located in areas where there is no demand.  I know of nowhere on the housing list I am looking at where there is no demand.  Indeed, it is the complete opposite.</p> <p>  It was said that where units were declined it was due to the need to avoid over-concentration of social housing units.  I ask again if this an example of the philosophy of the Housing Agency influencing the fact that we are not going into a construction phase and are instead dependent on HAP?   </p></speech>

I asked the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government how, at a time of a housing crisis, 50% of houses offered for social housing can be discounted because they have been deemed not suitable.  The Minister is blaming the Housing Agency and the Housing Agency is blaming the local authorities.  Who is ultimately responsible and who is driving the philosophy?</p></speech>

The Housing Agency was used as the vehicle for co-ordinating the activity and for working with the local authorities but as Mr. O'Connor has said, decisions on demand in different areas and any issues of over-concentration were taken at local level.  I do not want there to be any misinterpretation.  The Housing Agency was not overriding local authorities but was merely the vehicle for co-ordinating the inputs from the various local authorities.</p><p>There is a Government policy dating from 2007 on delivering homes and sustaining communities.  It does have a sustainable-communities philosophy at the heart of it that points to the issues and difficulties associated with large concentrations of social housing in particular areas.  It is not always the case that there are issues but in some cases in the past there have been.</p></speech>

The interpretation of sustainability frustrates the life out of me.  I was raised in the middle of a large town with council estates on every side.  We seem to have lost the phrase "council estates".  I did not differentiate between private homes and council homes.  They were very good communities.  Again, I return to the philosophy that meant local authorities were deeming 50% of the available homes in the midst of a housing crisis not suitable.  We are talking about the need to avoid over-concentration.  At what point does over-concentration kick in?</p></speech>

I am not in any way referring to bad communities.  I am not in any way casting aspersions on anybody.  I am just saying there has been a Government policy in place since 2007.  In framing that policy, account was taken of instances in the past where very significant developments with social housing only did not work out.  Of course, there are developments that did work out, and they have very strong communities.  There were areas, however, where they did not work out.  It serves as a caution-----</p></speech>

At the start of the noughties, substantial council estates were still being built in my town.  In tandem, funding was got from the Department to build community centres in the middle of them to make sure they worked as sustainable communities.  Swimming pools and so forth also were provided.</p> <p>  In Mr. John McCarthy's opening statement, he said on-the-ground activity and delivery can be accelerated only by the local authorities, the Housing Agency and the approved housing bodies working in partnership.  We have a letter today from the CCMA.  Its representatives did not come here today to discuss this most critical issue pertaining to the country.  Therefore, it is somewhat hard to find out about on-the-ground activity.  Mr. John McCarthy did not make reference to quarter 2 of this year and to the fact that, of the 200 projects of a scale involved in the one-stage approval process, only 12 have gone through.  What is going on with the local authority system if that is the figure?</p></speech>

We did investigate it when we were not getting a response.  In the previous version of the one-stage approval process, we did get very strong indications from the local government sector that it was too risky for it.  We did take a number of steps to de-risk it.  It still does not seem to operate as expected, as I mentioned.</p></speech>

I am a strong believer in autonomous local government.

I am not blaming Mr. McCarthy.  There is a problem at local government level but he is the Accounting Officer for local government.  There is a significant amount of money in the Vote in this area.  I have touched on one area in which, as a result of what is happening, we are ending up having to spend more money on HAP.  There was a report in the newspapers yesterday and today that 3,500 council-owned homes are vacant.  Who is accountable?  I am asking questions here and being told by the Housing Agency that the local authority bosses are responsible, the local authority bosses are telling me the agency is responsible, and the Minister is saying something different.  If there are 3,500 homes vacant for a prolonged period and 2,500 social homes being refused by county and city managers, is it not time to say the system is broken at local government level and centralise the whole system and be done with it?</p></speech>

The programme has certainly been ramped up quite significantly.  In fact, last year we had to get a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;100 million to be able to support it.  One can see in the construction status report that the programme is ramping up.  What is occurring is frustrating, however, considering that there are mechanisms that can accelerate delivery.</p> <p>  With regard to the voids issue that the Deputy raised, the local authorities are accountable to their elected members and to the National Oversight and Audit Commission.  It is in the public domain for the National Oversight and Audit Commission to shine a light on it.  It is cold comfort in many respects that the average re-let time is actually coming down.  The position was actually worse in 2016.  This is the second year in a row in which the re-let time has come down but it is still too long, on average.  It is too long an average because the local authority-by-local authority breakdown shows there is a very significant range.  Some local authorities can actually re-let properties very quickly.  We have to get best practice rolled out across the system.</p></speech>

Through the land aggregation, LAG, scheme, the Department is dealing with a series of bad land deals.  Notwithstanding that, there is a definitive need for land acquisition in certain counties, especially the commuter counties.  Mr. John McCarthy was kind enough to supply a table on what is in council ownership throughout the country.  In my county, there are nine local authority sites zoned but only one of those is a substantial landholding.  The rest are all smaller than 1 ha.  The substantial one is part of a LIHAF scheme that has not kicked off.  What is the position of the Department on acquiring landbanks in commuter counties to try to develop council homes?</p></speech>

We have that mapped now on the Rebuilding Ireland land map.  There are just over 700 sites across the local authorities.  That was the first piece that we wanted to put in place.</p></speech>

It does make a first step at mapping I think approximately 30 other State-owned properties, but the 700 are local authority ones.  We wanted that as a baseline so that if we got applications in from local authorities to borrow money for land, we would be able to say, "You've either got this land or you don't."  That has been hugely important.  We have not had a significant demand for land loans.  I do not want to say we are open for business - that is not it - but if a local authority was to come to us we would certainly look at it.  I think in the Deputy's own county we did actually approve a land loan earlier on this year.  I am not sure that it has actually been drawn down yet, but it has been approved.</p> <p>  The Deputy could count on the fingers of one hand the number of loan applications that have come our way in the last number of years.  I suppose we would really look at it on a local-authority-by-local-authority basis.  We do it as part of the engagement we have with local authorities on their social housing programme because as we look forward for what they plan to deliver in the next three or four years, one of the questions that we absolutely engage with them on is asking where the land to deliver those sorts of units is so that we are planning forward.</p></speech>

They need to start to think if we are going to deliver X number of units in 2021, we need to get through the construction and the planning, but before we ever get there we need the land.  They are actually getting into that space, so it is a much more structured and forward-looking arrangement.  If there was a need for land and if it was available at an appropriate price, subject to the local authority's capacity to be able to service it, we would approve it</p></speech>

The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in 2017 spent about &euro;1.4 billion, I believe, of which &euro;230 million-odd on rents.  Could the witnesses indicate to the committee how much was recouped in terms of the receipt of tenants' rental payments to the State?  I ask the witnesses to give me a figure for that later.  Could they also provide the committee with a list of active approved housing bodies as opposed to a full list of approved housing bodies?  I think that would be quite useful for the committee's consideration.  Furthermore, how many approved housing bodies have been removed in the past five years, for example?  Perhaps ten years would be a good indication as to how many have withdrawn from the market.  I would be very interested to see a figure for the total sum of money provided to approved housing bodies as a separate figure to that which has been spent by the Department on the provision of housing.  If the witnesses can answer these questions straight up, I ask them to do so, but if they want to take some time to gather them together, that is fine.  I will move on.</p> <p>  What percentage of the LIHAF funding has been drawn down?  The witnesses might be able to provide us with a note on this and perhaps break down the figure per application.  Is there a specific policy within the Department which precludes the development of large-scale social housing or is it just the case generally that the Department believes it should not engage in such developments because it would like to try to learn from the past?  Would Mr. McCarthy like to try to tackle those questions?</p></speech>

The Department has spent &euro;19 million on the provision of family hub accommodation this year.  The family hub programme was introduced primarily to provide better transitional accommodation than resorting to hotels.  On the basis of projections by the local authorities for 2018, as part of their homeless budgets, the cost of a family in a family hub is the equivalent of about &euro;36,000 a year.  The average cost in 2017 for a family in a hotel was about &euro;67,000.  Obviously, there is a capital cost associated with a hub, but the running costs are significantly less and it is a better service.</p></speech>

I am very proud of the work that is done in Fingal County Council.  The Minister and I visited the area last Friday and were told a target of 1,376 housing units were to be provided over a three-year period.  Fingal has delivered 2,241, which is a significant increase on the target it was given.  I was informed it was also going to significantly exceed the target it was set last year.  Why are other local authorities not able to match that?  Housing output is in single figures in certain local authorities in the State.  I appreciate there may be a lack of expertise in some local authorities but Mr. McCarthy outlined to me that, over the various stages of the drawdown of the funding provided to the local authorities during the development of a scheme, they would get &euro;25,000 for doing very little.  That sounds like the sort of money one might pay to an architect to draw up an advanced, large-scale plan.  That is not an excuse for a local authority not putting properties on public display for consideration for their development.  In a less adversarial manner than was presented to Mr. McCarthy earlier, would he have a view on that?  I have a firm view, based on what I have heard, but perhaps Mr. McCarthy would like to enlighten me further?</p></speech>

It is still cheaper to buy than to build in some parts of the country.  A significant proportion of some local authorities' output is in acquisitions rather than construction sites.  The Deputy referred to earlier conversations in relation to capacity and, while those issues would have been raised historically, one would imagine they should be resolved at this stage because of the type of arrangement that I outlined.</p> <p>  The programme was not far from zero in 2013 and 2014, so it takes a bit of time for that to ramp-up, although that should be resolved in 2018.  It is a case of taking the targets that have been set and delivering on them.</p> <p>  A lot of local authority time has been spent on getting stuff through the Part 8 process.  That pipeline of proposals is there.</p></speech>

If there is serviced site outside a provincial town with road frontage and correct zoning, is Mr. McCarthy telling me it is cheaper for the local authority to simply ignore that serviced, zoned site and try to find properties to buy within that provincial town for the provision of social housing?</p><p>The point I make is that surely it should be doing both.  It is not as if there is a lack of money.  What I see in this example is a lack of will to do that.  We have serviced sites with power, drainage and accessibility.  If they do not have accessibility, that is what LIHAF is for, even if it is only a case of providing &euro;100,000 for a few hundred yards of roadway.  If the Department has lots of money, which clearly it does, I am trying to understand why local authorities are not hitting their targets and why they are not developing sites that they may own and that are zoned appropriately and serviced or purchasing properties in their areas.  I am just trying to understand what is the issue.</p></speech>

When I was talking about some places where local authorities have access to cheaper acquisitions that was just in terms of their relative share of the activity because those opportunities would present.  When I think of my own town - and other parts of rural areas - where there would be a fair amount of vacant properties in the centre, it would make sense from a town regeneration point of view, apart at all from the point of view of meeting a social housing need.  We would be quite supportive of local authorities in that regard.  In many cases they would be properties that might have been on sale for a significant period and there was no market for them.  For example, our buy-and-renew programme is targeted at town centres, particularly in the context of properties that probably nobody else is going to buy which we do up even if there is a site further out on the fringe of a town.  The latter might be for the next phase of activity.  The national planning framework refers to trying to build up the core.  We are not be in any saying that it should be either-or.  If local authorities come forward looking to do both and it made sense then we would support that.</p></speech>

I appreciate that there are lots of vacant properties.  We are nearly four years into this crisis and various policies have been put forward for local authorities, which are now being fully funded.  Mr. McCarthy illustrated the drawdown parameters for funding to each of those authorities in terms of bringing schemes to development stage.  I do not think there is an excuse, but I am trying to understand the reason some local authorities have not done what they are supposed to be doing.</p></speech>

Deputy Farrell's local authority is a case in point whereby we are seeing the product on the ground in terms of finished houses and people living in them.  In other local authority areas, are at construction or final tender stage.  All local authorities now have a significant programme but they are at different stages in terms of bringing projects to fruition.</p></speech>

I am happy to provide him with the questions if he did not catch them all.</p> <p>  My final remark relates to the additional funding for the provision of family hubs.  Mr. McCarthy illustrated the cost of hotel accommodation versus family hub accommodation and it is clearly significantly cheaper.  He mentioned the capital costs, which is what the &euro;60 million is for.  How many of those facilities will be delivered for &euro;60 million?  Does Mr. McCarthy have an idea of where they will be located?  Are we looking primarily at the major cities, namely, Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway or are there other locations where there is proposed provision?</p></speech>

For example, one of the family hubs that is in operation is in Athy, County Kildare.  It is really where it makes sense from a local authority's perspective in terms of the homeless situation that they are dealing with.  The bulk of what is going to come on-stream with the additional funding is going to be in Dublin and the other main centres.  The Minister is engaged in a process  with the four Dublin local authorities to try to nail that quantity but we are talking about hundreds of additional family hub accommodation centres in Dublin.</p></speech>

I am not targeting those individuals for any other reason than that it is not discussed.  It is not something that is out there.  We are not discussing the fact that there are large numbers of people who are not entitled to social homes because of their nationality.  I would like more information to be provided to this committee, and perhaps even to the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I have not seen those figures being provided and it would be very helpful in terms of getting the total figure so we have an idea of what we are dealing with.

We need to change the provisions in order that they have a housing entitlement and they get houses.  We must stop spending vast sums of money on an annual basis on the provision of short-term accommodation and give them permanent residency here.  There is no point in the State continuing to throw money at the situation, we need to put such people in homes.  That is my point, lest anybody think I am saying this for other reasons.</p></speech>

I apologise if I repeat questions that have been asked.</p> <p>  I will start with Mr. McCarthy and his report, which was glowing and it looked good in terms of where we are going.  The view is that we seem to be getting on top of the housing issue but that is not the reality on the ground.  I know this because I represent a rural constituency, Carlow-Kilkenny.  The number of homeless people is at 10,000 plus and the waiting list is a mile long and is getting longer.  The view Mr. McCarthy gave this morning in his presentation and what the ordinary Joe Soap sees happening on the ground are two different things.  Figures are great but the reality is different.  We are still in a severe housing crisis.  That is well known and no figures will cover up that fact.  I would like to get a comment from Mr. McCarthy on that first.</p></speech>

I have tried to get AHBs to intervene and invest in mortgage-to-rent schemes in Kilkenny.  I contacted a few of them and I was told they were not interested on the basis that it was too costly and there was too much difficulty attached.  I was very disappointed with the response I got.  I mentioned individual cases and I thought the AHBs would be interested in buying the houses and leaving the families in them.  I also asked the county council but it said that it did not have a role to play in that regard but that the AHBs did.  They could buy houses and take over the mortgage and leave people in their homes instead of allowing the banks to put people out of their houses and them having to go on the list for social housing.  I thought there was plenty of scope for AHBs to buy such houses, or at least to look at them and see whether such an option would be viable, in order to keep people in their homes instead of them having to go on the social housing list.</p><p>I would like someone to give me a reason they did not use the mortgage-to-rent scheme produced by the Government or use it better.

I said that was nonsense where there were people who had been living in the houses for 15 or 16 years, that it was their own house, that they would be glad to stay where they were and gladly pay the rent if left i<i>n situ</i>.  However, no one was even willing to look at the houses.  They went through the entire process about which Mr. O'Connor is telling me.

It gets it from different sources.  I will move on.  </p> <p>   In the case of voluntary housing, there is a system under which tenants are not allowed to buy out their houses.   I was a member of a local authority for 20 years prior to coming into the House and always wondered why people could not buy out their house in the same way one could buy from the county councils and so on.  Families have a house and will pay a mortgage for ten, 15 or 20 years, but they can never own it.  I always thought that was wrong.  Taxpayers money was put into such housing.  If someone is long enough in a house, say, for seven years, he or she should be allowed to buy it out.  Will the Housing Agency ever consider changing that provision in order that houses could be purchased and bought out?</p></speech>

All of the families who reside in them will never be given the opportunity to buy them.  That policy is wrong and needs to be changed, whether at agency's level or the level of the Department or the Government.  If a family have been living in their house for seven to ten years, they should have the opportunity at some point to buy it out and live out their days in it.  I do not know who is responsible.  I have tried to suggest this several times, but no one is giving me an answer as to why it cannot be changed.</p></speech>

During the 1950s and 1960s it was always the local authorities which built houses.  Is the Department pushing towards voluntary housing bodies in providing social housing instead of county councils?  I know that some county councils are better than others in providing houses, but they are all turn-key.  When I first entered local government, they were building houses and had their own engineers and staff to build them and so on.  Now they look entirely to voluntary housing bodies or just buy them on contract.  I am disappointed that that happened.  We have lost many good staff.  The rural cottages built in the 1940s and 1950s provided a service.  Is it being pushed by the Department, rather than making the local authorities do what I reckon they ought to do, namely, build social and affordable housing?  I am happy with our local authority in Kilkenny which has been very busy and is way up there.</p><p>Other local authorities have not gone so far or have not built houses at all.  It is a pity that that is happening.  Why is there such a discrepancy between good and active local authorities and those that seem to be falling behind or not making any effort?</p></speech>

The building programmes of all local authorities are being ramped up, but some are at different stages of progression.  I do not want to give a sense that we are pushing either local authorities or approved housing bodies over the other.  That is not what this is about.  Rebuilding Ireland aims to deliver 50,000 social housing units under the headings of build, acquisition and leasing in the period to 2021.  Two thirds are to be delivered by local authorities and one third by AHBs.  A 2:1 ratio is a very big part of our vision for local authorities.</p></speech>

I am talking about value for money.  Does Mr. McCarthy have statistics to indicate the value for money achieved by local authorities in the case of an average three-bedroom house compared to voluntary bodies?  Is there a difference in cost between what a local authority would buy it for, on average, anywhere in the country and what a voluntary housing group would spend?  Does it come in at the same cost?</p></speech>

Some AHB projects cost less to construct, while some cost slightly more, but there is very little in it.  Going back to some of the earlier conversations, we want local authorities to be in the driving seat and make judgments on where and how social housing is to be delivered in their area and to take a lead role in partnering with any AHB which can play a part.  We have had quite a few more rural local authorities stating to us that in areas where they did not have land there were builders who had land but did not have access to capital.  In many cases, turn-key properties are a vehicle to marry them and actually get activity going in delivering social housing where it is needed.  We would be informed about the approach being taken in a local area by the local authority.</p></speech>

With modern technology, one would imagine the strength of stone and cement would be one of the first things that would be tested.  Why did that not happen?  The taxpayer will probably have to cover most of the cost.</p></speech>

Being a farmer, I know what a hectare of land is and it seems to be a lot of land to have lying idle, from what I am reading between the lines.

Instead of there being no regulation, there is a voluntary regulatory system in place.  To receive funding a body must subscribe to and go through it.

The Deputy said he previously had the view that the number was much smaller than over 500.  In fact, 90% of the approved housing body stock that is registered with the regulator is in the hands of 50 AHBs.  There are over 500, but we will go through a process before the regulatory system kicks in to identify the ones that are no longer active and remove them from the list.  The vast bulk of the AHB stock is concentrated in a much smaller number of AHBs.</p></speech>

Most of the actions we are taking to achieve value for money aim to make groups smaller and amalgamate them.  It is the preferred way to make them more efficient and effective.  Instead of this, the number appears to be growing when there are so many of them.  They are supposed to be non-profit, but there must be a reason for them starting.  I am sure there is a manager and staff in each of them.  They all have to be paid.  They might be voluntary bodies, but somebody is paying somebody.  Is it a waste of taxpayers' money to have so many?  Could the number be reduced to ten or 12 or could we have a target in that regard?  As Mr. McCarthy said, perhaps 400 of them were set up to build a few houses.  Are we talking about good management?  It is crazy to have that many individual agencies.</p></speech>

It has contributed to the fact that the vast bulk of the stock is concentrated in a small number of them.  As the statutory regulatory system is put into place in due course, it is possible that we will see an increase in the process of mergers and consolidation.  However, some of the approved housing bodies have a particular niche or focus.  They might be focused on older people, homeless persons or people with a disability.  There will always be these niche players in the system because they provide not only housing but often for a care element also, given the supports required.</p></speech>

Let us say that a local authority bought land a few years ago but did not use the site.  Solicitors on both sides got paid for conveyancing in order to transfer the land to the Housing Agency.  Now the Housing Agency is going to transfer to the land development agency and will pay for the conveyancing again.  We have about three sets of conveyancing happening here, with up to six solicitors involved, all for the one parcel of land.  Title is being moved from the local authority to the Housing Agency and then from the Housing Agency to the land development agency.  It is possible that the legal fees at the end of this process will be more per acre than the cost of the actual site.  Has anyone thought about that?  It seems grossly inefficient.  Why do we need another State agency?  Why can the Housing Agency not be beefed up?  Perhaps it is a policy matter but we must ask why every time there is a problem the answer seems to be to establish a new agency.  Here we go again.  The Housing Agency is relatively new.  I was here a few years ago when the land aggregation group, or whatever it was called, was in place.  That agency is gone now and the Housing Agency is in place but we are still talking about the same fields in all of these places throughout the country.  The Housing Agency will be gone in a few years.  There will be someone else at a future meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts looking at the same field owned by a new State organisation.  It is the same field the entire time.  This is great news for solicitors in any event .  I am not asking our guests to respond but I hope they understand the point I am making.  I am sensing a shrugging of the shoulders here.  I would prefer to see a greater effort going into building houses rather than into transferring title from one body to another.  That point flows out of the chart showing sites in the various local authority areas.</p> <p>  Who manages the land that is under the stewardship of the Housing Agency in all of the different counties?  Let us say it has 20 acres in a particular local authority area and 20 acres in another.  Does the farmer next door use that land to graze his cattle?  What happens with all of those sites?  The agency has 2 ha here, 3 ha there and so on.  What is happening with that land?  Money was spent when the local authorities bought the land initially.  When the Housing Agency was taking it over, contractors were sent out to fence off every one of the fields.  It will probably have to be re-fenced.  Who manages the sites?  How many sites does the agency have in its ownership around the country?  How are the sites managed?</p></speech>

Can somebody not gather data on the numbers of children who are homeless, the numbers that will exit homelessness in November and so on?  I am amazed.  This is the Committee of Public Accounts, which is chiefly concerned with money but if the Department is not even counting people or children, what is it doing?  I am baffled by what I am hearing.  I am hoping that someone will tell me I am misunderstanding what has been said.  Ms Hurley has just said that the Department does not count the number of children leaving homelessness.  It is awful.</p></speech>

It is absolutely awful.  The Department counts the adults leaving homelessness.  Generally, the ratio of those people in homelessness is 2:1, adults to children.  Approximately one third of those who are homeless are children.  Roughly 3,000 of the 9,000 are children.  The 9,800 figure includes children.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I should not be trying to come up with this figure.  The fact that this figure has not been recorded by anyone in the Department to date is awful.  Mr. McCarthy mentioned earlier that 4,729 adults exited homelessness in 2017.  He also said that 2,332 adults exited homelessness up to the end of June of this year.  The document provided to the committee during the break refers to 3,079 adults exiting homelessness in 2016, 2,322 exiting in 2015 and 2,161 exiting in 2014.</p><p>That adds up to 14,623 adults who have exited homelessness since 2014.  That figure excludes children.  In the circumstances, I am going to add on another 5,000 for the children who exited homelessness.  Shame on the Department that it did not count them.  I cannot believe it does not count the children exiting homelessness.  So 14,000 adults and approximately 5,000 children exited homelessness during that period and the officials tell me there are 9,800 people still homeless, which includes adults and children.  That is over 28,000 people who have been declared homeless since 2014.  I want to put that figure on the public record.</p><p> We all hear about the figures hovering around 9,000 or 10,000 but every year there are thousands going out of the system and thousands more coming in.  Effectively, 20,000 people have been homeless at some point in the past four years.  They were declared homeless and were accommodated in various centres and hotels.  They are no longer there, thank God, but there are still another 10,000 or 9,800 there.  The figure for those who have presented as homeless, adults and children, since 2014, at a minimum and based on what the officials are telling us, is over 28,000.  That is a figure I have never seen or heard before and I am only putting it together on the basis of the information we have been given.  Do our guests follow how I have arrived at that number?  There were 14,000 adults and I am adding on a third again to account for children, making almost 20,000.  There are nearly 10,000 still there, which means that over 28,000 people have been declared homeless since 2014.  I want the public to understand that.</p><p> We talk about homelessness figures and hear that only 10,000 people are homeless and that the problem is not really getting worse.  Almost 30,000 people have been declared homeless since 2014.  I can understand why the Department is not getting on top of the problem if it does not even count all of those affected.  I do not want to be dramatic but, as a public representative, I find this hurtful.  After all this and after we have trusted the Department to deal with homelessness, the officials now tell us they do not even count the homeless children who are going into hotels, hubs and places of that nature.  I have made my point and I ask the officials to reflect on it.</p></speech>

I have put that in the public arena just to get the point across.</p> <p>  The next matter I want to ask about is the figures we were given regarding the breakdown of the &euro;1.4 billion in the housing budget last year, which is fine.  Some &euro;800 million of relates to build, acquire or lease.  I will come back to the breakdown of that part.  A further &euro;296 million was spent on RAS or HAP, &euro;109 million on homelessness and &euro;201 million on pyrite resolution, house grants, agencies, Traveller accommodation and, probably, repairs for the elderly and people with disabilities.  We understand all that.  We are focusing on the build aspect.  In that context, &euro;802 million was the figure for build, acquire and lease.  Do the officials have a breakdown of that amount in the context of the amounts spent on build, acquire and lease?  Is it readily to hand?</p></speech>

Out of the &euro;1.4 billion spent last year on the housing programme, how much was specifically spent on building houses?  It is probably the question I should have asked at the outset.  How much of the &euro;1.4 billion was spent on housing construction, not acquisition, leasing, HAP, homelessness or house improvement grants?</p></speech>

We divided the supports for social housing into a rental figure and a construct or acquire figure.  The Chairman can see on the slide that the total is &euro;885 million.  I think the difference between that figure and the &euro;802 billion is possibly the social housing current expenditure, which is a figure of &euro;84 million.  That is added in but the rest of it is an analysis of the figure of &euro;802 million.</p></speech>

If 1,014 local authority houses were built last year, that was poor.  In the first six months of this year only 487 local authority houses have been built.  Let us hope there is a big increase on that.  That is all I can hope for.</p><p>I will ask about one related topic before I let other members come back.  The issue concerns the housing summit the Department held on 17 September in the Custom House.  I thank the witnesses for giving us information on that.  The Department gave the committee a sheet of paper.  I am not sure it was fully circulated over lunch.  The document lists actions to be taken following the summit.  These are notes taken by officials of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on the summit.  In attendance were Mr. McCarthy, the Minister of State, Deputy English, the City and County Management Association, CCMA, and the Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH.  </p><p>How many years into the housing crisis are we?  I know the Department will not use the term but it is an emergency for those who are affected.  It has been quite a number of years.  If homelessness has been highlighted since before 2014, we are certainly five years into the housing crisis.  In that light, under the heading &quot;Actions to bring forward&quot;, this is what the Department's notes of its meeting on that day with its Minister of State state:</p><blockquote>More high-level/ national strategic collaboration between CCMA and AHB representatives in order to plan and develop best practice on a national basis.  As it stands, we don&rsquo;t have a view of how the shortfall against targets will be made-up; don&rsquo;t have a view of the local plans at the level of the individual 31 local authorities. </blockquote> <p>Five years into the housing crisis, according to the minutes of a meeting attended by the Minister of State, the Secretary General, the CCMA and the body representing the approved housing bodies, the attendees state they do not have a view of the plans at the level of the 31 individual local authorities.  Is it any wonder we are where we are when it comes to housing?  If, as an occupant, I had read that four years ago, I would have thought those concerned should get their act together.  Five years on, however, this is what we are being told.</p><p>The Department has made light of the lack of statutory regulation for approved housing bodies.  It has spoken of the voluntary code but that has not delivered information that gives the Department a view of the plans at the level of the 31 individual local authorities.  I can understand that the Comptroller and Auditor General might say that, and I believe he does say that in his report.  However, I note this is stated in the minutes taken by the Department's own senior officials on its meeting four weeks ago with its Minister of State and the organisations I have mentioned.  The Department still does not know what is happening in the 31 local authorities.  We had hoped to make a bit of progress here today, but we are so badly prepared five years on that we do not even know what is happening in the local authorities.  These are the Department's minutes. </p></speech>

It may be down to our different experiences in dealing with people coming into our constituency offices.  Last Friday three new families came into my office in the space of an hour.  It usually happens on a Friday afternoon when I can do very little about it.  We are seeing the stress these people are suffering.  It is not possible to quantify the damage done by that experience of homelessness even if it is only for two or three months.  Given the uncertainty and stress that is caused, we need to accurately capture the number of people it is damaging.</p> <p>  Mr. John McCarthy gave us figures for builds and acquiring leases.  In terms of transparency we should not see builds and acquiring leases connected together because acquiring leases is not new, but existing.  We need to see the amount of money for builds expressed separately on every occasion.  Is regeneration included in that build component?  A number of regeneration programmes are under way.  Presumably they are also counted in that.  Some of those go back many years, including, for example, O'Devaney Gardens and St. Michael's Estate in Inchicore.

I took a paragraph from one of the documents we got, which stated it is worth noting that 1,074 units went on site in quarter 2 of 2018, which is an increase of 27% on the previous quarter, which was 846, and an increase of 239% on quarter 2 of 2017.  I accept the percentages are right, but the numbers are tiny relative to the scale of the problem.  That kind of presentation suggesting something is a great leap ahead drives us bananas.  The Department would want to put an extra zero at the end of some of those numbers to make a sizeable impact.</p> <p>  Page 125 of the Comptroller and Auditor General report relates to the approved housing bodies.  Paragraph 10.36 states "A report from the Local Government Audit Service (LGAS) in December 2015 found a number of instances in a number of local authorities, where mortgages, related to the three schemes, were not fully executed and recommended conducting a review and reconciliation of all mortgages charged on AHB properties."  About 12 different points are made about other recommendations.  One of them is that "local authorities should record all loans outstanding on their financial systems and issue annual loan balance statement".  Another recommendation is that "local authorities should review AHB projects to ensure that final accounts and post-project reviews have been completed".  Another one is that "suitably qualified local authority staff should inspect and verify certificates for payment for capital projects", which suggests they are not suitably qualified.  It also recommends that "local authorities should ensure that relevant staff received training in capital appraisal and procurement requirements", which suggests a deficiency there.</p> <p>  Earlier we heard that the local government auditor is coming back to review how those recommendations were completed.  That was not available when this report was being done.  Is that available now?</p></speech>

It would be worth exploring what those failings were because they would not be pointed out as recommendations if there were not failures in those areas.  The number of questions the local government audit threw up certainly shows that there is an issue with oversight here.  Given that this is a significant partner in delivering social housing, it is really important that it has the kind of oversight that is needed.  Presumably we will get that as soon as the Department has it at the end of the year.  I ask him to make a note of that so that it is not forgotten about.</p> <p>  Mr. John McCarthy might come back to us if he does not have the information immediately to hand on the following matters.  Document 1679(ii), dated 22 October, contains a table stating that 582 sites are unencumbered and that 128 sites have loans attached to them.  There is no way of knowing the potential number of houses that could be accommodated on those sites.  The 128 figure might be the higher number in terms of the number that can be accommodated.  I ask Mr. John McCarthy to provide the projected number of houses that could be accommodated on those sites - the unencumbered and the ones that have loans attached.</p></speech>

Obviously this was under the Rebuilding Ireland home loan.  By August 2018 only 57 loans had been drawn down.  Are there many more in the pipeline?  Has this not succeeded?  What are the impediments?  What have we learned from that?  I presume someone from the Housing Agency can answer that. </p></speech>

There was a very hot debate in the D&aacute;il because the feeling was that HAP was being introduced to get people off the housing waiting list.</p><p>A housing transfer provision was introduced where somebody was regarded as suitably accommodated where HAP was supporting that tenancy.  However, we are seeing the housing waiting lists appearing to go down when, in fact, the number of HAP tenancies is going up.  In essence, the same number of people must be provided for.  Is HAP regarded as a sustainable form of long-term housing?  If someone loses a tenancy, he or she must source accommodation himself or herself.  For example, in my area HAP for a family of two adults and three children is approximately &euro;1,300 per month, if one can find accommodation.  Usually, the family has to pay more than that themselves.  Over 30 years, that is &euro;468,000 but with no house at the end of it.  It is a very expensive funding mechanism.  We have been told by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that by 2022, HAP will cost in the region of &euro;1.7 billion.  The more that goes up, the greater the squeeze on the finance needed to build.  It then becomes an unsustainable form of housing support.  Is it regarded within the Department as sustainable in the long term?  Given the new thinking on building, are we likely to see HAP phased out?  Is that what the most recent research suggests?</p></speech>

However, even within the space of Rebuilding Ireland, its relative contribution to meeting people's housing needs will start to change from next year.  By 2021, it will no longer be the biggest component in meeting social housing need.  On the transfer issue, it was provided for in legislation that people could go on the transfer list if they wished.  To date, approximately 1,400 households have moved from HAP to mainstream social housing.</p></speech>

Is that what he is talking about or is he talking about merging them?  I appreciate a lot of these are very small.  There are a good few of them in Kildare.  There might have been a dozen houses or half a dozen houses and it was just one body and there was a name on it.  Some of them worked well and some did not.  Very often they rely on volunteers which can be very patchy.  I appreciate why there are the number there are.  At the end of the mortgage period, which has been funded from the public purse, there is still a house there and that house will turn over at some point.  They are not going to be sold.  The houses will always be owned by the approved housing body so if the Department ceases to recognise an approved housing body, what happens to the houses?</p></speech>

When we did a de-listing exercise five or six years ago, bodies were removed from the approved housing body list.  They had gotten status but had never progressed to delivering a project.  If we find there are some of those in the next iteration of that exercise, they would come off the list.  If one wants to remain as an approved housing body and is signed up to the code and can deliver, that is fine.  Otherwise, we will have to get into a space where, in effect, the assets would transfer to a merger process or a transfer process across to another approved housing body.  Ultimately, the units would continue within the sector, although possibly in some circumstances through another body.</p></speech>

I contacted Waterford City Council and I got the figures up to September.  If it has them, I am sure every local authority has them.  There are 30 local authorities.  We want as much information as possible to allow us to see what is happening in social housing.  Whatever timeframe Mr. McCarthy can get them for is fine.  I think he can get them up to September but whenever he can get them is fine.  The breakdown is applications received, validated and approved.  I am talking about them being broken down by local authority.  I also want the figures for the Rebuilding Ireland targets under the headings acquisitions, build and lease.  What are the targets for each local authority and what targets are being met?  Mr. McCarthy gave us the overall figures but I want them broken down by local authority.  We might be able to see that some local authorities are better at delivering than others.  We will then be able to see the number of people being approved for housing, the targets over the next three years for each local authority and whether things will get better or worse or stay the same so that at least we can benchmark.  Could as much as possible be provided to the committee?  I will send the clerk a note of exactly what I am looking for in that breakdown which can then be forwarded to Mr. McCarthy.</p></speech>

One of the difficulties with building new homes is the process and the Cathaoirleach has asked how much of the overall money is spent on building new homes.  We have been told that one of the problems is the four stage process.  We hope to get some of the county managers, or their association, in to help us better understand that aspect .  We know they have been before the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The Secretary General said the Department came up with a bespoke one stage process that was offered to local authorities.  It was anticipated that 200 projects would avail of it but only 12 did so.  He said that the reason for the low uptake was that local authorities felt they would be exposed to risk.  I counter that the reason there was a four stage process in the first place was that local authorities did not want to take any of the risk.  The point they make to us when we meet them, as politicians, is that unless they know they are going to get paid back fully by the Department they will not take any risk because they cannot afford to do so.  Whether it is one stage or four stages the problem is the risk.  The Secretary General said the process was modified and some of the risks were removed.  Have all the risks been removed?  Will the local authorities still feel, even with the modified version, that the element of risk is still too great for them to engage with the process?</p></speech>

This was one of the issues in the overall debate.  The Department says the local authorities will not build quickly enough and the local authorities say they cannot because the process takes so long from start to finish due to a cumbersome four stage process.  The Secretary General has said the process was modified down to a one stage process and most of the risks they were concerned about were removed.  Unfortunately, there were only 12 projects out of an anticipated 200 projects.  That shows there is something wrong somewhere and I want to understand what is still wrong.</p></speech>

We thought we had gotten to the bottom of it and we made these changes but that still has not resulted in the take-up.  Talking about the 59-week process, in terms of it being cumbersome, the 59-week process if it works the way that it should - it is aligned with private sector best practice in terms of housing development - it can actually deliver projects in as fast a manner as the private sector and it can provide the certainty that the local authorities need.</p></speech>

I have spoken to a number of them.  If the Secretary General remembers the last time he was in here, I had contacted a number of managers who I know across this State and that was one of their concerns.  I am interested to see how this works out.  Obviously, it is still not fully resolved and I hope that it is because it certainly was one of the impediments.</p><p>I want to move on to discussing the approved housing bodies.  Much has been made of the volume of such bodies.  EUROSTAT has compiled a report that deals with whether the expenditure for approved housing bodies would be on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet.  The second paragraph of its conclusions reads: </p><blockquote>Moreover, Eurostat considers that AHBs have a non-market nature due to their principal aims and other existing provisions.  Furthermore, the prices charged for renting cannot be seen as being economically significant, due to the fact, among others, that they do not seem to respond to change in the market or to economic signals and have little influence on how much the producer is prepared to supply and on the quantities demanded.</blockquote> <p>Essentially what I am taking from that is that the not-for-profit element of the approved housing bodies needs to change fundamentally, that the rents need to reflect market rents and that the investments decisions that are made need to change as well.</p></speech>

I think it was looking at what the facts are in relation to the AHBs.  Based on what the facts are, its conclusion was that they should be classified as being part of the Government sector.  I do not think it is a proposal to shift them into the market and make them operate as market players.  Maybe it was more recognising that they are providing rents in a non-market responsive way.</p></speech>

We are a little further back on the second phase and we will launch the third bundle shortly.  The public sector benchmark is relevant to all three.  The established practice is that once the procurement process for all three is completed, that is, once comparable bundles are completed, the public sector benchmark is published on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's website.</p></speech>

My problem is that we can never really determine that, however.  We can determine it at some stage long afterwards, but there is little democratic accountability about all of this.  We came up against it in other areas also.  We must find some way of doing it and of satisfactorily establishing that going down this route will give value for money and that everything is what it seems.</p> <p>  I will return to that point but I wish to make a general observation about the human side of all of this.  I imagine Mr. John McCarthy and everyone else here understands that there are people in need of social housing, that there are people on housing lists - many of whom live in their parents' or friends' homes - and people in need of affordable housing, a matter on which we have not even touched.  There was very little in the budget in respect of affordable housing.  Almost everyone who has a housing need is forced into the private rented sector, which has pushed up the price of rents.  When I arrive in my constituency office in Waterford tomorrow, probably a dozen or more of the many people I must meet will have housing-related issues.  They are looking for social housing but it is not there.  I will have to tell them that they must find private rented accommodation through HAP, but they cannot find places within the rent caps.  They are on a merry-go-round and they come to us to look for assistance.  They then ask us to make representations for houses which do not exist.  I do not buy into that clientelist system of doing things in any event; people should be entitled to a home based on merit and need.  They come to local politicians, however, when they want advice.  The problem is that for many of them there is not enough private rented accommodation available, or certainly not at the rates where they can avail of HAP.  They are left to their own devices and, in many cases, abandoned.  That is the reality and, unless we seriously start to build, it will continue to be the case and there will be debate after debate in the D&aacute;il regarding the housing crisis.  The Cathaoirleach said earlier that it had gone on for five years but it is probably longer than that.</p> <p>  I return to what was said earlier about the amount of money we spend on subsidising people in private rented accommodation rather than building homes.  The human cost of this is enormous.  I stress that it is difficult for us, as politicians, to deal with people who we know have a real housing need and who ask us to help them or make representations.  As I said, however, we are making representations for houses that do not exist.  We must do it and we go into the local council and meet the housing officers but they say "Sorry, Deputy, but HAP is the only option".  We revert to the constituents but they say they cannot find anywhere.  Does the Department understand what it is like for people in that situation?  Does it understand why we say there is a housing emergency which is real, which impacts on people's lives and about which much more needs to be done?</p> <p>  As an observation, in my constituency in Waterford, where the target is 687 units by the end of 2021 and with almost 300 people who are approved for housing this year alone, notwithstanding how many came off the list, we are only scratching the surface.  We are not dealing with the crisis at all, notwithstanding all the figures trotted out about how many homes will be built, how many acquisitions and purchases there will be and so on.  If the targets for each local authority are broken down, one will see we are not getting to grips with it at all.  That is only an observation and if Mr. John McCarthy wishes to respond he can do so.</p></speech>

I accept what he says and I do not think anybody sitting on this side of the room does not fully understand the implications of the housing crisis.  We visit homeless facilities and we see at first hand what it means for some people.  I fully understand and accept, therefore, what he says.</p> <p>  We have embarked on a six-year plan in the form of Rebuilding Ireland.  In overall terms, we have exceeded the targets of the first two years and the build piece is increasing, has increased over the past two years and will get to a point in 2021 where it will exceed 8,700, from a point in 2014 or 2015 when it was in the hundreds at most.  There is an ambitious plan, therefore.  The mix in the early years is a particular mix but it will evolve very much towards the build programme as it is significantly ramped back up to where it was in 2007 or 2008, in terms of scale of build.  We are aiming to get there and there is full commitment and dedication to that on this side of the room.  There is full understanding of the implications of what the housing situation means for people on a daily basis.</p></speech>

It has been put in a particular position, where it is doing its job.  However I am looking and see it has had a summit - of which the Chairman has asked for its result - and spring lectures, there was a conference in 2017 which was moderated by Ms Terry Prone.

We are investing a significant amount of money.  The housing crisis in Galway is equal to, if not worse than, the crisis in Dublin.  Let me outline the facts.  People have been on the housing waiting list since 2002.  Up until very recently, there were almost 5,000 households on the list, but, mysteriously and magically, that number has been reduced.  We do not know how that was achieved, but one of the reasons is that when someone takes a house under the HAP scheme, he or she is taken off the list.  The figures the Housing Agency sees for Galway have been reduced because people have accepted a HAP scheme payment and are no longer on the waiting list but a transfer list and so on.  Do the witnesses understand my frustration?  I am looking at the statistics, yet the housing crisis is getting worse.  We have a housing agency that is holding a summit, conferences and spring lectures, but it is not carrying out research into the real causes of the crisis which I see as no social houses having been built in Galway city - I am using Galway as an example - since 2009.  In 2018 it started to build 14.  There is no escaping the figure.  Did the Housing Agency look at the affect of not building a single social house in Galway city until 2018?</p></speech>

We make a summary of social housing assessments, to which we referred.  We also produce a statement on housing demand and supply nationally.  It looks at the situation at a national level, driving down to the likely demand for and supply of accommodation.  It also looks at affordability.</p></speech>

Of course, the Housing Agency has to look at the problem nationally, but it also has to learn from what is happening.  Let us use Galway as an example.  No social house was built and the only game in town is the HAP scheme.  That was a policy decision made in the Department.  As my colleague said, people are being told that their only option is to find a place to rent and what costs the HAP scheme will cover, but the amount of the payment is useless in Galway.  One cannot find a two-bedroom, or even a one-bedroom, apartment to rent which is within the range of the payment.  That is a fact.  Has the Housing Agency looked at it?</p></speech>

I know that the limits are set.  I know what the limits are in Galway and that the local authority can use its discretion.  Notwithstanding all of that, one simply cannot find a house in Galway to rent.  That is why the homeless figures are rising.  I know from a person related to me who was looking for accommodation that it costs more than &euro;1,000 a month to rent a two-bedroom apartment.  The HAP scheme has been the only game in town since 2014 when it was rolled out having been a pilot scheme.  Some &euro;300 million has been allocated this year, double the figure for last year.  Will Mr. McCarthy comment on the increase from &euro;150 million to &euro;300 million which will rise to &euro;421 million?  There is also the RAS, as well as the rent supplement scheme.  Has it occurred to the officials from the Housing Agency that they should conduct research into the impact of the various schemes on affordability in the housing market?</p></speech>

If the allocation for the HAP scheme is on an upward trajectory and spending next year will rise to &euro;421 million, it is one scheme that is actively promoting the private housing market.  Will the officials, please, try to answer my question?  If they are not able to do so and say they cannot, that is okay, too.  I am trying to understand it and do not want to be negative, but there cannot be solutions if the money spent on schemes that promote the private housing market continues to rise.</p></speech>

It is a reflection of the need to further accelerate the building programme in order that we will get to a point in 2021 where through a process of build, acquisition and lease we will be housing more people than under the HAP scheme.</p></speech>

Last year building work started on 14 social houses.  Does Mr. McCarthy know straight off - I am sure the Housing Agency brought in the city manager - the size of the land bank available and what the obstacles are to direct build, in encouraging small builders to come forward or engaging in the supply of co-operative housing which is not on the radar?  Personally, I would have thought this was the role of the Housing Agency, but I ask both witnesses to comment on the problem in Galway.</p></speech>

There are 14 acres of land at Ceannt Station which is in a central location, eight of which are included in a plan on behalf of Bus &Eacute;ireann with a private developer.  There are major land banks in the docks area, while there is other land that was bought at astronomical prices.  Of all cities, there should not be a housing crisis in Galway, but there is.  I know that the Housing Agency has knowledge of the land banks available.  In my time as a local authority member there was the land aggregation scheme.  It was a time when we bought land at a ferocious price, some of which was then given to a body in Dublin to avoid paying interest.  All of that land is available.  Is it the case that the Housing Agency is hoarding land?</p></speech>

The last time was when representatives of the Garda were before us, and they actually improved.  We have a major housing crisis and I see no element of value for money anywhere.  I see a complete lack of value for money in terms of the HAP scheme and RAS.  The Housing Agency is in the middle of a policy that is crazy.  It is misusing language, though not on a personal basis, in talking about social housing, social support and housing solutions as opposed to a right to a home and how to give security of tenure.  There is a complete absence of a recognition of that in any of the documents before me from the Department and the Housing Agency.  Where the fault lies-----</p></speech>

I will give the Deputy the figures for Galway city but the number of houses provided in terms of what we are acquiring through the NAMA portfolio is significant.  When we were working with NAMA, there were quite a number of developments in Galway city and a lot of effort was put into completing those developments and making them available for social housing.  I would need to check the number but it was of the order of 196 houses for social housing.</p></speech>

All I have seen is the housing crisis get worse and worse, and the waiting lists get longer, and then more deception in terms of the waiting list being halved because they are now on HAP or somewhere else.  That is what I have seen.  I do not mind waiting and people do not mind waiting.  In fact, that is the biggest change from when I was elected first.  We would go with people and ask them to bear with us and tell them they would get a house eventually because they were entitled to one.  Now, there is absolutely no message like that.  They are going from one house to another to another.  It is shocking.  However, this is about value for money and I do not see any value for money.  I see one level of bureaucracy after another.</p></speech>

I will always ask a question if I do not know the answer.  If I do not know the difference between one and the other, I take it that others also do not.  As such, I do not mind asking.  The Comptroller and Auditor General stated earlier that the Department is committed to tidying up the register of approved housing bodies prior to the introduction of the statutory regulation.  In the five years' work involved in that tidying-up exercise, it will be discovered that the agencies own properties out there.  The question arises as to where it is to go.  Trusts were set up 30 years ago and people have long since passed away.  Where is it registered?  I can see it being a far more protracted exercise than-----</p></speech>

Mr. O'Connor is saying that the agency is acting as the banks' selling agent and auctioneer and finding people to buy properties.  It is getting blue-chip purchasers who have no problem with mortgage approval.  Nobody else would do that for the banks for nothing.  I ask Mr. O'Connor to go away and think about that.  The agency should be charging the banks they minimum fee that they would have to pay in the commercial market to get the same work done.  While we need houses, I do not understand why we are finding buyers for banks free of charge.  I do not get it.  I ask Mr. O'Connor just to think about it.  That is all I will say.  Perhaps I am coming at it from a different perspective.  I ask Mr. O'Connor to come back and tell me if there is a reason I am talking nonsense.  On the face of it, I do not understand why we are doing it.</p> <p>  We glanced over the four-stage down to one-stage approval process.  We had a bit of discussion and Mr. McCarthy was on top of it.  This one-stage approval was much vaunted but Mr. McCarthy is saying chief executives are loath to take on a risk.  I can understand why they would be.  They are being asked to apply for a figure before a project has gone to tender.  It is a little bit premature but the Department is going to hold them to that price, albeit they can be facilitated with tender inflation provided the &euro;2 million cap is not exceeded.  There is still a &euro;2 million cap in the scheme.  Did the Department sit down with the CCMA to work out if this single-stage approval process was one local authorities would run with or was it simply announced only for the authorities to say they were not interested?  Will Mr. John McCarthy talk me through the process?  Did they indicate that what the agency came up with was a good scheme?  If they gave it the go-ahead, why are they not operating it?</p></speech>

For what it is worth, some of it goes back to what I said at the outset.

What I am saying is that Rebuilding Ireland has been in place for just over two years.  Within less than a year and a half, we had worked through a revised one-stage process and a much shorter, targeted, timelined, four-stage process.  We have been quite active in trying to make sure that the build programme that we envisage going on a sharp upwards trajectory has the systems to support it.</p></speech>

Builders are making more money from building offices and hotels than from housing.  It does not allow for long lead-in periods for builders, for example.</p></speech>

We will be able to determine the factors that are impacting delivery.</p></speech>

In that context, I suggest that the Department should detail on its website a list of those projects, by county and by stage.  It should be possible to see at a glance which ones have moved from stage one to stage two, for example, on a particular day.  The public will then be able to see very quickly that projects are sitting with their local authority for nine months, for example, without moving.  That must be shown.</p></speech>

We are not asking the Department to send out a circular to the housing officer to be filled in and emailed back.  There should be a mechanism in the Department to monitor and publish data on those projects that have started.  When they have successfully gone through stage one, a box could be ticked in the Department.  The same applies with progressing to stage two and so on but if a project is sitting at stage three for six months, somebody should know what is going on there.</p></speech>

Why is the credit policy governing loan approval decisions a secret?  Why is this information not available to any member of the public or to public representatives?  I tabled a parliamentary question and asked for a copy of said policy because I wanted to be able to explain to people why they did not get loan approval but it is a secret.  Why is that the case?  It affects people's lives and it is not fair for a public body to have a secret document.  My local authority has informed me that it is a secret and that I am not entitled to see it.  I have asked a parliamentary question and have been told it is a secret.  I also raised it as a Topical Issue a number of months ago but the answer I got was "No hope".  Will Mr. John McCarthy explain why the decision-making process around approving loans is secret?</p></speech>

I know of couples who have split up, legally separated and sold the family home.  They might have ended up with &euro;20,000 having cleared the mortgage.  However, under the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, one of the parties must still live in the original house.  I think I am correct in saying that.  Under the scheme, a loan will be given to the person who must look for a new house.  A condition of the scheme is that one of the parties must stay in the house.  One of the parties may not have benefitted financially to any extent or may have only ended up with &euro;10,000 but is ineligible.  I ask the Department to clarify the exact specifics in such circumstances.  People are coming up against that barrier.  Applicants have suggested to me that it is unconstitutional that their right to access this loan scheme is being jeopardised by virtue of the fact that someone now unconnected to them lives in a particular house, namely, the former family home.</p></speech>

This is the credit union movement.  Everybody, starting with the banks, is determined to keep credit unions out of their sphere of activity.  The Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, said just the other day in answer to a parliamentary question that one of the credit unions is ready, that it has gone through the process and has money available.  He stated he could not be any clearer than this and it would be very helpful if it could be explored with housing officials - he must have been speaking about the departmental officials.  He also stated that to be ready, a special purpose vehicle must conform to the Central Bank requirements and no other vehicle will be acceptable, presumably to the Central Bank.  Will Mr. McCarthy talk me through this because I think I heard an announcement on my way here this morning that a credit union would be able to come into this but the Central Bank has restrictions on that credit union lending its money?  I have said what the Minister of State, Damien English, stated very recently.  Perhaps it was not scripted.</p></speech>

The Central Bank needs to look at the requirements and steps and whether certain minimum levels are met.  Earlier this year, the Central Bank amended some of its rules.  In parallel with this, the Department is not in the job of telling credit unions that they must loan to approved housing bodies but we did make sure we engaged and facilitated dialogue between the approved housing body sector through the ICSC.  We provided core research funding, through innovation funds, to the approved housing body sector on how a special purpose vehicle could be developed that could avail of credit union funding.</p></speech>

In recent years, they have been looking to see whether there are funds they could draw on, either through European banks or private Irish banks.  In the middle of this process, in December the CSO concluded its analysis of the approved housing bodies and made a decision that all current activity and lending undertaken by approved housing bodies in Ireland is on the general government balance sheet.</p></speech>

It certainly has to do with legal and professional costs and we will come to the specifics.  There were property acquisitions and then legal and professional separate to that, and then there were office administration costs and some employment costs.  My impression is that, out of &euro;2.5 million spent, almost 50% was outside procurement guidelines because the vast majority of the Housing Agency's expenditure during the year related to pyrite, employment costs, pension costs, depreciation costs, HomeBond costs, transfers to the Exchequer, Fingal costs.  There is only about &euro;4 million left, or even less.  Most of the Housing Agency's discretionary purchasing or procurement of goods and services was completely outside the pale.  Does Mr. O'Connor understand the point I am making?  I have narrowed down the areas where this breach of procurement procedures occurred and ruled out all of the areas in which it cannot have occurred.  That means that in the areas where good and services were procured, &euro;1.246 million was outside procurement guidelines.  That is a phenomenally high percentage.  I have never seen any organisation with such a high percentage of their procurement outside Government guidelines.  I know Mr. O'Connor will give me the excuse now but does he get the starting point?</p></speech>

I know that after the agency got paid, it would take the AHBs a week, or two, or three to get their tenants in.  They were required to take the people off the local authority list anyway and they would have been doing the interviewing process of those people towards the end of the process.  It looks now as if we are uncovering a new void system through the agency.  The agency buys a house but it can take a year before the tenant gets the house.</p></speech>

I think I have done enough.  I wished to ask some more questions about the financial statements but we have had a long day.  As witnesses will understand, we are trying to get information into the public arena in order that people will understand what is going on because there is some frustration with how long it has taken the &euro;1.4 billion spent on housing last year to translate into houses on the ground, never mind the &euro;1.5 billion or &euro;1.6 billion spent on housing this year.  I know there are many acquisitions and many issues at local authority and approved housing body levels.  That is why we are having a second meeting which we hope some chief executives will attend to help close the circle because they are an important group of people.</p> <p>  I thank all the witnesses from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Housing Agency, as well as the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff, for their attendance today.  The meeting is adjourned until Thursday, 8 November 2018, when we will meet with the State Claims Agency on matters related to medical negligence, CervicalCheck and thalidomide litigation.  We will have a further meeting with the witnesses as soon as possible but we must confirm the date.</p></speech>
