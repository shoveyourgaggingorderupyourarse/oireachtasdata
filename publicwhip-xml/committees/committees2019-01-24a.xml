    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-24a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019012400002#B00400"><p>I want to raise an issue before we meet the representatives from the institutes.  The HEA's opening statement refers to its draft report into Waterford Institute of Technology.</p><p>This is the investigation conducted by Mr. McLoone.  We raised this several times with the HEA because the report itself was referred to the Attorney General and legal advice was sought from the legal team of the HEA.  During the latest meeting we had with the HEA, its outgoing CEO was confident that some report would be published but the correspondence received since seems to suggest that there will be no report.  The board will have to formally decide this but the correspondence suggests that there will not be any report and that the HEA will write to the 50 whistleblowers, thanking them for their input.  That is not acceptable at all.  We must call in the Secretary General or, if he has a conflict of interest, the next best person from the Department and the HEA to explain the options now.  </p><p> The key issue is that the HEA is claiming that it did not have the authority to prepare the report it prepared but it is more a question of the information that surfaced in the course of the investigation rather than the HEA being able to conduct an examination.  In any event, there seems to be precedent here.  In Waterford and in other areas, the Minister appointed inspectors to examine issues and that mechanism does allow for an examination of the types of issues that were examined in the course of the McLoone report.  We simply cannot accept that we overstepped our powers.  What has not changed are the facts and I imagine that whatever conclusions or recommendations are contained in the report are not in dispute.  The only contentious issue is the extent of the HEA's powers.  We need to look at the issue of the powers of the HEA if it does not have the power to conduct this type of examination.  It expects the Committee of Public Accounts to do some of the work, which we are doing, although we are not equipped for it.  It is hiring all sorts of outside organisations at significant cost to the taxpayer.  Some reports are being discredited by whistleblowers saying that they do not agree with the findings.  Individuals can have their own opinions on them.  A number of issues are at play here but the primary one is that we do not simply accept the HEA's assertion, if such an assertion is made, that it cannot do anything and allow this to be dropped.  That cannot happen.  We said that we would come back to this issue, even though it is a matter of policy.  We can still make recommendations to the Minister if we so wish.  The powers of the HEA are being considered currently and at some point this committee needs to reflect on that issue as well because it has an impact on our work.  My primary concern is the first part so I ask the Chairman to provide guidance on how we go about-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-24a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019012400002#C00200"><p>It is clear from the opening statement, which will be discussed, that there is a big matter of principle here.  We were assured that a report of some description would be concluded and published.  However, we are now being told that the advice provided to the HEA makes it clear that this is "not possible".  The authority has gone down a long road with a lot of people only to find, at the end of the day, that it had no authority to go down that road at all.  If the HEA does not have the authority to do the job that people think it should be doing, that is a legislative matter to which we will have to return.  There was a general understanding that there was a need for such an investigation and report, and I am sure that is accepted by the Department.  Some alternative method of providing such a report will have to be found by the Department or the Minister.  One cannot go three quarters of the way down a road and then say that one should not have come here.  The job still needs to be done.  Perhaps this was not the right way to go about it but the process cannot just stop.  We will have to raise this with the Secretary General to see if the Department has the power to bring this matter to a conclusion.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General would have been across this area in the context of dealing with the Quigley report into Waterford, furnished to a previous Committee of Public Accounts.  An inspector was appointed by the Minister to conduct a statutory inspection.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

There is a gap the institutional oversight structures and this committee appears to be the final point at which the institutions can be held to account.  The problem is that we could spend a small fortune on the well-known organisations that crop up here all the time.  There are four or five whose names crop up all the time.  This is costing money, by virtue of the fact that it is an historical look-back on things that have gone wrong but it is also undermining the institutions themselves.  If people think that there is no proper oversight, that prompts behaviour, which we end up having to look at retrospectively rather than preventing such behaviour.  We must get to the root cause of this because the entire sector is featuring too prominently.  We must explore this issue with the Department of Education and Skills as much as with the HEA.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-24a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019012400002#C01000"><p>We will take it up with the Secretary General later.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-24a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019012400002#C01100"><p>I agree 100% with both of my colleagues.  There is a gap in the competence and authority between the Department, the HEA and the institutions themselves and it is totally unclear as to who is responsible for what.  On another issue, the ETBs are out there on an arm that is independent as well.  There does not seem to be anybody to tie it together.  It just gets kicked back into this committee and we all know what happens in here then.  They say that it is the subject of investigation, there is a protected disclosure or it is before the courts and they cannot say anything.  While I appreciate that this is a policy issue, which is not part of our remit, we can make recommendations.  There are major deficits in the overall oversight of the education sector, particularly at third level, but also at second level with the ETBs.  We should consider devoting a session to protected disclosures and the fact that the legislation governing them is defective.  That legislation needs to be reviewed because it is focused on internal investigation of one's own problems, whereby people selected as those responsible may well be closely associated with the investigation of a protected disclosure or where their proximity to such an investigation would not help the perception of integrity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-24a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019012400002#C01200"><p>Just to add to what Deputy MacSharry has said in regard to the gap in the HEA's powers, that is precisely my understanding of the why the previous CEO of the authority resigned.  We lost the head of the HEA because of the authority's lack of powers and its inability to do the work that we want it to do.  This has an impact on our work.  Apart from the Waterford issue, for which we may be able to get an inspectorate appointed, we must have a say in the wider issue because it will have an ongoing impact on our work.  We have shone a spotlight on the institutes of technology and universities and have shown up on awful lot of issues.  How many have we had appear before us?  Indeed, more are due to appear.  An awful lot of them are dependent on the reports to which Deputy Catherine Murphy referred.  It is a key issue for us and whether it is in a periodic report or whether we do a separate, stand alone letter to the Minister, we must stress that this needs urgent attention.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-24a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019012400002#C01300"><p>We will come back and review that after today's meeting.  The points are all well made and noted.  We will take the matter up with Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, the Secretary General later this morning.</p> <p>  The next correspondence, Nos. 1881 and 1882, are the opening statements from the Department of Education and Skills, which we will note and publish.  We will discuss them later this morning.</p> <p>  The next correspondence is category B, from Accounting Officers and Ministers following up on previous meetings.  The first letter relates to NAMA, Project Nantes and the legal advice.  We will try to schedule that in the next week or two.  We had a private meeting on Tuesday but we need another half an hour on that issue alone, as well as some time for a few other issues.  We will have to schedule another private meeting for an hour in the near future.  We will not set a date today and will hold over that item.</p><p>We have published that already.  We have arranged for that to be published, but we will get the legal advice shortly.</p><p> The next correspondence is No. 1795B from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment dated 11 December 2018.  It provides a briefing note on the national broadband plan and metropolitan area networks.  We decided that we would hold this over.  We published it but we are holding it over for discussion.  We will be dealing with some of the other people in that industry in two weeks' time and, well in advance of that, everyone will have had an opportunity to review and discuss the matter.</p><p> The next correspondence is No. 1816B from the National Treasury Management Agency providing information requested relating to the percentage of ownership by the State of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  We agreed to note and publish this but we decided to write to the NTMA because we did not believe those responsible answered the questions that the committee wanted answers to.  We have written to them and we are waiting to get a reply to the more specific question next time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-24a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019012400002#D00200"><p>Is there something to go back to when the agency comes back to us?  I reckon there is something more to look at before it comes back to us.  It appears that there is a parallel arrangement.  The agency has no idea or appears not to have been aware that the remainder of Enet was being purchased or that contracts were being extended when it was considering purchase of it.  There is potentially public money at stake.  For two arms of the State not to know that there is something happening shows that we are in a kind of silo.  The problem is that the public purse comes a cropper in such an environment if those responsible do not know that something is going on.  I am not suggesting they should know the detail, but they should certainly know that something is happening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-24a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019012400002#D00300"><p>We are coming back to that for definite as soon as we get the response on the broader issues.</p> <p>  Next correspondence is No. 1837B from Mr. John O'Sullivan, Commissioner of Valuation, Valuation Office, dated 11 January 2019 providing information requested by the committee on the basis for the valuation of Harold's Cross stadium and comparisons used.  We will note and publish this.  People can read it if they wish.  He gives two tables.  One relates to the comparable transactions in the market around the time of the Harold's Cross issue in 2017.  They range from a property on Harold's Cross Road to others in Sandymount, Rathgar and Montrose.  I know they are not all in the same location as the Harold's Cross stadium, but the office is using distance from the city centre.  The price per acre in many of those areas was more expensive than the Harold's Cross stadium, although some of them were perhaps in a more valuable location.  Then, table number 2 gives subsequent transactions for approximately the same distance from the city centre.  Reference is made to transactions in Donnybrook, Grand Canal Harbour and Dunville Avenue, which would be close to that area, as well as Swords and the cinema in Harold's Cross.  People can make their own views known.  Some of those properties are well in excess of the price per hectare put on Harold's Cross.  I realise every property is different and I am not suggesting they are all comparable.  I am simply outlining the information provided by the Valuation Office.  People can digest it and comment if they wish.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-24a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019012400002#D00400"><p>There is a critical paragraph on page 2.  It is the third paragraph and it relates to the valuation.  Halfway through the paragraph the commissioner states that the Valuation Office will have no regard to the motives or strategic interest of either party to the transaction.  He goes on to state that the duty of the office under the circular is to provide a form of independent professional evaluation based solely on market evidence and that no other factors can or would be taken into account.</p> <p>  There were different valuations depending on the zoning.  This is a well-located site &ndash; I completely accept that.  It is difficult.  We can look at the tables and the valuation put on the properties.  I accept the point you are making, Chairman, that they are different.  Yet, we still come back to the same point.  It is something of a stretch to say the figure happened to be exactly the same amount as the amount that would have got the racing board out of trouble.  If this was to be replicated for the purchase of sites for educational campuses, then we would have very expensive educational campuses indeed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-24a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019012400002#D00500"><p>There is one concerning thing about the valuation as far as I am concerned.  The price assumes that Dublin City Council, or the relevant local authority, would amend the zoning needed by material contravention of rezoning.  Perhaps another public body was going to assist in the matter.  Maybe that is not an unreasonable assumption.  Anyone who has been a member of a local authority would assist any school development if it required a material contravention.  However, we could not make any of those assumptions in respect of all the other sites those responsible are comparing Harold's Cross to in the private sector.  Such an assumption certainly would have had an influence in terms of future use and future zoning that planners assumed would come through.  That is perhaps something of a leap but perhaps they were being pragmatic about it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-24a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019012400002#D00600"><p>One point is that the higher valuation would be residential.  An educational zoning would result in a lower valuation.  Yet the city council assumed a higher valuation.  Had it been earmarked to the city council that this was for an educational campus, the council would have zoned it for educational use.  In that scenario, it would not have premium residential zoning but educational zoning, which would be lower.  Whether that would have been fair to the owners of the site is another matter altogether.  In any event, there is a happy coincidence that the valuation happens to be the higher amount and it got another entity off the hook in the context of the balance sheet.</p></speech>

It looks like a remarkable coincidence that &euro;23 million was precisely what the Irish Greyhound Board required.  That was what the parent Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, wanted for that site.  It is a remarkable coincidence.  We have no evidence yet, but I want the committee to write to seek a copy of all communications, emails and correspondence between the Valuation Office and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in respect of what price would be acceptable and whether the Department had an indicative price that it was looking for.  That will be instructive.  The Department of Education and Skills wrote the cheque but the person selling the site &ndash; the person who wanted &euro;23 million &ndash; was the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We need the full communications trail between the Valuation Office and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to see what toing and froing happened in respect of that price.  That request is to go to both organisations.</p></speech>

We can seek more documentation - we could fill this room with it.  At the end of the day, I do not believe this committee is in a position to make a determination on whether there was anything wrong.  If that is the case, then we need to look at who is.  Does this need to be examined?  I am unsure whether this comes up in any of the routine audits that the Comptroller and Auditor General undertakes.</p></speech>

It was a 2018 purchase.  I plan to look at this in the context of the audit.</p> <p>  Deputy Cullinane's points are well made and there is a question of how we take it forward from here, seeing as professional opinions have been presented.  If we were to try to look into it, we would have to hire professionals to look at it.  I do not want to pre-judge it.  I want to look at it and then determine whether something further will be required.</p></speech>

We have only heard a selection of the papers today.  It is not possible to go on like this.  We have made this point repeatedly from day one.  We need help from a research officer, or whatever title the official is given.  It is not possible to continue to hold systems to account on the budget we have.</p><p>In a sense, we are providing the illusion that we are doing so.  We are doing our best.  I pay tribute to the Chairman in that regard because he is doing tremendous work going through the correspondence and teasing it out.  In itself, that process equates to a full meeting.  We are then left with correspondence.  We need a meeting - I do not mind if it is private or public - on how we can move forward in respect of this matter in view of the fact that we do not have enough staff to examine it.  That to which I refer will become very obvious later today when we are dealing with the University of Limerick and Waterford Institute of Technology.  It is simply not possible despite our best efforts.</p></speech>

We will move on.  The Committee of Public Accounts established by the 32nd D&aacute;il has reached item No. 1850 in correspondence and this is just letters received.  The volume of letters sent out to follow up on various issues is a multiple of this.  This far exceeds correspondence received by all other Oireachtas committees combined since the 32nd D&aacute;il was established.  We need research staff.  The staff provide fantastic administrative support but we need more.  We have three sets of financial statements, two special reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General and several reports from independent commission on various colleges.

This was not just an issue in terms of moneys paid by the Department.  There were the protracted discussions when the Irish Greyhound Board came before the committee and we were trying to extract answers on the massive amounts of money of which it is in receipt from the Exchequer.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy stated, a very coincidental amount was paid from one arm of the State to another that assisted the Irish Greyhound Board with its financial difficulties.  The Comptroller and Auditor General referred to this as a significant purchase.  I am not asking him to prejudge matters, but what is his professional opinion regarding value in this instance.  Wearing his other hat, Deputy MacSharry would indicate that the value is whatever the buyer pays for a particular site.</p></speech>

On the process involved, the Chairman used the term "remarkable coincidence".  I wrote it down.  In the context of what he will assess, does the  comptroller and Auditor General consider it a remarkable coincidence in light of the protracted discussions the committee had with the Irish Greyhound Board regarding the very perilous position in which it found itself?  As the Chairman stated, it was a remarkable coincidence that the board received a cheque from another arm of the State that just so happened to match the amount of money it needed to get out the gap and keep the dogs running.</p></speech>

There was a heading, &quot;Valuations Comparison&quot;, but I cannot see it now.  We came across this with the Office of Public Works, OPW, when people had made information available to Deputy Kelly and I in advance of the meeting and we were able to ask certain questions.  With regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General examining issues, it seems that moves are determined at a high level on whether a site works and a decision is made to buy it.  For example, a decision was made that Miesian Plaza worked for the Department of Health.  This is at a policy level where there is no expertise other than identifying a need, such as the Department of Education and Skills requiring a site for two schools in Harold's Cross, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine needing &euro;20 million because of a problem with Bord na gCon and the OPW needing a new building for the Department of Health at Miesian Plaza.  Then it goes to the various experts.  While it might not be stated, they retrofit the case to fit the outcome determined at the top.  I doubt that we will prove any malpractice.  However, I know from being contacted some weeks ago by a journalist from<i>The Irish Times</i>who had made a freedom of information request seeking much of the same material the Chairman is going to seek that approximately 20 comparisons were provided and that there the sites were identified in only four instances.  One of them related to the land at RT&Eacute; in Dublin 4.  That is like stating that land in Sligo was sold at the same time.  Dublin 4 and Harold's Cross do not even involve the same sports and nor are they in the same league or ballpark.  The reality is that, in Ireland and Britain, Savills is the go to evaluator.  Before the deal was finalised, I asked who valued the property and I was told it was Savills.  I asked for the valuation and was told I could not get it because the information was sensitive.  The only thing that made the information sensitive was that it had the potential to block a deal going ahead for, arguably, &euro;10 million more than should have been the case.  I wish the Chairman best of luck.</p></speech>

It corrects the wording of a previous letter and whether it referred to a person who was previously employed, an employed person or existing employees.  It is only a technical question.  We will note and publish it.</p> <p>  No. 1846B is from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills providing information requested by the committee on the allocation of places on school buses.  I suggest we note and publish it.  There is a lot of useful information in it.  It gives a rationale for why some buses do double trips.  The next item is a note on cases taken against Bus &Eacute;ireann by children and their families and the legal costs associated.  There is a separate item of correspondence.  The numbers are quite small.  The next item is the maximum travelling time, waiting time and distance for children.  Obviously those who have special educational needs may need to be transported to schools quite a distance from their houses and the time can be longer.  There is a special note on the transport grant, including details of the maximum minimum payment and the averages.  It is very useful for people who have to avail of it.  The next item is about the transfers between Bus &Eacute;ireann reserves and the school transport account back to the Department.  Money has been refunded to the Department.  There is information on regional cost differences.  On those last three items on the last page, it says they are collating information with Bus &Eacute;ireann and it will be forwarded to the committee shortly.  There is quite a bit of information there.  There is an acknowledgment that quite a bit of information still has to come.  We will note and publish it.  We will wait for further information.</p> <p>  No. 1847B is from the HSE providing a note requested regarding the business cases put forward by section 38 organisations for non-adherence to public health sector pay policy.  I am sure the nurses will be interested in this one.  It summarised that under the section 38 agreements - this issue was ongoing in the previous Committee of Public Accounts - 671 cases were closed in which recommendation was given or no action was to be taken.  There are 153 cases still unresolved.  Work is in progress between the HSE and the agency in 104 cases.  Work is in progress with the Department in 14 cases.  Various items are pending.  There are 35 more cases to be dealt with.  Table 2 gives the full list of all the section 38 organisations with regard to the major cases and salary scales that are in existence and have not been formally approved.</p><p>We will watch that and come back to it.  People use that information.  More than 600 cases have been dealt with and 153 still to be concluded.</p><p> Correspondence No. 1850 from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE relates to our periodic report No. 4.  We thank him for correcting a slight mistake we had on the nursing home support scheme.  Approximately &euro;1 billion is spent on that and we stated that two thirds of that went on public nursing homes.  He pointed out that should be one third.  The figures were in the report but we had the wrong percentage between private nursing homes and public nursing homes.  We acknowledge that correction and thank him for that.</p><p> Correspondence No. 1851 is from Mr. Mark Griffin, Secretary General, Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, providing detailed follow-up information requested by the committee on a number of matters.  We note and publish this.  Some of this will come up in our broadband discussion to take place in the next few weeks.  It also covered the metropolitan area contract extension, an overview of the &euro;9 million paid to KPMG, and an overview of projects before May 2018 and after with regard to the energy efficiency national fund.</p><p> The next item was an update on the clean-up in Aughinish.</p><p> The next item was an update on the sites in Avoca and Silver Mines; many people will be interested in this.</p><p> The next item related to correspondence on the European Commission ruling on the 300,000 homes and businesses and the issue of state-aid rules in respect of the national broadband plan mapping process.  We will discuss that in our next meeting on the national broadband plan issue.</p><p> There was a note on the number of cars and models of cars with eCall service.  That relates to the emergency call-out service.  There is interesting information there.</p><p> There is a note on the rolling-out of brown bins.  People can look at that.</p><p> People will find the next item interesting.  It is a note on the capacity and life expectancy of the four landfill sites still operating in the State, to include the breakdown between recycling, landfill and incineration and the figures for the most recent year, 2016.  The important thing to note is that four landfills operate in Ireland today: Knockharley landfill, Kentstown, Navan, County Meath, whose planning permission expires in August 2021; Ballynagran landfill, Coolbeg, County Wicklow whose planning permission expires in May 2021; Drehid landfill, Killinagh Upper, Carbury, County Kildare, whose planning permission is valid for the next nine years; and East Galway landfill, Kilconnell, Ballinasloe, County Galway, whose planning permission expired last year.  At this point only a few years remain in the landfills that are available.</p><p> It states that recycling and recovery is at 74% which is high internationally and only 26% goes to landfill.  Where the operators' permissions have almost expired they will need to apply for further planning permission.  Unless those are dealt with, somebody has a problem somewhere or else it all goes to Ringsend or whatever.  Maybe that was the strategy all along; I do not know.</p></speech>

It looked like there would be nowhere to dispose of waste.  I believe the permissions for both the Meath and Wicklow sites were extended on a temporary basis.  The proposed Cork incinerator - I am not sure where that is in the process - was being relied on.  I am not sure if it is appropriate to this committee or if it should be dealt with by the Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  A lot of these are temporary and a whole cost is not taken into consideration in that there is no landfill disposal in Munster at all.  If one stands on the bridge in Sallins, one will see Cork, Kerry and Tipperary trucks every day.</p></speech>

Back in 2000 in Galway a campaign started for zero waste.  It was extremely successful.  A model was rolled out and we had 70% diversion from landfill, across everything including composting.  That was possible.  It ran for six weeks as a pilot project.  It was rolled out as a local authority service and had 56% diversion on a weekly basis from landfill.  We showed what was possible.</p> <p>  The Government at the time had a plan for incinerators.  We are now seeing increasingly bigger dumps in fewer areas.  Galway showed we wanted to have a county plan and a city plan all in one.  We were willing to deal with our waste in a very sustainable manner.  The Government deprived the local authority of the ability to do that by bringing in legislation removing waste management from the local authorities.  It is not popular to say this.  They are the facts as happened.  The power was removed and centralised.</p> <p>  We now constantly blame individuals as polluters.  I do not believe they are polluters.  I will not go into it here because it is not relevant, but it is important for the record to say that the people of Galway showed what is possible.  They indicated that all the things from the engineers' reports and so on that had very low recycling rates were all wrong.  We showed what was possible and did it.  The Government took it from us, privatised it and took the power from the local authority.  There was a combination of forces at work and we will suffer with the taxpayers paying even more money in addition to calling citizens polluters which is unacceptable.</p></speech>

The incineration policy is possibly dictating that.  However, the cost of transporting the waste has not been included, in terms of the damage done to roads and the unsustainability of that.  There is a cost element to this policy, but it is not a matter for this committee.</p></speech>

However, I want to clarify an issue that I might have glossed over.  I say to those interested in the recycling issue the news is not half as good as I read out a moment ago.  The table covers the 2.7 million tonnes of waste in the country in the year.  Recycling was 34% and recycling involved in compost and digestion was 7%.  In fact the recycling was only 41%.  It goes on to state that incineration, which they call energy recovery, is at 33%.  In other words then the other 26% in landfill.  Really we are only at 41% for recycling, 33% for incineration and 26% for landfill.  That is a bit different because it had included the incineration figure under recovery.  I just wanted to spell out the difference between the original figures and the breakdown there now.</p></speech>

I propose that if by 10.15 a.m. we have not finished correspondence, we hold over correspondence because we have a lot to do with representatives from the two institutes coming in.  The time could slip by.</p></speech>

I will finish on this item.  Members will indulge me on the issue of the RT&Eacute;2 +1 channel.  We have brilliant news.  The letter states:</p><blockquote>In June 2018, RT&Eacute; made a formal request to the Department for the extension of RTE One+ 1 service and the introduction of a new service, RTE2 +1.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) was asked to conduct a Sectoral Impact Assessment on the proposal and the Department also conducted a stakeholder consultation.<br /><br />Following consideration of the BAI Report and the outcome of the stakeholder consultation, the Minister approved the proposed extension of RTE One +1 service and the introduction of RTE2 +1 service in December 2018.</blockquote><p>That is obviously just a number of weeks ago so now I will be asking RT&Eacute; when we can see it on air.</p><p> The next item is No. 11 on mobile coverage.  Members will be very interested in that note and the information about black spots around the country and repeaters for improving the signal which is referred to.  The Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, says it does not gather information about how many are in existence.  We will note and publish that correspondence.</p></speech>

We will keep it on the agenda for discussion but we will publish it in the meantime because people will be interested in that document.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1852B from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, providing information requested by the committee regarding the total of all payments for compensation and the percentage of payments made by the State Claims Agency in respect of wards of court.  It transpires that the majority of payments made are to people who have been made wards of court and last year 53% of the payments amounting to &euro;121 million went to wards of court.  This is a big issue.  Over the five years under review, &euro;500 million has gone in there, being managed by the Courts Service.  We have to ask questions and the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, might manage that but that is a policy issue and we will come back to it.</p> <p>  No. 1857B from Dr. Des Fitzgerald, President of the University of Limerick, UL, providing information for today's meeting.  We will note and publish it.</p> <p>  No. 1861B is from Mr. Stephen Kent, Bus &Eacute;ireann, providing information on school transport, which I read earlier.</p> <p>  No. 1836C is from Mr. John Keaney, SIRO Ireland, who has declined his invitation to attend the committee.  SIRO Ireland was one of the bidders for the national broadband plan.  We note and publish that.</p> <p>  No. 1838C was from Mr. Thomas Reed, breeding director of Warmblood Studbook of Ireland.  We have corresponded back and forward with him and the Department and sent a reply to him about state aid.  I propose we ask for a note on the oversight arrangements between the Department and Horse Sport Ireland and to request a copy of the service level agreement for that organisation.</p> <p>  No. 1840C is from an individual, providing briefing for the members to the committee on matters in UL.  We will note this but we are not publishing that item.</p> <p>  No.  1841C is from an individual, dated 15 January, providing briefing for members of the committee on matters in UL.  We will note that so that members are aware of it for today's meeting but we are not publishing it.</p> <p>  No. 1842C is from Adam Ledwith, public policy manager with Eir, dated 14 January, accepting the invitation to attend the meeting of the committee on the national broadband plan.</p> <p>  No. 1843C is from Peter McCarthy, CEO of enet, accepting the invitation to attend the meeting of the committee on the national broadband plan.</p></speech>

We have had detailed correspondence on this before and I propose that we forward it to the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Cannon, for his attention.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Our consideration of this is now closed because it gets more voluminous.  This particular individual was on a panel for over 30 years and he is not on it anymore.  That panel is not within our remit as it is not a financial matter.  It is really a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We got a response before-----</p></speech>

We have asked for information and they have updated the panel.  Then it should expire and this particular one was a very specific personal matter so we will not go into that but we will refer it to Deputy Cannon.  We will tell the individual that we have done so because the Committee of Public Accounts does not have a role in his particular case.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is No. 1862C, from an individual providing briefing to the committee on UL.  We can note that and discuss it today if members wish, but we cannot discuss any personal details.</p> <p>  No. 1863C is from another individual providing briefing to the committee on UL.  We will note that.</p> <p>  No. 1880C is from Mr. Jonathan O'Brien, regarding the national paediatric hospital board.  That is a request for Mr. Robert Watt to appear before the committee but we have our meeting set up specifically and we will come back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Government procurement and the National Development Finance Agency but not on that particular day.  We can decide who to invite if we want a further meeting on it.</p></speech>

We need to get them out of the way.  We agreed last week to write to the Office of Government Procurement, which may have a more direct role in it than the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It will set policy but it is up to the Secretary General.  He is responsible and he is the man who signs the cheque in health; we have also written to the National Development Finance Agency should it have advised on the financing and structure of such a proposal and we are awaiting information.  We have quite a range of people coming in for the first meeting already so we should speak to one Secretary General at a time.  I am not saying we will not invite Mr. Robert Watt but I am concerned that we already have quite a bit on our agenda with the group that I have mentioned.</p></speech>

Special Report No. 103 looks at a number of matters relating to the remuneration of certain senior staff members in University of Limerick, UL, and the Institute of Technology Sligo, where non-compliant remuneration arrangements were entered into.  Some public sector pension schemes provide for the discretionary awarding of professional added years for pension purposes.  These provisions are intended to compensate for the inability of certain professional or technical staff who, because qualifications or experience conditions applied at their recruitment, would be unable to qualify for a full pension before the mandatory retirement age.  Since 2009, awards of professional added years in the five older universities have been approved on a case-by-case basis by the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Until the end of April 2018, the newer universities, that is, Dublin City University and the University of Limerick, operated separate, independent frameworks for the award of professional added years.</p> <p>  We analysed the awards of professional added years in the two universities between 2012 and 2016 and found that the University of Limerick had awarded added years to more employees and with a higher average added value than was the case in Dublin City University.  Awards in Dublin City University were made only to academic staff while in the University of Limerick, 18% of awards were to non-academic staff.</p> <p>  Following circulation of a draft of the special report, the Higher Education Authority directed both universities that all applications for professional added years awards from the end of April 2018 would be subject to approval by the pensions unit of the Department of Education and Skills.</p> <p>  In general, subsidiary companies are used by third level education institutions as a means of managing non-core functions in a manner that separates their business affairs from those of the institution.  This allows the non-core functions to be run on commercial lines, and for subsidiary employees to be remunerated on competitive market terms.  Subsidiary companies usually provide pension benefits for employees on a defined-contribution basis, and such employees are not counted as public sector workers.</p> <p>  In late 2012, the University of Limerick arranged for two senior executives employed by a subsidiary company of the university to be admitted to a university defined benefit pension scheme that was about to close for new entrants.  This resulted in the two executives being granted significant additional pension benefits, including professional added years.  Those additional benefits have been valued actuarially at over &euro;1.2 million.  Claims were advanced that the two executives had been promised pension benefits equivalent to those of employees recruited to the university at the same time, but these claims were not supported by appropriate contract documentation.</p> <p>  In November and December 2011, the University of Limerick agreed with two senior managers that their employment would cease on 29 February 2012 on a severance basis, and severance payments were made on that date.  However, prior to their severance, arrangements were put in place with each of the senior managers to continue to make their services available to the university on a consultancy basis.  Separate contracts for service were put in place between the university and limited liability companies owned by each senior manager.  Evidence of work done in return for one of the consultancy contracts is limited.  In that case in particular, it is difficult to see that the value obtained from the contract is commensurate with the payments made.</p> <p>  The combined severance and consultancy arrangements resulted in additional estimated costs of &euro;310,000 in net present value terms, as compared to what the two managers would have received had they continued in employment to the standard minimum retirement age.</p> <p>  The process followed in implementing these two severance deals in the University of Limerick was reported on by me in a previous special report.  In the course of the earlier examination, the university misrepresented the circumstances around the severance deals.  In particular, it was represented that the severance payments were made because of unspecified performance issues, and the existence of the consultancy arrangements was not disclosed.  This misrepresentation of the facts undermines the audit relationship, and is a serious governance failure.</p> <p>  A severance arrangement entered into by Institute of Technology Sligo with a senior manager in 2016 cost the institute over &euro;202,000, when the sanction received from the Department of Education and Skills allowed for payments totalling just over &euro;37,500.  The actual expenditure included a sum of almost &euro;108,000 incorrectly classified as payment related to sabbatical leave.  The facts of the case did not conform to the circumstances in which sabbatical leave may be granted under the institute&rsquo;s policy, and the related payment was not submitted, as required, to the institute&rsquo;s governing body for approval.</p> <p>  It was noted that the institute&rsquo;s policy on sabbaticals is based on a two-year pilot scheme for the award of sabbatical leave to academic staff issued by the Department of Education and Skills in 2004-2005.</p></speech>

I will identify briefly some of the measures that we, together with the Higher Education Authority, HEA, have taken.</p> <p>  We have been working together with the Higher Education Authority on developing and strengthening the governance framework for higher education over the past few years.  Measures that have been taken include: the introduction of a new governance framework for the higher education system in 2015; reduced timelines for the submission of draft accounts for certification by the Comptroller and Auditor General and for the submission of annual governance statements to the HEA; the HEA to meet quarterly with the Comptroller and Auditor General to discuss the status of audits of financial statements and any issues arising; in 2016 the HEA commenced the introduction of a programme of rolling reviews on governance matters; and, in addition, the HEA ensures that codes of practice are in place in respect of the institutes of technology and the universities, and an updated code was put in place in January of last year in the institutes of technology and it is anticipated that there will be an updated one for the universities soon.</p> <p>  On the report and the professional added years awards for pension purposes, with effect from 30 April 2018 all applications for the award of professional added years must be submitted to the Department for approval.  The Department is also undertaking a review of awards of added years made by UL to employees in the recent past.</p> <p>  On the admission of certain subsidiary company staff into the university pension scheme, the Department with the HEA is conducting a review of the circumstances surrounding the admission of the two individuals into the UL superannuation scheme.  This review is examining the circumstances of their entry and any costs associated with the pension benefits and will identify any actions necessary to rectify the pension position if it is determined that they were incorrectly admitted to the scheme.</p> <p>  I refer to the severance payments to senior managers at UL and the Institute of Technology Sligo.  On UL, the Department acknowledges the concerns of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of the instances of misrepresentation by the university with regard to the circumstances of the severance deals.  From my perspective, as Accounting Officer, this is not acceptable practice for any higher education institution.  In order to ensure that such misrepresentation is not a feature of the university&rsquo;s future relationship with the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department has communicated its serious concerns to the university and highlighted the importance of full disclosure and transparency in responding to all such requests.  The university has confirmed to the Department that it has taken specific measures to ensure that all future interactions with the Comptroller and Auditor General are open and transparent.</p><p>On IT Sligo, in November 2018 the Department issued a circular to the sector providing guidance on the processing of severance payments in the public sector as well as a new guidance note to the sector in regard to reporting for and sanction of redundancy payments.  The Department also agreed to issue guidance to the institutes of technology regarding sabbatical arrangements for academic staff.  The guidance will be informed by the findings of the HEA&rsquo;s third rolling review which is looking specifically at staff remuneration and benefits in higher education institutions, encompassing issues such as compliance with public sector policy on salary and remuneration, pensions, expenses and other related benefits such as sabbatical leave.  The review will be completed and published in 2019.</p><p> The Department is committed to ensuring that the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report are fully implemented and will liaise with the HEA and the institutions as appropriate to facilitate this.  We are currently examining the matter of recoupment of funding from higher education institutions where governance breaches have been identified and considering the most appropriate options available to us in that respect.</p></speech>

He is aware that the committee has discussed financial statements in the third level sector at length.  He has been involved in those discussions on several occasions.  We issued a report on 11 July 2017 regarding the unacceptable delay in receiving accounts from the various institutions.  Yesterday, I looked up the most recent set of financial statements published in respect of the three organisations being dealt with today.  The most recent set of published audited accounts for the University of Limerick are for the period 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2016, two and a half years ago.  I have not seen any published financial statements for the university since then.  In his opening remarks, the Secretary General referred to accountability and control.  Those remarks ring hollow given that we do not have audited accounts for the past two and a half years.  The most recent published financial statements for IT Sligo and Waterford Institute of Technology cover the period 1 September 2015 to 31 August 2016.  That is two and a half years ago and we have not received any published financial statements for them since then.  We will proceed with the meeting but I cannot emphasise strongly enough to Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; that the Committee of Public Accounts finds it utterly unacceptable for the Department to come before us and talk about control, monitoring and review while the financial statements covering the past two and a half years have not been laid before the Oireachtas.  Does Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; have the audited financial statements for the University of Limerick or IT Sligo signed off by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the relevant Accounting Officer or president of the institution?</p></speech>

We have three months to work through them.  We must interrogate the accounts in partnership with the HEA and seek clarification on certain matters.  We do not publish them immediately.  Rather, we interrogate the accounts and then move to publication.</p></speech>

As Accounting Officer, he must accept that is utterly unacceptable.  This is all public money.  We issued a special report in July 2017 specifically dealing with this issue and I am sure the Secretary General accepted the correctness of those recommendations.  Waterford Institute of Technology has previously appeared before the committee on this issue.  Here we go again.  The last time it appeared, we threatened to send its representatives home because their accounts were two or three years out of date.  We are back here two years later in exactly the same scenario.</p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; stated it will take three months for the Department to publish the accounts.  If I or a departmental official with a finance brief got those accounts, they could be gone through in a morning.  I presume Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; has tasked such officials to go through the accounts.  Legally, the Department has three months to go through the accounts but it could do so in three hours if it so chose.  The Department has the financial statements from each of the institutions for a certain period but it is not willing to publish them.  Does the Department have a query regarding the audit of the Comptroller and Auditor General?  I ask Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; to explain this to the public.  I do not understand the reason for the delay.</p></speech>

There are matters on which we must engage with the HEA or the institutions.  It is not a quick examination of the accounts.  The Department and the HEA are carrying out our roles in this regard.  I agree with the Chair's point that we need to get the accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General as quickly as possible for audit and then publish them following oversight by the Department and the HEA.  However, we must take our role in that process very seriously.  It is not a box ticking exercise or a very quick examination.  There are regularly matters on which we must seek clarification from the institutions involved.</p></speech>

Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; is stating that the Department will now review the accounts for the period from 1 October 2016 to 30 September 2017, a year and a half ago, and possibly begin raising queries regarding what happened in 2016.  It is a little late to be doing that now.  The Department should have been doing so all along.  A year and a half after year end, nothing should be arriving on Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;'s desk from any of these institutions about which he does not already know.  What has been happening for the past year and a half such that the Department is now beginning to raise queries?  The committee does not accept that there is adequate supervision by the Department if it is only now beginning to ask questions a year and a half after year end.</p></speech>

The Department must go through the accounts when it receives them.  It cannot be a case of receive and publish.  We need to work through the accounts.</p></speech>

We expect representatives of each of the institutions to appear, along with Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, because somebody must ensure this does not continue.  There is no point in the public electing us to do our work on the Committee of Public Accounts, the committee making a recommendation a year and a half ago and life carrying on.  That will not happen under my watch as Chair of the committee.  We have done tremendous work in getting the education and training boards and other organisations to get their accounts up to scratch.  I thought the institutes of technology and universities would be more efficient and effective because the ETBs went through significant restructuring through the years.  We want the level of efficiency that is now in the ETB sector to be replicated in the institutes of technology and universities.  As Accounting Officer, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; is primarily responsible for ensuring that the institutes of technology and universities do their job.  His job is to ensure they do their job but that has not happened.  We will proceed with the meeting but representatives of the three institutions, along with Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, as Accounting Officer for the Department, will appear before the committee in early course to discuss the financial statements for the periods I mentioned as well as the unaudited financial update covering since the period since year end.  We will set a date for that meeting.</p> <p>  We will now move on to the opening statement of Mr. Paul O'Toole of the HEA.</p></speech>

The HEA has a significant role in the governance and oversight of public funding provided to higher education institutions, HEIs.</p><p>In common with many areas of public administration, this role has evolved and continues to evolve, to ensure that taxpayers&rsquo; funds are utilised in a cost-effective and appropriate manner to deliver on the objectives of Government policy for the higher education sector.  The HEA implements its responsibilities in this regard primarily through its governance framework for the higher education system.  The framework incorporates a series of complementary measures and reports.  This oversight function seeks to be respectful of institutional autonomy, but within an accountability framework.</p><p> An important development in the evolution of the HEA&rsquo;s governance and oversight role and responsibilities will be the planned repeal and replacement of its foundation Act, the Higher Education Act 1971.  It is expected that the new Act will provide greater clarity in respect of the extent and operation of the HEA&rsquo;s responsibilities and those of the institutions themselves and the Minister for Education and Skills.  Pending the enactment of the new legislation, the HEA will continue to refine and improve its system governance regime.  Recent and planned actions include the development and implementation of revised codes of practice for universities and institutes of technology, the continuation of themed rolling reviews of the sector's institutions, and a follow-up report on the 2017 review of intellectual property management and conflicts of interest in partnership with Knowledge Transfer Ireland, KTI.  It is important to emphasise that progress on improved governance is being achieved in conjunction with our stakeholders.</p><p> I will now refer to the handling of remuneration for certain staff in the University of Limerick and the Institute of Technology Sligo.  In his response to chapter three of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills indicated that the Department and the HEA will work together to examine the matters raised and will ensure corrective action is taken.  The HEA is working with the Department in this regard and is continuing to engage with the University of Limerick on these matters.  Further details can be provided to the committee as required.</p><p> Recommendation 5.2 was that, "The HEA should review payments described as sabbatical leave across the sector to ascertain if similar control weaknesses are happening elsewhere."  As part of its governance framework for the higher education system, the HEA has commissioned a review of pay and related practices in higher education institutions ,HEIs, including the matter of sabbatical leave.  The fieldwork in seven institutions is under way and a report is expected in the second quarter of this year.  Based on this report, the HEA will consider the extension of this review to other institutions.</p><p> With regard to other matters in respect of the University of Limerick, UL, the HEA continues to monitor progress on the implementation by the university of the recommendations of the Thorn report.  The latest report from UL in respect of the period ending 31 December 2018 indicates that the university has implemented nine of the ten recommendations, with the remaining recommendation in progress.  The university has also reported that 35 of the 42 recommendations arising from its internal review of procedures are completed, with the remaining seven in progress.  The HEA will continue to monitor the situation and, in conjunction with the annual governance statement of UL to be provided by 31 March of this year and the HEA&rsquo;s rolling review programme, we will work with UL to ensure robust governance polices and practice are in place.</p><p> I will now move on to the issue of Waterford Institute of Technology and the development and disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry.  I will initially update the committee in respect of actions arising from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report and then provide updates on the review being carried out by the HEA itself.</p><p> I will begin with progress on implementing the recommendations to the HEA in special report No. 104 of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Recommendation 2.2 was that "The HEA should require as part of the governance statements that HEIs submit a schedule of all their disposals and the consideration received."  This recommendation has been implemented and the schedule is being sought from HEIs, commencing with the period 2017 to 2018.</p><p> Recommendation 3.4 was that "The HEA should ensure that HEIs have clear and consistent policies on when a full-time staff member at a HEI may directly receive equity from a spin-out."  This recommendation has been incorporated into a new intellectual property protocol developed by KTI in consultation with the HEA.  The new protocol is being submitted to the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation for approval.</p><p> Recommendation 3.5 was that "The HEA should ensure that HEIs have policies in place to ensure that staff involved in negotiating the sale of valuable IP do not have a reporting relationship and are not subject to direction by an interested party."  This recommendation is being incorporated into both the new IP protocol mentioned earlier and the revised annual governance statements to be completed by higher education institutions, HEIs.</p><p> Recommendation 4.3 was that "The HEA should ensure that HEIs&rsquo; policies on creator reward schemes take account of potential situations where HEI staff have a financial interest in a company acquiring IP."  As with the earlier recommendations, this recommendation is being incorporated into both the new IP protocol and the revised annual governance statements to be completed by HEIs.</p><p> I will now move on to the independent review of the spin-out and sale of companies from the telecommunications software and systems group, TSSG, at Waterford Institute of Technology.  This review has been discussed previously by the Committee of Public Accounts.  Arising from this, the committee will be aware that the HEA commissioned this review and that a draft report was prepared.  Subsequently, the HEA sought general legal advice as to its powers to conduct reviews of this nature.  In turn, the Department of Education and Skills sought advice from the Attorney General on the general powers of the HEA in respect of conducting reviews on a broader basis.  The Department of Education and Skills wrote to the committee on 18 December 2018 in this regard.  On receipt of a letter from the Department of Education and Skills on 7 December 2018 in respect of the advice of the Attorney General, the HEA has in turn sought further legal advice.  Our legal advisers considered the specific nature of the Waterford Institute of Technology review in light of the advice received from the Attorney General and the previous legal advice provided.</p><p> While this matter falls to be considered further by the board of the HEA at its meeting next week, it is important to take this opportunity to provide the committee with a summary of the advice received.  In short, our legal advice is that the HEA does not have the power to conduct reviews or investigations of the specific nature of the one that was under way in respect of Waterford Institute of Technology.  This is regrettable as the clear intent of the HEA, as stated in evidence to this committee, was to bring this review to a conclusion and publish its report.  Nevertheless, the advice provided to the HEA makes it clear that this is not possible.  As I have indicated, the matter will be considered at the meeting of the board of the HEA next week, including a consideration of the next steps.  In this regard, it will be important to ensure that the HEA communicates with each of the approximately 50 people who contributed to the review and to whom we are grateful for their input.</p><p> Notwithstanding that this specific review cannot be completed, the HEA intends to continue its work with Knowledge Transfer Ireland and the higher education institutions to ensure that robust polices are in place and are being implemented.  In line with the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General, this work is well under way with specific new reporting requirements in place for HEIs reporting in their annual governance statements, a revised IP protocol at approval stage, and a review of the updated requirements for HEIs to be undertaken by the HEA in 2019.</p></speech>

We do not normally take comments at this stage, but Mr. O'Toole has highlighted a very significant, major and substantial issue that will be before the committee and we want to deal with it immediately.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-24a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019012400002#M00300"><p>First, I thank Mr. O'Toole for his opening statement.  On the WIT report, representatives of the institute will be before us this afternoon but they will be here to deal with the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General which dealt with only one small element of spin-outs, the issue of FeedHenry.  As Mr. O'Toole will know, the HEA's report was much more substantial.  The 50 whistleblowers are not looking for gratitude.  That is the first point I will make.  They will be thankful for any gratitude they are given, but that is not what they want.  They have engaged in a process.</p><p>My question is both for Mr. O'Toole and for the Department.  I know that the Secretary General is not in a position to respond so somebody else from the Department will have to.  The legal advice is that the draft report which is <i>in situ</i>cannot be published because it strayed outside the powers of the HEA.  It is still unclear what that means.  Was it the case that the conclusions which were drawn were so significant that they strayed outside those powers or was it an issue with the remit and terms of reference in the first instance?  That has not been clarified for us.  In any event, when Dr. Love was before the committee before the end of last year, he said that the facts are the same, that the facts established are not in question, and that rather it is a question of the powers.</p><p>The issue is what happens next.  It should not be a matter of politely responding to the 50 people who engaged, thanking them very much, and giving them our gratitude, but a matter of deciding what to do now.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; or somebody else from the Department can respond to this.  There is the potential for the Department to appoint a statutory inspector to examine this.  That has happened in Waterford and other areas.  Are we looking at a commission of inquiry?</p><p>What is the mechanism now to deal with these issues?  Serious questions have been raised by whistleblowers.  An additional whistleblower has come forward and will possibly be an aspect of whatever happens next.  The HEA board will examine this but I do not know whether it has any authority to contact a Minister or look at other options.  That probably falls to the Department.  I will strongly state - I seek the support of the committee on this - that we certainly will not be letting this lie and that that will be the end of it because we overstepped the mark in the context of our powers.  That might have been the case - and that is sloppy on the part of the HEA - but what happens next?  Before the end of this meeting, I want the HEA and the Department to outline what are the options.  We will certainly be following through on that.</p></speech>

The HEA is outside its remit and off the pitch to an extent.  There is a big issue that merited all of this.  There is an issue of remit.  It is certainly within the power of the Department to do something.  Would Mr. O'Toole like to comment?</p></speech>

Perhaps I could have phrased it differently but we are very conscious of the duty of care to the people who came forward as part of that review.  It is important to stated that, within that group, there are people who made disclosures and individuals who contributed and had different views and believed that their actions were appropriate.  There is a conflict and contradiction in that.</p> <p>  The fact that we do not have those specific powers that would allow us to close this specific report does not mean the issues have gone away.  That is something I want to discuss with the board in the context of the appropriate next steps.  The latter will involve a consideration of what powers we do possess.  We have powers to form a view and to put that forward to the Minister for the governing authority.  I am also aware that the Department has written to the governing body in some detail and that is going to be part of the mix.  If I am in any way conveying that we simply see this as a chapter shut, that is the not the intention.</p> <p>  To answer Deputy Catherine Murphy's question about what prompted the legal advice, I understand this was given in evidence before the committee at some stage last year.  As part of a drafting process, the draft was shared with people who would be, if you like, part of the findings which may have occurred.  They submitted their views in respect of the draft report.  My predecessor at that point took a view about the powers of the HEA which he shared with the committee.  The Department sought clarification on that and got further advice from the Attorney General.  I understand the Department has shared a summary of that advice with the committee.  That advice stated that the HEA would need to take its own legal advice on the specifics of the matter and I was prompted to do that when I came into the role, and here we are today.</p></speech>

The CEO of the HEA has already referenced the letter we issued to Waterford IT with the detailed set of questions that we have asked for responses to, but we are in a process with the HEA.  There is a ministerial power, under section 20 of the Regional Technical Colleges Act, which allows the Minister to commission an investigation and appoint a reviewer to look at the performance of functions of any colleges or governing bodies.  In light of what has transpired with the HEA review, it is important for us to be legally advised on the scope of that power.  We are conscious that it is there and of the considerations that the CEO of the HEA has referenced, and the concerns raised or referenced in a wider context than the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We are conscious that the Comptroller and Auditor General has highlighted a set of issues in respect of which we need to bring closure and clarity.  I cannot prejudge ministerial decision-making and, in light of the history of this issue, I am sure the Deputy will understand that it is important that we are seen to be approaching this without prejudice or bias.</p> <p>  The HEA board may, and probably will, decide to give advice to the Department.  We are considering our assessment of the issues raised in the report.  We are conscious of the concerns that have been raised by individuals that go wider than some of the issues in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We will be taking all those issues into account in our assessment and advice to the Minister in due course in light of the information that we get back from the questions we have posed for Waterford IT.</p></speech>

It will be included in our work programme.  We will be coming back to our guests and they will be coming back to us.  This was unusual but the committee wanted to deal with this issue at this early stage of the meeting, rather than later on, because there is a separate issue from the Comptroller and Auditor General report.</p> <p>  I invite Dr. Ftizgerald, from the University of Limerick, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-24a.142" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Desmond Fitzgerald" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019012400002#N01100"><p>I am accompanied by Mr. Gerry O'Brien, deputy president, Mr. Liam O'Reilly, the head of IT, and Mr. Eamonn Moran, the director of strategy.</p> <p>  We have been asked to address issues relating to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and also to provide an update on the implementation of the recommendations in the Thorn report.  To give some context to that, my first action, on 2 May 2017 - my first day as president of the university - was to ask the then Minister for Education and Skills for an independent investigation of the university and that led to the Thorn reports.  The purpose of these reports, as with the investigation we did within the university and referred to as the Deloitte report, was to find out what had happened in the university over the previous years, to be completely transparent, to address the issues raised by whistleblowers, other members of staff and former members of staff and to guide reforms in the governance and management of the university.</p> <p>  At my previous appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General informed me that there would be an investigation on matters relating to pensions.  My concern with these reports is that the University of Limerick had, in the past, misrepresented facts to the Department of Education and Skills, the HEA, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Committee of Public Accounts and the wider public.  It was and is essential to regain the trust of those to whom we report and of the people we serve in Ireland, particularly in the mid-west region.  I have done everything in my power to achieve this.</p> <p>  I have detailed to the committee in writing the steps taken by the university to put more robust management and governance systems in place.  Prior to taking up the appointment as president, I had advised governing authority of the University of Limerick that a new management system was required in order to separate operational matters from academic functions and have a particular focus on corporate functions, including finance, HR, IT and registry.  As a consequence, a chief operating officer and registrar was appointed who also holds the post of deputy president.  Since then, the university has undertaken much work to address all issues raised by the reports.  Progress has been made on a number of fronts to improve governance and controls and this includes independent advice which led to the establishment of a new governing authority with fewer members and with specialist expertise and experience.  New senior management structures have been put in place, with several senior appointments made, including a director of human resources.</p> <p>  A number of reviews have underpinned the restructuring of the key functions such as HR and finance.  There has been strict adherence to accurate reporting to the HEA, the Department and other regulatory bodies.</p><p>University of Limerick was named <i>The Sunday Times</i>University of the Year 2019.  Student satisfaction rates, based on national surveys, have never been stronger.  The University of Limerick has enviable graduate employability, with just 2% of our students seeking work 12 months after graduation.  Employers repeatedly point to the quality of our graduates in their decision to establish and grow their companies in the region.  The University of Limerick is undoubtedly making a unique contribution to the economic success of the mid-west, including the palpable resurgence of Limerick city.  It has just announced the development of a Limerick city campus which will increase capacity by 2,000 students and focus on entrepreneurship and applications of technology in business and industry.<br/><br/>From the outset, my aim has been to be transparent and truthful, while ensuring the highest standards of excellence, integrity and public accountability are adhered to.  It is in this spirit that I appear before the committee. </p></speech>

IT Sligo, formerly known as Sligo Regional Technical College, will have been in existence for 50 years in 2020.  We have a strong track record of performance in the provision of education in the north west.  This includes the provision of further education apprenticeship awards and higher education awards from level 6 to level 10.  Much of this education is delivered online.</p> <p>  The institute is well managed and has never been in financial deficit.  As part of our risk management policy, we have a requirement to put 3% of our annual revenue into our reserves and have done this consistently year on year.  It has allowed us to invest &euro;35 million of our own funds in new on-campus developments in the past ten years, in addition to &euro;16 million in funding received from the Department in the same period. </p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General carried out the review under consideration and completed the report in June 2018.  The report examined whether the resources of the higher education institutes had been used and disposed of economically and efficiently and on the most favourable terms reasonably obtainable with respect to the remuneration of certain senior staff.  Chapter 5 of the report deals with a single severance payment made by IT Sligo.  It was a once-off payment related to one individual.  It is not cyclical and has not been repeated by the institute. </p> <p>  In summary, a severance package was approved by the Department of Education and Skills for an employee whose five-year fixed term contract was set to expire in August 2015.  At the end of the five-year contract, the institute offered the employee a new specific-purpose contract, pending the recruitment of a candidate as part of a proposed restructuring of management roles.  Employment contractual issues and other matters with the employee developed soon afterwards.  The institute was incurring ongoing legal fees in dealing with the individual's claim for permanency.  It was also incurring ongoing legal costs to resolve other outstanding issues.</p> <p>  With the approval of the governing body, the president at the time engaged legal advisers to mediate to resolve matters with the employee, chaired by an accredited mediator.  The negotiations, in which both sides were legally represented, resulted in a redundancy payment, supplemented by paid time off, which was agreed to be and characterised as a sabbatical, although it was not within the terms of the 2004 pilot project circular on sabbatical leave.  On legal advice, the institute signed a confidentiality agreement on the termination of employment by reason of redundancy, with effect from February 2017.  As a consequence, it became liable for a higher level of severance pay than originally approved by the Department.  The institute acknowledges that such an agreement and the use of the sabbatical leave policy should not have been entered into without sanction from the Department. </p> <p>  The report makes one conclusion and three recommendations.  The conclusion, as we have heard, is that IT Sligo entered into a settlement worth over &euro;202,000 with a former employee when it only had sanction to pay just over &euro;37,500.  The recommendations have been referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department and the HEA.  The institute accepts the conclusion and agrees with the recommendations.  It will no longer enter into sabbatical leave or confidentiality agreements that preclude the disclosure of details of the agreement reached in the financial statements, unless it obtains formal approval from the Department, or on foot of legal advice.</p> <p>  A new code of governance for institutes of technology has been adopted by the governing body.  IT Sligo is striving to ensure ongoing compliance with the code and the necessary systems will be put in place to ensure approved processes are followed.  The institute is compliant with the Civil Service and public service circular letters DPER 09/18 and Department of Education and Skills 66/18, as circulated in 2018.  It is also amending its risk management policy to incorporate the requirements mentioned and the guidance included in the good practice framework on severance payments.</p> <p>  The agreement related to a single severance payment made by IT Sligo was based on legal advice to mitigate the ongoing financial exposure, given the circumstances.  The institute acknowledges that it should have informed the Department of Education and Skills of the new severance arrangements agreed with the individual concerned and that it should not have used the sabbatical leave policy as a vehicle to enact the agreement.  The conditions that led to the individual case will not arise again.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Brendan McCormack, in particular, for dealing with the one issue brought up in the case of IT Sligo and using his opening statement to deal with it, rather than tell us how good the college is, which is not the issue before us.  I welcome what he has done, in addition to coming with his hands up.  I do not know whether I can continue to read the documentation we are receiving.  I welcome all of the briefing papers and background material.  In the period of just over two and a half years for which I have been a member of the committee I have found reading the Comptroller and Auditor General's report disturbing, particularly on the University of Limerick.  I will come back to Professor Fitzgerald on the matter of whether he has read it and to hear his thoughts on the stark findings outlined.  I have read all of the reports every single week and this one particularly drew my attention but I will leave the emotion aside.  Reading about misrepresentation and non-disclosure in Limerick, as set out in the report, is truly disturbing.  I will come back to that issue.</p> <p>  The report contains four chapters, in addition to the introduction.  Chapter 2 refers to the added years.  The University of Limerick distinguished itself by being more generous and rewarding more people with added years.  It was one of two institutions, the other being in Dublin.  I understand from the Department that this has now changed and the position is that all universities will have to report to it and receive permission.

I agree with the first part of that.  What comes across is that a way was found to facilitate the two persons at any cost.  It did not matter.  There were considerable gaps.  It started in 2007 and went forward.  There was a three and a half year gap to where it was discussed.  When one reads the chapter on what happened from 2007 to 2012, the governance issue, namely who was monitoring this, beggars belief.</p></speech>

In addition, when I try to get my head around it, I have lost count of how many reports there are including from the Comptroller and Auditor General and Deloitte.  I will come back to you, Chairman, to get a list of them over the last five to ten years; perhaps ten years.  I refer to Deloitte, Howarth, which produced two reports relating to governance, Mazars, Thorn, mediators, investigators and Kieran Mulvey, and that is only touching on them.  There are many other investigators or companies appointed to bring some type of accountability in respect of taxpayers' money to a system that should have its governance in place and should be working.  On top of that we have the whistleblowers.  This is to try to bring some level of accountability to an institution that is supposedly a third level institution that prides itself on its standards and open mind.  Forgive my frustration, but that is where I am coming from.</p> <p>  I will return to specific questions on chapter 4 and severance payments to senior managers.

We are here because this has come out as a result of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, "RTE Investigates" and all the other reports.  To that melee, we can add all the whistleblowers, who have suffered dreadfully, an issue we cannot go into today.  They have drawn our attention to various issues.  If this was the culture regarding severance payments - taking two persons from a subsidiary company and facilitating their pension - it begs the question of what the culture was regarding ordinary employees on the ground who came forward to highlight inconsistencies and questions about financial irregularities regarding receipts.  Was it not very difficult for them?</p></speech>

I have always said that I appreciated the fact that they came forward.  That was why when I asked for the Thorn investigation, any staff member or former staff member was given the opportunity to talk to the report's authors without any confidentiality being imposed by the university.  I have to agree with the Deputy that there was a culture where inaccurate information was provided.  Information was misrepresented to the different bodies but this does not happen anymore.  I have worked hard to make sure we put systems in place that will ensure that the committee can have confidence in the information we give it.</p></speech>

It was a key issue that came up in the Deloitte report about how we were carrying out our business.  I agree with the Deputy.  There were things that needed to be changed and I can assure her that since I have assumed office, I have made those changes.</p></speech>

I concur with Deputy Connolly when she rightly pointed out that Dr. McCormack's opening statement dealt conclusively with the issues.  Sligo Institute of Technology was exemplary in how it responded to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  If other institutions behaved in the same manner, they would not have to spend as much time before the committee so I commend Dr. McCormack first and foremost.</p> <p>  I return to some points made by Professor Fitzgerald in his opening statement.  He said that when he assumed his role, he commissioned an independent report to examine issues raised by whistleblowers.  I assume this was the Deloitte report.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We will not go into issues raised by whistleblower G regarding his or her own personal circumstances, although perhaps we should do so at some point in private session.  I wish to address a number of allegations made by whistleblower G relating to the student recording systems.  An allegation was made that possibly hundreds and certainly a large number of students' grades and possibly even their degrees were understated.  We must bear in mind that Dr. Thorn said that he believed that whistleblower G to be a very credible witness.  What is the university doing about the concerns raised by this whistleblower regarding student data?</p></speech>

This involved a special Deloitte report out of the two reports - there was no other report.  He made me aware that a report had been produced that was critical of the systems.  At that point, we put an additional amount into IT spending - about &euro;2 million in the first year.  We did that by stopping some other capital projects that were being planned.  We then went out to tender to bring in a group of experts on our system.  The initial tender, which was run before I got there, had failed but this tender managed to get a group called Clarion to come in and start looking at the systems.</p></speech>

I refer to undertaking to look back on allegations or concerns raised by this whistleblower regarding degrees and grades which previous students were awarded that may have been understated and that it may have been the case that people were awarded results that were not correct.  That is a very serious allegation which I put to the Comptroller and Auditor General prior to the meeting, although it is not a matter that would necessarily by captured in his examination as there is no immediate cost implication were this to be the case.  However, if this did happen, there is a potential cost as the institution could be open to litigation.  The whistleblower is saying that there was an attempt to do a trawl back but that it was stopped.  Is that the case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-24a.316" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Desmond Fitzgerald" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019012400002#S00200"><p>No, there was a trawl back.  The reason for putting the investment in was to ensure that the system was working correctly.  Within that, it was recommended that we do a trawl back, and we did so.  The trawls are done in different ways.  This one looked for anomalies in the scoring.  It went very far back, to the 1980s.  We found one student who had been given a score that would have given them a 2.2, that is, an honours degree, but that student should have been awarded a 2.1.  That error was corrected, the student informed and a new script issued.  We examined a large volume of past results - our head of IT is present and can provide members with the precise figures - but we found no other cases, with the exception of this one case.</p></speech>

I take what Professor Fitzgerald says at face value, that the trawl happened.  However the whistleblower argued that it did not happen to the extent that it ought to have happened and that, rather than the single case which Professor Fitzgerald has identified, there are potentially dozens if not hundreds more.  He may be right or he may be wrong.  There are other issues raised by whistleblowers B and C which also deal with process.  Therefore, in the context of those concerns which have been raised, does Professor Fitzgerald believe that further independent examination of these issues is necessary?</p></speech>

Let me explain why.  External examiners review our examinations at all different stages up to examination boards where the external examiners will be present.  We get external validation of what we do throughout the examination process.  It is not one step.  There are multiple steps.  We are frequently asked by employers to provide them with the transcripts of our graduates.  When we have done that and looked back on many thousands of transcripts, we have not seen any errors.</p></speech>

In that respect, I refer to Professor Fitzgerald's opening statement.  It referred to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and what it described as misrepresentation.  I will go further as I think we must drop the niceties here and deal with straight language.  It was not misrepresentation.  I would argue that individuals and the institution as a corporate body effectively lied to the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, but they certainly gave inaccurate information, deliberately and purposely, and they intentionally backdated documents.  Would that be Mr. McCarthy's understanding?  Am I correct in my reading of his report that individuals and the institution as a corporate body - I used the word "lied" but perhaps we ought to say deliberately misled - the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General?</p></speech>

However, I want to strongly make the point that I have not identified any individuals, nor have I identified their positions.  What I have identified are actions that are recorded in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report where there was a deliberate and intentional attempt to mislead or lie to the Comptroller and Auditor General, which potentially means - and, I would say, did mean - a cost was incurred by the State.  Professor Fitzgerald responded to questions about disciplinary actions by saying his understanding was there was dialogue with the individuals involved and they were moved into different positions but on the same salary scales.  I am saying that is completely unacceptable.  No decision, no reference and no inference was made by the Comptroller and Auditor General because he cannot make such an inference about individuals and whether there were issues of fraud.</p><p>He cannot make that determination.  Professor Fitzgerald should examine whether these issues should be referred elsewhere.  The Comptroller and Auditor General said that if this was in the private sector, he would have walked away, and maybe other authorities, including law enforcement authorities, would be looking at it.  That should apply to the public sector too.</p><p> Professor Fitzgerald referred to secondment earlier and the situation with two individuals.  The overall cost of bringing them into the pension fund was &euro;1.2 million but if they had worked out where they were, the additional cost would have been just under &euro;500,000.  That was Mr. McCarthy's finding, was it not?.</p></speech>

In June, the University of Limerick conferred an honorary doctorate on Vicky Phelan for her efforts.  Professor Fitzgerald described her exceptional commitment to calling out wrongdoing, her "selfless commitment to public service", and how through "her courage, commitment and exceptional communication skills, she is highlighting a major issue".  He stated "She is an inspiration to our students, our staff and our community, she has brought great honour to the university, and for this we have awarded Vicky Phelan an Honorary Doctor of Letters."  The whole country would support Professor Fitzgerald's actions with regard to Vicky Phelan.  Is there not irony and contradiction between that and his treatment of persons A, B, C, D, E, F and G?</p></speech>

What role does the governing body play?  Does its remit include oversight, both financial and of processes?  Has it been requesting reports?

I report at every meeting of the governing authority which also receives detailed reports from the audit and risk committee, as well as from the finance, human resources and asset management committee.  When issues such as the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General have arisen, the governing body has asked me to prepare reports on the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It has also asked us to report back on a regular basis on the implementation of the recommendations made in any of the reports.  The governing authority has been very active in overseeing the changes in governance within the institution.  I can assure the committee that it plays an essential role in the governance of the University of Limerick.</p></speech>

My next question is directed at the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I have been attending this committee for about two years and do not recall the Comptroller and Auditor General ever saying anything similar to what he has said today, that is, that he would have walked away.  I am paraphrasing what he said.  Can he recall similar situations in recent years?</p></speech>

I refer to the university's handling of protected disclosures.  Has it reviewed the matter?  It should fall to someone a grade above the person making the complaint.  In one instance the review was carried out by people several grades below the person making the complaint.  From experiences here, it strikes me that one cohort of more powerful and better paid individuals in a higher grade received enhanced pensions and handshakes and been moved sideways.  Another group have really been the heroes in all of this in the better functioning of the university into the future in terms of checks and balances, governance changes and all the rest.  They have paid a very heavy price in sacrificing a career or losing out on future superannuation or pension payments.  Let me ask Professor Fitzgerald about the apologies made?  I understand apologies were made to some of the whistleblowers but they were made in private.  In one instance it was accepted that the complaints were justified and not malicious, while in the other the whistleblowers were thanked for coming forward.  Does Professor Fitzgerald have a problem with making the apologies in public?</p></speech>

Having to be told to make an apology completely undermines its value.  I apologised to the whistleblowers twice; once when the suspension was lifted and then as part of the settlement we reached with them.  By the way, I would like to comment on the commentary we hear time and again about the whistleblowers and how they have been handled.  It is said I will not name them or give them letters.  I would appreciate an opportunity to outline in detail what has been done to get the people concerned to come back to work to do the jobs that they-----</p></speech>

In the last year, since the appointment of the new governing authority, a lot of work has been done to ensure we have in place within the univeristy a robust system for the making of protected disclosures.  It has gone through the finance committee and the governing authority and is being implemented.  The process does not involve people in the institution in the first phase.  We have received very good legal advice on the matter and are making sure that if people want to make protected disclosures, there is a robust system in place to enable them to do so.</p><p>I want to move on.  Obviously, there is the University of Limerick, which has elements like Plassey and Mary Immaculate College.  There appears to be a facility to move people sideways. Are staff still moved sideways between these institutions?</p></speech>

The same construction company and project managers were used and money had to be refunded because money that was to be spent on the boat house was spent on the President's House.  Has that matter been concluded satisfactorily and are there other issues involving, for example, the concert hall?  How does the concert hall fit into the University of Limerick?

We are very frustrated.  We have a new team in place, trying to sort out a whole range of things that happened in the past but very often the information required is just not available.  In the case of person A, I have gone through the file and I know what happened.  She got a short-term gratuity.  We went into mediation with her, despite the fact that she was not working there anymore, in order to try to correct that.  We did everything we could to correct it.

I do not want to go into the minutiae of different members of staff.  I am looking at it from an overall perspective.  We are here today with all these reports because of the whistleblowers and their persistence.  We are here because of the "Prime Time Investigates" programme and because of the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We are here because of a lack of governance.  Even where proper governance is in place in theory, it is not being implemented in practice.

The system was designed and implemented at a point in time with the volume of students in 1998 in mind.  The university has grown significantly in student volume and numbers.  Over that period there was, in my view and as was identified in the report, a significant under-investment in the mechanisms and resources required to sustain the system in terms of resources that use the system in the registry, that administer and run the business process side of things, the management of the data and the IT management and resources required to support it.  That broadly covers it.  I can attempt to go into more detail but they are broadly the issues.  Since that report has issued significant actions have been taken to deal with aspects of the data issues and the specific focus on the process of active students to ensure integrity.</p></speech>

They have a similar system in the US called grade point average.  It is a weighted average calculation.  Typically, undergraduates would start their degree in second year.  They progress from first to second year and their final result will be based on their marks for second, third and fourth year.  This weighted average calculation is called a quality credit average, QCA.  In the Deloitte report following the review there were some challenges over the QCA identified and this was identified as a particularly high risk.  Prior to my-----</p></speech>

In early 2015, the executive committee of the university undertook to take action to rewrite that part of the system.  In parallel to that, they implemented a checking system that would check the output.  It was to re-implement, write a detailed specification, agree the specification and implement the specification.  In parallel, they commissioned a separate piece of work to check the outputs of the newly implemented system.  That was implemented as the new part of the system in December 2015.  It and the checker that goes along with it have been used to process all the semester results for every semester since 2015.  Various measures have been taken and that is an example of one of the biggest measures to mitigate some of the risks.</p> <p>  Following that, there were multiple other risks identified with some of how the IT systems were managed and some of the business processes.  The business process issues were mainly to do with the amount of manual intervention and checking that had to happen as opposed to just trusting the system output.  Probably more staff than one might expect had to do more manual checks to check outputs.  A budget was set aside and a project was envisaged to take a number of years to address these risks.  In order to undertake that exercise, the university needed to scale up significantly on the resource side in terms of internal staff to be able to engage with the project and, additionally, it needed to be able to select an external party that would have expertise in the management of extensive projects.  This was a large change programme.  These projects are large in nature.  They are expensive, take time and are complex.</p> <p>  A tender was run.  The first tender did not yield any responses.  It was run through the all-of-government framework.  The tender was amended and tailored to get more interest in the market and was re-run.  The second time it was run, seven or eight companies tendered for it.  Four were shortlisted and went through a detailed, rigorous public sector procurement process that resulted in Clarion, which was mentioned earlier, winning the tender.  Following contract negotiation, Clarion signed a contract with the University of Limerick in February of last year.  We are engaged with Clarion on that project under a governance committee that has some of the most senior people across the university engaged in various projects that will deal with the risks identified in the report, including the detailed historical review of the records.  There are multiple strands to the project.  It is complex and large.  We are under way and are engaged in it.  It is not all planned out.  It is complex and is going to cost a lot of money.</p></speech>

The stage we are at is the de-risking stage of the system in terms of business processes, data clean-up and data into the future and improvements in the system itself to get more standard functionality so there will be less manual checking.  That is work on the current system and that is with a view to potentially getting it ready to run a tender to replace the system in the long term.  Multiple other institutions in Ireland are in the same boat.  I would not get into the realm of speculation but we are going to be spending definitely more than another &euro;2.5 million to &euro;3 million, up to possibly maybe &euro;5 million, over the next two to three years on addressing this system.  On the long-term size of these projects to replace the system, Deloitte made a very rough order of magnitude estimate that it could cost &euro;15 million to &euro;20 million to replace a system of this critical nature.  Across the sector, these types of projects are being approached by our peer institutions.  They are all at various stages of either doing significant investment into their existing systems which, to use IT terminology, are legacy systems that were implanted a long time ago, or replacing those systems.  The &euro;15 million to &euro;20 million that is mentioned in the report is not unreasonable as a figure.</p></speech>

I made a formal request that they be invited in to consider these matters and was told it would be taken on advisement.  I look forward to following how that matter will be responded to.  For me, it is not a case of advisement but a case of law or not law.  The relevant legislation is section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 2011.  In the interest of the integrity of the college, it would serve the college very well by bringing in its representatives, if for nothing else than to clear its good name.  If there are outstanding issues then we can deal with them using the full rigours of the law to cleanse any issues that there may be.</p><p> On the Revenue question, has Revenue been asked about the potential benefit-in-kind implications of the issues that have arisen? </p></speech>

It would seem to me that in the interest of completeness, while I have suggested the Garda involvement, I am sure that Revenue may have an interest if somebody was getting over and above what they should be getting, if they were having additional pay for doing a PhD. and all of this kind of thing, or were getting a contact to provide consultancy that may not have had actual work linked to it and being carried out.  Again, I am not an accountant but it just occurred to me that maybe there are benefit-in-kind implications and that, perhaps, the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners could also be contacted if for nothing else than to rule that everything is in the clear.  I have one final question but I shall let Mr. O'Brien answer first.</p></speech>

If they were bona fide consultancy contracts, if one was hiring a consultant - and we have just heard about Deloitte, Clarion or the different companies that have been mentioned that all went through procurement to provide consultancy services - who made the decision that these consultancy contracts, which worked out at &euro;189,000 for one person and &euro;180,000 for another person, required no public procurement?</p></speech>

This is the first time I have seen the Comptroller and Auditor General saying that this person deliberately misrepresented the facts.  Professor Fitzgerald is saying that person misrepresented the facts.  This has cost the State &euro;350,000, yet this person is still employed.  How can the employer have trust in that?  Professor Fitzgerald can talk all he likes about the changes in culture, but if that person is still in the organisation at a high level and being paid a high salary, it puts to nought much of what we have been told.

The Comptroller and Auditor General's report raises other questions.  The report carried out in the summer of 2017 specifically dealt with the issues raised on the RT&Eacute; "Prime Time Investigates" programme, as well as specifically looking at the reporting that was done.  On the previous occasion I appeared before the committee, in June 2017, I said I was very concerned about reporting to the agencies and the accuracy of the reporting.  We acted on the basis of what we had in the Deloitte report.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report is a different report.  The Chairman asked me what are we going to do in terms of the findings of that report.  I cannot pre-empt the investigation, because it would create huge difficulties for us if we did that.</p></speech>

If the board of governors was satisfied that an individual at senior level in the employment of the university seriously misrepresented the facts, as stated by the Comptroller and Auditor General, to the board, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department of Education and the Committee on Public Accounts, would that individual merit a written warning or would that matter be recorded on the individual's personnel file?</p><p>I am speaking in general terms, not about this case.  If a situation was to arise next week, for example, and it became clear to Professor Fitzgerald that a very senior official was deliberately misrepresenting information to him, the board and external organisations, should there not be action? I am speaking about a potential future event because I am interested in knowing the issues involved.  Should it be recorded on the person's personnel file or should there be a disciplinary process?  How would such an event be handled in the future?</p></speech>

That is our legal advice.  The Comptroller and Auditor General was very careful in saying they were not pointing at individuals.  We do not use that as the basis for disciplinary action; we would be obliged to carry out an investigation.  At that stage we would use it as the basis for a disciplinary action that might or might not be applied.</p></speech>

At the end of whatever investigation the University of Limerick might choose to carry out we hope that if it is thought it was not appropriate to make the payments from public funds, the university would move to have the funds recouped to the taxpayer.  We had it here with the Department, the Higher Education Authority and Cork Institute of Technology when funds were spent in a way that was not appropriate.  Measures are put in place in that regard.  We want to tell the people that if taxpayers' money is spent inappropriately in a State institution, moves will be made to recoup the money.  Does Professor Fitzgerald understand the principle?</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General said that if it was to happen in the private sector and facts were misrepresented, there would be a resignation.  Professor Fitzgerald has highlighted a second issue that because it has occurred in the public sector, it is, therefore, hard to deal with such issues.  Two interesting comments have been made.  Both witnesses have said in different ways that if this was to happen in the private sector, the auditor would take very definite action.  There is a hint in what has been said that if this occurred in the private sector, there would have been action taken, but both witnesses have said that because it occurred in the public service, neither of them is free to act.</p></speech>

In fact, I would nearly say the opposite is the case.  If I was a private sector auditor, I could have walked away and forgotten about it.</p></speech>

As he mentioned, the report before the committee this afternoon examines issues relating to the development and disposal by Waterford Institute of Technology of its equity interest in a company called FeedHenry Limited.</p> <p>  The Telecommunication Systems and Software Group, TSSG, is an internal research unit within Waterford Institute of Technology.  Arising from an EU-funded project on mobile telecommunications systems undertaken from 2002 to 2004, researchers in the unit developed a technology with commercial potential that became known as FeedHenry.  The institute applied for and received support from Enterprise Ireland for the development and commercialisation of the technology.  In all, Enterprise Ireland provided funding of nearly &euro;1 million to the institute for FeedHenry-related projects.</p> <p>  In June 2008, a number of staff employed in the TSSG, together with other individuals, registered a company called FeedHenry Limited.  Later in 2008, the institute awarded the company a trial licence to use the FeedHenry technology.  In December 2010, the institute transferred full ownership of the intellectual property, or IP, to FeedHenry Limited, in exchange for an equity stake in the company.  At the same time, investors, including one of the existing shareholders, put approximately &euro;500,000 into the company.  Subsequent investment rounds had the effect of diluting the institute&rsquo;s percentage shareholding, and other shareholders in the company were affected proportionately.</p> <p>  In 2014, FeedHenry Limited was sold to a multinational company for a gross consideration of &euro;63.5 million.  The institute received &euro;1.6 million from the net proceeds of the sale.  A national code of practice on research commercialisation was published in 2004.  This recommended that research-performing organisations should adopt formal policies to deal with commercialisation of IP, and the management of associated conflicts of interest.  In the event, Waterford Institute of Technology&rsquo;s governing body adopted a policy statement in February 2010.</p> <p>  Significant agreements and decisions in respect of the assignment of the FeedHenry IP were made subsequent to the adoption by the governing body of the IP policy, but in conflict with its provisions.  For example, an internal commercialisation committee established under the February 2010 policy to review and approve all agreements on commercialisation of IP held its first meeting only on 6 December 2010.  The minutes of the committee&rsquo;s first meeting do not record any discussion of the assignment of IP to FeedHenry Limited, which occurred on 15 December 2010.  Also, the institute&rsquo;s IP policy indicates that a 15% equity stake in a spin-out company would usually be appropriate in exchange for transferring IP owned by the institute.  In the case of FeedHenry Limited, the institute agreed in July 2010 that it would accept a 15% equity stake in the company on condition investors put &euro;500,000 into the company.  In December 2010, the institute accepted a stake of 10.8% when it assigned its IP to the company.  The basis for agreeing to accept the reduced equity share was not documented by the institute.  The reason for variation from the indicative 15% shareholding was not considered either by the governing body or by the commercialisation committee.</p> <p>  The examination found that neither institute nor national policies deal with situations where staff members have significant personal interests in companies acquiring IP from their employer organisation.  In the case of FeedHenry Limited, there was no service level agreement or cost-sharing arrangements with the institute in place prior to November 2010, even though the company&rsquo;s registered address had been on the institute campus since 2008.</p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s development funding agreements with the institute from around 2005 included an arrangement whereby Enterprise Ireland would be entitled for a nominal sum to a 5% equity share in any campus spin-out company.  However, Enterprise Ireland did not exercise this option.  From 2007, Enterprise Ireland dropped this kind of provision from its commercialisation funding agreements.</p><p>After the institute transferred the FeedHenry IP to the company, Enterprise Ireland invested a further &euro;800,000 in FeedHenry limited under its programme for supporting start-up companies with high growth potential.  Following the sale of FeedHenry limited in 2014, Enterprise Ireland received &euro;4.5 million for its interest in the company.</p><p> The institute received &euro;1.6 million from the net proceeds of the sale of the company.  Around &euro;639,000, or 40% of the amount received by the institute, was distributed to other beneficiaries under pre-existing arrangements.  The institute paid &euro;147,000 to a financial institution under the terms of a 2005 profit-sharing agreement, but was unable to locate a signed copy of that agreement when requested to do so by the examination team.  A further &euro;492,000, including employers&rsquo; PRSI, was applied to pay bonuses to 80 TSSG staff as part of an incentive scheme under the February 2010 IP policy.  Some of the TSSG staff who received payments under the incentive scheme had separately benefitted financially from the sale of shares they held in FeedHenry limited.</p><p> Following a previous committee meeting, the HEA and Knowledge Transfer Ireland commissioned a review of IP commercialisation policies and practices generally in the third level sector.  The report of the review, which was issued in February 2018, found some common areas of weakness in the sector, including in relation to systems for managing conflicts of interest and the decision-making process for relative equity stakes in spin-out companies.  The HEA will be able to brief the committee on subsequent developments in that regard and on the implementation of sector-related recommendations presented in the special report.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-24a.824" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Beausang" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019012400002#QQ00300"><p>With the committee's agreement, I will summarise some of the key points in the more lengthy opening statement circulated to the committee by the Department.</p> <p>  We welcome the opportunity to discuss the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on the development and disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry by the Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT.  As the committee will know, the Secretary General of the Department has assigned responsibility for this matter to me under the Public Service Management Act because he is subject to a conflict of interest.  I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Tony Gaynor, principal officer, and Ms Stephanie Goode, assistant principal officer, from the funding and governance unit of the Department.</p> <p>  Commercialisation of IP from public investment in higher education and research is a long-established Government priority.  While lead policy responsibility resides with colleagues in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, work closely with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Knowledge Transfer Ireland to support the delivery of Government policy objectives to enhance the innovative capacity of the Irish economy to create employment and generate economic growth.  It is essential that IP commercialisation by higher education institutes, HEIs, is undertaken in such a way that the interests of the Exchequer and the institution are appropriately safeguarded.  This requires the existence and effective operation of a detailed governance framework that can respond to the complex issues that may arise during the commercialisation process, such as the management of conflicts of interest that may arise in the context of the spinning-out of a company with a HEI's intellectual property.</p> <p>  A detailed and comprehensive governance framework continues to be developed for the purpose of overseeing the operation of IP commercialisation in HEIs, and it has evolved considerably since 2004, when, as the Comptroller and Auditor General referenced, the first national code of practice for managing intellectual property from publicly funded research was published.  A number of key milestones are mentioned in my written statement, including the various national IP protocols, the first of which, entitled Putting Public Research to Work, was published in 2012 and replaced, revised and updated in 2016.  A further version, currently in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, will be subject to ministerial and Government approval in due course.  These policy initiatives that focus on IP commercialisation have been complemented and reinforced in the overall broader governance framework in HEIs by the implementation of the various codes of practice for the governance of institutes of technology and the university sector, as well as the broader governance arrangements that have been introduced by the HEA to strengthen oversight and accountability within the sector.  </p> <p>  Most recently, Knowledge Transfer Ireland and the HEA commissioned an expert international review of IP policies across the higher education sector, carried out by the consultancy firm, IP Pragmatics.  The review concluded that all the HEIs examined have policies in place for IP management and employ experienced technology transfer and other dedicated professionals to carry out these important activities.  The review made a number of recommendations, however, to improve the consistency of approach across the higher education sector, including highlighting the need to define a framework setting out the minimum components of good IP management in areas such as spin-out approval and conflict of interest management.  Ten recommendations were made in the review to strengthen IP policies, management procedures and the management of conflicts of interest relating to the commercialisation of IP from HEIs in Ireland, and they are being implemented.  The chief executive officer of the HEA updated the committee on progress made in his statement.  The recommendations of the review have also informed the development of the new national IP protocol that I referenced a few moments ago and that is scheduled to be presented to Government for approval soon.  </p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report makes 11 recommendations, of which seven are the primary responsibility of WIT while four are the responsibility of the HEA.  Having examined the report, the Department is of the view that there are significant issues raised relating to institutional governance and oversight in connection with the process for the commercialisation of IP in FeedHenry by WIT, as well as issues with the existence and effective operation of relevant policies, procedures and guidelines by the institute.  The Department regards these issues seriously and, subsequent to the publication of the report, it engaged directly with the chair of the governing body of the institute.  We have written formally to the chair requesting further information on a number of issues arising from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  In total, the governing body has been asked by the Department to respond to a set of 16 questions, which were appended to the statement we circulated to the committee in advance of the meeting.  </p> <p>  The Department's letter to the chair in WIT seeks to establish from the governing body whether the IP framework in place in the institute operates effectively and is sufficiently robust to prevent recurrence of the events set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  Our assessment of that report is ongoing and we are seeking to identify any lessons learned from it that may be beneficial to the sector more generally through a further strengthening of the policy framework for safeguarding the interests of the Exchequer and institutions during the IP commercialisation process.  </p> <p>  The responses to these questions and the further information received from WIT will inform the Department's advice and recommendations to the Minister on any further steps or actions arising from the findings and recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The governing body of the institute has acknowledged receipt of that letter and the Department expects a response from the governing body following its next meeting, which, I believe, will be at the end of January.  The Department will assess the response from the governing body when it is received in preparing its advice to the Minister on the next steps for the issues set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The Department will also take into account any advice from the board of the HEA on foot of its consideration of the issues that we discussed earlier.  </p> <p>  My colleagues and I are happy to answer any questions from the committee arising from its examination of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-01-24a.826" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Willie Donnelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019012400002#QQ00500"><p>I have given a detailed submission and this is just a short summary of that.  As the Accounting Officer of Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, I welcome the opportunity to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts to discuss the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on the development and disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry.  WIT was established in 1970 to address the needs of industry in the city and the wider region.</p><p>As the basis on which the economy had been built began to crumble in the 1990s, the community in the city turned to WIT for solutions.  It is now ten years since Waterford Crystal closed in Waterford.  Its closure had a devastating effect, not only on the workforce, but also on the wider community.  The economy of the city had been based on manufacturing, the port and associated heavy industries.  By the time of the Waterford Crystal closure, this economic base had been decimated.  Moreover, the demise of Waterford Crystal, a prestigious brand that made the city known all over the world, was a symbol of the demise of the city in the minds of the people of Waterford.</p><p> With the needs of that community in mind, our focus as an institute has been on rebuilding the economy of the region for the 21st century through cutting-edge research and by being leaders in technology and innovation.  Starting with the establishment of the Telecommunications Software and Systems Group, TSSG, and the subsequent establishment of two centres of excellence in biopharma and advanced manufacturing, we have worked hard to bring about a transformation of the industrial landscape in Waterford and the wider region.  This has required WIT to go outside its traditional role as a teaching college and necessitated major investment in resources and structures that were supported by our own central funding, unlike in universities.</p><p> In 2004, WIT created the ArcLabs Research and Innovation Centre where researchers, entrepreneurs, business support and high potential start-ups are co-located.  At the time, this was a radical concept and required the development of new governance and management structures.  Now it is widely replicated and considered best practice.  The success of this model was highlighted by Enterprise Ireland at the Committee of Public Accounts in 2013, when it stated: "Waterford is a shining example of how co-locating the incubation centre with the institute has led to the establishment of a software industry that probably should not have existed in Waterford."  The creation of this software industry in Waterford was driven by the success of the TSSG.  Since 1998, the TSSG, which is widely recognised as a global leader, has brought more than &euro;90 million in competitive research funding to the region and completed over 600 research and innovation projects.  It has 90 staff members of more than 20 nationalities.  Over 300 former employees of the TSSG have moved into alternative employment in the ICT sector in the region.  Between 2013 and early 2017, the TSSG technology gateway completed more than 260 projects for Irish companies.  The TSSG has been a vehicle for foreign direct investment and, with its spin-out, FeedHenry, has attracted major venture capital investment in Waterford.  FeedHenry was established at the height of the economic downturn, but still achieved venture capital investment when there was virtually no investment of this type nationally.  We recently saw the establishment of a dedicated venture capital platform in the south east and a high potential start-up accelerator programme that is driving the next generation of employment.</p><p> From nothing, today the region has over 100 high technology companies.  The software industry in the region employs more than 3,000 highly qualified professionals.  There is no question that this industry at this scale would not exist but for the TSSG and the efforts of the institute.  This level of success is almost unprecedented in Irish higher education.  Our efforts have paid off and we are well on course to replace all the jobs lost in Waterford Crystal.  The institute is proud of its success, and it continues to be ambitious for the city and region and anticipates a bright future for high technology industry in the area.</p><p> It is worth noting that, in research, innovation and commercialisation, Ireland continues to develop and evolve.  As with all third level institutions, the governance and management infrastructure has matured since 2010.  The organisational design, processes, procedures and systems in WIT have evolved over the past decade to reflect the evolution of the Higher Education Authority knowledge transfer system.  The review of intellectual property management and conflicts of interest, commissioned by Knowledge Transfer Ireland and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, performed a deep analysis of the intellectual property management and conflict of interest system as exists in WIT.  We were one of the five reference sites.  The report indicates that the system implemented in WIT is consistent with established international practice.</p><p> Regarding the specific matters under consideration today, the institute welcomes the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report.  WIT has worked closely with the Comptroller and Auditor General to ensure that all information relating to the development and disposal of intellectual property in FeedHenry was made available in a timely manner and, where sought, we provided contextual and supporting information.  Importantly, the institute has fully reviewed its internal policies and practices in light of the report's recommendations and is satisfied that the majority of recommendations have been fully implemented.</p></speech>

However, that is a matter for Professor Donnelly.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. McCarthy and his office for their work and report.  I will turn to page 20, which covers the review of intellectual property management and conflicts of interest.  Paragraph 2.17 discusses the review by the HEA and Knowledge Transfer Ireland of intellectual property policies.  That review came as a result of work done and questions asked by this committee on a number of issues, mainly relating to WIT but also other institutes of technology.</p><p>Our work was in two areas.  We were focused on management of conflicts of interest as well as whether the institutes were being fully and properly protected in their share in equity.  These were essentially the issues we were concerned with.</p></speech>

These were the two areas that the committee and I focused on.  We highlighted potential deficiencies.  That has been agreed by the Higher Education Authority and Knowledge Transfer Ireland.  These were the areas where there were weaknesses.</p></speech>

It goes across the sector in general.  This was not only an issue relating to Waterford Institute of Technology.</p></speech>

The report refers to failures in the systems for managing conflicts of interest.  I gather "weaknesses" is the word used.  Were there weaknesses in the decision-making process around relative equity stakes in spin-out companies?</p></speech>

There was a lack of evidence in respect of decision-making and the documentation of reasoning for certain matters.

I know the guideline that the president is referring to, which is of the order of six years, but that really relates to things like invoices and so on.  For a major strategic initiative on the part of a public sector organisation, I would expect permanent retention of critical documents.</p></speech>

Given that it was not in the document, perhaps the institute can accept that for these types of strategic big sales or initiatives, it should keep better records.</p> <p>  I will move on to conclusions and recommendations on page 21 of the report.  Paragraph 2.20 states: "The Governing Body of Waterford Institute of Technology adopted a local policy to deal with commercialising IP and managing conflicts of interest in February 2010 &mdash; almost six years after this was recommended in the 2004 national code of practice."  Who was the vice president for research from 2004 to 2010?</p></speech>

In fact, the 2010 policy states that the officeholder is the office of the vice president of research.  Why did it take six years to develop the policy?</p></speech>

First and foremost, the intellectual property policy that was from 2004 was a recommendation.  If the Deputy reads the IP policy, he can see that it says that the policy, which is a recommendation, should not be taken in isolation.  It needs to be taken in the context of the structures and infrastructure being in place to support the development of the IP policy.</p> <p>  Two other dates are important.  In 2006, the Institutes of Technology Act 2006 gave institutes of technology authority to be engaged in spin-out companies.  Second, the tech transfer, or technology transfer strengthening initiative, in 2007 was the first investment nationally in developing the IP management infrastructure to support the 2004 recommendations.  WIT was the only institute of technology along with the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, to receive funding for a tech transfer office.  The tech transfer manager was hired in 2008.</p></speech>

I am keen to say one thing that is important.  The 2010 IP policy is the codification of practice that was established in the institute since 2004.  It is not that we did not have established practices.  It is simply that the 2010 policy is the codification of those practices.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General states at paragraph 2.22: "There is no record that the assignment of the Institute's IP to FeedHenry Ltd in December 2010 was considered or approved by the Governing Body."  Essentially, a decision was made to transfer the IP.  That would have been a fairly big decision to make.  I gather the person or the office overseeing it was the financial controller at the time.

It says that in June 2011 I make a presentation to the governing body where I presented FeedHenry and the spin-out of FeedHenry.

My understanding, from reading national policy and the policy of Waterford IT in respect of spin-out companies and so on, is that it seems the policy is written from the viewpoint that these companies would be established within the institute.  It seems from this perspective that the company was established outside of the institute privately and it then came to the institute and sought the IP.  Is my reading of that right?</p></speech>

It was the first time we had a technology transfer office and I thought it advisable to establish good practice in our engagement with campus companies.  I subsequently received a memo from the person who had carried out the review raising certain issues about the relationship between Aceno and the institute.  In the light of my having requested a review, I asked for documentary evidence in support of the issues to be provided.</p></speech>

My understanding of his report is that it states a memorandum raising concerns was sent to Professor Donnelly.  However, the report seems to suggest a copy of the memorandum ought to have been sent to the secretary or financial controller, the president and the governing body, but that this was not done.</p></speech>

The Institute responded that the (then) Secretary/Financial Controller was not included in the circulation list for the memorandum.

As I had asked for a review to be carried out, I requested documentary evidence related to the claims.  It is quite common to receive communications from persons making particular statements.

I think it was very reasonable for me to say to the person that I had a serious concern about the matter and ask to be provided with the supporting information which allowed the particular conclusions to be reached, which I would then forward on.  When the supporting information did not arrive, I forwarded the matter to the person responsible for the management of conflicts of interest, namely, the financial controller.

At paragraph 3.28, the report states, "Furthermore, the Institute stated that a review of consultancy work [was] undertaken by Aceno Ltd".

I am not accusing anybody of saying they did a review that was not done but unfortunately the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot report that a review actually took place, or what that review did or did not, because there are no documents.  Lessons can be learned and that is the important thing in all of this.</p> <p>  I will move on to the assignment agreement.  This is the second important issue in the report.  Paragraph 3.36 states: "After the July 2010 licence agreement was signed, FeedHenry Ltd endeavoured to attract the level of investment that would help trigger the assignment of the IP."  Policy can change depending on a whole range of factors, but here the policy was that the equity to be received by the institute should be reduced by 15%.  The paragraph continues: "In November 2010, the company proposed changes to the terms of the July agreement."</p> <p>  Mr. McCarthy might be able to confirm my understanding that the company contacted Waterford IT in order to change its equity.</p></speech>

It is important I am given time to say the following.  Consider the situation we were in.  This was 2010 and the economy had collapsed.  The State had given us &euro;800,000 of investment in research and innovation in intellectual property, IP, that was generated.  We had gone through two phases of attempting to commercialise that IP with two separate, external companies and both had failed because of the economic situation.  We had a situation whereby, contrary to the national situation, venture capital companies were willing to put &euro;400,000 on the table.  The IP policy said for assignment-----</p></speech>

The IP policy said that the requirement for assignment was &euro;140,000.  Uniquely, this company, maybe because I was a shareholder, was required to meet more stringent conditions.  We had &euro;400,000 on the table from a set of venture capital companies in November.  Anyone who knows how the system works for venture capital companies will say that, if that deal was not closed by December, the venture capital companies would have walked away for tax reasons.  As the vice president for research, and not as a shareholder, and with the financial controller knowing I had a conflict, I said that, from my perspective, the institute needed to accept what was on the table because it was well beyond what was in our intellectual property policy.</p></speech>

I want Mr. McCarthy's professional opinion.  Here we have a vice president of an institute for research who was also a shareholder in a company and, notwithstanding his declaration of a conflict of interest, as a shareholder of a company, he stood to gain financially if that company was sold.  He then, as vice president, wrote to the financial controller advocating for a reduction in the equity of the institute.  It could be argued that would be financially beneficial to Mr. Donnelly, although I am not saying that was his motivation.  Would Mr. McCarthy see that as a conflict of interest, or something that could or should have been avoided?</p></speech>

Conflicts occur in these situations, maybe particularly in these situations, because of the merger of individual, institutional and commercial interests.  It is broadly recognised that conflicts of interest occur.  There is a conflict of interest but the issue is how it was handled.  As Mr. Beausang said, to conclude from the information available that the conflict was handled inappropriately is something that we have to explore.  I would distinguish between the clear fact of the conflict of interest and how it was handled.</p></speech>

The intellectual property policy was developed in 2010 and it references the commercialisation committee but, in fact, it was a technology transfer office.  It says that someone has a conflict of interest if they, or someone known to them, or somebody with whom they are in a business relationship, or somebody to whom they report has an interest in the company and they must absolve themselves of any decision making.</p><p>If the policy was in place from 2004 to 2010, most of the people in the commercialisation office would have reported to Professor Donnelly.  In fact, as President, they now all do.  Does Professor Donnelly have shareholdings in any existing companies in WIT?</p></speech>

I will not deal with this in detail but there was a great deal of public commentary about issues that were raised in this committee, which was unhelpful.  Professor Donnelly might have a view on that.  We focused on two areas: management of conflicts of interest and protecting the institute.  In fact, we are examining these across a number of institutions.  Our role is to ensure that happens.  Nobody is disputing the fact that Waterford IT is one of the leading drivers of cutting edge research and development.  A substantial amount of positive work was done, but that does not mean that we cannot examine these issues.  We have done that, and I believe we have done it fairly.  We ask questions without fear or favour.  That is our job.  There are a couple of other issues I will raise later, but I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

It was about the fact that there was no proactive recognition of possible problems on the ground.  The feeling I get, and this has arisen with different institutions, is that development is good, spin-off companies and commercialisation are very good, but there is no oversight.  One questions that at one's peril.  It arose again today with Professor Donnelly, that this is excellent and it was particularly good at that time, but that it should not be questioned too much.

However, it was a requirement of the funding agency that 10% of the cost be raised elsewhere.  As we could not raise it from our core funding, it had to be raised externally.  As such, we sought a partner that would make a contribution of 10% of the cost.  Again - this is what I understand as I was not involved - it was agreed as part of the negotiations that it would receive 1% of the equity the institution received from any company established within the incubation centre.</p></speech>

I am sure we can count them.  I have not seen any evidence of a lack of understanding and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General is clear.  As somebody who has many businesses, I agree that there can be conflicts, but I think many of us who are shareholders try to protect ourselves from any such accusations.  It would be my considered opinion that Professor Donnelly's position, his multiple hats, his transition through University of Limerick and his various roles-----</p></speech>

I have a significant issue with the vice president of an institute of technology standing to personally gain from shareholding.  If one is employed by the State and getting a salary, one's focus should be on that job, not on making money out of the seed companies one sees coming down the tracks.  I am uncomfortable with it and I think, from my colleagues' contributions today, that we are uncomfortable with that position.  I am not suggesting that there is anything untoward, necessarily, but it does not seem to be the right way to go about the important role that Professor Donnelly has there.  No record of that has been signed off by the governing body and questions have been asked of other Deputies as to how long they keep records for.  Any of us who keep accounts know how long we have to keep records for.  We did not just fall out of the sky.  Professor Donnelly must have known questions would be asked.  Would that not be the file he would keep?  Would he not have thought that the file relating to the company in which he was a shareholder would be asked about in the future?  I would keep that file specially.</p></speech>

I am only trying to put the record straight.  It was not my function to keep those records.  I was vice president of research.  When we talk about records being missing, they were not my records.

Following the disposal of the interest in the intellectual property to the company from the then acting president, it informs AIB that, in line with the agreement in place, we will hold 1% of the 10.8% of shares for the benefit of AIB.  It specifically refers to being in line with the term of the institute&rsquo;s agreement with AIB.  However, there is no signed version of that agreement.  We do have the heads of an agreement which has space for signatures.  From a legal point of view, however, it is a draft agreement.</p> <p>  I do not think there is a dispute necessarily between WIT and AIB as to what the terms are.

Even if they are there, they are not implemented.  Mr. Donnelly has pointed out, which is in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, that a policy was introduced in 2004 but not implemented until 2010.  Subsequently, there was another policy but there was a significant delay in implementing it.  Even if policies are in place, they are not actually acted on or implemented.</p> <p>  In addition, we now have a thumbs-up for the commercialisation of research and intellectual property.  That is not value for money for the public purse, which is providing the universities and the institutes of technology with funding.  Who does the assessment in terms of value for money for the taxpayer?  What I am getting here is a thumbs-up for &euro;62.3 million on expenditure with a tiny amount of a return.  It also involved years of research.  I could go back to 1996, when I look at the literature, up to 2014 when it was sold.  Who has valued that for the public purse?</p></speech>

To be clear, Government policy is to encourage commercialisation of intellectual property but within a proper framework.  That is very much the issue we are talking about in the context of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report with appropriate oversight of that commercialisation process and effective and rigorous management of conflict of interest.  The framework to achieve that is work in progress.  We have a new intellectual property protocol sitting with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation addressing the specific larger weakness identified in the KTI-HEA report.  That was a framework for spin-outs, which relates to the FeedHenry Limited issues and more generally.</p></speech>

We all agree on the lack of governance and when the policies are brought in, who will implement them and ensure they are being carried out?  There is also an area where commercialisation is regarded as being good and all of the public facilities are used to help to make a massive profit for a private company.  Is that Government policy?  Even within that policy, there is a grey area where it says to protect public property and the public entity as well.</p></speech>

Mr. Robert Watt, the Secretary General, wrote back to us saying that it was far too complex and that they could not possibly do that.  We wrote back telling him how dare he insult the public service by saying it is not capable of putting the money together because every private organisation that applies for a research grant has to keep a record and the Department came back subsequently with a significant volume of improved information.  It was not the lot but it was a decent stab at doing it.  That is on the record from our previous efforts and perhaps every member was not tuned into that.  We have received information and investment from a variety of other sources which makes Deputy Connolly's point even more serious.  Mr. Beausang is saying that as a result of that, a greater effort is being made to at least establish what happened with the money because it was not just what was going in through Waterford IT, it was coming in from-----</p></speech>

I know the issue of the number of jobs that are created in the region has been addressed before.  It is in excess of 100 high-quality jobs and that needs to be factored into any calculation looking at the outputs.  We need to look at the entire picture, not just the money that comes back into the institute.</p></speech>

I just did not get through all of the report.  I also have a number of observations on responses that were given.</p> <p>  An Teachta O'Connell made a number of points earlier that I do not agree with, which shows that members have different opinions in this area.  I remember when we first examined this, we were told by some in this sector of spin-outs and that we did not understand.  We do and I am clear that commercialising IP is good.  Others might have a different opinion and the interests of the State and the institute have to be protected but the concept is good.  It is not morally or ethically wrong for anybody in an institute to have a shareholding in a company.  If someone is a vice president for research, it is probably best not to be a shareholder because I would see that as protecting the individual, the office and the institute.  If I was developing policy I would probably have that as a  requirement because if one is the office holder of the policy, which Dr. Donnelly is, it is better not to be involved.  I do not cast any judgment on Dr. Donnelly but that is my opinion of how it should work.  In many respects, the glass is half full because we have had the report from KTI-HEA and recommendations have been made on foot of us and the Comptroller and Auditor General examining this issue and improvements have been made.  All of this is not about making sure that we have exchanges such as this; it is about making sure that policies are robust and that they protect the third level institutions and the taxpayer.  That is what we want and that is what the Comptroller and Auditor General considers when he examines process.</p> <p>  On the jobs that are created, everybody accepts that jobs were created as a consequence of this spin-out and others.  That does not justify any weaknesses in the system.  We are not here to make judgments on how many jobs are created.  We can accept that.  We are here to look at how we can improve weaknesses where they are present and to accept learnings.  It is good that WIT has accepted all of the Comptroller and Auditor General's recommendations and that they are being implemented.  Let us collectively mark that down as an achievement and then I will go on to some of my other questions.</p> <p>  Dr. Donnelly and I were not having a disagreement but there were questions around what the institute received.  There is a breakdown of when the company was sold in section 4.1 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  The Comptroller and Auditor General was given this breakdown.  Dr. Donnelly's view was that we need to be careful that we do not put inaccurate information into the public domain and I certainly would not want to find myself in that position.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is saying that when the company was sold, the institute received &euro;1.59 million.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

To be fair, it is important that we talked about the percentage of equity that the institute got and then we talked about the return on that equity.  The return on the equity was &euro;1.5 million and the fact that the institute had an IP policy that dictated how that was distributed is a different conversation.</p></speech>

We cannot get into that because it is now with the HEA and legal people but that examination was carried out on the basis of concerns that people in the institute have.  That is our job and I had this out with the Secretary General of the Department and the former head of the HEA when he was before the committee in Dr. Donnelly's absence as well.  We cannot ignore documentation that is given to us.  It is not in our gift to ignore protected disclosures.  Dr. Donnelly should be aware of that because sometimes I get a sense from him as an individual that he feels that the work of this committee is somehow personal; it is not.  We have a job to do, which is to follow up on those protected disclosures and examine process only and we have done so.</p></speech>

I am a fairly outspoken person and I have a particular style but I fully support the work of this committee.</p> <p>  On protected disclosures, the institute has a structure and a process in place for dealing with same.  I want to put on the record that the institute takes them very seriously and when we get protected disclosures, they are fully investigated and they are overseen by an independent board.  I can also tell the Deputy, as president of the institute, that where there are protected disclosures, the president never knows what the detail of them is.</p><p>They are fully investigated and the institute takes action.  What I would like to say to anybody, particularly those associated with the institute, is that if the institute or anybody associated with it has information and wants to use a protected disclosure system, that system is in place in WIT, as it is in all other institutes.</p></speech>

Of course, the institute has its policy and people can make protected disclosures within the institute.  They can also make them outside the institute to different bodies, which they have done.  In the case of the report that is not yet published, and might not be published, there were 50 people, but there were people from within the institute who had different views.</p></speech>

The person who carried out the review interviewed 50 people, which includes people in  KTI, the HEA, the Department, and people who work in the institute.  To protect the institute, and perhaps Deputy Cullinane can say it, there were not 50 people who made disclosures or statements about the institute.  There are 50 people who were interviewed, as would be appropriate.  This is how the institute gets a bad name.  People say to me, "I hear there are 50 people making disclosures about Waterford Institute of Technology".  Fifty people, as appropriate, were interviewed in order to carry out the process.  That is what has been communicated to me.  I request that we be very careful when we make statements about the number of people who made disclosures.  I think the Deputy said it was 15, 12 or whatever.</p></speech>

In fact, we did make that point when the Department and the HEA representatives were present.  We had a discussion this morning during which there was a recognition that people were interviewed.  This committee has received an additional protected disclosure that we are now dealing with which might be carried over to whatever will follow from the HEA's work.  In any event, that is accepted.  I did not mention that there were 50 protected disclosures.  I said there were a number, which from memory I believe was 12 or 13, received that had to be acted upon and were acted upon.  That is the end of it.  The process was put in place to do that.</p></speech>

It is about the reason the decision was made to do this.  Paragraph 3.40 states that at the final negotiation, the equity for the institute was reduced from 15% to 12%.

I have two final questions for Mr. McCarthy.  Paragraph 4.7 states: "FeedHenry Ltd (established in June 2008) had its registered offices in ArcLabs".  Deputy Connolly dealt with this earlier.  From 2010 onwards, rent and expenses were incurred by the institute but which were recovered.  However, from 2008 to 2010, there was no record of that.  The institute said it is because it was not using any of the resources but Mr. McCarthy points out that it seems to be giving an address and telephone number based on ArcLabs.  Again, not to get into the rights and wrongs of it because the institute's response is possibly correct, I am just trying to understand this.  Did Mr. McCarthy include this because the point is that it cannot now be proven one way or the other?</p></speech>

Certainly, within a research institute where many different research projects are ongoing at a point in time, there is a funding stream that is available for specific purposes.  There really should be time logs, even if it is on the basis of somebody self-certifying, but with somebody looking at and discussing it - let us say, a line manager - and signing off on the allocation of time as between projects.</p></speech>

Given this was not a recommendation in Mr. McCarthy's report and, as I understand it, it was not dealt with in the KTI-HEA report either, do Mr. Beausang and Mr. O'Toole believe this is something that could be looked at?

I think it is necessary because one has different streams of funding from different sources for which one has to give an account.  There should be a system within an institution which supports the allocation of costs to individual projects.</p></speech>

The academic member of staff would be allocated responsibility for the supervision of PhD students and he would also be allocated responsibility because he was seconded to oversee some of the management in TSSG.  If anyone wanted, they could go through all the records and pull them together.  In the case of a contract researcher, because one is charging their time to the project, all those records are in place.  The point I am making is that this person is a whole-time academic member of staff.  Their allocation is distributed under areas such as supervision and teaching, which could all be pulled together.  I accept the point that we should be more formal so that when we second somebody to a particular project, we should have a formal way of ensuring that the 50:50 split can be measured.  I agree with that.  It is a very good point.</p></speech>

It takes about 80% of my time at the moment.  We have an application ready to go, and we have worked hard on that between the two institutes.  We have an issue in the sense that we have an engagement with the TUI, which is the academic union, and we are in negotiation with it to look at how we complete a memorandum of understanding, MoU, which it wants to complete before we move to the next phase.  Things are progressing, maybe not as fast as we would all like, but it is extremely important that we engage the staff and that the staff are fully part of the process.</p></speech>

That is, to some extent, why we are here today.  The HEA has said that it accepts that and has informed all sectors that they must embody this in their recommendations.  However, it will be year before we know if that has actually happened.  It is to happen in the coming year. </p></speech>

The second point is that these requirements are new so the Higher Education Institutions, HEI, and Knowledge Transfer Ireland, KTI, agreed that the HEI would carry out a review in 2019 of the implementation of the various recommendations.  This is separate from the annual governance statements.  The third component is the revised IP protocol.  A protocol was devised in 2012 and there was an evolution of that in 2016 and there will be a further one in 2019, which will deal in more detail with spin-out companies and revenue sharing arrangements.  That is a policy matter for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and, as was referenced earlier, that policy will be considered by the Government.</p></speech>

Their shareholding is a private matter but if they are part of the staff, surely they should be treated in a uniform way.  If some of the staff happen to have, in a private capacity, a shareholding, how can one distinguish that from the reward scheme?  I ask Mr. O'Toole to explain that to me.  Is it any of the HEA's business?  I know that some committee members might not like me putting it this way but it is their private business.  We have not been told today how much Professor Donnelly made because it is his private business.  We might be curious but it is his private business at the end of the day.  Is the HEA straying into the private business of individual staff members?</p></speech>

I go back to the conversation we had earlier.  There is a recognition that conflicts will occur and the management of those requires the maximum amount of transparency.  I go back to the point that one does not stray into the shareholding of a private individual but one must ensure that whatever that individual does is in accordance with policy and that if there are conflicts arising, they are managed.  The thrust of the revised protocol will be about how potential conflicts are managed, such as spin outs and revenue share.</p></speech>

At the same time, Mr. O'Toole has said that the HEA does not want to stray into their private financial affairs so how can it make that differentiation if it does not do that?  I ask him to explain this conflict.  I see that Dr. O'Sullivan has his hand up.</p></speech>

I am concerned that somebody was not taking this too seriously if they felt that the chairman could attend that meeting on his own.  I am a little bit concerned.  Maybe I am misreading it but it is based on only one person showing up for such an important meeting.  I would encourage the chairman to make whoever else offers to be there in future be there in future.  That is all I am saying.  I do not know the chairman himself but I compliment him.  This was an important letter and the Department was waiting for the board's response.
