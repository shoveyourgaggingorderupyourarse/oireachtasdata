    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022052500002#B00200"><p>I remind members, witnesses, and persons of the Public Gallery to turn off their mobile phones.  The purpose of today's meeting is to examine the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 and the Control of Dogs Act 1986, and the strategic priorities of R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann.  In the first session, the committee will hear from representatives of the Department of Rural and Community Development on the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 and the Control of Dogs Act 1986 and, in the second session, it will hear from representatives of R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann on the priorities for the greyhound industry.</p> <p>  From 28 February, the legal requirement of mask wearing in all sectors has been removed.  However, it is still good practice to continue to use face masks, particularly in crowded areas.  The Service encourages all members of the parliamentary community to wear face masks while moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I want to bring to witnesses' attention the matter of privilege.  Witnesses giving evidence within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to a committee.  This means that witnesses have a full defence in any defamation action for anything said at the committee.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed to cease giving evidence on an issue at the Chair's direction.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and they are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who give evidence from locations outside the parliamentary precinct are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice in this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside of the proceedings held by the committee, of any matters arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise, comment on, or make charges against either a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way that could make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in the committee meeting when they participate from within the parliamentary precincts.  There can be no assurances in relation to participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts and members should be mindful of this when contributing.</p> <p>  In the first session, we will hear from representatives of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  We are joined by Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa, assistant secretary; Mr. Paul Geraghty, principal officer; Ms Catherine Burns, assistant principal and Ms Teresa Gavaghan, higher executive officer.  I call on Ms Nic Aongusa to make her opening statement. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.6" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022052500002#B00300"><p>Good evening.  I would like to thank the committee for inviting us here this evening to discuss the Department&rsquo;s role in relation to Dog Breeding Establishments Act and the Control of Dogs Act.  I am assistant secretary in the community division of the Department of Rural and Community Development and I am accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. Paul Geraghty, principal officer, Ms Teresa Gavaghan, higher executive officer, and remotely by Ms Catherine Burns, assistant principal officer.<br/><br/>First of all, I would like to set out the Department&rsquo;s responsibilities regarding dog breeding establishments and dog control.  Legislative and policy responsibilities in relation to the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 and the Control of Dogs Act 1986 were transferred to us from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in July 2017 when the Department of Rural and Community Development was formed.  Since the transfer of these functions, the Department of Rural and Community Development has carried out several reviews of this area of work to ensure the legislation is fit for purpose, to seek to make improvements where appropriate and to promote responsible dog ownership.  I will talk more about these activities later.<br/><br/>The Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 regulates the operation of dog breeding establishments.  It requires local authorities to establish and maintain registers of dog breeding establishments and prohibits the operation of unregistered dog breeding establishments.  The Control of Dogs Act 1986 provides for the licensing and control of dogs and for the protection of livestock from worrying by dogs.  Operational matters in respect of these Acts are the responsibility of the local authorities and I will speak about this in more detail later.<br/><br/>First, it is important that the public understands the key work that the Department of Rural and Community Development carries out in the area of dog control.  The Department of Rural and Community Development publishes comprehensive annual statistics on local authority dog related activities.  These cover, for example, information on stray and unwanted dogs, dog licences, enforcement actions, and the operation of local authority dog shelters and dog breeding establishments.  The statistics are available on the Government website <i>gov.ie.</i><br/><br/>Statistics for 2021 will be published later this year, but I can give some examples of the type of information gathered for 2020.  In 2020, the total number of dog licences issued was 207,866.  This includes 200,857 individual dog licences, 6,713 lifetime of dog licences and 296 general dog licences.  The general dog licence covers an unspecified number of dogs in the one premises.  The annual dog licence and general dog licence are valid for one year while the lifetime of dog licence is valid for the dog&rsquo;s lifetime.<br/><br/>The statistics contain some welcome trends.  For example, the total number of dogs euthanised in 2020 in local authority pounds was 172, down from 403 in 2019, 778 in 2018, 996 in 2017 and 1,674 in 2016.  This continues the year-on-year annual trend in the decline in the number of dogs being euthanised &ndash; down from just over 21,000 in 2002.<br/><br/>Information in relation to dog breeding establishments is also collated by my Department.  The number of such establishments in 2020 was 239.  This figure includes 83 commercial dog breeding establishments, 85 hunts clubs and 49 commercial boarding kennels.  The remainder comprises 18 animal welfare shelters and four training kennels.  That is an overview of the Department of Rural and Community Development's work in the area, but in order to provide the committee with a full picture of the work carried out in relation to the control of dogs and dog breeding establishments, it is important to understand the role of other arms of Government with responsibilities in these areas.<br/><br/>The most important aspect of work relating to dog control happens at the front line.  The local authorities are key in this regard.  They are responsible for all operational matters in relation to dog breeding establishments, including the licensing, monitoring and inspection of dog breeding establishments and, where a serious and immediate threat exists to public health or animal health and welfare, for the closure of such establishments.  Local authorities are also responsible for the enforcement of certain legislation in this area.  For example, under the Control of Dogs Acts local authorities have the power to issue dog licences, appoint dog wardens, provide dog shelters, seize dogs, impose on-the-spot fines and take court proceedings against dog owners, where appropriate.  The Department of Rural and Community Development co-operates closely with the local authority veterinary service to ensure that we do what we can to support the vets in their work.<br/><br/>The Department of Rural and Community Development also has a close working relationship with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  This Department is responsible for the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, and a statutory instrument made under this act includes provisions around the microchipping of dogs.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine also wrote and oversees regulations around the sale, supply and advertising of pet animals, including dogs.  We are currently in discussions with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding the potential transfer of some  responsibilities in this area, as a move towards consolidating the work around dog breeding establishments.<br/><br/>As a result of our close relationship with both the local authority vets and dog welfare groups, we became aware of the need to tighten up on the operating standards in dog breeding establishments in Ireland.  We initiated a public consultation in 2017, and in January 2019, revised guidelines for the operation of dog breeding establishments came into effect.  They now form part of the framework within which local authorities carry out inspections and issue improvement notices where required.  Having taken on board the stakeholder views, we ensured a substantial shift in focus within the revised guidelines towards the welfare of dogs and pups in dog breeding establishments.  We know that better socialised pups, housed in appropriate accommodation, make for better pets.  Where there is a focus on socialisation in the key first few weeks of life, there is a smoother transition to life in a family home.</p><p>We know that better socialised pups, housed in appropriate accommodation, make for better pets.  Where there is a focus on socialisation in the key first few weeks of life, there is a smoother transition to life in a family home.  The revised guidelines also place an emphasis on the need for accurate record-keeping by dog breeding establishments and sets the staff to breeding bitches ratio at 1:25.  This was a key shift from the original guidelines, which did not stipulate in a ratio.  </p><p> As part of our drive to review and improve legislation in this area, work is ongoing in the Department on a review of the legislation and the preparation of proposed amendments to the Dog Breeding Establishment and Control of Dogs Acts.  Regarding dog breeding establishments, we are considering, for example, strengthening the enforcement regime by introducing additional penalties for offences and allowing for fixed payment notices.  We are also proposing additional amendments to ensure that local authorities can inspect deregistered premises and seize dogs when warranted due to welfare and other issues.</p><p> Under the Control of Dogs Act, we are considering a new provision to allow for dog control notices, DCNs.  They are notices issued to owners whose dogs have been found to be out of control.</p><p> As part of our objective to promote responsible dog ownership, the Department recently published a consultation report on a review of measures relating to the control of dogs in Ireland.  This report followed a public consultation to which more than 1,000 responses were received.  As a result of this review, the Department intends to more actively promote a culture of responsible dog ownership in Ireland.  This will include supporting information campaigns regarding responsible dog ownership and progressing measures involving primary and secondary legislation.  </p><p> We are also consulting with the Office of the Attorney General regarding introducing increased penalties for the offence of livestock worrying, which continues to be an issue in our rural areas.  Some 241 incidences of livestock worrying were reported to local authorities in 2020, with 253 reported in 2019.  </p><p> All the work we do in this area, including the reviews of the legislation, revised guidelines and stakeholder consultation, is with a view to the promotion of responsible dog breeding and ownership in Ireland.  Dogs who are bred in dog breeding establishments are now more likely to receive individual attention and be socialised properly before going to their homes.  At that point, the responsibility transfers to their owners.  </p><p> We know that dog ownership brings great benefits, physical and social, but it also brings with it responsibility.  Another part of the Department has responsibility for the national outdoor recreation strategy.  As part of the communications plan around the forthcoming strategy, there is the intention to develop and deliver a communication campaign to promote a culture of responsible dog ownership in outdoor recreation.  This will complement the work already carried out in area by the Department.</p><p> Dogs must be kept under effectual control, in particular around livestock.  Dogs should never be left free to roam and pose a threat to the livelihoods of our farmers.  During lambing season each year, the Department has spearheaded communication campaigns seeking to inform dog owners of the risks of leaving dog unattended.  As I mentioned, we seek to increase the level of fines for the offence of livestock worrying.  We will continue to do our part, along with colleague in local authorities, local authority vets and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to consolidate efforts in this area and promote the message of responsible dog ownership.</p><p> I thank the committee for its attention.  My colleagues and I are happy to respond to any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions.  I will ask three and let other members in.  The Department published statistics on local authority dog-related activities.  Can Ms Nic Aongusa tell us the biggest issue local authorities are faced with?  Is it stray, missing or mistreated dogs or illegal breeding?  According to the statistics for 2020 on <i>gov.ie</i>, five local authorities issued no on-the-spot fines in 2020.  I appreciate the pandemic may have been partly responsible for that, but I checked the figures on the same website for 2019 and the number was four - Tipperary and Kildare were included for both years.  There were four in 2018, with Tipperary coming up again.  In 2017, four fines were issued.  None were reported to have been paid and no prosecutions or convictions were recorded.</p><p>Can Ms Nic Aongusa offer any reason some local authorities have issued no fines?  In the instances that have been reported, could she explain why that was not followed through on?  If the Department's statistics have any purpose, it is to inform us as to how well a policy is working.  What is being done to address the issue from the Department side?</p></speech>

We regularly engage with local authorities and get a sense from them of what is happening.  The important thing to emphasise is that we publish the statistics and information that local authorities send us.  In general, local authorities would probably be more appropriately able to answer those questions.  I do not know if my colleagues have any further information on that.</p></speech>

Are local authorities hooked up to any of the various microchip databases?  Not all databases can be checked online.  Some are manual and people have to phone the companies concerned.  Would it be easier if everything was digitised and amalgamated?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022052500002#C00700"><p>I am aware of that issue, which has been raised with the Minister.  As I understand it, there is a local authority database on dog licences and a separate database on microchipping.  The two databases operate separately.  When they were being developed, some consideration was given as to whether there should be a single database, but I understand speed was of the essence and it was decided on the local authority side to proceed with having a dog licence database.  The question of having a link between the two databases would require further work and development.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022052500002#C00800"><p>The Departments of Rural and Community Development and Agriculture, Food and the Marine and local authorities are all involved in this area to some extent.  Are the limitations of their remits clear?  In addition, the Department of Rural and Community Development stated that it was in contact with the Department for Agriculture, Food and the Marine about transferring some responsibilities in this area, namely the sale, supply and advertising of pet animals.  What responsibilities is the Department considering transferring?  What would be the benefit of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022052500002#C00900"><p>We are in discussions with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding the potential transfer of some responsibilities in the area as a move towards consolidating the work around breeding establishments.  The discussions are at an early stage.  My understanding is that it concerns the functions of our Department has regarding dog breeding establishments.</p><p>As I said in my opening statement, our responsibility as a Department is a policy responsibility.  We are responsible for the legislation and the operational responsibility rests with the local authorities and their vets.</p><p> When I was answering earlier about databases, I did not have my note to hand.  Perhaps I will go back to the question asked before.  The dog licensing database was established in 2018 by the local authorities and a microchip number can be recorded on a licence but it is not mandatory.  There was a question about linking the microchipping and dog licence database, and a policy decision was taken to keep the two separate for a number of reasons.  A link was not technically feasible because dog licences do not contain a unique identifier and there were data protection issues as well about databases handing over personal details other than individual cases.</p><p> There was also a concern when setting up the microchips database that there could be a negative impact on the uptake of microchipping, which was being introduced for animal welfare reasons, if people were also required to buy a licence at the same time.  Another concern came from the local authority side about a potential loss of earnings.  As the committee knows, local authorities collect dog licences and depend on those for dog warden operations.</p><p> We could give consideration to amalgamating databases, but if that happened, an amendment would be required for the statutory instrument that prescribes dog licensing.  The database would require much coding change.  Currently, dog licences may be purchased at post offices and there would need to be further discussion with those post offices.  Of course, we would also need to discuss this with colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, who are responsible for microchipping.  It would be quite a complex operation to link the two databases.  We try to have very good co-operation at official level between the two Departments to overcome those kinds of issues.</p></speech>

We have the longest and largest inland county, so is there an opinion or rule-of-thumb ratio for how many dog wardens a county should or is advised to have?  The Cathaoirleach knows we had two and one went out sick and has only been replaced, to the best of my knowledge, with half a post.  It is crazy because I know there are times when a dog warden is stuck trying to catch dogs in an estate.  We have a huge county in Tipperary that is not being covered.  Is there a rule of thumb for the number of wardens?</p></speech>

We do not have any rule of thumb on the distribution of those wardens.  Under the local government legislation, each chief executive of each local authority is responsible for the staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out functions in the local authority area, including the provision of dog warden services and inspections of dog-breeding establishments.  The number is fairly static.  In 2018 and 2019, the number was 49 and it was 50 in 2020.  Those are full-time dog wardens.</p></speech>

There is the legal definition of guidelines and there seems to be some confusion at different local authority levels, with some believing they are legally enforceable.  Some local authorities make it a condition on granting a licence that a party complies with dog-breeding establishment guidelines but others do not.  Do the witnesses agree it would be best if we removed the term "guidelines" and the ambiguity that goes with it so we can all be sure these are conditions that must be complied with if somebody is to run a dog-breeding establishment?</p> <p>  The second point concerns the databases and inconsistencies.  Animal welfare organisations and I have done an exercise in trying to find out what dog-breeding establishments are licensed to different local authorities.  What we find is that approximately 50% of local authorities will display some form of information around licensed establishments in the area.  Others will have no information and it would have to be requested.  Even then, the information given is patchy.  Again, could we not have some consistency where the local authority would be obliged to display publicly the dog-breeding establishment licence and that the establishment itself would be required to divulge information, including the number and location of the establishment, along with the number of breeding bitches, for example.  Again, that is not on every database.  It should also include the tax registration number, because this can be a very profitable industry, and the date of the last inspection, including whether any conditions were attached to same.  That sort of information would be very helpful.</p> <p>  From speaking to members of the public, it seems they are horrified to think they could be buying a dog coming from industrial-scale puppy farms.  They are being advised by the Minister to do their homework but there is no way they can do that because they do not have the information available to them.  What are the views of the witnesses on that or the database that could be publicly available with all that information, which could lead to people making an informed decision when buying a dog?</p> <p>  There is another question relating to data that should be maintained by the dog-breeding establishment operator.  This would be a record of births, deaths, sales, movements and any other events that relate to each dog within the establishment.  I have asked the question of previous witnesses in particular about what happens to breeding bitches then the dog-breeding establishment finishes with them.  What we hear is it is very hard to gauge what happens to them.  In some cases they are sold as older dogs and in other cases they are surrendered to rescue operations, which puts a cost on that service to look after these retired bitches.  There is also anecdotal evidence that some of the dog-breeding establishments set up a separate rescue-type organisation and advertise these retired bitches as rescue dogs.  They make more money by selling pups and then the retired bitch as a rescue dog.  I will start with those questions and I might get back in again.  The questions relate to tracking where the animals go from these establishments.</p></speech>

The Senator asked about the local authority register of dog-breeding establishments.  As the Senator knows, under section 9 of the Act, the local authorities are obliged to maintain a register of establishments in their area, but section 9(15) outlines that the local authority may publish the register in a manner that it sees fit.</p></speech>

We carried out a search of all local authority websites and it indicated that 15 published their list online.  Seven had no commercial dog-breeding establishments and therefore did not publish a list, whereas nine did not publish online anyway.  The Department has raised the matter with the dog control working group, which is under the auspices of the County and City Management Association, CCMA.  It was agreed by the CCMA that the publication of the dog-breeding establishment details should remain at the local authority's discretion.  This aligns with the current legislation.</p><p>The question of whether the legislation should be amended to impose stricter conditions is something we will be considering in our review of the legislation.  I will ask Ms Gavaghan to address some of the other issues raised.</p></speech>

In regard to the word &ldquo;guidelines&rdquo;, the Dog Breeding Establishments Act allows the Minister to issue guidelines.  We published revised guidelines in 2019.  They became effective on 1 January 2019.  In the proposed amendments, we are planning to put these guidelines on a statutory basis so they will be able to help future-proof the Act and to link the guidelines clearly to the Dog Breeding Establishments Act.  Local authority veterinary inspectors use the guidelines to carry out their inspections and if there are serious deviations from these guidelines, they have the power to issue improvement notices, or for very serious health and welfare issues, they can close down an establishment.</p></speech>

Would the inspections not be better done like farm inspections and brought under the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine so there is a consistent approach to all dog breeding establishments, no matter where they are?  It seems it is pot luck.  If someone is in a local authority which takes this very seriously, they will have very good inspectors, or the inspector might be the dog warden in one local authority but is a vet in another local authority.  It would make sense to have a consistent approach so we know that when the inspections are taking place, they are all being held to the same standard.</p></speech>

We do this by holding and facilitating annual training days for local authorities.  We intend to hold one this year in September.  Obviously, we could not hold them face to face during Covid, but we held one online.  They help to ensure there is standardisation across local authorities.  Presentations are given by senior vets who have experience in inspecting and issuing improvement notices and closure notices in local authorities.  We have had presentations from people from Northern Ireland and Scotland in regard to dog control and an individual from the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, in respect of investigative techniques.  In this way, we try to ensure there is standardisation of enforcement across the local authorities.</p></speech>

Most animal welfare organisations have a 1:10 ratio.  What is important for anybody listening today is that it is 1:25 breeding bitches and does not include the pups or any stud dogs on the farm.  That could result in one person actually being responsible for up to 150 dogs.  I have one dog and I know it is an awful lot of work in terms of cleaning up after it and maintaining it.  I hope the witnesses will tell me that this staffing ratio is under review and will be reduced from 1:25 because it is just not practical for it to be 1:25 when we are really talking about 1:150 dogs.</p></speech>

It is important to take the views of the local authority vets on board, which would be that there is a huge variance between the various dog breeding establishments.  Some have a high degree of automation, which would mean that staff are freed up to spend more time with the dogs and pups if there are automated feeding stations, automating cleaning and so on.  It is a slightly crude implement to use the ratio in a very strict way and we have to trust the local authority vets to apply common sense when they visit these establishments because of that sort of variance.</p> <p>  The Senator asked in regard to retirement plans for breeding bitches on dog breeding establishments.  It is a stipulation of the Act that appropriate retirement plans should be in place for breeding bitches.  We are not aware of dog breeding establishments advertising retired bitches as rescue dogs but we will look into that.</p></speech>

This would include the birth of the pup, the death of the pup, the dams, the sires and all of this type of information.  The dog breeding establishment operator is required to make it available as and when required by the inspecting officer - the local authority vet - and if the information is not satisfactory or to the vet's satisfaction, he may issue an improvement notice.  That is very clearly stipulated in the guidelines.</p></speech>

These records must include all microchip details, age, sex, breed, dates of whelping of each bitch, number and sex of pups in each litter (including the number of live and dead pups), and details of sale or disposal.  Each pup must have its dam and sire&rsquo;s microchip number listed in its records.  The premises must also have a separate record of all bitches, over 6 months of age and capable of being used for breeding purposes.  All such records must be maintained for five years and made available for inspection on request by an authorised person. </blockquote></speech>

This is my second term on the agriculture committee.  If I had just happened to drop in here today and this was all new to me, I would find it very confusing that one minute we are mentioning local authorities, which house local government, and the next we are referring to the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Rural and Community Development.  When it comes to the broad spectrum of dog control, licensing and microchipping, can this circle be squared in any way?  If someone is not up to speed with this, it is confusing.  If someone has an issue, especially from a livestock worrying perspective, even if the dog is captured and it is microchipped, that person has to go round the houses to track down who might own it or who might be responsible, or where to go next.  That is if the dog is microchipped or licensed.  The majority of dogs out there may not be and probably are not.</p> <p>  How do we get the ordinary man or woman on the street, not to mention those in breeding establishments or large-scale outfits, to deal with this?  They will have a dog and there is no onus on them to do it, but they know it should be done.  God be with the days when I was a young lad in rural Ireland and a garda would call in to look for a dog licence.  That day is long since gone.  We will find, 99 times out of 100, that when there is a problem, an issue or an offence such as livestock worrying, it will be the dog that is not microchipped or that is untraceable that will be the offending dog.  That is the root of all evil in this debate, as far as I am concerned.</p> <p>  My next question is one I asked a previous witness.  It concerns licensing and microchipping for those who are compliant and who go to do it with the best will in the world, but who then down the line may not be responsible or good owners.</p><p>The way I put this the last time was that it was like the theory test for a driver's licence.  Do the witnesses think there should be a kind of simple, basic, perhaps ten-point, questionnaire for people to fill out as to what they think it would be like, what they would need to do, or the tasks they would need to perform to be what one would consider a responsible dog owner?  Do the witnesses think it should be as simple as registering a dog, irrespective of who the person is, what the dog is or how vast or otherwise the person's knowledge of being a dog or other pet owner is?</p></speech>

The first question the Senator asked was about the diversity of the various State bodies responsible for this.  I agree with him that it can be confusing.  That has historical origins in that dog wardens and dog control, historically, were matters for local authorities and the Department with responsibility for housing and local government.  Then the community function of that Department transferred to our new Department of Rural and Community Development.  We have brought that function with us.  In more recent years, in the past decade or so, issues of animal welfare have come more to the fore, so there is very much a focus on animal welfare when it comes to issues relating to dogs.  The discussions at the moment are with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and, I understand, the local authorities in respect of the issues of animal welfare and dog-breeding establishments.  Given that Department's responsibility for animal welfare and dog-breeding establishments, it follows that regulation, inspections, standardisation and other issues would all come under the control of the overall animal welfare function.  After that, the issue of dog control arises.</p> <p>  There is a case to be made for all issues relating to dogs to come under one authority.  We have not got there yet, however.  The discussions at present relate to the dog-breeding establishments element.  However, we engage regularly with all the stakeholders.  For example, we meet regularly with the local authority vets, as I said earlier, and the control of dogs working group we attend, which is chaired by a director of services under the auspices of the CCMA.  We also have regular meetings, as required, with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We co-operate closely.  It is a three-legged stool.  There is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, our Department and the local authorities.  The best approach is to have that close collaboration.</p> <p>  Senator Daly mentioned enforcement and how to improve it.  That issue goes beyond enforcement of dog licences and could relate to many other types of licence.  As to how to improve enforcement, I would turn the question on its head.  It is linked somewhat to the third area the Senator raised, that is, how we can encourage more responsible dog ownership.  The idea of a theory test for a dog owner is not a bad one at all.  If, however, responsible dog ownership is encouraged and promoted, the first thing a responsible dog owner does is get a licence for his or her dog and get that dog microchipped.  That could be part of a communications programme we have talked about.</p> <p>  I invite my colleagues to speak if they wish to add anything further.</p></speech>

We are very aware of the issue.  We hear quite a bit about it.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is particularly concerned about it.  Under the Control of Dogs Act there are specific requirements about keeping dogs under effectual control.  There were 253 incidences of livestock worrying reported in 2019 and 241 in 2020.  We know that a lot of instances go unreported and are sorted out locally and so on, but we are considering increasing the fine for the offence of livestock worrying.  We are getting legal advice on that.</p> <p>  I will pass the Senator on to Ms Gavaghan for responses to the other questions.</p></speech>

As for the onus being on the owner of the dog, and if we compare dog ownership to buying a car, when I buy a car I have to inform myself as to what is required, have my car tax, have a driver licence and so on.  Perhaps what is warranted and needed here is information campaigns as to what is required, and it is something the Department is looking at in the context of our outdoor strategy.  People may not be aware they need their dogs licensed and microchipped and that there are responsibilities in respect of dog fouling and cleaning up after their dogs and so on.  I agree we need to get the message out there, but there is a certain amount of personal responsibility here too.  People need to inform themselves as to what they have to do, and the Department needs to ensure they are made aware of that.</p></speech>

I will not repeat what everyone else has said other than to say I am aware that the Department of Rural and Community Development publishes a comprehensive manual of statistics in respect of local authority dog-related activities.  When I went looking today, I saw that the statistics for 2021 are not yet online.  The witnesses might tell us when they are because this is important.  I am also aware of the information on stray and unwanted dogs and the detail the Department has on that.  I have looked back at those statistics.  The witnesses need not go through all that, but they might tell us when the 2021 statistics will be published.  We are now coming up to the middle of 2022.</p> <p>  I noted from the Department's comprehensive written statement, which I read in detail today, that the total number of dogs euthanised in local authority pounds in 2020 was 172.  That was dramatically down from the 404 in 2019.  Has Covid anything to do with that?  I think Covid had a significant effect on dog ownership, strangely enough.  We see a lot of dogs now being got rid of.  I will not say "dumped", but certainly there were many people who had dogs and who were walking them around D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour a few months ago.  I ask them where their dogs are and they say, "We parted company."  There is a small issue there in respect of Covid that we will not really know how to measure.  Many people got new dogs during the period of Covid and suddenly realised when they were going back to work that they could not quite manage their dogs.  There is something in all that.  The witnesses may know something about it, but in time I think we will know more from those figures.  In 2002, 21,000 dogs were euthanised.  Are those figures correct?  I am shocked to think that many dogs were euthanised in 2002.  The witnesses might come back to me on those figures.</p> <p>  Another area I am especially interested in hearing about is whether the Department has more detailed information on the dogs held by the 85 hunt clubs?  Concern has been expressed to me about some of those clubs.  I simply do not have the facts but I would like to know how much the Department monitors that and how much it inspects those activities.  It is a different type of dog keeping, if the witnesses know what I mean.  We talk about animal welfare, and that is critically important.  I would like the witnesses to address that issue.</p> <p>  I am particularly interested in the issue of livestock worrying.  The Department tells us it is taking advice from the Attorney General on increasing the fines and the regulatory issues around all that, and rightly so.  Farmers, whom we represent, are clearly a big aspect of our work on the committee and they are deeply concerned about this.  What are the penalties the Department is planning?  What engagement has it had with the farm representative bodies and groups, and indeed individual farmers or stakeholders in agriculture?  They need to know more about this.  When does the Department expect a timeline in respect of the Attorney General?  We hear a lot in these Houses about the Attorney General's legal advice, which seems to be endless.  It is a great old line to be spun out.  I am not suggesting the witnesses are spinning that line but I am suggesting it is one we hear regularly in these Houses.  What is the timeline in that regard?  That is the particular issue on which I wish to concentrate.  I accept there seems to be a bit of a disjointed mix between the local authority, the witnesses' Department and the local authority veterinary service.  I am hearing from the witnesses that there may be a need for some legislative change in some areas.  That has been suggested.  As a committee, we would like to hear about those changes.  If anything is to come from our work today, we would like to elicit from the witnesses some key messages, not necessarily today, but the witnesses can contact the committee at any time with recommendations as to what they think would be positive and favourable in respect of this issue in order that we could further consider them in any report we may wish to do.</p> <p>  I thank the Cathaoirleach for the time.  I thank the witnesses for coming here to be with us.  They might touch on some of the issues I have raised.</p></speech>

The Senator asked how much we inspect and monitor.  I will reiterate that we have policy responsibility for the legislation.  The measures, operational aspects and enforcement are matters for the local authorities.  Within that context, we are happy to provide as much information as we can.</p> <p>  On the question of the Attorney General's advice, as my colleague mentioned earlier the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is keen on the amendment relating to sheep worrying.  She has met recently with farmers' groups and has sought the advice of the Attorney General.  We are hopeful we will get advice that will enable us to make regulations in the short term.  I will ask Ms Gavaghan to address the Senator's questions about the statistics.</p></speech>

We publish annual statistics on the dog control activities of local authorities, including dog control and dog breeding establishments.  The Senator firstly asked when the 2021 figures will be published.  They will be published shortly.  We are currently finalising them and have a few queries to follow up on.  We carry out an in-depth checking process.  If we need new data, we agree that with local authorities first.  We issue a form, generally early in the year, to the chief executives of each local authority to make them aware we are collecting the data.  We give a deadline for receipt of that information.  We issue quite a detailed and extensive form.  The local authorities generally provide the information as soon as possible and we collate it and do thorough checks.  There may sometimes be inconsistencies in the data and once we are aware of them, we follow up with the local authorities.  The process can be quite detailed.</p> <p>  If local authorities have outsourced their dog control facilities to an animal welfare organisation, such as the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, they may have to go to that third party for the information, which can slow down the process.  Those figures should be published by the end of the second quarter; certainly by June.</p></speech>

Data is everything.  Figures need to be broken down and analysed.  Ms Gavaghan talked about the comprehensive and detailed form involved.  Would it be possible for the Department to make a blank copy of that form available to the committee to allow us an understanding of the type of data it is attempting to capture?  I do not want a form that has been filled out.  I would like to see a plain copy to understand the format of the form.  That would help us to understand the type of information the Department is trying to elicit.  That might give us a greater understanding of the in-depth analysis she has set out for the committee.  I thank Ms Gavaghan for her detailed response.</p></speech>

That illustrates a shift in policy.  In the past, large numbers of dogs would have been euthanised but more of an attempt is now being made to ensure they go to good homes.  They are either rehomed or transferred to animal welfare groups.</p></speech>

In 2017, 916 were euthanised.  In 2018, that figure reduced to 725.  In 2019, the figure was 398 and in 2020, it was 171.  The figures seem to have plateaued.  At a certain stage, the statistics plateau and we seem to have reached that stage.  The 2021 figure has reduced slightly from the 2020 figure but it has plateaued to a certain extent.</p></speech>

We are dealing with three Government Departments and 30-odd local authorities.  I am concerned about the efficacy of that.  There is a compelling case that the all-encompassing role of animal welfare should be transferred to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine because it would be a natural progression from the work of that Department.  Do our guests have a view on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.63" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2022052500002#G01400"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  As I said earlier, I agree that it seems a bit incongruous and confusing that the functions are spread across three different bodies.  We have responsibility for the Control of Dogs Act and the Dog Breeding Establishments Act from a policy perspective while the local authorities have operational responsibility and deal with enforcement.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine deals with animal welfare.  Responsibility for the Control of Horses Act, for example, rests with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine whereas the Control of Dogs Act rests with us and the local authorities.  That is worth considering.  As I said earlier, discussions have commenced with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the local authority veterinarians about the transfer of responsibility for dog breeding establishments, which clearly come under the remit of animal welfare.</p> <p>  As I said earlier, the Control of Dogs Act is an historical matter about controlling stray dogs and dog fouling, which also comes in under the litter Acts, which are the responsibility of another Government Department, namely, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  The question is more complex as it relates to the control of dogs.  However, it is a matter that will be discussed and considered into the future.</p></speech>

Since the establishment of the Department, the number of enforcement actions has reduced drastically.  In 2015, under the Department as it was then constituted, there were 4,849 on-the-spot fines.  In 2020, the equivalent figure was approximately 1,000.  Is there a particular reason, other than what I have cited, for the reduction?  Those figures have reduced, year on year, since the new Department was established.</p></speech>

I would not necessarily link that change to the transfer of responsibility to the new Department.  It may be a reflection of other responsibilities in local authorities.  I can try to find out more information about that and communicate with the Deputy.  I do not have that information to hand.</p></speech>

There were 82 prosecutions.  Again, that number is substantially lower than in previous years.  There were 411 in 2015 and 304 in 2016.  Since then there has been a year-on-year reduction.  Of the 82 prosecutions, there were only 20 convictions.  Does the Department have a view on those rates?  Are they are acceptable success rates?</p></speech>

They are the ones with responsibility for enforcement.  We would engage with them and find out in general how things are going but this is a matter for each local authority.  They have a statutory function under the Act as the authority with responsibility for dog control within their functional areas.  It is the same with parking fines and things like that.  It is an enforcement act to be carried out by the local authority under its statutory function.</p></speech>

The 2020 figures are quite reduced in comparison to the 2019 figures.  Covid played a big part in that.  During the level 5 lockdowns, only emergency call-outs were allowed and there may not have been as much door-to-door activity.  There may not have been as many dog wardens on the streets and they could not stop a person walking their dog to see if the dog was licensed due to Covid.  We are responsible for the policy and legislation and all the powers of enforcement are invested in the local authorities.  It is a matter for the local authorities to carry out these enforcement activities.  Various issues would be raised at our meetings with the CCMA.  As I said earlier, various issues are discussed when we hold our dog warden training days.  We try to ensure standardisation across local authorities.  Senior local authority vets give presentations on how they carry out inspections, on how to proceed to court and on court activities, etc.  Sometimes if a fine issues at the end of a year the process might be carried through to the following year and it will be reflected in the following year's statistics.</p></speech>

Those percentages are very consistent.  Ms Gavaghan says that part of the approach is to ensure standardisation across all local authorities.  How does the Department do that if it does not discuss the number of fines issued, the number of prosecutions, the fines paid and the subsequent convictions from those prosecutions?  How does the Department strive to achieve standardisation and a consistent approach across local authorities if it is not discussing the specific experiences of local authorities in all those areas?</p></speech>

The Department has committed to ensuring robust and consistent enforcement of this Act but is not making direct interventions when there is clearly not consistency in how it is being implemented in different parts of the country.  Will the witnesses accept that perhaps there is a need for greater intervention to ensure the delivery of that aspect of the programme for Government?</p></speech>

I am very clear that the responsibility for ensuring there is more enforcement rests with the local authorities.  However, I accept that we are the Department with the policy responsibility.  We should also bear in mind that in recent years, the functions of the local authorities in relation to overall community responsibilities have increased.  Their dog breeding functions are funded by the dog licence income and so there is a deficit when it comes to their income versus their total expenditure on dog breeding and dog control functions.  For example, in 2020 the total expenditure by local authorities on dog control and dog breeding was &euro;7.2 million and their total income was &euro;4.7 million.  There is a funding deficit of &euro;2.5 million there.  I cannot speak for the local authorities but if the Deputy put the same questions to them about the lack of enforcement or on-the-spot fines, I imagine they would give two answers.  The first one might be to do with resources.</p><p>The second might be that imposing fines may not be the way forward and that it may be more of a case of engaging with communities and dog owners.  Once again, it is a question of encouraging responsible dog ownership.  I know from talking to people that the problems are not so much to do with having more licences or microchips.  The key problems with dog control relate to the animals that are neither licensed nor microchipped.  It is harder to impose an on-the-spot fine on their owners.  I have heard from staff operating on the ground that if a fine is imposed, it is very difficult to collect.  These issues relate not only to dog licences but also to a range of other areas regarding which fines are imposed at local level.</p><p> I accept what the Deputy has said and that there is a case for us to engage more proactively with local authorities and find out more about what is happening on the ground.  In fairness to Deputy Martin Browne, he raised that at the beginning of the session.  We need to reflect on that.</p></speech>

This matter goes back to the crux of the problem, which is about consistency at local authority level.  We and those who are interested in animal welfare are interested in consistency across the board.  It would make sense if inspections were carried out by a national body, be it the Veterinary Council of Ireland or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and if there were an electronic register with all the relevant information.  Regardless of whether there is a dog breeding establishment in Cork, Kerry or Dublin, the same data would be collected.  Those same data would be available to members of the public so they could make informed decisions when purchasing pups.  They would know exactly where pups are from, the sizes of the dog breeding establishments and the level of breeding.</p> <p>  Let us consider the Department's report on inspections.  Cork county had 35 renewal applications but only three inspections.  Mayo, by contrast, had ten renewals and ten inspections.  Clearly, the local authority in Mayo inspected every single dog breeding establishment that applied to renew a licence whereas the local authority in Cork inspected only three of the establishments of the 35 applicants seeking a renewal.  Even from looking at the chart in the report, one sees a lack of consistency at local authority level.  We are calling for a more joined-up approach.  The delegates will agree that this is what is needed.  The Department might be in charge of the Act but the local authorities need to implement the laws consistently across the board.</p> <p>  The delegates noted in their report that the problem with the current definition of dog breeding establishment is that it also captures the animal welfare organisations, kennel clubs and so on.  Would it be much better to separate them in order to have a clearer picture?</p></speech>

When the legislation was being drafted, there was a strong argument that all dog breeding establishments, regardless of who runs them, need to be subject to the same guidelines.  That is the approach that has been taken.</p></speech>

One would have to argue that one-size-fits-all guidelines are probably not the most appropriate.</p></speech>

The 85 hunting clubs and the associated dogs represent a somewhat different set of circumstances.  I realise they are well looked after in most cases, or in 99% of cases.  It is in people's interest to keep the dogs healthy and fit.  They are working dogs.  I know the subtle difference between pets and working dogs and have no difficulty with that.  Are there any data on this?  Data are everything.  Where could we get more information on the 85 hunting clubs that the delegates referred to in the opening statement?</p></speech>

I agree with the Senator that the premises are different from those of commercial dog breeding establishments.  Hunting dogs are pack animals and have a unique set of circumstances.  We revised the guidelines in 2019.  I understand from talking to representatives of the Hunting Association of Ireland that it has commenced a review of its guidelines and that its revised guidelines, which would comprise a second set, are imminent.  I am not sure what kind of data the Senator would like.</p></speech>

We will hear from Ms Dearbhla O'Brien, chief executive officer; Mr. Frank Nyhan, chairperson; Mr. Pat Herbert, director of regulation; and Mr. William Fitzgerald, veterinary director.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I want to bring to witnesses' attention the matter of privilege.  Witnesses giving evidence within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to a committee.  This means that witnesses have a full defence in any defamation action for anything said at the committee meeting.  However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed to cease giving evidence on an issue at the Chair's direction.  Witnesses should follow the direction of the Chair in this regard and they are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity.  Witnesses who give evidence from locations outside the parliamentary precincts are asked to note that they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter.  Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by witnesses, outside of the proceedings held by the committee, of any matters arising from the proceedings.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against either a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way that could make him or her identifiable.  Parliamentary privilege is considered to apply to the utterances of members participating online in the committee meeting when their participation is from within the parliamentary precincts.  There can be no assurances in relation to participation online from outside the parliamentary precincts and members should be mindful of this when contributing.</p> <p>  I now call on Ms O'Brien to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. Frank Nyhan, chairperson of the board of RC&Eacute;; Pat Herbert who is director of regulation; and William Fitzgerald who is veterinary director.</p> <p>  I wish to begin by acknowledging the staff of RC&Eacute;, the approximately 6,000 trainers and owners across Ireland, and the wider greyhound community for their commitment and hard work during what has been a difficult period for the industry.  As with many sectors of society, the pandemic presented unprecedented economic and organisational challenges.  Income generated from gate admissions, tote operations, restaurant facilities and other areas were effectively decimated and like other sporting organisations across the country, RC&Eacute; greatly benefited from Government supports.  On behalf of the board and the wider greyhound racing community, I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s ongoing support for our industry.  These supports ensured that while tracks were closed to the public, racing still continued but more importantly, it ensured that RC&Eacute; was able to continue expanding the range of care and welfare initiatives it operates.</p> <p>  As a newly-appointed CEO, my focus and the focus of the board is for Ireland to rank number one globally in delivering best-in-class welfare programmes and care standards for racing greyhounds.  No healthy greyhound should have its life ended prematurely.  As the industry regulator, this requires acting upon solid data and responding with a zero-tolerance approach to breaches of welfare.  We also wish to restore commercial activities post Covid and in the medium term to develop a right-sized industry model for the sport that fits the country and delivers best value for our largest shareholder, the Irish taxpayer.</p></speech>

We also need to restore and rebuild the image and perception of greyhound racing in Ireland.  Armed with facts and the right welfare and care initiatives, we need to debunk much of the negative image and perceptions attached to the industry- some deserved and some misplaced.</p> <p>  As CEO, I want to impress upon committee members today that care and welfare remains the priority of the board and that RC&Eacute; and the greyhound industry are making significant strides forward in this area.  For example, 2021 marked the first year of operation of the R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann traceability system, RC&Eacute;TS, which ensures that the status of all racing greyhounds is available at any given time.</p> <p>  Under this new system, registered greyhounds are tracked through all stages of life including birth, microchipping, racing career, changes of ownership, location, export, retirement and end of life.  Owners, trainers and breeders are required to maintain an accurate record on the traceability system through direct notifications on the RC&Eacute;TS web portal and mobile app every 42 days.  This period of every 42 days is key.  Compliance is mandatory for every greyhound owner or trainer who wishes to enter any greyhound in their care in a race or a trial at an RC&Eacute; track.  No compliance means no racing with no exception.  Automated suspensions were introduced on 15 January this year.</p> <p>  In 2021, 23,760 greyhounds were subject to traceability on RC&Eacute;TS.  Of this figure, 18,538 greyhounds were active, which means a status of currently racing or trialling was assigned to them.  A total of 5,222 greyhounds were inactive, which means they have stopped racing or trialling activity in Ireland.  Of this 5,222 figure, RC&Eacute; can now report on and categorise the inactive greyhound by status of exported, rehomed, retained as pet and deceased.</p><p>The numbers of recorded deaths can also be further extrapolated to capture general cause of death.</p><p> The system allows for a proper and clear analysis based on facts, not assumptions, and gives RC&Eacute; proper data upon which it can enforce its recently expanded legislative powers.  The success of this system means that apart from cattle, racing greyhounds are now the most regulated and tracked animal on the island of Ireland.  That point is worth reiterating.  RC&Eacute;TS has led to an increase in directed and focused inspections.  In 2021, 1,221 welfare inspections were carried out, with 914 having been carried out to the end of April 2022.  A record 2,000 inspections are planned by the end of this year, which compares with 615 inspections in total in 2019.  These inspections are both random and targeted.  In 2021, ten welfare notices and 82 fixed penalties issued, with 62 fixed penalties having issued so far this year.  This compares with four fixed-penalty notices in 2020.  The second phase of the traceability system, which is in development, will add further functionality and reporting to the system, including a microchip-scanning project, the recording of injury data and the uploading of veterinary certificates.  While RC&Eacute; is authorised to regulate in the jurisdiction of Ireland only, it is our aim to build on the successful delivery of RC&Eacute;TS by using the valuable information collated together with regular information exchanges with our counterpart organisation in the UK, which is a significant destination market for Irish greyhounds.</p><p> The continued expansion of RC&Eacute;TS coincides with the development and further improvement of a range of other welfare and care programmes, including the greyhound care fund, which is dedicated to a variety of initiatives for the care and welfare of the greyhound.  The fund receives 50% of the proceeds from all current sponsorship obtained by RC&Eacute;, 10% of all admissions and restaurant packages and 5% of net tote income.  RC&Eacute; spends well in excess of the Government-stipulated 10% of the Horse and Greyhound Fund on welfare.  In 2022, we have budgeted to spend more than &euro; 3.6 million on welfare and traceability, up from &euro;2.2 million in 2019.</p><p> Greyhound Racing Ireland, GRI, operates a range of foster care initiatives supporting foster care homes, of which there are currently six, which care for 135 greyhounds as of May, and two new greyhound care centres, which are under negotiation following a tender process.  RC&Eacute; operates and funds the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust, IRGT, a registered charity that provides rehoming opportunities for greyhounds both domestically and internationally via direct placement and by providing financial assistance to private rehoming agencies.  In 2021, the IRGT rehomed 2,234 greyhounds, a 25% increase on 2020&rsquo;s rehoming figure of 1,775.  A total of 422 greyhounds were rehomed with the trust in the UK in 2021.  The IRGT has also recently made arrangements with reputable US rehoming agencies that will place a number of greyhounds from Ireland, namely, Greyhound Pets of America, Finding Loving Irish Greyhound Homes Together &amp;amp; Salukis, FLIGHTS, and Flying Irish Greyhounds, some of which have decided to pay 100% of the costs of transport.</p><p> Despite the great work of the IRGT, rehoming is becoming increasingly challenging, as all animal welfare agencies are finding.  This is in part due to the war in Ukraine and the return to work for millions of people throughout Europe post pandemic.  While greyhounds make for wonderful family pets, RC&Eacute; will continue to advocate and educate such that responsibility for the greyhound is, ultimately, with its owner, who must be prepared to care for the greyhound for the entirety of its life and beyond its racing career.  We plan to bring forward initiatives, both educationally and practically, that will reinforce this responsibility.</p><p> RC&Eacute; this year announced a significant expansion of existing supports for seriously injured greyhounds, including the serious injury scheme and the dental assistance scheme, and next week we will launch a new kennel improvement scheme providing financial assistance for the upgrading of kennels.  In late 2021, RC&Eacute; launched a new code of practice, approved by the Minister, that applies to any person who keeps, breeds, rears, trains, races, trades or transports a greyhound in Ireland.</p><p> The laboratory analysis of samples obtained from greyhounds is an integral part of integrity and welfare programs within RC&Eacute;.  I am delighted to report a marked decreasing trend in regard to adverse analytical findings reported over the six-year period to 2021.  In 2021, 4,859 samples were analysed by the Irish National Accreditation Board, INAB, with 13, or 0.27%, adverse analytical findings, down from 29 adverse analytical findings, or 0.54%, in 2017.  This indicates a well-regulated sport that takes its integrity responsibilities very seriously regarding doping and medication control through the implementation of a multifaceted approach to testing activity.</p><p> To assist RC&Eacute; in fulfilling its mandate as regulator of the racing greyhound sector, updated legislation has begun to be enacted.  RC&Eacute; urges that the current statutory instrument legislating that euthanasia of a greyhound must be carried out by a veterinary practitioner, which is currently before the Minister, be adopted as soon as possible and that amendments to regulations, as submitted by RC&Eacute; under the Greyhound Racing Act 2019, be amended accordingly.  We want to raise the greyhound racing industry to a new level whereby the culture of care and welfare is such that no healthy greyhound will have its life ended prematurely and with the correct legislative tools, we can do this.</p><p> Aside from further expanding our care and welfare schemes, RC&Eacute;&rsquo;s focus in 2022 is to get attendance levels back up at our tracks and to offer entertainment as a destination tourism attraction, as much as it is a place of pride for the local greyhound owner and enthusiast.  Work is under way on a new five-year strategic plan that will build on the significant developments under care and welfare, in addition to developing a racing model that is economically viable and scaled appropriately for the country and its population and that brings back the buzz.  We are delighted to announce that this year, the Irish Derby will once again be broadcast live on national TV from Shelbourne Park, returning the sport to its rightful place.</p><p> While the industry needs restructuring, it also needs investment in key capital projects such as Shelbourne Park, which is to greyhound racing what Croke Park is to the GAA.  The board of RC&Eacute; has unanimously affirmed its long-term intention to retain greyhound racing at this historic site and has committed to delivering capital improvements that will enhance the stadium and the track for the people.  Plans and designs for this state-of-the-art investment are under way, with works expected to commence in early 2023.</p><p> Why should investments such as this matter?  Apart from the sport&rsquo;s deep roots in communities throughout the country, greyhound racing is also a significant net contributor to the economy.  A report compiled by consultant economist Jim Power and published by RC&Eacute; in July 2021 shows that our industry made a net contribution to the economy of &euro;132.3 million in 2019 and supported 4,150 full-time and part-time jobs.  An additional 6,211 active greyhound owners derived economic benefit from the industry in 2019, the last full year of activity before the pandemic.  An investment of a further &euro;117.8 million was made by greyhound owners in 2019 in preparing and racing greyhounds.  This is significant expenditure, and much of it is injected into local economies and supports thousands of local jobs.  Wagering activity on greyhounds contributes to the overall betting levy collected by the Exchequer.  This levy was increased from 1% to 2% in 2019, resulting in a return to the Exchequer of &euro;95 million in that year.  Furthermore, an estimated &euro;8 million per year was raised at greyhound meetings for worthy causes prior to the pandemic.</p><p> In a post-Covid world, greyhound racing is seeking to re-establish itself as a significant vehicle for fundraising for sporting organisations such as GAA clubs and charitable causes.  As I previously indicated, our industry will continue to face difficult challenges as the country exits from the pandemic.  The ongoing challenge for RC&Eacute; is to continue the development of a commercial greyhound racing industry built on a consumer-focused and high-quality entertainment product that meets the highest possible international regulatory and welfare standards.  I look forward to working with the RC&Eacute; board and staff and the wider greyhound community to explore new opportunities for the development and growth of our industry.</p><p> I again thank the committee for affording RC&Eacute; the opportunity to address it.  My colleagues and I look forward to answering any questions members may have.  If additional information arising from the meeting is required, we will be happy to provide it as swiftly as we can.</p></speech>

We dealt a lot with greyhounds in the last committee.  I think the Chairman, who is absent at the moment, and I are the only two survivors from that committee.  There was much controversy at the time when we did the pre-legislative scrutiny of the 2019 Act.  There may have been a change in RC&Eacute; personnel, but the witnesses represent the same body.</p> <p>  I welcome the work they have done on the traceability system.  That was a major issue.  It reads as if it will do what it says on the tin and will help matters.  As a suckler farmer, I agree with the comparison.  The calves and cattle of Ireland are more accounted for and more easily traced than human beings.  If one can aspire to that standard, the goal is definitely being achieved.  Before the new traceability system, a number of greyhounds were untraceable in the system.  Will the witnesses give an update on those untraceable dogs that were discussed previously?  Where are they?  What progress has been made in overcoming the issue?</p> <p>  The witnesses stated that Greyhound Racing Ireland has six foster care homes and that two more are in the tender process.  Are many more places showing interest?  Certain individuals have contacted me to state that it is a prolonged, slow process and it takes a long time to get a premises through that tender.  More people might be willing to become foster care homes if the paraphernalia about being accepted were cut through a little quicker.  They seem to lose interest as time goes on.  Only two are being negotiated at the moment.  Will they be sufficient?  Are there many expressions of interest beyond those eight?</p> <p>  The witnesses stated they have made a submission to the Department or have been in contact with it about updating the 2019 legislation with regard to only a veterinary surgeon or officer being accepted as somebody who will euthanise a greyhound.  Where are they with that?  It is news to me.  If there are changes to legislation, we would imagine that we would be among the first to hear about it.  How long has that submission been in for?  Where is it with the Department?</p> <p>  On the commercial side, I am involved with the Kilbeggan race committee.  We have done much research since the pandemic and since things opened up.  It is not just us, but nationally.  There is a feeling that if we are to get people back to the extent that we want, we will have to provide open air facilities.  People tend to avoid large, crowded, enclosed areas, which includes most greyhound racing, especially for night racing.  The word on the racing circuit is to put up a marquee with a roof and no sides.  People are conscious of going into enclosed areas.  Have the witnesses found that?  Can they provide similar facilities?  Have they done research on that?  Do they feel they would need to go along those lines to encourage people to return or to facilitate the new needs of a population that is conscious of the pandemic we have gone through?</p></speech>

We are fortunate in that we have an upstairs, a downstairs and an open area.  It depends on the particular stadium, but we absolutely can facilitate entertainment in the open air.  We are finding that in general, attendances are starting to increase again.  We are starting to see group bookings and fundraising activity coming back too, as much as the regular punter.  Attendances are at 81,000 in the year to date, which is kind of where we wanted it to be.  We had budgeted for 70% of the 2019 level of attendance, with a budget of &euro;323,000 for the year.  Some 81,000 for the first half the year is not too bad.  We had budgeted to be open from 1 January, with 2022 being a full year of economic activity.  We lost the first four weeks because everything did not really reopen until the end of January.  We are mindful and conscious of it and attendances are on our radar, as is facilitating attendance as people require.</p> <p>  A statutory instrument has been drafted and is with the Minister.  We put a lot of work into it.  It may be the second time we have drafted it, since it may not have been done to the standard required at the time, but now it is at that standard.  It went to the Minister relatively recently.  We hope it will proceed.  These things can never happen quickly enough, as the Senator knows.</p> <p>  I ask our director of regulation to address the whereabouts and traceability of animals identified the last time.  I am happy to talk about 2021, for which we have all the figures.</p></speech>

The chairperson and I are the two surviving members of the last party that was before the committee in 2019.  My recollection from the last meeting is that the question of untraceable greyhounds centred around those that were exported rather than those domestically in Ireland.  The UK provides the most significant export market for Irish greyhounds.  The activity of greyhound breeding in the UK is limited in that 80% of greyhounds in the UK are of Irish origin.  The figure for last year was 85%.  There is very little breeding of greyhounds in the UK and it depends significantly on the Irish market.  I emphasise that it is the responsibility of Greyhound Racing Ireland to govern and regulate greyhound racing in Ireland.  These responsibilities do not extend to crossbreeds such as lurchers, which are commonly confused with greyhounds.  We only advocate for the export of greyhounds to those countries with equivalent welfare standards to this country, the UK and Europe.  We have gone on record to say that.  We do not advocate the export of greyhounds to countries with substandard welfare levels.</p> <p>  It is abundantly clear to us that we are unfortunately not in a position to restrict exports of any animals, including greyhounds, to countries.  We are obliged to operate under EU laws and worldwide trade agreements.  Neither Greyhound Racing Ireland nor any other Irish regulator can be held responsible for greyhounds exported to countries which have welfare standards, from where they are subsequently exported to other countries.  I advise the Senator that we are in constant and regular communication with our counterparts in the UK and Australia about these matters.  Matters relating to greyhounds in Australia have been brought to our attention.  We have investigated these matters here too.  Unfortunately, we are not in a position to restrict exports of greyhounds.  China was raised when we were last speaking.  There is no live trade of greyhounds from Ireland to China unless they go through the UK.  Our regulatory remit and controls under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act are confined to this jurisdiction.</p> <p>  The CEO mentioned the euthanasia Bill.  The Senator asked about care centres and foster care centres.  I defer to my colleague Mr. Fitzgerald on those matters.</p></speech>

It is similar to any tender process.  All the processes have to be gone through for the purposes of issuing a tender from a semi-State organisation.  Once the tender has been evaluated, a period of time has to be given afterwards to give tendering parties a chance to appeal.</p><p>Once that period has elapsed, the contracts can be exchanged.  It is quite a lengthy process.  It would be a lot easier if a lot of the additional material could be cut through, as the Senator put it, but unfortunately it is required.  I refer to stuff like tax clearance certificates and a lot of the additional paraphernalia that goes with that, which is all required.  I share the Senator's sentiment that it can take time and be quite slow but, unfortunately, most of these things are required.  That pretty much covers the care centres.  Senator Paul Daly asked whether eight is sufficient.  There is something of a line to be drawn.  We have foster care centres, which are centres that prepare dogs for their forever homes.  Many of these dogs will be rehomed abroad with credible rehoming charities.  Then there are the greyhound care centres.  We are currently in the process of confirming two of these.  These will essentially be for rehoming dogs here in Ireland.  There is a slight difference between the two types of centre.  As I have said, we are currently in the process of exchanging contracts with regard to the care centre tendered for towards the end of December, the closing date for that tender process having been at the end of January.</p></speech>

I am very serious now though.  We were here in 2019 and I will openly say that I thought the industry was on a cliff edge.  I was very fearful for where it was going to go.  I compliment Ms O'Brien and the board for what is after happening.  Major changes have been made, particularly with regard to traceability.  That element was a key issue.  The Chairman, Senator Paul Daly and other members spoke about the bovine issue and how bovines had a traceability system put in place since the foot and mouth crisis.  Literally within a few months, the same system was put in place here.  That gives confidence in the system and in the industry.  It has been the game changer.  I compliment the CEO and the board on their hard work in moving that forward.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses give us an indication of how the board is set financially at the moment and how they believe it will go?  Obviously, it has been under financial pressure with regard to sponsorship in particular.  Will they give us an indication of any sponsors coming on board and how we are funding our major events including the Laurels?  Will they also give us an indication of the interaction with the public?  Figures as to how things are going were mentioned.  An indication was also given that community groups, GAA clubs and sporting organisations are now again having sporting days and renting out the complex for race nights.  Where does the board see the figures going?  </p> <p>  Will the chairman comment on whether he believes the press has been fair to the industry over recent weeks, months and years with regard to the coverage of races?  In some local newspapers in particular, you do not see any coverage.  What work could be done in the short to medium term to ensure that local papers in particular pick up on major sporting events such as the Laurels in my part of the world?  Does he believe there is a gap there?  What message needs to be sent to get some support from the press on this issue?</p></speech>

I will take the last point, which was on press coverage, first.  Obviously, we suffered a fairly dramatic decline in popularity in 2019.  Some of this was deserved and some of it was not.  Thereafter, the decision as to how to progress was our own.  I believe we have done a relatively good job with regard to what we have done with the industry since.  I am not sure that is always reflected in the coverage we get but the press is entitled to cover what it wants to cover.  It is up to us to make a space for ourselves.  I was delighted that the chief executive was able to announce that we are back on the national airwaves for the derby semi-final and final.  That is a positive development.  There is a bit of a disconnect between the coverage locally and the coverage nationally.  There is still quite significant coverage of greyhound racing on local tracks in local newspapers and on local radio but there is not so much nationally.  That is probably reflective of a view that was taken of us.  I believe that will change but the onus is on us to change it.</p> <p>  I can probably take the Senator's question on finance as well.  Our accounts for the last full year will be published shortly and will show an operating surplus of &euro;3 million.  The budget for 2022 is &euro;1.3 million.   We are holding &euro;3.5 million from the Harold's Cross development money.  It was agreed at the time of that stadium closing that the balance of the money left over would be used for capital investment.  We intend to spend a large portion of that money on Shelbourne Park over the next 12 months.  On an operating level, we are operating on a surplus although obviously with the very significant assistance of state aid.</p></speech>

That compares with &euro;9.4 million in 2019, the first full year of operation.  That is the revised forecast.  We had originally budgeted to bring in &euro;7.5 million but we opened very late and that first month is a big chunk of a quarter so we do not think we will make up that difference although we can see it starting to come back towards the 70% of 2019 levels that we had planned for.<br/><br/>With regard to GAA groups, fundraisers and getting crowds back, it was wonderful to see the Con and Annie Kirby Memorial cup.  Some &euro;20,000 was donated to six local Limerick clubs.  We would like more of that.  We are starting to see GAA clubs around the country making bookings for local fundraisers.  We are still subject to some of the cancel culture.  When someone hears about it, we start to get a bit of negative press from organisations that are anti-greyhound racing.  The way to combat that is by continually improving welfare.  If we improve welfare and demonstrate that improvement, it will come back by default.  It is not about going out with a nice promotional campaign saying how wonderful we are.  The industry has to prove it.  That is our role as regulator.  It is our <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>.</p></speech>

This board recognised very early in 2019 that traceability was the only game in town and that it was absolutely essential to have a robust and accountable traceability system if the future of the industry was to be maintained.  This board has afforded every opportunity and every resource to the development of the traceability system that was launched last January.  The <i>modus operandi</i>of the traceability system is that, unless you engage with the system, you cannot be part of the racing industry.</p><p>The person does not get to race and is automatically suspended.  One is effectively removed.  By the way, one does not get prize money either.  All that is withheld.  That is on the clear direction from the board that this is where the industry has to go.</p><p> The Senator mentioned media information as well.  The board kept itself very much aware of what was happening with regard to certain individuals throughout the last number of years who committed, let us be honest, reprehensible acts.  I can advise the committee that 13 exclusion orders have been progressed by this board since 2018.  That is indicative of a commitment to maintaining the integrity of the industry and ensuring its longevity.</p></speech>

I echo what some of the previous speakers said.  I come to this as someone who is sceptical about the industry.  I have consistently raised issues about State funding, including to the equestrian industry.  I recognise that it is an industry, however.  I read the submission today.  It was clearly jumping off the pages that this is an organisation that had looked at itself, done a great deal of soul searching and confronted issues.  That was clear in the style and the language of the report.  I acknowledge that because it is very important.  Ms O'Brien is right that a lot of it hinges on welfare.  I recognise that it is an industry and a very profitable one.  I recognise the positive fallout in terms of fund-raising and community engagement with the GAA.  Who stands up here and talks negatively about the GAA?  The potential and the synergies are enormous in sport.</p><p>There is substantial State funding involved.  Every year the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine comes to both Houses of the Oireachtas and makes the case for it and every year we talk about whether we should divide this up, once and for all, and have two separate sources of funding.  Perhaps there are good reasons for it not to change, but the Minister has not necessarily ruled it out for the future.  That is something the witnesses need to keep an eye on.  However, we have the same debates and at the end of the day they are all really about the issue of welfare.  Ms O'Brien put her finger on it.</p><p>I refer to five key points contained in the written statement.  First, it states that no healthy greyhound should have its life ended prematurely.  That is a very positive statement.  That jumped off the page at me, because that is not what the perception always is.  I acknowledge that.  Greyhound Racing Ireland is going to restore and build the image and perception of greyhound racing in this country armed with facts and the right welfare and care initiatives.  Again, it is a very positive affirmation of its focus and intention, and that is important.  Under the new system for registering greyhounds it refers to them being tracked at all stages from birth, including microchipping, racing career and so forth.  That is really positive.  Then there are the welfare inspections.  Again, there is that recurring theme, and it is spot-on.  Greyhound Racing Ireland has clearly identified that this is where the concern is.  It is not always about the individuals in the organisation.  Not everything we read about the individuals in the organisation is correct; neither is everything one reads about politicians always correct.  I am conscious of that.  This morning's newspaper is used to wrap tonight's chips, but behind that it can leave many people wounded and damaged reputations.  That is a terrible thing to happen.</p><p>Perhaps the witnesses would discuss the greyhound care fund a little.  There is also the statutory obligation to ring-fence that at 10%.  Greyhound Racing Ireland has suggested it may go beyond that, which I am delighted to read and acknowledge.</p><p>Our guests referred to working on a five-year strategic plan.  That is very positive and significant.  Clearly, they must have an economic model because Greyhound Racing Ireland is a business enterprise.  However, I return to what I said from the start.  My major concern is about the welfare of animals and I recognise that Greyhound Racing Ireland is seeking to address that.  It is an important matter.  There is a lot of work to do and a lot of communication to be made to get that message across.</p><p>To return to the obligation relating to the State funding, what are the views of the witnesses?  Do they think it should be broken up and that there should be a disconnect between horse racing and Greyhound Racing Ireland or do they think Greyhound Racing Ireland would be clever to stay with the<i>status quo</i>and that it works out better for Greyhound Racing Ireland?  Do they have a comment or suggestion on that?  Those are just a few thoughts.  Perhaps the witnesses will respond to them.</p></speech>

No, we do not have a burning desire for that.  In terms of the use of State funds, I guess it comes down to whether it is a good use of State funds.  I believe it is.  I believe we should have more State funds when one looks at what it does in terms of welfare and where we are going.  We will spend &euro;3.6 million this year on welfare.  That is up from &euro;2.2 million in 2019.  We are the regulator for the industry so we must have the resources to regulate, do it properly, hold people accountable and have zero breaches of welfare.  We want to regulate and distribute a sport that is well run and that has the health and well-being of the greyhound at its heart.  That is the first thing.</p> <p>  Is it a good use of State funds?  Apart from the welfare, the money is used to run 14 stadia throughout the country which have their own little ecosystems and economies in and of themselves.  These stadia generated more than &euro;9 million in revenue in 2019.  They provide jobs and contribute &euro;132.3 million to the economy.  It is an extremely good return on investment to the Exchequer, notwithstanding the great work we are trying to do in raising welfare standards and distributing a sport that is our heritage.  It is as Irish as hurling and must be protected.</p> <p>  The separation from the fund is not foremost on our radar or on my mind.  It is more that the funding is there and that taxpayers can see that it is a very good use of their funds.  That is essential.</p> <p>  I hope I can remember the Senator's other points.</p></speech>

I will return to two issues.  One is independent oversight of the industry.  It is all very well Ms O'Brien telling us all that and that it is hunky-dory and very nice, but we have to give reassurance to the public.  I would like to have reassurance about the independent oversight of the industry, so it is validated independently and is not part of the old boys' network or any other network.  I am not suggesting it is, incidentally, but I want to get that reassurance.  We are here to ask a few questions so Ms O'Brien might talk about that.</p> <p>  The other thing is Harold's Cross stadium.  Ms O'Brien will recall it, although if it was before her time her colleagues will be able to recall it.  Many people were unhappy about that issue.  Am I right to say that there was some suggestion that there may be some funding in terms of a dividend to the community in Harold's Cross in respect of the sale of the stadium?  There was a great deal of concern in that community that it was losing something very significant, and about the reason it was losing it and the change there.  I thought that, and I am open to correction if I am wrong.  I am asking the question and I do not have the answer to the question I am asking, which is a rare thing in politics.  Was there any commitment to the community in Harold's Cross with regard to the result of the sale of the property in terms of a community dividend or feedback to that community, which had a long historical tie to the industry?</p></speech>

That may have arisen in the context of the next usage of the site, which was for Department of Education schools, rather than the vacating of the site by Bord na gCon as it was at that time.  Our commitment was to use the funds to discharge a very substantial debt we had at the time and to put the balance into refurbishment.  We have met or are meeting our commitments in respect of Harold's Cross.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  It is heartening to hear that the organisation is focusing on welfare.  It will come as no surprise to anyone that I am not a fan of greyhound racing.  I think the only way the industry will survive is by improving animal welfare standards.</p> <p>  The use of surgical artificial insemination is prevalent in the greyhound breeding industry and, unfortunately, now in companion dog breeding.  A reply to a parliamentary question shows that over 400 female greyhounds underwent surgical artificial insemination in the past three years.  We know that the procedure is banned in Britain.  Representatives of the Irish Veterinary Council have told this committee that they are looking at this very invasive procedure.  The first thing to consider before carrying out any procedure is the requirement not to harm any animal.  Does Greyhound Racing Ireland favour a ban on surgical artificial insemination?</p></speech>

In 2005, the then Irish Greyhound Board introduced specific regulations on the area of artificial insemination.  The practices that govern the procedure in this country are subject to the Artificial Insemination of Greyhounds Regulations, SI 561 of 2005.  Under these regulations, the board's remit chiefly concerns the issuing of licences on an annual basis on receipt of an appropriate recommendation from the Irish Coursing Club, ICC.  As members will be aware, the ICC is the registration body for all matings of stud dogs in this country.  The legislation covers how and where semen may be domestically managed or imported, whichever is the case, and how it may be collected and stored.  The legislation covers a raft of regulatory provisions under various headings.  It is important to note that while Greyhound Racing Ireland issues licences on an annual basis, it is the ICC that has specific statutory responsibility to maintain the records on the area of frozen semen implantation and artificial insemination.  Such work is not the remit of Greyhound Racing Ireland.</p> <p>  On the actual process of implantation, semen is implanted in a number of ways, for example using straws containing chilled fresh semen.  I defer to my veterinary colleague as he is abundantly more qualified to speak about the operation.</p></speech>

However, it holds a degree of benefit when canine bitches, including greyhounds, have particular difficulties in breeding naturally or using facilities like the transcervical method.  Surgical insemination has benefits from the point of greater yields of fertility.</p></speech>

The surgical insemination of greyhounds allows us to use semen from other countries, specifically Australia, where a greyhound is not standing here.  I take the point that the Senator has made about the specific dog but from the point of view of the overall health of the breed, in terms of promoting hybrid vigour, the procedure has its beneficial uses.</p></speech>

The UK has always depended on Ireland for the lion's share of its greyhounds and racing pools.  There is a British greyhound racing studbook but it is extremely small and the number of litters listed in it is very small.  Even before legislative changes took place in the UK to prohibit the surgical procedure the Senator has mentioned, the UK still depended on Ireland for its racing greyhounds.</p> <p>  My colleague has pointed out the industry advantages of artificial insemination.  Some years ago, Dr. Donagh Berry, who works with Teagasc and is probably one of the most advanced geneticists in this country, completed a report on the proclivity of inbreeding in the Irish greyhound.  A copy of his report is available on our website.  He found that the Irish racing greyhound has several positive attributes regarding the level of inbreeding, many of which would not be unrelated to the importation of semen along the lines of which we have spoken.</p></speech>

We spoke to our counterparts in Australia and the Greyhound Board of Great Britain.  We specifically spoke to people in the Irish Coursing Club about introducing an effective and robust recording and traceability system.  No different from the cattle movement monitoring system, we had to draw a line on the dataset that was to be included.  People have a certain level of expectation.  If one goes back too far, the likelihood of getting accurate updates on what happened to greyhounds may decrease as one goes further back.</p> <p>  To clarify, the dataset for the current traceability system that went live in January 2021 concerns all juveniles microchipped from 1 January 2021.  As members will be aware, the juveniles are microchipped by ICC stewards, who have the added benefit of being the operators of an authorised database under the microchipping regulations of 2016.  That database is called MicroDog.  RC&Eacute; receives a direct feed from the ICC on those.  It also includes the dataset of active greyhounds that are registered on the race management system, RMS.  The RMS is our software for recording activity around the areas of racing and trials.  The RMS basically records the form lines that one sees on a race card for every greyhound.  Every greyhound that was in a race or trial from 1 January 2021, in addition to every juvenile that was microchipped from January 2021, is included.</p></speech>

This significant increase is concerning.  At 154, the number of deaths is the highest to date.  Some of the injuries recorded are leg injuries.  The difference here is that horses can be treated.  What are the witnesses' views on this matter?  Are we capturing the deaths at trials, including unofficial trials?  Will the witnesses commit to having vets present at all meets, be it an official trial or an unofficial one?  There is a concern that animals are getting injured at unofficial trials in particular, given that they are younger, and there are no vets on site to treat them and address the welfare concerns involved in transferring animals off site.</p></speech>

She is correct about race injuries; I cannot disagree with her.  The increase was very concerning.  Were it to be repeated, it would ask serious questions of us as an industry.  Greyhound Racing Ireland has taken a number of steps, even since the turn of the year.  We have resurfaced a number of our tracks and engaged the services of a multinational institute called the Sports Turf Research Institute - it does a great deal of work in Australia and the UK on greyhound racing surfaces and horse racing surfaces and is an expert in examining moisture quantity, the camber of bends, etc. - to try to address the controllables.  This week, the Sports Turf Research Institute is visiting three tracks around the country, which are the first tranche of work that the institute is taking on with us.  From this point of view, we have taken measures to address last year's increase in injuries and deaths.</p> <p>  For the information of members, the numbers for 2022 had reduced considerably to the end of April.  Approximately 72 dogs were injured and 24 euthanised.  These figures are for race meetings.</p> <p>  I am looking at my notes, which I made because I wanted to catch all of the Senator's queries.  She asked about the presence of vets at official and unofficial trials and the gathering of data.  Since 1 November, all injury data have been captured on unofficial as well as official trials.  To segue into the Senator&rsquo;s final question somewhat, we do not have vets at all unofficial and official trials as matters stand.  To a degree, the quality of the data differs slightly between official and unofficial trials because the people gathering the data are not veterinary surgeons and, therefore, it is not within their purview to give diagnoses.  As such, the information is more at the bigger picture level.  We ask them to indicate whether the injury is to a forelimb or hindlimb, whether it is a hock injury and if it is a back injury.  We also have a category of &ldquo;Other&rdquo; if the person knows that the dog was hurt but does not know where.  As I mentioned, forming a diagnosis is not within these people&rsquo;s purview.</p> <p>  Regarding the presence of vets at trials, it is the case in the UK that they are present at official trials but they are not present at unofficial ones.  Having spoken to colleagues in Australia, the number of official trials there is small.  They largely refer to official trials as what we would classify as conduct trials.  What we would classify as official trials are not classified in the same way in Australia and vets there are not present at the vast majority of them.  The reason for this is that the information that both of those jurisdictions have gathered suggests that the risk of injury is far less at trials because there are fewer greyhounds, less potential for collision and less potential for injuries.</p> <p>  There is no disputing that some dogs get hurt, but it must be borne in mind that, in 2021, there were approximately 68,000 additional trials carried out on RCE tracks with just under 84,000 dogs.  RCE does not physically have the resources to cover that level of activity.  The Senator may be aware that trying to locate veterinary surgeons and veterinary labour has been tricky for some time.  This has not been the case for just the past six months.  Rather, it has been the case for the past ten years, and there is no sign of the situation changing in the immediate term.</p> <p>  In terms of making our resources stretch as far as they can, vets are present at races currently.  If the available resources were to change, I would argue strongly for addressing the issue, but they are not present elsewhere at this point in time.  Trying to make our resources stretch may be a bridge too far.</p></speech>

The Senator referred to the 154 deaths last year.  That was 154 deaths too many, as my colleague mentioned.  Like so many others, our industry is not perfect.  I wish it was, but it is not.  Speaking as the longest serving member of the organisation&rsquo;s executive, though, this board is committed fully to improving welfare standards within the industry.  I would like members to know that when they leave this room.</p> <p>  I will give some context to the 154 deaths.  There were 1,388 race meetings at 14 licensed stadiums, with over 15,500 races and more than 91,000 starters.  My colleague mentioned the 351 reported injuries.  They represented 0.38%.  The number of greyhounds put to sleep or fatally injured represented 0.17%.  That is still too much and we know that we need to improve.  My colleague has mentioned the steps that are already in play to improve the figures.</p> <p>  Since 1 November, staff at trial sessions, including our racing managers, are reporting injuries sustained there.  This information is recorded by an authorised staff member during unofficial and official trial sessions and reported to RCE.  During such track activity, the information recorded by the authorised staff includes the location of the stadium, the date of the injury, the owner or trainer of the animal, whether it is an official or unofficial trial session, the name of the greyhound, the prevailing weather conditions and whether people were provided with the contact details of the nearest veterinary clinic.  By the way, those contact details are available in all greyhound stadiums and access to emergency veterinary care facilities is made available in every weigh room.  Other information recorded includes the location of the injury, a brief description of the injury, whether the injury was witnessed and how it was reported.</p><p>I can advise the Senator that the people most affected by those injuries are GRI staff because they take such pride in the maintenance of their surfaces.   They have been trained extensively to maintain those surfaces.  They take huge issue when a greyhound breaks down on a track.  That is to their credit.  I also advise the Senator that in the past two years we have specifically introduced an injury recovery scheme, which has been expanded recently.  The scheme provides that up to &euro;1,000 in the cost of veterinary fees can be recovered for any greyhound that is injured at a race or trial session.  That is available to owners.  Last November, we launched a code of practice for the care of greyhounds, which was signed off by the Minister.  It contains general welfare principles, and covers responsible ownership, husbandry issues, hygiene, pest control, nutrition, healthcare and breeding.  I will not list them all.  The code that has been brought in contains a raft of provisions.  The code of practice is specifically referenced in the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.  It is the minimum care that is required in the industry.  </p><p> On the area of responsible ownership, as has been mentioned by the Chairman and Senator Boyhan, it is the responsibility of every owner in this country to think about retirement plans for greyhounds when they are finished racing.  We will assist in the process, but it is the owner's specific responsibility.  We are on the record as saying that people must start thinking about these things before they take ownership of a greyhound.  It is incumbent on them to do so.</p><p> On traceability, I can advise the Senator that there are specific plans in plans for phase two of the R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann traceability system, RC&Eacute;TS.  They will incorporate a raft of things, such as the uploading of euthanasia certificates for greyhounds.  We have mentioned the statutory instrument that is being progressed in the matter.  Phase 2 will also involve the recording of specific injury data at trials and races.  We also envisage the introduction of the uploading of health checks for greyhounds in advance of transportation.  Much of that will focus on the care side rather than the racing side.  There is a body of work to be done.  We have been driving the roll-out of the RC&Eacute;TS to meet the needs of the industry going forward.  Phase 1 is complete, but is an evolving animal.  It has to evolve to meet the needs of the industry.  We are committed to the recording element of the RC&Eacute;TS.</p></speech>

However, committees are encouraged to take a gradual approach to this change.  Members and witnesses have the option to attend meetings in the relevant committee room or online via Microsoft Teams.  All those attending the committee room should continue to wash their hands properly and often, avail of sanitisers, be respectful of other people's physical space and practise good respiratory etiquette.  If they have any Covid symptoms, no matter how mild, they should not attend in the committee meeting room.  Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.  As they are well aware, if members are participating remotely they are required to participate from within the Leinster House complex.  We have received no apologies, which is good.</p> <p>  Today we are discussing the proposed personal injuries resolution board Bill 2022.  The general scheme of the Bill was recently referred by the Minister of State with responsibility for trade, digital and company regulation, Deputy Troy, for pre-legislative scrutiny by this committee.  The Bill aims to amend the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Acts 2003 to 2019 to increase the number of personal injury claims settled through the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and to avoid the expense and time associated with litigation.</p> <p>  Due to the proposed expansion of the board's remit and new statutory functions to be conferred on it to resolve personal injury claims, the general scheme also provides for a change in the name to the personal injuries resolution board.  The committee previously heard from officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and today I am pleased we have the opportunity to consider the matter further with representatives from various organisations.  I welcome from the Alliance for Insurance Reform Mr. Peter Boland, director, and Ms Tracy Sheridan, the director and owner of Kidspace PlayCentre at Rathfarnham and Rathcoole.  From Insurance Ireland we welcome Ms Moyagh Murdock, chief executive officer; Mr. Florian Wimber, director of advocacy, communications and public affairs; Mr. Michael Curtin, manager of regulation and policy development; and Mr. Michael Horan, non-life insurance manager.</p> <p>  Before we start I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses in respect of references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of a person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  The opening statements have been circulated to members.  To commence our consideration of this matter, I invite Mr. Peter Boland to make opening remarks on behalf of the Alliance for Insurance Reform.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.194" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Boland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022052500002#A00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to make a statement in its scrutiny of the personal injuries resolution board Bill 2022.  The Alliance for Insurance Reform consists of 47 civic and business organisations from across Ireland, representing over 55,000 members, who in turn have 700,000 employees, 622,000 volunteers and 374,000 students.  Our single aim is to get insurance premiums down to affordable levels and keep them that way.  I do not propose to read the introduction to our presentation except to say that as recently as last month in a survey we conducted among members, 42% of respondents indicated that insurance costs are threatening the future of their organisation.  This figure is not materially different from the response to the same question from a survey we carried out in 2018.  In addition, 31% state that insurance costs are preventing them from providing certain services, and this view is particularly prevalent in the voluntary and community sector.  Overall, liability premiums on renewal have increased by 16% in the past 12 months.</p> <p>  The fact that 85% of the value of personal injury settlements in the liability sector are now made via litigation guarantees that the settlement of such claims is as expensive as possible, with obvious ongoing impact on the cost of insurance.  If we genuinely want to protect Irish businesses, voluntary and community groups, sports and cultural organisations and charities from the impact of unsustainable insurance costs, we must protect and develop PIAB so that it can settle more cases.  This is where the personal injuries resolution board Bill 2022 comes in.  We warmly welcome the intent of this Bill, even if it does not go far enough in terms of enabling PIAB to adjudicate on claims.</p> <p>  With regard to the specifics of the proposals in the Bill, head 4 regards the supply of personal public service numbers, and it is on page 6 of the general scheme.  We welcome the requirement for claimants to provide their PPS number to verify their identity and the proposal that failing to supply a PPS number will now be an offence.  However, we note there is no sanction for this offence.  We ask that an appropriate sanction be added to make this requirement meaningful.</p> <p>  Head 6 regards the wishes of the respondent to enter mediation.  Subject to some caveats, which I will outline in a moment, the alliance welcomes the provision of mediation into the PIAB process but our view is that it would be of most benefit if it could be introduced at any stage in the process.</p><p>This head seeks to give respondents one opportunity to consent to mediation at the start of the process.  We ask that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, be allowed to re-propose mediation to both parties later in the assessment, and particularly following assessment being rejected by either party.  Additionally, we suggest that either party should be allowed to propose mediation at any stage as long as this does not serve to delay the overall process.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the alliance for insurance reform welcomes the provision of mediation into the PIAB process, subject to several concerns.  We welcome the commitment in the explanatory note to head 8 that mediation will not affect the timeline for assessments of a claim in cases where the statutory time frame applies.  However, there is no mention of delivery costs of mediation.  It must be crystal clear that mediation at PIAB cannot attract legal fees or other delivery costs, as this would fundamentally undermine its mission, particularly in the present situation, where there is no cap on fees for mediation.  Furthermore, in order for mediation to be effective, it is essential that the plaintiff is present at all times, even where plaintiffs choose to use the services of a solicitor.<br/><br/>Head 9 deals with the power of the board to make procedural rules for mediation.  As per our comments on head 6, we ask that PIAB and both parties be allowed to propose mediation at any stage in the assessment process and particularly following assessment, if the assessment is being rejected by either party.<br/><br/>Finally, with regard to mediation, we propose that if either party refuses to engage in mediation when it is proposed, such refusal should be factored into decisions on costs in any subsequent judgement by the courts.<br/><br/>We welcome the broadening of PIAB's responsibilities through the amendment of section 17 of the principal Act. Given the experience and expertise PIAB has developed in the 18 years since its establishment, it is now the most appropriate forum for the determination of a broader range of personal injury claims.  In particular, it is the view of the alliance that it is well within PIAB's capability at this stage to assess psychological injuries and more complex claims, given that insurers' assessors frequently assess such complex claims, and insurers and claimants' lawyers settle accordingly.<br/><br/>Head 17 deals with section 50.  Section 50 of the principal Act pauses the Statute of Limitations for claims before the board until six months following the issuing of an authorisation by PIAB.  That six-month pause was a temporary measure to allay early concerns about the PIAB process being a barrier to the constitutional right of access to the courts.  However, that issue has long been addressed and this pause must now be removed, as it merely serves to delay the process.<br/><br/>Head 24 deals with the functions of the board.  The alliance welcomes the formal addition of functions regarding the publication of data and research on personal injuries and related areas.  It is essential for reasons of public policy, competition, health and safety and fraud prevention that details of all personal injury claims in the State be recorded, analysed and published.  The alliance calls on the Department to initiate the transfer of Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s claims data-sharing platform, InsuranceLink, into the ownership of PIAB, where it can be developed by the board in the interests of the common good and accessed by all parties with a valid fraud prevention or detection function.  <br/><br/>The European Commission Directorate-General for Competition, having issued a preliminary assessment last year which found that Insurance Ireland restricted access to InsuranceLink, thereby restricting competition in the Irish motor vehicle insurance market, has published proposals by Insurance Ireland concerning access to InsuranceLink which involve Insurance Ireland retaining ultimate ownership of the database.  We strongly believe that InsuranceLink should be taken from Insurance Ireland and made completely independent.  PIAB is the natural repository for this data, given its founding legislation, its role in the Irish personal injury sector and its experience and expertise in this area.  For this and all databases, data protection considerations must be honoured but not allowed to impede the provision of data where the data serves the common good, promotes safety or prevents and detects criminality.<br/><br/>Finally, with regard to head 24, we welcome the proactive approach proposed for promoting the board and its work.  PIAB must continue to make clear to plaintiffs and respondents alike the benefits of settling via the board and the potential consequences of non-engagement or rejection of an assessment by the board.<br/><br/>On head 27 on the disclosure of information regarding offences, we welcome the formalisation of a mechanism for reporting suspected fraud to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br/><br/>It is a common experience among our members that the case presented to court varies in material details from the case that was presented to PIAB, which undermines the assessments of the board.  In addition to the content of the draft legislation we are scrutinising today, the service provided by PIAB would be greatly enhanced if court cases were to commence with the exhibition of the PIAB claim.  This would verify that, by and large, the same claim is being made in court.  If it is not, then the claim should be sent back to PIAB.<br/><br/>The alliance believes that reform of PIAB will be a missed opportunity if it does not consider the development of PIAB into a quasi-judicial body, along the lines of the Workplace Relations Commission, Residential Tenancies Board or An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  While the right of access to the courts must be protected, PIAB now has the experience and expertise necessary to facilitate it in adjudicating on personal injury claims.  In addition, the recent adoption of judicial guidelines on damages for personal injuries means that many more cases may be directed towards the District Courts, which will present a capacity problem.  PIAB is well-placed to adjudicate on such claims, therefore talking pressure off the courts.  <br/><br/>We note the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Zalewski <i>v</i>. the Workplace Relations Commission, Ireland and the Attorney General, and welcome the clarity this ruling would provide in considering the establishment of PIAB as a quasi-judicial body.<br/><br/>We propose that a mechanism be inserted into the Act that allows for periodic reviews of the new legislation in order to allow for the consideration of additional reforms and to counter any unforeseen challenges to the operation of PIAB in the future.  Such a review mechanism is already built into the founding legislation of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.  I have provided section 6 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act but I do not intend to read it out in full detail.<br/><br/>In conclusion, businesses, voluntary and community groups, sports and cultural organisations and charities need insurance to be affordable now and into the future as a matter of urgency.  While we warmly welcome this draft legislation, we urge this committee to do everything in its power to make sure the legislation is amended, approved and commenced in its entirety immediately to facilitate this.  Of all the major challenges facing Ireland right now, of which there are many, insurance is the one that Government can fix quickest but reforms are not moving fast enough.  It is clear that neither the economy nor the fabric of society will fully recover from the Covid-19 pandemic unless insurance is sorted.  Government has a golden opportunity to make the cost of insurance affordable now and forever, but only if it gets meaningful reforms, such as this legislation, into place now before the opportunity is lost.  This concludes our formal presentation and we will be happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

I am the chief executive of Insurance Ireland and I am joined today by my colleagues, Mr. Florian Wimber, director of advocacy, communications and public affairs, and Mr. Michael Curtin and Mr. Michael Horan, managers from the regulation and policy development section.</p> <p>  Insurance Ireland is the representative body of the Irish insurance industry, with more than 133 members providing cover to over 25 million customers globally in more than 110 countries.  Irish insurers invest nearly &euro;490 billion annually.  Our members employ approximately 35,000 people in Ireland and contribute &euro;1.6 billion in tax income per year to the economy.  Ireland is the fifth largest market for insurance in the EU and the biggest exporter of insurance services.</p> <p>  The proposal to reform the Personal Injuries Assessment Board with this Bill is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s agenda for insurance reform.  Insurance Ireland and our members strongly support the objectives of the Bill.  It would be remiss of me not to re-emphasis the fact that our member companies recognise the value and the work of PIAB in providing for swifter settlement of personal injury claims and its impact on reducing legal costs since its inception in 2004.</p> <p>  The last time Ireland introduced such major reform, with the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, was in 2004.  Insurers responded positively and consumers benefitted.  We have continually advocated for the strengthening of the powers of PIAB as a means of reducing the legal costs involved in claims settlement.  The benefit to consumers of strengthening these powers is that claimants would receive their compensation more quickly and unnecessary litigation would be avoided, thus saving on legal costs.</p><p> If the Bill is enacted, the extended mandate will allow PIAB to settle more personal injuries claims more effectively and efficiently, avoiding costly and lengthy litigation.  This will lead to a more stable insurance market to the benefit of consumers, businesses and insurers alike.  As my colleague has already communicated, the cost of insurance and the duration of litigation procedures present a fundamental threat to consumers and businesses.  In its most recent motor report on the national claims information database, the Central Bank of Ireland reported that in 2020 the legal costs associated with settling personal injury claims through litigation were &euro;16,064, compared with costs of &euro;841 through PIAB.  That is almost 20 times more.  The Central Bank further noted that litigation has a very limited effect on the compensation of the claimant.  Therefore, extending the mandate of PIAB to enable it to resolve more claims should result in significantly reduced legal costs and, consequently, reduced cost of claims.  In addition, the Central Bank&rsquo;s report found that an average settlement through PIAB takes approximately 2.3 years, and is often much quicker, compared with 4.2 years for a settlement through the courts and litigation.  Insurers have consistently said that consumers will benefit from quicker assessments and swifter payment of their compensation through PIAB and that doing so will avoid the lengthy legal process.</p><p> On the specific provisions in the general scheme, we note that parties will be asked to consent to mediation and, if mutually agreeable, it is envisaged that PIAB will facilitate mediation via a mediation officer appointed by it.  More complex injury claims will be dealt with by PIAB, including wholly psychological injuries, which are currently released by PIAB to be settled in the courts.  Traditionally, PIAB has not assessed these claims because there was no categorisation in the old book of quantum.  The new personal injuries guidelines make provision for the assessment of injuries of a psychological nature.  This increases the number of personal injury claims that can be resolved through PIAB, by including these types of claims not previously assessed by it.  PIAB currently has a maximum statutory timeframe of 15 months within which to assess any claim.  Claims that involve more complex injuries or injuries with a potential long-term prognosis that cannot be settled within the 15-month timeframe are released by PIAB to be pursued through litigation.  The general scheme proposes an extension of up to two years beyond the current maximum period of 15 months.  This would allow for increased resolution of these types of claims within PIAB, which would again greatly reduce the time and cost of settling complex claims.</p><p> The reform of PIAB is an essential element of the-whole-of-government approach to the progress of the action plan for insurance reform.  It will improve the effectiveness and efficiency of claims processing, claims assessment and settlement processes and will reduce the need for costly and lengthy litigation.  The proposed Bill will improve the Irish insurance market environment to the benefit of consumers, businesses and insurers.  We welcome the Cabinet&rsquo;s recent agreement on a proposal to amend the duty of care and occupiers&rsquo; liability in Ireland.  Together with this proposed Bill and the already implemented personal injuries guidelines, this rebalancing of the duty of care will contribute to a consistent and comprehensive suite of reforms to the Irish insurance market.</p><p> Insurance Ireland welcomes the proposed reforms in this proposed Bill and the changes the renamed and refocused personal injuries resolution board will bring to the Irish insurance sector.  I thank the committee for this opportunity to present our position and I look forward to answering any questions members may have.</p></speech>

My first question arises out of the contents of Ms Murdock's opening statement.  When I read it, I noticed there was something missing, namely, any mention of premiums or a reduction in premiums.  Ms Murdock spoke of savings in legal costs and so on but there is no reference to these being passed on to customers.  She says there will be a benefit to consumers and of course there will be if the claims process is quicker.  There is nothing like the stress of a court case or a legal procedure hanging over you.  Does Ms Murdock see this proposed Bill as being an effective way of reducing premiums?  Is it simply about making things quicker or more efficient, or will those savings be passed on?  It is not in the submission but does Ms Murdock see that happening?</p></speech>

We are talking about taking the cost of insurance out of the process, which will have a big impact on the premiums that businesses and consumers currently pay.  I can also point to what has happened in the last 12 to 18 months and even going back to when motor premiums reached their peak in 2017.  In the past 12 months, those premiums have come down by 12%.  Since the peak in 2017, they have come down 30%.  While I acknowledge my colleague's survey of his members within the Alliance for Insurance Reform, the one bright spot in the monthly reporting from the CSO is that the cost of insurance is continuing to decline.  The CSO does not report on employers' liability and public liability, ELPL, and property insurance because it is a complex portfolio.  However, I know from reports from my members in this market that they have not seen any significant increase and nothing in line with the actual inflationary pressures that are on businesses in terms of materials and labour.  We can also point to the fact that the ELPL market has been loss-making over the past number of years.  We are only now in a position where we are starting to break even.  It is important that this market is attractive in order to bring in more insurers.  It must be a viable business for the sake of the consumers and the policyholders themselves and so as to attract insurers into the Irish market.  As it stands, we all know it is very difficult to bring new players in.  This proposed Bill, together with the revised guidelines and the news that the change in the duty of care is imminent, will certainly address the drivers of the cost of insurance in employers' liability, public liability and property insurance.  I assure the committee that we have seen clear evidence of reducing prices up to this point in time.</p></speech>

I was looking at parliamentary question data from December 2021 showing profits within the insurance industry.  For 2019, the operating profit or loss as a percentage of total income for employer's liability, public liability and commercial property insurance was 3%.  Does Ms Murdock know what that figure was in monetary terms?  Percentages do not give the full picture.  Does she have a money amount for the profits in 2020 and 2021?</p></speech>

I will ask my colleague to comment on this in a minute.  That 3% profit comes after a period of making significant losses.  It is an aggregated figure where losses were in excess of 20% for certain years.  The problem is that a number of major players left the market and that figure, which is also based on the Central Bank's data, excludes the failed insurers that went out of the market.  It is a very nominal return on investment, especially for people at group board level looking to reinvest in a market where there is only a return of 3%.  There was an operating loss of 3% from 2015 to 2019.  We started to see a return to profitability in 2020 and that was not just-----</p></speech>

That is why we are here.  It is critical in getting Ireland to the same situation as other European nations and economies, where insurance is not an existential issue.  I have cited several examples recently where representative bodies that are members of the alliance have met their European counterparts, and have been met with disbelief - and, in some cases, laughter - at the thought that insurance is the issue that it is in Ireland.  Our role is to look at the cost of insurance in the near future.  I will be honest and say that three or four years ago I would not have fancied the job of selling Ireland as a destination for liability insurers.  It was a very difficult market.  Many of the difficulties have now been resolved or are in the process of being resolved.  That is reflected in the price of motor insurance, which is dropping at a steady rate.  It is not dropping dramatically, but steadily.  The price of liability insurance, which is subject to the same conditions, is not dropping.  As far as we can see, the critical difference between the two is a lack of competition on the liability insurance side.  The Government has accepted that, and has established the office to promote competition in the insurance market within the Department of Finance.  The office was established in December 2020, but it has not resulted in any positive news yet.  However, we expect that with all of the good stuff that is happening at the moment, this being a key part of it, it will have to be reflected in the price of liability insurance.  As matters stand, we are due reductions, because reductions are happening in motor insurance.  They are not being passed on by the incumbents, so we need additional competition.</p></speech>

I am a massive fan of mediation.  It works when it works.  One cannot just say that it will only work today but will not work tomorrow.  I am thinking about amendments that could be made to make this legislation more effective.  I would be interested in hearing Ms Murdock's views on mediation.  When mediation works, it can work really well.  All parties walk away from it happy out.  Of course, when it does not work, there are other options.  Does Ms Murdock have a view on mediation being available - not offered every ten minutes - right throughout the process?  Sometimes people get into the process, think they want to have a row and then find out that perhaps it might be preferable to reach an agreement.  I ask Ms Murdock for her views on that.</p></speech>

Looking at the numbers, between 12% and 15% of claims are currently settled through PIAB, with a significant number going on to court.  Some 10% of claims are settled immediately after PIAB hearings.  Obviously, some sort of mediation goes on there.  Some 60% of claims are settled through litigation before court.  If we can make a big dent in that, it will take a significant amount of legal costs out of the process, which will be to the benefit to the consumer and to businesses.</p></speech>

I do think there is any guarantee of that, but let us hope it proves to be the case.  I put the following question to Mr. Boland or Ms Sheridan, who will have very practical experience of the issue.  Where policies or premiums were suspended or significantly reduced during the lockdown period, when the high-level restrictions were in place, or however one wants to put it, was it done easily and willingly?  Were conditions attached?  If so, what were the conditions like?  What was the impact on businesses of any conditions that were attached?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.217" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tracy Sheridan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022052500002#D01400"><p>During Covid, when we were first closed, it was a bit of a fight to get insurance paused.  We did eventually, after many meetings, begging and pleading.  A three-month refund at the end was the best-case scenario for most businesses, but we had to pay the whole way through.  Many businesses did not manage because insurance premiums are astronomical.  The premiums are huge, and have been since 2017.  I am heartened to learn that motor insurance premiums have come down in price, but the cost of personal liability and employer liability insurance most certainly has not.  It has gone up by 16% since the judicial guidelines have come in.  I have no idea why that is.  It is not only that.  Even if the premium does not go up, there are increases by stealth because particular activities are not covered or the excess goes up, without any claim being made.  There are many ways in which premiums need to come down, more than just the headline cost.  We certainly need to see that happening very quickly.  This Bill can really contribute to that.  The big issue is that, ultimately, the current system is unfair to businesses.  The costs that insurance is accruing for businesses cannot be sustained.  Ultimately, that is down to the legal fees.  Those fees have to be taken out of it, however it happens.  It must happen quickly.  This Bill is great work, but change has to happen fast, because businesses are closing one after another.  We are all hanging on by our fingernails and we need help.</p></speech>

I ask her to comment on the 16% increase in premiums since the judicial guidelines were introduced.  That worries me.</p></speech>

However, specific cases may have claims pending or may involve past claims.  Generally speaking, what we are seeing is a flat level of premiums.  We look forward to the next national claims information database, NCID, report on employer liability and personal liability insurance. According to the last NCID report, 93% of policies were under the &euro;5,000 mark and 85% are under the &euro;2,500 mark.  We have not heard that there has been a general increase of 16%, but I know that the Alliance for Insurance Reform has carried out its own survey with its members.  On the whole, we would say that the increase of 16% is not indicative of what is happening on the market itself.  We fully accept that insurance is a major challenge for everybody, but that is for the reasons we have already outlined.  This proposed Bill and the legislation relating to duty of care will have a major impact and will attract other players into the market.  That is what we all want.</p></speech>

Does Ms Murdock think that inflation is going to have an impact on insurance premiums?  If so, what does she think the potential impact is going to be?  I am not asking Ms Murdock to comment on future prices.  Will there be an impact because of the high inflation levels?</p></speech>

Undoubtedly, construction costs are hitting everybody.  We are seeing significant challenges in getting labour, whether it is for the hotel sector, the leisure industry or festivals.  The actual impact on general commodities and resources is having a major impact.  It is unquestionable that it feeds into everything that we do.  Insurance has to cover the risk.  If these costs go up, policyholders must ensure that they are properly insured.  I cannot comment on rates.</p></speech>

Just because the guidelines are in place does not mean that they will be in place forever.  PIAB has been very strong in terms of passing on the benefits of the new guidelines and its average assessment on general damages is down by 47% currently.  However, a number of challenges remain.  The first is that it will ultimately depend on the view of the courts as to whether these new judicial guidelines stand or not.  As a result, it is incumbent on the Department of Justice, in as much as it can, to get cases into the High Court as quickly as possible in order that we can get some certainty.  In the meantime, a series of challenges to the judicial guidelines - constitutional and otherwise - are being put by individual plaintiffs and their legal representatives.  We are very concerned about those challenges because significant resources from certain sections of the legal profession are being thrown at the judicial guidelines.  We do not want them derailed because they are one of the most significant reforms to have happened in respect of the cost of insurance area for many years.</p></speech>

I hope that is true because, as we heard from Ms Sheridan and other business owners across the country, insurance costs are a major challenge.  Having said that, the insurance industry also said that businesses would benefit from the introduction of personal injury guidelines.  At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, the then CEO of Zurich stated that the cost of public liability insurance would fall by 20% if the guidelines were put in place.  He also said that if the cost did not fall, serious questions would need to be asked.  As Ms Murdock is aware, it is now one year since the guidelines were introduced.  The number of public liability claims has fallen by more 20% in recent years according to the PIAB.  The awards being made have fallen by more than 40% since the introduction of the guidelines a year ago.  I accept, as has been alluded to, that there are court challenges to the guidelines that have yet to be decided.  There has been a considerable reduction in the number of claimants accepting PIAB assessments.  This represents considerable progress on the situation from a number of years ago.  However, businesses have not seen any benefit from the progress at all in terms of their costs for public liability insurance.  In Ms Murdock's opinion, why is that the case and does she expect to see the cost of public liability insurance for businesses decreasing in the coming months?</p></speech>

Insurers are still committed to passing on the savings.  Indeed, they have been passing on the savings since the inception of the new guidelines.  What we are concerned about is the length of time it is taking for these cases to come through.  While the award levels have been reduced, as Senator Crowe correctly said, the acceptance levels have dropped significantly and we are down now from 50% to 37%.  Insurers have built in the benefit of those perceived savings in the current rates of insurance.  What we want to see is the other elements of the reform agenda come in to help that.  I will not go into the exact details but I have been given information and am concerned about three cases in particular that have come through the new guidelines at Circuit Court level, where the offers that PIAB made were rejected.  One was in the south west of Ireland, where PIAB had made an offer of approximately &euro;14,000 between general compensation and special costs</p></speech>

That case went before a judge and no additional information was provided in terms of medical reports or an additional rationale as to why the offer was rejected or why the claimant was arguing for a higher award.  In that case, the outcome was that almost &euro;80,000 was awarded to the claimant, which was more than four times the original offer made by PIAB which, in itself was a generous offer compared with the old book of quantum.  The case is being appealed but it was very concerning that there was no rationale given for the deviation from the new guidelines.</p> <p>  Two other cases that have been heard are equally concerning.  In each, the PIAB offers were rejected and the claims went before the court.  The court awarded significantly more - three times more - than was originally offered, with no additional information or rationale given for the deviation.  I am concerned that they have come through the system when we know there is a big backlog of old cases under the old book of quantum.  The sooner we get the other elements of the reform agenda put in place, the sooner we can put these to bed.  Then we will see certainty come back into the market and we will see the new guidelines reaffirmed by the courts.  That is really important.  The cases will be appealed and we need to see the awards by PIAB being reaffirmed by the Judiciary.</p></speech>

Mr. Boland referred to the need to ensure that there are more competitors in the market.  That is something SMEs across the country have raised with me.  Often SMEs can only get one opinion on private liability insurance.  Obviously, that is not acceptable and it allows underwriters to adopt a like-it-or-lump-it approach.  We all want to see change and Mr. Boland highlighted the need to ensure that the new judicial guidelines are protected and that key reforms, beyond those guidelines, are speeded up.  Are there any steps he feels would enhance Ireland's attractiveness as a market for underwriters to enter?</p></speech>

The market is already more attractive as a result of the implementation of the judicial guidelines, the establishment of the Garda insurance fraud co-ordination office and the commencement of the Perjury Act.  We now have the legislation we are discussing today, which is a very important part of the jigsaw, as well as the proposals from the Department of Justice on duty of care.  Ireland is very rapidly becoming a more attractive market from a liability perspective and it is just a matter of getting the additional competition in on the back of that now.</p></speech>

Our job is to conduct pre-legislative scrutiny on the general scheme.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I did not hear any specific recommendations from anyone on changes to the proposed Bill that we ought to be considering.  I ask our guests to indicate what changes they think we should consider.</p> <p>  The bigger issue that concerns us all is that the significant changes that have come through legislation do not seem to be reflected in insurance premiums yet.  What is so different about motor insurance in comparison with the other types?  Motor insurance, according to CSO data, is down by 37% since 2016 and by 12% in the past 12 months alone.  We are definitely getting traction in the motor sector from the changes that are coming through.  What makes employers' liability and public liability so dramatically different?  While I accept there is difficulty in comparing and getting a standard case, do the insurance industry, the Central Bank, the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council, NCPC, or any other body have an index of what is happening that is broadly accepted?  We have the industry stating that there is no change in premiums and businesses indicating that they are up by 15%.</p><p>They cannot both be right.  I thought a lot of the effort of the Central Bank and the National Competitiveness Council was to move to some sort of a baseline but we seem to be still arguing about the numbers, and then the defence is always anecdotal, such as a business that has had an awful experience or a court case in which a judge charged three times the award.  That does not help public policy.  Can we find common ground where we could at least discuss this with shared statistics that everyone agrees with, rather than the anecdotal stuff that makes it difficult for us to disentangle what needs to be done?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.246" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Boland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022052500002#F00600"><p>We support the broad thrust of the legislation.  We would like there to be a sanction for not suppling a personal public service, PPS, number.  The role of mediation should be broadened through the process, not just looking for agreement on mediation at the start of the process.  Section 50, which delays the pursuit of litigation for six months after a PIAB assessment, should be dropped from the legislation.  InsuranceLink should be moved under the control of PIAB.  These are elements that are not in the current draft legislation.  If a claim goes from PIAB to litigation and is materially different when it gets to court, it should be sent back to PIAB for reassessment.  A periodic review clause should be built into the legislation using the same model as the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.  Ultimately, it would be a lost opportunity if PIAB does not evolve into a quasi-judicial body that is able to adjudicate on cases.  That is it in a nutshell from our perspective.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's other question, I will obviously defend our figures because they are quite comprehensive.  We had over 900 respondents in the past two months in that survey so we are very confident of them.  The difference may be in the different sectors.  In the Central Bank's national claims information database, NCID, which provides very comprehensive data on liability and motor, the issue when it comes to liability is a sectoral issue.  In the only liability report that has been published by the NCID so far there is a major contrast in terms of the changes between 2009 and 2019, which is the period looked at in the first report.  For example, in that 11-year period, the premium for manufacturing increased by 61%; arts, entertainment and recreation increased by 105%; wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motor cycles increased by 21%.  The big reduction, somewhat ironically, was in financial and insurance activities, which saw their average insurance premium drop by 69%.</p> <p>  Essentially, what seems to be happening is that if you are based in an office and are static, you will have seen your liability premium drop quite dramatically over a ten-year period, a five-year period, and the past three years.  If you are in what is regarded as a risky sector, whether that is hospitality and tourism, leisure, manufacturing or the vast majority of voluntary, community or sporting sectors, you are looking at increases.</p></speech>

Can we get to the bottom of what makes Ireland a difficult market in which those in the industry say they are being crucified?</p></speech>

I do not disagree with what my colleague, Mr. Boland, has put forward as additional changes but I will be frank and more pragmatic by saying half a loaf is better than no bread at all.  Expediency is key to getting this Bill passed without too many further complications that may cause it take longer to get through the Oireachtas process.  If the spirit of what Mr. Boland is proposing can be incorporated, we would not be adverse to them at all.  We contributed to the consultation and very much got our inputs into it.</p> <p>  In terms of the difference between liability and motor, over the past three years and 12 months in particular, we have seen the economy roar ahead.  The premiums paid by businesses are a factor of footfall, turnover, and the actual business they do.  That has had an impact on the premiums consumers are paying, but on the rate itself, we are not seeing the increases that we have seen in some headlines.  Certainly, there are a number of individual cases that have had some difficulties and we have read the news and individual hotels have complained about the change in their premium from year to year.  That can often be down to the fact that there are pending claims and past claims.  The Bill before us, the duty of care and the Occupiers' Liability Act are key to addressing the situations that have an adverse effect on the premiums that businesses pay.  I will ask my colleague to comment on the differences.  There are a couple of other factors that make a pronounced difference to the two experiences.</p></speech>

The liability market is a very challenging market and has been for some years.  It is reflected in some of the problems that are out there.  Having said that, when we talk about agricultural shows and festivals and so on, there are many events around the country that operate with insurance and there are some that have problems getting insurance.</p> <p>  We have a situation in Ireland where we have had a relatively generous system of compensation over many years.  The judicial guidelines are trying to tackle that.  The personal injuries resolution board Bill is another building block to try to address the whole situation.  The objective of all these efforts is to attract more players into the market and increase capacity.  That is something we support as a representative association.  Insurers need to be comfortable about the risks they take on.  They want to take on as many risks as they can.  As the national claims information database report shows, the liability market has made some players uncomfortable about some of the risks relating to liability in particular. </p></speech>

I just have a few questions.  On page 5 of Mr. Boland's presentation there are two graphs that indicate the portion of injury claimants who settled through each settlement channel from 2015 to 2019.  The percentage of claimants who chose litigation is quite high compared to the percentage who took the PIAB route, which is quite low.  From the other graph on page 4, it looks as though it would benefit plaintiffs to take the PIAB route.  They seem to get higher payouts and it is faster.  In Mr. Boland's view, why are people choosing to the litigation route rather than the PIAB route?  Is there any guarantee that this legislation would reverse matters?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.252" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Boland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022052500002#G00100"><p>It is a very good question.  I will use the table on page 4 to explain exactly why litigation is so popular.  It reproduces table 26 from the first national claims information database, NCID, liability report.  The data the Central Bank, through its NCID unit, has provided over the past number of years has been exceptional in casting a bright light over this area.  It leaves very little room for vagueness or fake news, to use an oft-used expression recently.</p> <p>  Insurance Ireland and Ms Murdock have given versions of these figures.  There are many different ways the numbers can be pulled out of both the motor insurance reports from the NCID and this liability report but they all show the same thing.  The set of figures we chose to highlight here shows injury settlement costs by the cumulative settlement band.  Essentially, in the band on the left-hand side of the table, we have been very generous in calling minor injuries any that are up to &euro;150,000, which covers all of the minor injuries and probably a few more.  In the same table, across from the row showing the awards costing less than &euro;150,000, the Deputy will see the direct settlements, which do not constitute a huge number of the settlements in this area.  The table then moves to the PIAB figures.  Through PIAB, the average compensation payout for awards under &euro;150,000 is &euro;26,760.  If somebody rejects that assessment and goes to litigation, they actually drop to an average of &euro;25,088.  Therefore, the plaintiff is down by about &euro;1,500 by going to litigation and, what is more, they are waiting an average of 2.7 years extra to get that assessment and compensation.  In terms of natural justice, it is an appalling route to take because people are getting less and it is taking longer.</p> <p>  However, the average legal fees applicable to a PIAB settlement are &euro;1,705 and the average legal fees applicable to a litigated settlement are &euro;18,680, which is an increase by a factor of 11.  That is the reason so many cases go to litigation.  There is no benefit, by and large, for plaintiffs to take a straightforward minor personal injury into litigation but, as a rule, they go to litigation because there is another pot of gold at the end of that particular rainbow.</p></speech>

Are they being advised, in Mr. Boland&rsquo;s view, to go down the litigation route?  Will this legislation before us do anything to change that?  What more can be done to encourage people to stick with PIAB?</p></speech>

First, the mediation allows this kind of data to be explained to plaintiffs so they are not just getting their information from one side of the argument.  Second, there is an allowance in the draft legislation for PIAB to be able to promote itself more publicly and more effectively, and we would be very much in favour of that.  If it was just down to numbers, PIAB would handle and settle every claim.</p></speech>

It is probably human nature that people feel that in having a solicitor on the job, they will do better.  There is a perception that PIAB is a low-award entity whereas the real picture is that it is a low-cost process and a low-cost body but the awards coming out are every bit as fair and representative of the inconvenience and the injury caused.  It is very important, as Mr. Boland said, that we raise awareness of the benefit of going the PIAB route.  It is also worth pointing out that insurers themselves have an acceptance rate of in excess of 96%, so they very much support the process.  What we need to do is try to get the message across to the complainants that they will do every bit as well or better than they would in going through the court system because they can get their lives back on track much quicker and they will be compensated.  In the current climate of rising inflation, a bird in the hand is worth ten in the bush, so we are very supportive of those elements of the new Bill.</p></speech>

I would not share Ms Murdock's desire to have this rushed through; we need to try to do as much as we can on this legislation.  It is interesting that personal injuries litigation has become a targeted profit centre for many legal entities, and that is a fact.  It also assumes that the ability of the insurer to pay is unlimited because, ultimately, insurance companies just pass on the cost.  Ms Murdock's interest in seeing reform now has more to do with companies potentially falling over because of insurance costs.  I wonder about the amount of robust pushback Insurance Ireland has been putting on the Law Society for years.  I have a concern about the level of escape from PIAB.  I brought this up at the committee previously with regard to the attachment of post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, and all of that.</p><p>Ms Murdock referenced a couple of court cases and said judges are not taking account of the judicial guidelines.  That message needs to be hammered home by her organisation.  It is not enough to come in here to the committee and say it.  Insurance Ireland should be going out publicly and saying that it is unacceptable what is going on.</p><p>With regard to Mr. Boland&rsquo;s submission, I ask him to comment on a couple of points.  I am very involved with small and micro businesses and he touched on a lot of pinch points or nerves, to be honest.  Businesses are looking for change and they are looking for this legislation to deliver.  With regard to the NCID report, Mr. Boland's submission at page 4 states:</p> <blockquote> 	The only beneficiaries of this extended process are lawyers, who get an average of &euro;18,680 in fees, 11 times more than the cost of delivering compensation through PIAB.  Insurers pay those fees and charge the cost on to policyholders, even in circumstances where the policyholder is adamant the claim is fraudulent or exaggerated. </blockquote> <p>We all have experience of that.  I again ask Ms Murdock what the members of Insurance Ireland are doing to try to challenge that situation in the courts.  We all know that when it gets to the courts, the costs skyrocket.  Mr. Boland might talk about that graph again so we absolutely understand why so few of these claims should be exiting the PIAB system in the first instance.</p><p>Second, on page 9 of the submission, he states that the alliance proposes legislation, including a mechanism to periodically review the legislation.  Does he mean the legislation we are scrutinising now or all of the PIAB legislation?</p><p>With regard to Insurance Link, Mr. Boland states that it should be taken off Insurance Ireland and made completely independent.  That is a prerequisite we should look for.  It is my understanding that, over the years, it has been very difficult to attract insurance companies to this country because the level of data on insurance payout has not been available and people cannot make a sound business judgement as to whether it is a good or bad market to enter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.258" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Boland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022052500002#G00700"><p>I will take the questions in order.  In terms of settlements, this needs to be understood because there was almost a myth that developed over the years that insurers picked up the tab for all of these claims.  Insurers do not pick up the tab.  They are businesses and they need to make a profit, and that is fair enough.  They take whatever the cost is and they pass it on to policyholders.  For every claim, right and wrong, the cost of that claim is passed on to policyholders.</p> <p>  It is important to note that if someone has been injured due to the negligence of somebody else, they must be compensated adequately in that situation.  I do not think anyone would undermine that and it is the heart of the process, but the issue is the costs those sorts of claims attract.</p><p>It is quite starkly illustrated by table 26.  Essentially, anything that goes beyond PIAB is not about delivering additional compensation.  There is a strong role for the courts in far more difficult, complex or major injuries.  The figures change when one gets to the &euro;500 million mark.  Certainly, however, PIAB is very well suited to dealing with the vast majority of claims, such as the everyday minor injuries.</p><p> I would make an additional comment on this area, to which I referred in the text that we read out.  We find that insurers will settle as a commercial expedient.  If they have a file on their desk on which there is a total reserve of, for example, &euro;75,000, and if they feel that they can get away in negotiations with &euro;50,000 all-in, they will settle, regardless of the right or wrong of the case.  This is infuriating from the perspectives of our members.  They seek cases that have gone to PIAB and on into litigation where they know that it is a try-on, that it is fraudulent in a broader sense or that it is exaggerated.  In our view, we get no protection in many cases from insurers in that area.  It is all the more important now that they do not do that anymore, because seeking to do that would fundamentally undermine the judicial guidelines.  If a narrative emerges that one can take a case from PIAB, go into litigation and get a few bob extra by dealing directly with the insurer, that will undermine the work of this House on the judicial guidelines, which remain a fundamental reform to the sector.</p><p> I will address the other issues that the Deputy raised.  In terms of periodic scrutiny, to be pragmatic about it and to echo what Ms Murdock said about the need to move this on, we would suggest that if we were to review it, we should review the current legislation on it.  It might become too complex if we were to draw the principal legislation into it as well.  </p><p> On the Deputy&rsquo;s third point, which was on InsuranceLink, the story stands for itself.  The preliminary view of the European Commission is that it was used as an anti-competitive tool.  We would like to see it owned by an arm of the State for the common good and in the interests of the citizens of the State. </p></speech>

Critical to running an insurance business is having a database that outlines the historical claims that have been made by an individual.  That allows an insurer to price a risk much more accurately.  If you do not have the data, then you are just picking a number without having the claims history of the individual available to you.</p> <p>  Needless to say, this is an ongoing assessment of the situation by the by the Directorate-General for Competition, DG COMP, at the European Commission.  I therefore need to be careful, but I will quote what they found in their preliminary assessment last year.  They found that Insurance Ireland restricted access to InsuranceLink, which is that claims database they own and operate on behalf of their members.  According to DG COMP, they thereby &ldquo;restrict[ed] competition in the Irish motor vehicle insurance market&rdquo;.  That was the preliminary finding.  </p> <p>  Proposals have been made to Insurance Ireland and have been circulated by the European Commission.  They ultimately proposed that the database would remain in the ownership of Insurance Ireland.  Given the history of the database, and given the way that the European Commission has found that it has been used, we have serious concerns about it remaining in the ownership of Insurance Ireland, regardless of the safeguards that they would put into place.  They have listed a series of safeguards which, they claim, would make it essentially independent.  Yet, it would essentially remain in the ownership of Insurance Ireland.  We have a concern about that. </p></speech>

There are therefore huge issues.  We are looking at the proposal under head 24, that the alliance calls on the Department to initiate the transfer of Insurance Ireland&rsquo;s claim status sharing platform InsuranceLink into the ownership of PIAB or PIRB.

PIAB has been exceptional in the way that it has transformed the personal injury claims landscape, although it has it has been fundamentally undermined over the years by various challenges.  As policyholders, we very much trust PIAB to be able to provide the data, subject to data protection restrictions to anyone who is entitled to the data.  When I say anyone who is entitled to it, I refer to people who would have to have a genuine interest in it.  Needless to say, that includes all insurers, if they are quoting in the market, as well as other bodies, such as the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland and self-insured entities of which there are many operating in this country.</p></speech>

Ireland not only has a domestic market, where there are challenges in assuming insurance, and Mr. Boland has referred to that.  We also have a strong exporting market.</p><p>Under the European Single Market insurance services are provided from Ireland under the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services to other EU countries and to approximately 110 countries globally.  This market is consequently bigger due to the number of potential customers in it and that places Ireland as an international hub for insurance.</p><p> With specific reference to the second point on making Ireland the biggest exporter of insurance, according to data from the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, the head organisation of all supervisors in Europe, Ireland exports approximately &euro;30 billion in premiums and is, by that, the biggest provider outside its own jurisdiction compared to the other markets, if that answers the question.  The data only cover life and non-life insurance, not reinsurance.</p></speech>

I certainly agree with that and it is a move I would like to happen.  He referred to the Supreme Court decision in Zalewski <i>v</i>. the Workplace Relations Commission.  My understanding from research and knowledge is that there is some uncertainty about whether the Supreme Court would rule similarly for PIAB to become a quasi-judicial body.  A case brought before the Supreme Court as a personal injuries claim involves broader legal considerations that have been determined by the courts over time rather than the statutory employment law issues that come before the WRC.  I share the eagerness of the Alliance for Insurance Reform for PIAB to become a quasi-judicial body, as it could have a substantial impact, but that causes some concern.  Can Mr. Boland advise to what extent the alliance has considered this?  Has it received legal guidance or what are his thoughts on that?</p></speech>

Certainly, it looks as if the implications of the Zalewski case have yet to fully work themselves through.  We would be very keen to see PIAB or the PIRB as a quasi-judicial body, but if it is the view of the Attorney General and the Government that this type of model has an amount of uncertainty over it, then the pragmatic view to take is that we move ahead with the legislation as it is, with the proposed model, and then look back when the quasi-judicial option has been clarified further.</p></speech>

I refer to Ms Sheridan and, perhaps, Ms Murdock.  It is very frustrating for businesses, and being from Galway I am familiar with those in Galway city.  It is very repetitive in a sense, and Ms Sheridan mentioned it earlier, that the costs of general insurance are just not going down.  Not only are they very significant costs, but they are also putting businesses to the wall.  That is very worrying.  What hope can she give businesses this morning whereby she believes that the premiums should and will come down over time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.286" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tracy Sheridan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022052500002#J00600"><p>I can point to the historical performance.  Motor insurance is coming down significantly.  I believe employers' liability, EL, and public liability, PL, are not going up to the extent that has been reported in general.  One of the concerns that not just insurers but also businesses have is the wait-and-see approach being adopted by a certain cohort of solicitors.  That is very damaging and there is a contagion effect there too.  We want those cases expedited through to appeal.  However, we see the Bill before us, whereby PIAB can hear more cases automatically, as a big game changer.  Regarding the duty of care in the Occupiers' Liability Act, it calls out the issue with absolute liability and that is being addressed, whereby there is more personal responsibility being placed on the users of services and it is not just down to the occupier or the policyholder.  That will be a real reassurance to businesses.  It will also reassure new entrants from an insurance perspective coming into the market that it will have a significant impact.</p> <p>  If we look back to the last real change that PIAB went through in 2004, insurers responded very positively.  That is where we would say we are committed to passing on the savings from these legislative changes.  There is nothing to suggest they will not do that.  It is in their interest to keep viable policyholders and viable businesses going.  Quite often they have continued to insure certain sectors at a loss, as the figures from the Central Bank have demonstrated.  It has been subsidised by investment income.  Packages or portfolios by insurers are made up of a number of products - liability, motor and other types of property insurance.  That has sustained those entities.  However, we have seen too many exits from the market and that is what we want to prevent here.  If we can get certainty and consistency back into the market, it will become a much more stable environment for insurers to enter, while businesses will get certainty as well.</p> <p>  In sectors where there are activity sports or adventure parks and where people can expect to have a bump or trip or fall, one should not have to expect that somebody will land a claim because there is absolute liability on the occupier or the policyholder.  That is just ridiculous and it is out of sync with the other European jurisdictions against which we are benchmarking ourselves.  As my colleague, Mr. Boland, said, they laugh when they see what is going on here.  We must make it a more normal operating environment for both businesses and insurers to enter.</p></speech>

What I refer to is possibly anecdotal but a large American-backed insurer came into the market here a number of years ago.  It operated here for five to six years and then left with its tail between its legs.  One of the issues that was raised at the time was that it did not have access to data beyond three years and that ultimately some of its original business planning was flawed strategically because of that.  Do they wish to make any comment on that?  Again, it relates to the access to data and who holds the data.  Perhaps they might address that first.</p></speech>

However, what all insurers, both potential new entrants and existing players, want in a market is certainty and stability.  Those years we referred to were probably the most volatile, with a race to the bottom and significant losses made.  A lot of lessons were learned at that time.</p></speech>

Insurers would not have had that during the period the Deputy mentioned.  A significant effort goes into it.  The Central Bank also has powers to expand the data required within that database.  That is part of the miscellaneous insurance Bill that is going through as well.</p></speech>

I am under pressure for time and I thank Ms Murdock for answering that.  I have a question about the issue that was highlighted in the submission by Mr. Boland, which is well known within insurance circles.  It is where a claim is being brought and the insured person contacts the insurance company basically stating that it is a fraudulent claim for a plethora of reasons, for which there might be some evidence.</p><p>The insurance company decides, because it thinks the matter might end up in the courts, to arrive at a settlement and the insured party loses his or her no claims bonus.  Such people end up giving that money back to the insurance company over the subsequent three to five years in increased costs.  Has Insurance Ireland done a cost-benefit analysis on the basis that if it does not challenge those types of claims or the Law Society of Ireland or legal eagles who propose them, it is simply perpetuating that practice?  Has it examined such claims and decided to pick out 20, 30 or 40 of them and go hard at them to seek an order of attachment against the legal representatives who have brought those cases?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.293" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Moyagh Murdock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2022052500002#K00200"><p>One of the first problems is there is little prospect of recovering those legal costs in the cases that fail at court and that are clearly identified as fraudulent and are thrown out.  The experience is that insurers never recover that money.  Therefore, there is no deterrent there and many of these solicitors operate on a no foal, no fee basis.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s report indicates the legal costs are 40% of the total cost of a claim before it arrives in court and for those settled at court, the legal costs are 104% of the award size.  It is good economics to do an assessment and calculate that in fighting a case all the way to court the insurer would lose or else if it wins, it will not recover its legal costs in any event.  It is a balance.  The insurers are committed to adhering to the new guidelines and have been doing so since their introduction last year.  It is something we have listened to and there is a commitment to fight these cases.  The new centralised Garda national fraud unit has been set up.  Insurers have their special investigations units.  They are fighting fraud on all fronts and that is delivering results.  We see news headlines where cases have been prosecuted successfully in court, involving not only complainants but solicitors and medical professionals.  That will continue but it is a very costly process to go all the way to court.  The overall interest is to settle cases that are genuine as expediently as possible and to try to identify those that are not and present the Garda with the relevant information that it can follow through with a prosecution.</p></speech>

I acknowledge there is a separation of powers between the Legislature and the Judiciary but this practice, which has been going on for years, is getting worse.  A load of people are ambulance chasing.  There is no fallout for a solicitor in bringing a case on a no foal, no fee basis.  As Ms Murdock said, insurers cannot recover the costs.  Some fraudulent cases have been brought to court.  They are known to be fraudulent and are a try-on in the courts.  Why is Ms Murdock's representative group not approaching the Law Society of Ireland or the Department of Justice to state we need a change in legislation to target this activity and to stamp it out because it is an ongoing scourge and it is costing small businesses in particular.  I know many small enterprises whose insurance costs will put them out of business.  Some of them are on the cusp of operating while they seek new business without insurance and that is a terrible position for people to be put in.  I hear what Ms Murdock is saying but it seems this is a nut that has not been cracked for a decade and longer and it has got worse.  We are now possibly even worse that the United States, which was held up for years as being the litigation capital of the world.  We are certainly right up there with it.  In fairness, it is not enough for Insurance Ireland to come in as a representative body to highlight that these are problems, it cannot recover its costs and all the rest of it.  Why is Insurance Ireland not going after the legal people who are bringing those cases?  It should put some legal onus and liability on them for bringing cases that are known to be fraudulent.  Those legal people bring them, get the plaintiff in a case to sign off on it and then say they have to test these cases in court.  That should not be done.</p></speech>

Also the ease of being able to blame someone else for a minor issue needs to be removed.  Personal responsibility needs to be taken, the Civil Liability Act and the Occupiers' Liability Act should be changed and the incentive removed.  Quite often, it is like lottery numbers with respect to compensation being paid out and they have nothing to lose.  The practice of taking cases on a no foal, no fee basis is too big of an incentive for claimants.  We have a responsibility to fight those cases and prosecute them but it is a full agenda that we need to pursue as a collective.  I hear what the Deputy is saying and I will take it on board.</p></speech>

I argued the real reason the pharmaceutical industry opposed the waiver was because it was unwilling to give up intellectual property rights in order that it could continue to make as much profit as possible.  In doing so, I also queried whether Mr. O&rsquo;Connor in expressing that view was using a "racist trope".

They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and leave at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending.  They should always maintain an appropriate social distance during and after the meeting.  Masks, preferably of a medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking.  I ask for full co-operation in this regard.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence by witnesses who are physically present or by those who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege.  The witnesses are giving evidence remotely from outside the parliamentary precincts and, as such, may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate if he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  Today the committee will discuss the Public Service Performance Report 2021, which was published last week.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the officials attending on behalf of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform: Mr. John Kinnane, acting assistant secretary; Mr. Ed Hearne, principal officer; and Ms Caroline O'Loughlin, assistant principal.  I ask Ms O'Loughlin to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

The first report was published in 2017.  The Public Service Performance Report 2021 is the sixth edition.</p> <p>  As recommended in the committee's final report on the framework for parliamentary engagement throughout the course of the budgetary cycle, financial performance should be assessed through the principles of performance budgeting, focusing on what is being delivered with resources and how this aligns with the programme for Government and departmental statements of strategy.</p> <p>  The purpose of the performance report is to increase transparency and accountability and ensure every citizen can see clearly how public funds are being utilised.  The information is deliberately presented in a clear and accessible way to ensure that everyone, not just those with financial expertise, can fully understand how public money is being used.  The report builds on the existing elements of the performance-based budgeting initiative and creates a space in the budget process for performance dialogue.  While performance information is provided alongside financial information in the Revised Estimates Volume, REV, in December, outturn information for the current year cannot be provided due to the timing of REV publication.  This means committees may not have the relevant information to allow them to assess performance for the most recent year in a timely fashion.  The performance report addresses this by providing timely quantitative information on what was delivered with public funds in the previous year.  This creates an opportunity for meaningful dialogue between Ministers and the relevant sectoral committees on Government performance.  The information provided in the report will assist the relevant sectoral committees in tracking progress on the outputs and outcomes of key Government strategies.</p> <p>  The committee's final report on the framework for parliamentary engagement proposes that sectoral committees meet to consider the chapters of the performance report relevant to their areas of oversight.  The performance report is designed to support such an enhanced focus on performance and delivery by committees.  Relevant performance indicators are presented in a dedicated, focused document in an accessible manner.  This approach seeks to enable sectoral committees to make best use of the time available for reviewing performance and achievement by Departments and agencies.  The performance report is just one element of a suite of measures to increase evidence-based decision-making, such as the spending review process, the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service network and the public spending code.</p> <p>  Updates on equality budgeting and green budgeting, which are both integrated into the performance budgeting framework, are also included in the report.  The equality budgeting pilot was implemented in 2018.  It brings a new focus to performance budgeting, considering equality dimensions such as gender, socio-economic inequality, disability and minority groups.  Following a Government decision in 2021 to accelerate the implementation of performance budgeting, all Departments now participate in equality budgeting and report equality metrics in both the REV and the performance report.  An interdepartmental group has been established to drive this important work across all areas of government.  This work is overseen by an equality budgeting expert advisory group, which comprises key stakeholders and relevant experts.</p> <p>  In 2019, Ireland joined the OECD Paris Collaborative on Green Budgeting and committed to the progressive implementation of reforms to the budgetary process to better embed climate and environmental goals within it.</p><p>With the advent of the ambitious climate targets in the programme for Government commitments and their incorporation into legislation via the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, this need grows ever more pressing.  An update on this work is also included.</p><p> An ambitious work plan for performance budgeting policy is in place for the coming year.  It aims to continue the momentum achieved to date and further advance this work.</p><p> In 2019, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform successfully applied for funding to develop our performance budgeting framework and systems under the EU structural reforms support programme.  The project incorporates all elements of performance budgeting, such as equality, green, sustainable development goals, SDG, and well-being budgeting, in line with the programme for Government commitment to develop a national well-being framework.  The project is now entering the final phase and focuses on key priorities, such as improving the ICT framework for performance budgeting and increasing tagging of expenditure.  A number of peer-to-peer study missions have also taken place to facilitate information exchange and allow Irish budget officials to learn from best international practice.</p><p> The performance budgeting framework is kept under constant review to ensure it best serves the purpose of increasing transparency and accountability.  Feedback from stakeholders is an essential part of this and we particularly value feedback from the committee as a cornerstone of that.</p><p> It is clear from the committee&rsquo;s final report that the performance report is a source of information that can be further utilised by the sectoral committees in their engagement with Ministers and their Departments.  Such engagement would, in principle, allow the sectoral committees to consider, with the relevant line Departments, any issues regarding performance against targets, with the specific indicators selected for inclusion in the report.  </p><p> The recommendations contained in the committee&rsquo;s final report were quite thoughtful in this regard.  I thank the committee for including this document on its agenda and I look forward to hearing its feedback.  The engagement with the committee on the overall format of the report and its positioning within the budgetary cycle is very important to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as we continue our work in enhancing the overall performance budgeting framework and the performance report in particular.</p></speech>

In the short few minutes I have, I will focus on a few points, in particular, the establishment of the well-being framework.  The idea is to move away from measuring only key economic indicators and instead take into account a wide range of other areas, including physical and mental health, skills, income, wealth and biodiversity.  It seeks to ensure that factors that are important to people in their everyday life and quality of life are also considered as part of budgeting.</p> <p>  Ms O&rsquo;Loughlin said that there was some engagement on this and we know that a public consultation has taken place.  The various indicators that will be measured have not been defined at this stage.  Will the witnesses indicate what the measurements will be and what kind of back-and-forth discussions have taken place with the different Departments?  Will the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform take a lead role on the matter?  I appreciate that the Department of the Taoiseach is leading on this but this is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's report.  Rather than leaving it to the various Departments to outline what they are doing, will the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform set down for these Departments what the indicators are for measuring the well-being framework and how it will be brought about?</p></speech>

The initial report set out the well-being dimensions that we will use for Ireland.  A range of 42 indicators are available on the Central Statistics Office, CSO, dashboard.  With regard to our work with the line Departments - this ties into the comments made by Ms O&rsquo;Loughlin - within the overall performance budgeting framework we need to see how we can utilise the well-being framework so that there will be policies within particular Departments that will impact on a particular dimension of well-being.  The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Department of Education and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage may all have policies that are impacting on a particular dimension of the well-being framework and may have the ability to move the indicators through the performance budgeting framework project.</p> <p>  What we are seeking to do in the project in which we are involved is to create better linkages across the performance budgeting framework, so that as policies are being developed in particular Departments, those linkages between the Departments are clear and it is also clear how they are improving well-being.  We have been involved in looking at certain Departments and trying to map out their policies to see how they fit with the well-being dimensions and with the various indicators.  The idea would be that over time, as we develop the performance report and also the performance metrics in the Revised Estimates Volume, we would be able to match those with the dimensions and indicators in the national framework.</p></speech>

Mr. Kinnane mentioned the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  I imagine every Department will be measured across all of the indicators because they are all dealing with the public and the community.  Is it a question of measuring everybody using one set of indicators?  Has the Department defined what those indicators will be?  For example, as regards the greening measures, the Department has not set out all of the various measuring points for those and they have been in the report for two years now.  Will the roll-out of the well-being framework be as slow?  I hope it will not be as slow and it will be more prominent in the report from this year onwards?  I cannot see any reason for holding back on the framework.  I ask that the Department start reporting on it sooner rather than later?  Can Mr. Kinnane give an indication of the timeframe for rolling it out?  I would prefer to see the well-being framework moving faster than the greening measures?  It is a measure of how the Government is performing in delivering for the public.  It is not all about economics.  We want to ensure that quality of life and other factors that are important will also be measured in the report as soon as possible.  When will we see indicators on the well-being framework being presented in the report?  Will the same measurements be used across all Departments?</p></speech>

Within the national economic dialogue, which we organise with the Department of Finance, we will seek to have a session that specifically addresses the well-being framework and how it can be utilised within the budgetary process.  Then, as we move forward-----</p></speech>

I just selected Departments.  The Department of Rural and Community Development could have policy areas and, equally, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has policies and both Departments work together.</p></speech>

Surely every Department would be measured against those parameters.  I do not know that they act specifically in those instances but Departments influence people in those areas.  It is not so much a measure of the Departments but a measure of how they get on with the public and the communities they serve.</p></speech>

The framework was developed over a number of years.  That country initially utilised the framework.  As budgetary proposals came in from departments, it utilised the well-being framework to scrutinise the proposals to see how they impacted on the various dimensions of well-being.</p> <p>  As we look towards the next budget, we are working within our Department to see whether there is a way that we can apply certain dimensions of well-being.  Initially, on a pilot basis, we would assess whether we can map decisions across so decisions that impact on a number of Departments across the shared dimensions of well-being.</p> <p>  To get to a stage that we are in a position to produce a public service performance report that reports against the various dimensions of well-being, a lot of work needs to be done, from an IT perspective, to have a system where we can tag each expenditure line and each of the indicators within the performance report against the various dimensions of well-being.  That is a huge job of work that will have to be done on an incremental basis.  We will have to start on a pilot basis with certain dimensions and Departments and then roll that out so that, over time, we will get to a situation where we report against the well-being dimensions.</p></speech>

Mr. Kinnane mentioned the New Zealand living standards framework and gender budgeting in Iceland.</p> <p>  The SRSP project is now in its second phase.  We are engaging pilot Departments now to conduct a tagging exercise to see how expenditure can be tagged against different dimensions. </p></speech>

On page 16, the report states that 49% of the target has been delivered in respect of people in receipt of intensive home care packages, the number of hours from these packages is at 68% delivery and the number of short-stay beds in public long-stay units is almost 67% of delivery.  How can 93% of a budget be spent on the delivery of these key performance indicators that range between 49% to 68% delivery?  If 100% of these indicators were delivered then what overspend would we be faced with and why?</p></speech>

The purpose of the performance report is to capture information to ensure we have the right information when the sectoral committees meet Departments.

We started out with the kind of material that is in this year's report and last year's report.  The plan is to progressively build on them over the next number of years.  The principal step forward that we made in that over the past year was to look at each capital programme that went into the national development plan.</p><p>We assessed that across seven climate-related criteria, such as air quality, climate mitigation and water quality.  Just transition was also one of those considerations.  We have a detailed report on that, which we can share with the committee.  Over time, as we mentioned, the tagging process that will be relevant to the well-being framework and to equality budgeting, will also be relevant to green budgeting.  We expect there to be a specific focus on just transition.  The degree to which an expenditure programme contributes to just transition will certainly be part of that process as well.</p></speech>

When we talk about the whole area of public sector reform and sectoral performance reports, one of the things that is close to my heart is equality in terms of disability budgeting.  The reporting on that was introduced in 2018.  Are the witnesses satisfied that the allocated expenditure is being spent within the Votes?  Is it making an impact and how is that measured or do they just accept the reports that come from the Departments in that area?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.349" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline O'Loughlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022052500002#D00500"><p>In this instance, the performance report would try to capture the metrics that represent that work, in the body of the report in the performance metrics but also specifically under equality budgeting.  We have done a lot of work in the past with the Department of Health to improve the metrics that represent disability spending and I know they have greatly improved over the past number of years.  There are specific metrics under the equality budgeting heading that address disability.  With equality budgeting, it is not a matter of trying to clock up metrics and thinking the job is done.  We are trying to demonstrate to the Departments that if they add an extra lens to performance budgeting to target specific cohorts of society, public expenditure will be much more effective.  That is what we are trying to demonstrate to the Departments.  We have done a lot of work with the Department of Health to improve metrics.  The metrics in the body of the report from the Department of Health on equality are quite good and, as I mentioned, equality is reflected in a number of the equality budgeting metrics specifically.</p></speech>

Are there any lessons the Department of Transport or the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications should be picking up from the equality budgeting to see if we can have better and more accurate reporting?  We are now putting a lot of money into retrofitting and budgeting for that type of thing.  Are we seeing that money filter down to where it is needed?  Do the witnesses have an insight into the areas that could be improved in the reporting so that we get a more accurate account of the effectiveness of public money being spent in these areas?</p></speech>

As I mentioned, they include well-being, equality, SDG, and green budgeting.  In the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, we try to work together and share experiences to learn from best practice.  That is reflected in the SRSP project we mentioned earlier.  It reflects all elements of performance budgeting.  Green budgeting is certainly learning from the experience of other elements of performance budgeting.  We are trying to make sure it is as informed as it can be.  The SRSP project is providing international best practice in all elements of performance budgeting, which will certainly be reflected in the work ahead.</p></speech>

A Deputy alluded to the fact that it shows how much money was spent on home help.  The reality on the ground is that we cannot fulfil the hours needed to be fulfilled.  Does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, perform checks on that or refer back to the Department of Health or whatever?  Where does the buck stop?  Does it stop with DPER or individual Departments to answer for their actions, or lack thereof, and failures to provide services that are budgeted for?</p></speech>

Given the long-term nature of capital projects and the need to have a pipeline in place, Departments require a high degree of certainty.  That informs the approach towards capital budgeting.</p> <p>  With regard to the allocation of funding to current expenditure programmes, each year we set out the multi-annual expenditure ceilings but the reality is what gets set out on a technical basis is a ceiling for a Department that is in line with the current year's ceiling.  The ceiling published for the Department of Rural and Community Development for next year would be the same as this year's expenditure allocation in the Revised Estimates Volume.  At budget time, that allows the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform along with the Ministers of the relevant line Departments to enter into a discussion about priorities for the following year.  Decisions are made on allocations and increased allocations at a departmental level.  Departments have multi-annual funding in place in that a ceiling, which is at the same level as the current year's ceiling, is set out but any incremental increase requires agreement during the budgetary process.  That has served us reasonably well in providing flexibility to respond to the evolving situations seen over the past number of years.</p> <p>  The delivery of the programmes is the responsibility of the line Departments, but when it comes to whether funding has been spent during the year, we at an aggregate level report with the Department of Finance each month on spending by Departments.  We review the various sections within the Department of Public Expenditure that deal with the relevant and respective line Departments.  We go through the expenditure on a monthly basis, identifying areas where there may be underspends or overspends, and that would feed into discussions with regard to allocations for further years.</p></speech>

Is there a master plan that shows, over the lifetime of the national development plan, what projects will be at the different stages along the way each year so that we can track progress or lack thereof in these projects within each Department?  Let us consider, for instance, the building of the cancer care unit in University Hospital Galway.</p><p>Is there a project plan for that programme setting out what will be done in each year of the plan to ensure it is completed within a certain timeframe?  We see a list of projects and that &euro;110 billion, or whatever it is, is being allocated but how do we track that progress on each project within each Department on a yearly basis to see if the targets are being met so that there will be a stream of work for the construction industry and civil engineering contractors and they will know that there is a plan in place and that everything is moving in the right direction rather than having that stop-go feeling that is out there at the moment?  Is there a master plan or a master programme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.356" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Hearne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022052500002#E00200"><p>There are a couple of sources for that information.  It was a key finding of the IMF when it looked at our capital planning system a number of years ago.  In 2017, it carried out a wide-ranging assessment of how we budget for investment, how we allocate it and how we monitor implementation.  One of the key findings was that, centrally, we did not have a good view of what the overall capital programme looked like in its totality.  While individual Departments were monitoring their own investment programmes, there was no consolidated central view.</p> <p>  In response to that, we set about a number of initiatives.  Probably the most useful has been the Government's capital project tracker, which started life as a simple list of projects but which has developed to include much more detailed information, much of which is published.  Not all of it is published for reasons of commercial confidentiality and other reasons.  That sets out the budgetary scale of projects, their likely commencement date, their current stage in the project life cycle and the likely completion date.  We have updated that approximately every six months since it started in 2018.  That covers the largest projects in the State.  </p> <p>  We then have the interactive Project Ireland 2040 map which sets out much smaller-scale investments including community investments and investments by local authorities.  That is an interactive map whereby members of the public can look at their area and at the type of projects that are coming.  It does not have the same level of information as is available for the larger projects but we plan to develop it further.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the construction sector.  We work very closely with the construction sector and the various representative bodies through the construction sector group.  We know that this has been a useful tool for them in foreseeing the likely pipeline of work in the medium term.  Those in the sector have given us feedback suggesting that more granular information needs to be made available in that regard.  That is certainly something we plan to continue to develop over the medium term.</p> <p>  Those are the two principal sources.  On individual large projects, Government Departments will publish particular project-level information separately.  Any of the major transport, road and energy projects will have its own dedicated website operated by the individual agencies responsible for it.  There are a number of sources of information, the capital tracker being the principal central source.</p></speech>

How is that monitored?  Is it just a reporting mechanism?  If a programme sets out what is to be done over ten years, it will be monitored.  I have not looked at the tracking system but it probably just shows progress and where things are rather than where things should be or were projected to be.  Can that be compared within the tracker?</p></speech>

That is principally a reporting tool.  The primary responsibility for monitoring implementation, ensuring projects are on schedule and so forth is with the sponsoring agency, the relevant Department.  Different Departments have their own systems in place to ensure that happens and their own governance processes around their investment portfolios.  That more hands-on monitoring of implementation and governance takes place more at the Department level.</p></speech>

There is an awful lot of detail to look at but it is very helpful.  It is a big reform to now have a document like this containing this much detail and telling us whether the allocation of money made in a budget has achieved what was set out as the rationale for that allocation.  This is a lot more information than we used to have before these reports were introduced.  They are also improving all of the time.  Well done to the officials.</p> <p>  There is so much in the report.  It is kind of for each sectoral committee to study the section relevant to it and to then follow-up.  However, there are a few things that strike me.  The first relates to the Department of Transport.  Is there a problem with the Department of Transport?  There is absolutely no information on many of its key high-level metrics for 2019, 2020 and 2021.  There are no figures on the number of rail stations with accessible bridge crossings, the number of stations with improved accessibility, the number of bus stations with Part M of the building regulations internal and external accessibility improvements, the number of bus stops, the number of wheelchair-accessible vehicles in the taxi fleet and so on.  It is not just that there are no figures for this year, but that there are none for the last three years.  We therefore do not really know whether the Department of Transport is spending money on the things it was supposed to spend it on and delivering the results it was supposed to deliver.  That seems like a big issue.  It is the only one I can see that is like that.</p></speech>

As I said, our approach to equality budgeting is not about meeting metrics and ticking off a given number so that we consider it done.  We want to demonstrate to the Departments that, if they push their policies a little bit further to target specific cohorts of society, they will be much more effective.  This was one instance in which the metrics were just not yet available but the Department acknowledged that this was a way to capture that information.  The report is published now but, as those details become available, we will update the online version.  We wanted to capture the structure in order to demonstrate it to the Department so that it can use it as an example for targeting specific cohorts in other areas.  That is an exceptional case.</p></speech>

There is a lot of campaigning going on around the area of access.  I particularly note the great work of the disability campaigning group, Access for All.  It would probably not be surprised at this, but it would be angry.  I have been meeting that group for quite a few years.  In a way, this is for the Department of Transport, Dublin Bus and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  This is an example of a body telling you it is working on improving accessibility while not managing to gather information on it.  It has accepted that these are reasonable metrics but does not gather the information.  Access for All gathers information as to the number of DART stations every week where people in wheelchairs cannot get on a train because the lifts are not working.  The people gathering that information are volunteers and campaigners.  There is a pretty big gap there that is worth highlighting.  That is not the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's fault.</p></speech>

I will refer to the Revised Estimates Volume.</p><p>In the section covering the Department of Transport there are metrics for what its targets are for 2022 and were for 2021.  Therefore, targets are in place.  When one searches for the number of wheelchair-accessible vehicles in the taxi fleet, there is a target set of 3,300 for this year.  Likewise, there is a target for the number of accessible bus spacing stations.  This is a timing issue with regard to reporting.  As Ms O'Loughlin said, when the data become available they will be included.  However, the important point is these are metrics the Department is focused on collecting.  They have been identified as important equality metrics and they will be reported against.  They have been included in the REV with targets for this year and when it comes to next year we will be able to see how it is delivered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022052500002#F00200"><p>There will be a massive improvement.  We eagerly await that.</p> <p>  On higher education, in the equality section of the report, there are metrics covering students with disabilities, Travellers and quite a number covering women in particular positions and so on, which are important metrics in terms of equality.  I suggest one of the biggest issues in higher education in terms of equality is the major inequality in the difference between people from higher socioeconomic and people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds accessing university and higher education.  We need to know we are improving in that or not as the case may be.  As it is a major issue, there should be some metric that captures that and assesses whether decisions we make about grants, fees, outreach programmes or whatever it may be are delivering any change in terms of accessibility to higher education.  I do not know if Mr. Kinnane would have any comment on that but that needs to be added in there.</p></speech>

If we note the section covering the Department of Education in the REV, one of the metrics the Department of Education has selected is the transition rates from post-primary to higher education and separating out the differences between the transitions rates from schools participating in the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, programme and non-DEIS schools.  It is something of which the education sector is aware.  Where metrics are available, we will certainly work with the Departments on that.  Initially, on equality budgeting, we started off with one dimension and we have broadened it out to include issues such as socioeconomic disadvantage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.368" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022052500002#F00400"><p>I accept it is a work in progress but it would be important to include that area as it is a critical one in terms of equality because there is a gross inequality in that, as I think Mr. Kinnane will be aware and it has been widely discussed.</p> <p>  Another aspect I would note in passing, which is more a matter for the committee to follow up on, is the number of lower-income households who have been provided with energy efficiency upgrades in the equality section.  Overall, the numbers indicate we are not meeting the targets.  However, it is useful information.  These reports are brilliant in that sense but we are massively underperforming in meeting the targets.  One might argue the targets are pretty modest in and of themselves and it is useful information to have but we are doing about 50% or 60% of what is targeted in terms of energy efficiency upgrades, particularly for those who need support with respect to the warmer homes scheme and so on.</p> <p>  When metrics are set, who decides on them as to what is a good metric?  I am interested in the metrics for the film industry.  The metrics in terms of expenditure in that area are the number of feature films funded and the number of participants in training and development.  Who came up with them?  I frankly think they mask serious problems in that area.  The number of feature films produced does not tell us everything we need to know about the development of our film industry.  The number of people participating in courses does not tell us how many people are becoming qualified because in my view the answer to that question is none.  There is not a proper training and accreditation qualification regime in the area of film despite much money being allocated to it.  I am wondering who decides on the metric.  On the face of it, one would think that looks good but on digging a little below the surface I would argue it is not so good.  One element that sector should be asked about is its employees and people having some security in employment. Who decides on the metrics? </p></speech>

There is so much information in it.  Many of the questions we would have arising from it relates to information to be given by the Departments but this is an extremely useful document to have.  I commend the officials on their work on it.  My first question relates to the way the work on the report is done.  There is such an amount of information in it and it is a significantly long document.  On a practical level, how many people worked on it to put it together and how long did it take?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.375" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline O'Loughlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022052500002#F01100"><p>In the Department, it involved our unit and three people worked on it but every Department fed into the process.  Every Department put a great deal of work into gathering this information and reporting it to us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022052500002#F01200"><p>Then the unit collated it.  They asked the questions, which makes sense.  Those three people had to ensure, on foot of all that information having been received, the report was published.  As those of us who have done such work, we know it can be difficult to get back information that has been sought.  It is significant to see all this work come together.  It is useful to have this report and to take notes on it.  When did work on this report start or is it constantly ongoing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.377" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline O'Loughlin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022052500002#F01300"><p>The metrics are first identified in the Revised Estimates Volume in December and we go back to the Departments to provide them with the metrics and ask them for the updates.  Basically, they told us what the target was in the REV and we ask them to come back and report on it.  However, there are other elements.  There is equality budgeting and that work is ongoing during the year with engagement with the Departments to identity the metrics and flesh them out as best we can.  A great deal of work has gone into it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2022052500002#F01400"><p>One can see that from this document.  Many instinctive questions we would have would be for other Department but that it is a job for another day.  Not to add to the officials' work, the queries we would naturally have on foot of the report relate to additional reporting that will be put into it.</p><p>One of the questions I would raise with the Minister is on the large capital projects.  There could be cost overruns.  Often it is difficult for us to see what the underlying cause is.  Obviously we know the national development plan outlines &euro;165 billion of spending, which is no small figure, over the next ten years.  Measuring the performance of the capital expenditure would be quite important to establish whether cost overruns were as a result of inflation, poor planning or otherwise.  I ask Ms O'Loughlin if there are any plans to incorporate that element.</p></speech>

As I said in the opening statement, the feedback from this committee in particular is extremely important.  The whole point of the report is to present how public expenditure,  public money, was spent and what it delivered in a very clear and accessible way and to facilitate committees to scrutinise that.  This is obviously an extremely important element of the budgetary cycle.  We very much welcome the feedback from the committee so that we can adapt the report in whatever way best serves the committee's needs.  That is something we will include in the future.</p></speech>

It does not quite get into project level information about project costs and forecasts and so forth but it is a good tracker of what is happening across the various programmes.  We also publish a report on the construction industry which sets out a lot of detail around those types of trends the Vice Chairman mentioned such as inflation, skills availability and so forth.</p></speech>

Thank you, Mr. Hearne.</p> <p>  The other question I have relates to something I came across when I was a councillor.  The spending on agency staff can be quite high.  Could that be incorporated in some way?  I will not name organisations, but sometimes in the past you would see huge spending on agency staff in a particular place and you would know there were people struggling to get work in the place.  It would be interesting to look at how much money is spent on agency staff.</p></speech>

Whereas the Revised Estimates Volume will include a lot more financial detail on the departmental allocations, we deliberately tend to keep the expenditure here at a programme level to keep the focus on what is actually being delivered.  This is a very large document.  The REV is hundreds of pages.  It is not a very accessible document so the focus here is trying to strike the balance between providing a lot of financial detail and the performance.</p></speech>

Could that be documented separately?  I am from Galway and I would know when there were acquisitions or new social builds.  It is very important for us to have that information as well.</p></speech>

Those are my key questions.</p> <p>  Something that stuck out as I opened a page was income supports for children.  I am not asking the witnesses to comment but it states that the percentage of children from birth to 17 years of age at risk of poverty has increased from 15.3% in 2019 to 15.9% in 2020.  I note the percentage of children from birth to 17 years of age in consistent poverty decreased by 0.1% in a year.  Sometimes we, as a society, need to look at our failings as well.  I understand that is for a particular Department but it is important to note, as a committee, that we need to take a serious look at that.</p> <p>  I will finish up now and then let an Teachta Boyd Barrett in.  On behalf of the members, I say well done to the team for putting this together because it is a substantial piece of work and has a huge amount of information in it.  We are very thankful that we have that information.</p></speech>

When you give the figures for expenditure under each departmental heading, it is the direct allocations and presumably does not take account of the expenditures.  Do the witnesses think it would be plausible - it would certainly be good in my opinion - to also look at the tax expenditures under each of those departmental headings and to look at what they are delivering for us?  This is obviously a major step forward in terms of seeing what we are trying to achieve with direct funding allocations.  Now we can measure that.  We have been discussing the fact that there is no real, or very little, measurement of tax expenditures even though they are supposed to achieve certain things as well.  Is it a plausible that we could work towards this report, including that analysis as well?</p></speech>

I know it works with the tax strategy group papers, looking at various items of tax expenditure over time.  The production of reports, however, and anything to do with tax expenditure would be a matter for the Department of Finance to look at in the first instance.</p></speech>

One possible step in the direction Deputy Boyd Barrett is talking about was work that was done last year around budget time.  It was similar to the green budgeting side of things, which we have in expenditure terms here.  It looked at the climate impact and the balance of various measures in budget 2022.  It is certainly possible and some elements of our framework here have been looked at through the lens of taxation.</p></speech>

I understand the demarcation lines but there is a certain sort of lack of "joined-up-ness" here.  I will give an example from agriculture where we allocate a certain amount of direct funding to a particular programme while simultaneously there are tax expenditures that are trying to achieve certain things in agriculture but they are not looked at in the round or in terms of the agricultural sector as a whole because they are both trying to achieve things with public money in a particular sector but in two different ways.  We have always tended to look at this stuff more and now we are looking at it in even more detail and with more analysis.  We are starting to look at this other area but we are not as far down the road and have not joined the two arms yet.  I take the point about the Department of Finance.  This needs to be said to it as well.  It seems there is a logic in seeing how all-of-government efforts and funding, whether it is through tax expenditure or direct expenditure, should be looked at in the round to see if we achieved what we were trying to achieve.</p></speech>

The committee has for many weeks held discussion on issues such as the humanitarian crisis, the EU response to the war and the EU applications of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia.  Last month, a delegation from the committee travelled to Romania and Moldova on a fact finding mission to view the situation on the ground in two European countries at the forefront of the humanitarian crisis caused by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.  I am delighted to say that we will continue that work.  We want to keep this issue on the radar and we are aware of the importance of that.</p> <p>  I am delighted to welcome Ms Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, chair of the EU committee of the Ukrainian Parliament.  I also welcome the ambassador of Ukraine, H.E. Ms Larysa Gerasko.  She is busy; she was at a fundraiser last night.  It was good to see her there.  It is good to have her back and we look forward to today's engagement.  As son an choiste, cuirim f&aacute;ilte rompu chuig an gcruinni&uacute;.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome our guests.</p> <p>  All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if a statement of a witness is potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue these remarks.  It is imperative that he or she complies with any such direction.  I think the members of the committee know the drill in terms of the rules on being in the Leinster House complex.</p> <p>  We will start with opening remarks from a fellow chair, speaking from Davos, Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze.</p></speech>

I also want to underline my gratitude to our ambassador of Ukraine, H.E. Ms Larysa Gerasko, for doing such a great job by connecting us and helping to facilitate this dialogue between the parliaments.</p> <p>  I am joining the committee from Davos.  The World Economic Forum is definitely focusing on a lot of issue such as security, geopolitics, and specifically on Russia's war against Ukraine.  We are privileged to have the possibility of several of our Members of Parliament and members of the Government  to be here to continue explaining what is happening and encouraging support for the country.</p> <p>  On behalf of the Ukrainian people who I represent as a parliamentarian, I wish to express our wholehearted gratitude to the Irish people and politicians for the warm welcome they have given to Ukrainians seeking refuge.  I have heard that Ireland has increased its population by 1% by welcoming approximately 30,000 Ukrainians.  We are grateful for that and we hope that by Ukraine winning, with the support of the free world, those Ukrainians will have a warm welcome back home and the possibility to return to their houses if they are preserved or to rebuild houses once this sad, terrible and most barbaric war is over.</p> <p>  As the committee members know, unfortunately, there is no safe place in Ukraine at this time.  We are not only threatened but we are being shelled and pounded upon, killed, tortured, deported from the occupied territories and our children are being abducted.  The atrocities that Russia has visited upon our land are absolutely inhumane and horrible to even imagine.  I call this war a war between the world and anti-world, humanity and anti-humanity.  I believe what is happening to be totally illogical.  Free world nations and free people are standing up with Ukraine, but we need to sustain this support.  It does not get any easier each day.  That is something I feel here in Davos, unfortunately, in that there is a willingness by some politicians, states, and analysts to try to push Ukraine into making concessions or find compromises at the expense of Ukraine, as opposed to continuing to help us further and the need to understand and verify for themselves that the values being defended are real-world values that matter and are important.</p></speech>

There seems to be some noise in the background.  I ask everyone who is present at the meeting online to mute their equipment because we are hearing some interference.  It seems to be coming from the background, or maybe from Davos.</p></speech>

It is not only about values.  We are all being tested how serious we are about our principles, our beliefs and most basic things such as freedom and democracy.</p> <p>  As the committee members probably already understand, Russia is trying to erase us from the map of the world, as a nation and state.  One of the major reasons it is trying to punish us is because we want to build our own country according to our own vision that would be democratic and, in the future, a fully-fledged member of the European Union and Euro-Atlantic community, and would have the possibility to develop according to the best practices which the free nations have been showing the world.  Russia totally opposes our right to not only build a European future for Ukraine but also the right to live in this particular moment.  That is why it is extremely important for us, for Ukrainian people, 93% of whom support the European integration path for Ukraine.  More recently, there has been a clear signal from the EU in the decision to be taken in June to give us EU candidate status.</p><p>I wish to underline how grateful we are for Ireland's clear and dedicated stance on that matter.  I take this opportunity to reach out to the members of the committee and ask them to do their utmost in talking to sceptical colleagues in other countries.  Unfortunately, not everybody is on board at this moment.  I ask them to try to persuade them that we should not be hiding behind legalities but should take this political decision already now because that is the inspiration for Ukrainian people, that we will have the possibility to transform our country in accordance with European-----</p></speech>

It is very important that this strategic ambiguity on Ukraine's European perspective from some of the European Union member states is dissolved.  We are trying our best but Ireland's voice, arguments and explanations to its colleagues would be crucial in that and so I am calling on it to help us to get this first important stage done.</p> <p>  With regard to the war, unfortunately this night was not the exception.  Again, some civilian targets in Pryvillia and Zaporizhzhia have been hit.  Fierce fighting is ongoing in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as the Kharkiv and Kherson regions.  Air alerts are threatening the whole country.  That means we are very much dependent on the instruments to fight back.  I know about the military neutrality of Ireland but I appreciate all the non-lethal aid it has been giving Ukraine.  It is very much needed so our incredibly brave, courageous and professional armed forces will be protected.  We are also reaching out to all the nations that can give us heavy weaponry to do that as fast as possible because time matters and time means the lives of civilians.  You cannot defend your country bare-handed.  That is why that is another very important issue for us.</p> <p>  On top of military support, we appreciate it when nations take a political stance.  That is exactly what Ireland is doing.  I am watching how Switzerland is redefining its neutrality by going from active neutrality to co-operative neutrality.  That is very important in terms of those sanctions that it has joined.  It is heartbreaking for us to watch how the sixth package of sanctions is not being adopted and is still being postponed.  One of the countries of the EU, irrespective of the basic value written in the European agreement on solidarity, is violating that basic principle of solidarity value.  I will be blunt about this.  It is holding hostage the full decision of the EU on starting the process of embargoing Russian oil and cutting off Russian banks from SWIFT.  I believe we need all Russian banks to be cut off from SWIFT.  Only then will those sanctions really work because many people are using the loopholes in sanctions to avoid them.  Gazprombank is one example.  I am appalled by the decision that German and Italian companies can pay through Gazprombank in rubles for the energy resources.  That is totally wrong and is in discontent with all the sanctions that have already been adopted.  We know that, unfortunately, Russia is buying weaponry through Gazprombank, paying salaries to its soldiers to continue killing us Ukrainians and continuing its terrorist activities in the territory of Ukraine.</p></speech>

That is also of huge importance because what Russia is doing right now is stealing.  For example, in the occupied territories, it is stealing our grain and our agricultural equipment and selling, or trying to sell, our stolen products - like looters - to other nations using different ships and so on.  It is hard to comprehend the scope of the crimes Russia is carrying out or even count them on all ten fingers because the variety is very big.  There are also some assets of Russian affiliates registered with the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin.  I am kindly asking the members, as politicians, to engage with their Government and see how those assets could be frozen and then seized.  They could then potentially be transferred or repaid to Ukrainians who have lost their homes, their loved ones or their health when they were wounded and so on.  That is why I am saying we need sanctions to pressure Russia.</p> <p>  We have to understand it is not Putin who is fighting this war against us.  It is the collective responsibility of the Russian Federation.  Russia must be weakened to the extent that it is not capable of carrying out additional attacks on Ukraine or starting any other war in the whole world, which it was doing before this.  It was showing off to the world with its credible strong response.  Russia understands the language of power, unity and strength.  It is provoked by weak reactions.  That is what has been happening over decades, unfortunately, with the Russian attack on Georgia, Russian engagement in Syria, and the initial attack back in 2014 on Crimea and on the east of Ukraine.  I hope we will not make this mistake again and that the lessons learnt are being exercised and carried out at this moment by many nations.  Together we will be able to ensure that the "Never again" we repeated after the Second World War will actually become never again.  As of this point in time, that is not there.</p><p>Obviously, here in Davos we are discussing the issue of the potential food crisis imposed on the world because of the Russian war against Ukraine.  Approximately 22 million tonnes of Ukrainian grain is currently stored in Ukraine, which shows our capacity to feed 400 million people a year.  Unfortunately, at present, with all the improvements we can make on our western border, using the rail network, lorries and ground transportation through Europe and on to the European port of Gdansk and ports in Lithuania, we can only increase our exports by 30%.  That will not solve the issue.  That would mean we would need six years to export everything in terms of crops that we have.  We will have the new harvest in July, which means we will have to destroy some of the crops we already have because we do not have the facilities to store them.  That will happen at a time when people in northern Africa and Middle Eastern countries, who are on dependent on our exports of these products, might face real hunger.  There is an urgent need to unblock the sea route from the Pivdennyi Port near Odesa through the engagement of the international community in order for Ukrainians to export these crops to ensure we deter the possibility of a food crisis.  We do not have a solution to that issue yet but it is another very important topic on which we need to concentrate.</p><p> I would like to finish my remarks by thanking Ireland, along with almost 40 other nations, for filing a claim to the International Criminal Court, ICC, of Russian war crimes on the territory of Ukraine.  We in Ukraine sincerely believe this war must be ended with Russian defeat and isolation, and definitely with Russia's punishment.  Therefore, it is very important that we are currently working on documenting and registering all the war crimes against humanity that have been revealed to the world after the liberating of some of the areas that were occupied by Russians near Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv.  Unfortunately there have been many Buchas around Ukraine that have been done by the so-called armed forces.  I cannot call them the armed forces of the Russian Federation because they are violating every single convention that foresaw rules of engagement for war times.  This is one track but we must also ensure Russia is punished and prosecuted for the war and crime of aggression.  That means a separate tribunal, a Nuremburg mark 2 would be have to be set up.  That would require much common effort by many nations.  We are counting on Irish engagement and support in this endeavour.</p><p> I understand Ireland's contribution to the de-mining of lands through UN missions has been incredible.  Unfortunately, approximately 300 sq km of new minefields, including agricultural fields that have been mined deliberately by the Russian Federation, are in dire need of urgent de-mining.  Ireland's expertise, training and equipment in that regard would be extremely important.  I would like the committee to also consider that possibility in addition to its humanitarian and financial aid, which are still very much needed.  We appreciate what Ireland has already done in that respect by pledging money to the European Peace Facility to direct financial support for Ukraine.  Even in these dire times we are thinking of the recovery of Ukraine and how to approach that in the best way in order that it would be a transparent process of engagement of other countries who are ready to provide additional support but also ensuring we use this drastic and most painful time as an opportunity to rebuild Ukraine as a better place in the centre and at the heart of Europe.  I will stop on that point as it is much more important to hear members' questions and engage in direct communication through questions and answers or members' comments.</p></speech>

We will try to keep the conversation flowing.  Deputies Richmond, Howlin, &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and Brady have indicated.  I will take those contributions first.  I welcome Mr. Barry Andrews, MEP, to today's meeting.  If he would like to contribute during his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues' time slot, I will be happy to let him speak first but his colleagues have the right to speak first.  Mr. Andrews is very welcome and has a good interest in this area.  If members have a few questions they can direct them to the Chair of the Committee on EU Affairs, Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze, or to the Ukrainian ambassador, Ms Larysa Gerasko.  They can involve both of them.</p></speech>

There is much to cover there.  Many of the questions and points from our end may come across as a bit frivolous when we know the chairperson and the ambassador and their fellow country people are living under this horrible attack and brutal war.  To bring the engagement back to a slightly more procedural matter on the hopeful accession of Ukraine to the EU as speedily as possible, Ireland is one of the countries that has stated in the EU that we want to see this happen quickly, not in ten or 20 years like other larger member states have negatively said.  From a parliamentary point of view, what work had been done prior to the war in preparing Ukraine for accession?  What assistance would be needed from EU member states in terms of some form of Marshall fund but also to ensure that we, as parliamentarians, in a sympathetic member state can do our best and utmost to ensure that swift accession?  I will leave it at that as I know members have a range of questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.415" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022052500002#F00500"><p>Yes.  Ukraine experienced serious difficulty in breaking through with our European integration plan.  It was the negative decision of the previous authorities under President Yanukovych not to sign the association agreement that triggered the Revolution of Dignity and it was only after that, with the great losses, we had the chance to sign the association agreement and the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, DCFTA.  Then, we, as opposed to any other state in the world, had to go through the process of having a referendum on the ratification of the association agreement in the Netherlands.</p><p>We learned a year later that with the harsh involvement of the Russian Federation there, the results were negative for Ukraine.  We even had difficulties in terms of having it ratified, even though I think Ukrainian people deserved it more than anybody else.  Since 2014, before its ratification, we have said that the association agreement should be implemented.  Along with that, we started work on a set of reforms enabling Ukrainians to travel visa-free.  All of that ensures that we are definitely not starting from scratch on the issue of accession to the EU.  We are much closer together.  We redirected our trade and more than 44% of our exports were to the EU before the full-scale invasion.  We have been successful in a quite a lot of transformation by meeting many of the important criteria on the path.  We are not starting from ground zero, as it were.  However, there is a lot that will definitely have to be done.  I believe that our recovery plan has to be about recovery and transformation.  It has to be a recovery and reform plan.  The funding that will have to be provided to Ukraine through financial aid, lines of credit and investment will also have to be topped with financial assistance for the reform agenda that is still very much needed in Ukraine.  While we have been successful, for example, in setting up the anti-corruption institutions, in order for those institutions to deliver on their tasks efficiently, they will have to go through a period when they are tested in action.  Some will probably have to be fine-tuned to an extent.  We also have a lot to deliver on in ensuring that the rule of law in Ukraine is exemplary in the future.  There are many other areas in which we need best practices that could be brought with EU expertise and direct engagement with Ukraine.  </p><p> On the Marshall Plan, as far as I understand it, it has been decided that it will be known as the "Brussels Plan for Ukraine".  It will be very similar to the Marshall Plan that was introduced after the Second World War.  It is good that we are already thinking about it.  The Marshall Plan was introduced three years after the end of the Second World War.  If we are thinking about a similar plan for Ukraine now, we can include the most important deliverables for Ukraine. It will be important for that to be felt by the Ukrainian people.  With regard to numbers, we can probably talk about numbers now but unfortunately we are experiencing additional losses to the economy and infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, universities, places of cultural heritage, people's homes and multistorey buildings, every single day.  Unfortunately, those numbers are going to grow.  We will only understand what kind of allocations will be needed for Ukraine after the end of the war.  We are definitely looking at the numbers, not only as aid and credit, as I said.  Investment policies will also provide a big opportunity for other countries to develop sectors in Ukraine that they might be best at.  The Ukrainian Government is asking other countries to consider what sectors of the economy they would like to focus on as part of the future recovery.  The Ukrainian Government is also suggesting that each EU country works with a particular region or area in Ukraine as part of the recovery plan.  The plan is in the making.  I am sure that the ambassador has all the materials that have already been prepared for the recovery plan.  From my perspective, I will end on the point on which I started, namely, that recovery has to be tied to a reform agenda.  I do not think that two parallel tracks will be the right way to go.  </p></speech>

I wish to make a brief comment and ask two questions.  First, it is important that we express, as a committee representing all parties in our Parliament, our total solidarity with Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze and her parliamentary colleagues in facing the absolutely shocking and unjustified assault on their country by the Russian Federation.  On Ukraine's application for membership of the EU, I think Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze accurately reflected Ireland's very strong support of it.  The visit of the Speaker of our Parliament and the Chair of the Senate to Kyiv last weekend was undertaken not only to support Ukraine, but to be advocates across the EU.  I think that should be stated.</p> <p>  As to my two questions, the issue of the export of grain is a critical one, as Russia now uses food as a weapon of war and starvation as a threat to the world.  Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze was very sanguine, almost pessimistic, in terms of what can be done to export Ukrainian grain.  They are saying that the rail routes could only export some 30% of the grain.  Is there a possibility and what can be done at an EU level to ensure that the grain that is there and which is vitally needed by hungry people across the globe can be exported?  What do we need to do internationally to provide safe corridors for the transport of grain?  Do the witnesses' have a view on that?</p> <p>  My second question relates to our visit to Romania and Moldova as a parliamentary committee, which was eye-opening for all of us.  One of the places we visited was Palanca in southern Moldova, which is the crossing point that is closest to Odesa.  I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' assessment of the following.  There was a real fear that if Odesa was assaulted by the Russian Federation, there would be a mass exodus into Moldova, which would overwhelm it, and we wondered how that would be dealt with.  Do the witnesses have a view on the conduct of the war in terms of the vulnerability of Odesa and that southern corridor across the Black Sea?</p></speech>

With regard to export routes, we must do everything that can be done and undertake all possible engagement at the European level, in terms of perhaps bringing the UN on board, in trying to negotiate safe borders with the Russian Federation for exports.  I think that from the diplomatic standpoint, that is probably the only option.  However, Russia is bargaining and blackmailing and trying to insist that some of the sanctions against it have to be lifted in order for any exports to be made from Ukraine.  I would not dismiss the channel of insistence through the UN instruments.  However, at the same time, even if we did that, it would involve removing mines from the sea area.  There are Ukrainian mines that are protecting the Port of Odesa and Russian mines that are in place as part of its assault on the Ukrainian sea borders.</p><p>That is in full and total violation of the law of the sea.  Irrespective of any obligations, Russia is behaving that way.  That means an additional demining effort, including a sea demining effort.  It also foresees specific sea convoys that would work on convoying these exports.  There are a lot of components to that.  I am pessimistic because none of the efforts that have been made in that direction so far have produced any result.  Russia has been blowing up the humanitarian corridors for people to leave the cities.  It does not care.  It has blown up the vehicles of members of the civilian population as they have tried to get to refuge.  That is why I am very sceptical about that and about how Russia will behave.</p><p> Other important aspects have to be borne in mind.  Since we do not have enough storage facilities, that could be an additional thing that might be worked on directly with the Ukrainian Government by bringing in some of the temporary possibilities for storage facilities in order that we could store some of the new crops and maybe engage in some processing on the territory of Ukraine.  That could help the future of our exports.  Those are practical details.  I am sure our agriculture minister could go into that much more precisely.</p><p> I had a separate meeting here in Davos with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integration of Moldova.  Moldova had prepared to receive a maximum of about 15,000 Ukrainian refugees.  This is not to mention that almost 400,000 have gone through Moldovan territory, but now the Moldovan people are hosting 95,000 Ukrainian refugees in their homes.  Moldova is hosting maybe 3,000 to 4,000 people in the facilities it has prepared for refugees but, even without the limited capacity of this country, Moldova has been doing a great job of welcoming Ukrainians.  For Moldova, the number is not proportional.  There is a huge number of refugees now in the country.  There may be another wave of refugees because of the assault on Odesa.  Unfortunately, as committee members have probably noticed, the air attacks on Odesa and the surrounding region are continuous.  Some of the destruction is, unfortunately, happening in the city, which is very symbolic for the Russian Federation in its sick and twisted perception of history.  Russia ties the city to some imperial Russian greatness.  This war is about the restoration of Russian Empire as the Russian Government understands it.  It does not matter what the name is.  Putin sees the dissolution of the Soviet Union as the most drastic mistake of the 20th century.  Therefore, I do not think the Russians have given up the idea of attacking either Odesa or Kyiv, so it is entirely possible that a new wave of refugees will come through that area.</p><p> Moreover, we have to understand that in Transnistria, this non-recognised territory that has been cut off from Moldova for a couple of decades, there are, I think, about 1,300 Russian troops stationed at the moment.  They are on high alert.  Moreover, there is a big base there, a big military storage facility, that they are threatening to blow up.  That could be a huge disaster for the region on various terms, including ecological terms.  Therefore, the threat is there.  Moldova should be given additional help in its efforts to be ready as at least a transit country for those people who might need to find further refuge.</p></speech>

I reiterate what everyone else has said about the solidarity there needs to be with Ukraine, which is dealing with an absolutely abominable invasion by Russia, something none of us expected to happen.  We are in a very different place now from where we were a few months ago.  This being the EU affairs committee, Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze has already dealt with the piece of work on EU candidacy and reorientation of Ukraine's set-up, that is, the economy combined with reforms.  That will be very difficult to follow through on in the middle of a war.  Obviously, we are in complete support of EU candidacy for Ukraine.  When we deal with a necessary Marshall plan of rebuilding, as is hoped, at the end of the conflict, we will also need to ensure the correct resources and proper facilitation.  Sometimes I think there has been a failure on the part of the European Union to provide a proper roadmap for accession.  That is a piece we need to work on.  We have had unhelpful commentary recently, particularly from France, that does not help the situation.</p> <p>  Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze dealt with the wider issue of food security.  I would ask questions about Ukraine's energy security and the supply chains.  I would also ask about the issue of sanctions.  We have seen the difficulty in getting the last and the next round of sanctions into play.  It is a question of what Ukraine wants to see from those sanctions.  Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze has dealt with some of that, including in respect of SWIFT, and we can all make guesses about fuel, but what exactly needs to happen?  As much as everyone prefers that there is multilateralism and agreement at European level, that might not always be necessary.  The European Union has carried out a number of co-operative actions recently, even through the pandemic, on an opt-in basis.  In an awful lot of cases people opted in, so we might be looking at that into the future.  Again, it is a matter of Ukraine's view on that, particularly the sanctions.</p> <p>  Mr. Shchedrin has responsibility for trade, does he not?</p></speech>

I was to follow up on that.</p> <p>  The last time Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze was before us, she spoke about the list of companies, provided to the Department of Foreign Affairs, that were still trading with Russia.  Where is that?  We have had a lot of sanctions and a lot of things have changed since that.</p> <p>  I will leave it at that.  I may come in again afterwards.  I do not want to hog the entire meeting.  I have a tendency to do that so I apologise.</p></speech>

It is important to understand that, having decoupled from the Russian grids and connected to the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity, ENTSO-E, system, Ukraine can, even now, export electricity to the European Union.  The urgent ENTSO-E connection envisaged that there would not be a commercial flow of electricity from Ukraine to the European Union but that can, and should, be reconsidered because, while the supply is not a lot at the moment, we can supply 3% of the European Union's needs, that is, we can supply electricity to substitute for some of the gas consumed.  It is important to understand that there are some possibilities here that have not been exploited yet.</p> <p>  In the context of oil, we are experiencing extreme shortages of gasoline and diesel because Russia has totally destroyed our refinery capacity and deliberately targeted our storage facilities across the country, regardless of whether they were state- or privately owned.  We are now looking for options to get more of the fuels that we need through the bottleneck on the western part of our border, which is also a life vein for us.  We need these fuels first and foremost for our agriculture sector and armed forces but we also need them for all of the other parts of the economy.  We need to be capable of relying on the supply for our people to live.  That is another area where the engagement of the committee is very much needed, that is, in trying to secure further volumes to meet those urgent needs of Ukraine.  That is where we are.</p> <p>  We are still transporting Russian gas to the European Union.  Obviously, we would very much like to cut that dependency on transportation to zero, but that would require other sanctions.  The EU is now discussing an oil embargo but we see how much difficulty there is with gas.  As we have heard from many colleagues, a gas embargo is obviously far from being apprehended as a clear possibility.  Europe has to look at a target of zero dependency on Russian energy sources.  The mistakes that have been made in recent decades in increasing the dependency of certain European countries on Russian energy resources are now being paid for.  We definitely understand it will take time to introduce a gas embargo but it is the major thing that has to be achieved.  I do not see the sixth package, if and when it is agreed, being the last package that would need to be introduced against the monstrous aggressor that is the Russian Federation.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, there is no end to the war in sight.  We are now heading into the fourth month of a brutal invasion and assault on Ukraine, its sovereignty and its people.  I again express solidarity with the ambassador, with Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze and with the entirety of the Ukrainian people.  A lot has been covered in terms of EU accession.  Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze highlighted the issue of sceptical countries.  I believe we all know which countries they are.  Perhaps, we should name them.  They include Germany and France.  Perhaps Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze would like to put others on the record here.  What engagement, if any, has been under way with those sceptical countries to make them see right and to allow this process to move on?</p> <p>  The other day, President Zelenskyy said that, at this point, diplomacy is the only way to bring the war to an end.  What moves are now taking place?  The Russians have said that the peace talks are now at a dead end.  There was a very unhelpful and disgraceful intervention by the disgraced war criminal, Henry Kissinger, yesterday or the day before.  He stated that Ukraine must cede territory to bring the war to an end.  I would like to get a view on that.  It is an absolutely disgraceful comment for anyone to make but I am not surprised to hear it coming from someone like Henry Kissinger.</p> <p>  Ireland's support for the investigation at the ICC was touched on.  I note that the Prosecutor General of Ukraine has now opened more than 13,000 investigations into war crimes.  We saw the first prosecution the other day, which is to be welcomed, but is there capacity to deal with that volume of investigations?  People absolutely need to be held to account, as does the Russian Federation, but is there capacity to deal with that volume of investigations?  What assistance is Ukraine getting in that respect and what additional assistance is required?</p> <p>  On the issue of food security, I will not labour my point because many people have spoken about it already.  I was in New York last week.  I attended the UN Security Council debate on food security.  I heard at first hand of the impact that is being felt, the concerns and the fears that Russia is now using food insecurity as a threat against the world.  At the same time, we see convoys of Russian trucks leaving Ukraine loaded with grain and headed for Russia.  We have been told that it may take direct negotiations with Russia to end the blockade on the seaports to ensure that grain can flow freely to sub-Saharan countries, other African countries and other countries that are 100% dependent on this grain.  What conversations, if any, are taking place?  Is there scope for conversations or discussions of that nature?</p> <p>  I have a couple of other points.  I was part of the delegation from this committee that went to Romania and Moldova.</p><p>I have seen first-hand the generosity and warmth shown to Ukrainian refugees fleeing over the border.  There was a major concern in Moldova about the situation, including in Transnistria.  Overnight, we saw the former Moldovan president being arrested on high treason and corruption charges, which I am sure will add to the instability in Moldova.  There is a real concern there about the Russian objective to move farther west, to Odesa, to block access to the Black Sea.  We have seen the continuous missile attacks on Odesa.  There was concern that if there was a full frontal assault on Odesa, up to 100,000 refugees would flee the border at Palanca.  What discussions are taking place?  Hopefully it never comes to the point that there is a full frontal assault on Odesa.  What discussions have taken place with border control in Moldova to ensure that some issues experienced there are addressed?</p><p> On the broader issue of refugees, I note that 345,000 refugees in Poland have gone back over the border into Ukraine.  We now see more refugees returning to Ukraine than are leaving.  It is good to see Ukrainians heading home.  Obviously, it is different in the east of Ukraine, where Russia's primary focus is at this point.  Ukraine had bravely defended Kyiv and Kharkiv and Ukrainians obviously feel that it is now a little safer to return home.  What capacity is there in Ukraine to deal with returning refugees?</p><p> Many countries have moved to reopen their embassies in Kyiv, including the USA, Denmark, Switzerland and the UK.  I have asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, repeatedly, to look at reopening our embassy in Kyiv as a mark of solidarity and support.  He said the Department is constantly evaluating the security situation.  There is a concern about Irish diplomatic staff and no one would want to put them in a dangerous situation but other countries have moved to reopen their embassies.  How important do the ambassador and chair think it is for countries like Ireland to reopen their embassies as a show of solidarity and goodwill at this difficult time?  I thank the Chair, the speaker and the ambassador.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.431" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2022052500002#K00200"><p>There were quite a lot of questions.  I will start from the very last one.  Ukrainian people are watching attentively.  It is welcome when embassies in Ukraine are reopened.  The assessment by Irish security, intelligence and partners would be important for Irish diplomatic staff, but maybe that could be assessed and then decided on in co-ordination with other nations.  We have been happy to see Americans, Canadians, the EU mission and many other missions reopen in Ukraine, even though they are understaffed and working in a limited capacity.  That means a lot.  None of them have brought back consular departments but they are focusing their activities on political and defence personnel.</p> <p>  Regarding how we are dealing with refugees, I stayed in Kyiv.  Many of my friends left.  Some went abroad and some went to the western part of Ukraine.  I see many people coming back now.  On a personal level, I understand that being there is still insecure.  There are a number of reasons for it.  For example, people do not have resources to pay additional rent in other parts of Ukraine.  They still have their homes, so they do not need to stay in the facilities, which provide a safe place for internally displaced people from other regions of Ukraine.  That means that many places in the western parts of Ukraine are being vacated but not for long, because unfortunately new people are coming in from internally.  We have used schools and public municipal buildings for these centres to help internally displaced people to stay.  Many are staying in other Ukrainians' homes.  I cannot say that we are expanding the capacity for internally displaced people or helping them on the territory of Ukraine, but the number is not decreasing at all.  Almost 9 million people are internally displaced and they are staying with family, friends or total strangers, or in public buildings prepared by local authorities to welcome internally displaced people.</p> <p>  I do not think direct negotiations on grain between Russia and Ukraine are possible.  We would not engage in direct communication because that would be totally wrong, as it would be used by Russia as more leverage on us.  That is why we believe this is the responsibility of many international organisations and nations.  There is no direct negotiation between Russia and Ukraine on that issue.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right that our capacity to deal with investigations is far from being enough.  That is why we have asked different countries that are able to send forensic experts and special prosecutors to Ukraine to help us to deal with this need to document and do it in accordance with the standards that will be needed for the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice.  If Ireland is able to provide any additional capacity in that respect, the office of the prosecutor general would welcome those efforts.  A serious team from France and from some other countries has worked with us but it will not be enough.  More atrocities and additional crimes are being revealed in newly liberated territories.  We hear terrible stories from near Kharkiv from people who have gone through that occupation.</p><p>These are people we would know, not some stranger or an official.  It is hard to imagine what was happening in these territories.  One would think we had seen it all after Bucha but that is far from the truth.</p><p> With regard to the statement by Kissinger, I am very grateful to the Deputy for putting so eloquently that Kissinger made a disgraceful comment.  I am happy that here and across the meetings we are having both online and offline with our counterparts, there are few who would dare to put it that way but there are some.  Also, there are some countries that may not express this directly but are hinting, under the pretext of saving the lives of Ukrainians, that Ukraine should make some concessions and basically agree to the loss of some of the territories.  These countries do not understand that these are exactly the concessions that were made before and that in 2014, Ukraine listened to its partners.  We were weak at the point - our chain of command was ruined after the former president of the Caucasus fled the country and so on - and it was extremely difficult.  We were asked by our partners not to shoot back, resist or fight back.  That was a huge mistake.  Let us be clear.  We have not been protected by the fig leaf of the Budapest memorandum, a sheet of paper that did not provide assurances, not to mention guarantees after we had given up the third biggest arsenal of nuclear weapons in the world.  Therefore, we have learned our lesson from those suggestions in 2014 and we are not going to make the same mistake on our side again.</p><p> President Zelenskyy addressed the whole forum here in Davos online and this morning he spoke on the broadcast of the Ukrainian breakfast at Davos.  He made pretty clear that Ukrainians do not agree to concessions but we definitely understand that at some point there will be discussions on a peace agreement and that wars are finished by peace talks.  However, he said he would prefer Ukraine, on one side, with international partners that have been critical in helping us to go through this dire challenge, if one can call the war just a challenge, and, on the other side, some representative of Russia who can take a decision.  I do not think we are considering on any level at this particular moment any real negotiations that would envisage anything but an exchange of prisoners of war and hostages and the establishment of humanitarian corridors between the occupied and non-occupied territories, while there is a ceasefire and a potential withdrawal of Russian troops.  These are the only logical topics for talks to take place at this moment.  We are not talking about the possibility of Ukraine giving up any part of our land.</p><p> Let us suggest, for example, that France gives Nice to Russia or that Germany gives Bavaria to Russia.  That would be totally wrong.  People must understand that concessions only indulge an additional appetite for Putin, the Russian regime and the Russian Federation.  That will be seen and used as a weakness, which will lead to additional attacks and additional destruction in the future.  That is why it is a no-go for us.  As Golda Meir, the former President of Israel, once said, there is little room for compromise between those who have come to kill you and your desire to live and survive.  That is where we are right now.  We understand that the situation is existential for us.</p><p> With regard to naming the countries that are still sceptical, the Deputy is right that it is about our EU candidacy status.  They are France, Germany, the Netherlands unfortunately, Belgium, and Austria to some extent, and Cyprus.  We are looking around and trying to understand in which direction to go or lean.  There are quite a few countries with which to work and that is why the parliamentary connections of members of the committee are very important in that regard.</p><p> I do not know if any members are involved in the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.  That is another assembly that will take place.  Perhaps members could work with delegations of other countries directly or offline.  That would also be helpful at this point.  I apologise.  Members can disregard that statement.  However, notwithstanding that Ireland is not a member of NATO, it is represented on other parliamentary assemblies.  Ukraine participates in the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, although we are not a member.</p></speech>

My first question is on the response of the Irish Government and Irish people in dealing with the new Ukrainian members of our communities who have arrived on our shores.  What feedback has the delegation received from refugees who have come here about that response?  Is there anything that we could do better or do more off?  Is there anything that is making it difficult for people to settle here and integrate?</p> <p>  Are the witnesses satisfied with how the Irish Red Cross is operating?

I cannot think of anything additional that can be provided to our citizens.  The only thing that I would pay attention to is education, and I believe that should come from the Ukrainian ministry of education.  We appreciate the possibility for children to attend school here but we must all ensure, maybe at EU level and then international level, that Ukrainian children while they remain abroad receive lessons on Ukrainian history and in their own language.</p><p>Maybe they could be provided online from the schools in Ukraine.  Additionally, among the Ukrainian refugees in countries that have accepted a high number, there may be teachers who could teach the lessons.  Maybe that could be arranged on the spot.  One of the issues we face right now is discussing how to approach this systemically and as soon as possible if the conflict is to go on.  This is to ensure the children do not lose the understanding of who they are while they are away and waiting for the possibility to go home.</p><p> I do not know much about the operations in Ukraine of the Irish Red Cross specifically.  Maybe the ambassador would be better equipped to address this issue.  I will tell members about the International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC, an international organisation.  We have been discouraged by its low efficiency and ability to open up the work on the ground in Ukraine, in addition to its unexpectedly low level of performance.  I am not talking about the national Red Cross but the ICRC.  Initially, UN agencies were basically not present on the ground in Ukraine.  I thought it was totally disturbing in respect of any understanding of the efficiency of those institutions and considering all the money going to the region.  In Moldova, where members&rsquo; colleagues have been visiting, families receiving refugees are supposed to get compensation through UN agencies.  Only 2,000 families have been dealt with.  There are 95,000 refugees there.  The organisations are claiming they do not have enough personnel or staff and so on but are sitting on huge loads of money that would have made a difference for those in need.</p></speech>

We are working on establishing additional Saturday or Sunday Ukrainian schools here.  We have two of them, in Cavan and Dublin, but we need more.</p> <p>  The one challenge is accommodation.  Of course, members know about that.  Unfortunately, our displaced people have to move to other places.  For instance, Ukrainians may be in a hotel in a town, city or village for a month and are then moved by the authorities to another place, and then to yet another.  It is a little difficult for children if they are going to one school and then have to change to another, and then another.  The same applies to adults.  Most Ukrainians have found and started work, but, if they have to move, they have to find another job.  That is a little bit of a problem.</p> <p>  With regard to the Irish Red Cross, I had a meeting with its secretary general.  He told me most of the donations will be spent here for displaced Ukrainian people and that there is a fund, or something like that, that will be transferred to Ukraine for rebuilding the country after the war.  We are in contact, but, since the Red Cross is an independent organisation, the embassy does not control its activity.</p></speech>

It is very useful for me and I hope we can share ideas.</p> <p>  I have two questions, one of which is on accession, which was touched on earlier.  There is a debate in the European institutions about moving away from a technocratic approach to accession, which is based on full compliance with the Copenhagen criteria, to a more political approach, which would allow for the fact that some of the accession candidates do not necessarily meet all the compliance criteria.  The EU of 2022 is very different from what it was when we joined 50 years ago, when it was known as the European Economic Community.  Ireland was very poor then and not quite as socially progressive as it is now.  There was a heightened state of tension over conflict on the island of Ireland in 1972, when we joined.  Despite this, we blossomed.  Ireland is a poster boy for accession and has demonstrated that convergence can happen within the EU.  A debate on moving away from the technocratic approach is occurring in the EU institutions.  My question is for Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze, in particular.  If the European Council does not grant accession-candidate status to Ukraine at its June meeting, what will be the reaction politically and among the people in Ukraine, particularly if the sixth sanctions package has still not passed, which is quite likely?  The US introduced an oil embargo on 8 March but we still have not done anything.  We have been talking about it for three months.  If we do not grant accession status and do not manage to deliver the sixth sanctions package, I believe there will be a negative reaction.  Perhaps Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze could go into that in a little more detail.</p> <p>  My second question is on the humanitarian response.  Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze mentioned the unexpectedly low level of performance of the ICRC and stated UN agencies are not present.  That is very worrying because the Irish Red Cross has attracted donations of &euro;35 million, which is unprecedented.  It is really important that it deliver this time.  However, it must comply with the humanitarian principles of independence, neutrality and impartiality.  There is a very clear mandate.  I have heard from many Ukrainian MPs who are frustrated by the ICRC because it has had meetings with Mr. Sergey Lavrov.  It has opened an office in Rostov, Russia, but quite rightly states it has to do this to have the authority and credibility to do prisoner exchanges, open humanitarian corridors and visit Ukrainian prisoners in Russian territory.  Maybe Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze could elaborate on the current attitude to the ICRC and whether there is an understanding of its mandate.  Is the frustration really about its failure to deliver in terms of programming given the massive donations made by the public in Ireland and the rest of Europe over the past couple of months?</p></speech>

It is about a ray of hope for the Ukrainian people.</p><p>It is also part of the understanding that when we get to the point where the real peace negotiations take place with Russia, we will be not only by our desire psychologically but also with some kind of promise of ability for us to get to the union we will be embedded in the EU.  We might think of whether the Ukrainian authorities have been right in raising expectations internally at home, at least insisting on this publicly and so on.  We do not see that happening for sure.</p><p> It is not only a political decision.  Yes, we are talking about a political decision, but we have also delivered responses to the questionnaires provided from the European Commission.  Hopefully, the Commission will be ready with its assessment of those answers soon.  I hope that the basics of the Copenhagen criteria will be met by Ukraine in many areas.  We are not talking exclusively because we are fighting the war and dying for our European choice but this is also based on the fact that Ukraine has delivered upon a lot of things already.  The combination of these two things is drastically important to take this perhaps brave step that would envisage the possibility of further engagement for the EU.</p><p> Regarding the ICRC and UN agencies, I said that for the first month and a half after invasion, UN agencies were almost not present there.  Now they are, but the scope of their presence and the scope of their performance from my perspective is not corresponding to the level of financing they are receiving and to the level of trust that many in society are putting in them by donating their money specifically to the UN agencies as well.  I understand that the ICRC needs to be impartial and neutral.  It needs to have the open corridors for conversation and dialogue with both sides to any conflict anywhere.  However, so far we also need to understand that its opening an office in Rostov did not really lead to its ability to visit prisoners of war in Russian territory.</p><p> It has been the case throughout the war - for eight years already - that we have always granted access to those who have been legally detained on our territory who have come to kill us, but the ICRC never really had access to people detained in the occupied territories in eastern Ukraine or Crimea or on the territory of the Russian Federation.  That is why there is so much dissatisfaction that the organisation is doing so much by working with Russian authorities but we do not see the protection and even the basic rights of prisoners of war being protected by the ICRC on Russian territory.</p></speech>

Regarding accession, what are the Ukrainian Government's plans to address the objections of other member states between now and June?  The Taoiseach is also in Davos and he has reiterated this morning Irish support for Ukraine's candidate status.  I am concerned that some of the sanctions and the corporate reaction are virtue signalling based on the corporate profile of organisations.  What is Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze's message to the corporate giants gathered in Davos about their response to date?  What does she expect from them in future?</p></speech>

All the questions bar one have been asked.  She said that some negotiations are taking place on the exchange of prisoners and humanitarian corridors and that there is no question of Ukraine ceding territory.  How important is it to have an independent foreign policy arising from these negotiations in due course whenever they take place?  Obviously, Ukraine has our full support in its application to join the EU.  Is there any question of Ukraine considering being militarily neutral or is NATO membership very important for Ukraine?</p></speech>

It is important that representatives of different friendly countries are also doing an advocacy job for Ukraine.  Regarding the message right now, the decision of the government was that a few ministers, including the Deputy Prime Minister who has responsibility for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration would now travel to certain sceptical countries to argue our case.  We, as MPs, are also working through the friendship groups like the European integration committee engaging with the people from the foreign affairs committee to mobilise all the resources.  We are also co-ordinating our efforts with non-governmental organisations that are also actively connecting.  Obviously, the president is also involved in this endeavour.  We hope that this multilayer approach will give the result by the end of June.</p> <p>  I see how much difficulty there has been on agreeing the sixth package of sanctions.  I reiterate that we need to be serious about our values and our principles if we really mean all those words that have been repeated so many times.  I was in the NGO sector before getting involved in politics following the revolution of dignity in 2014.  I was brought up on those values that we believe in.  On behalf of all those who taught us those values, some doing it from textbooks, we would like to really stand up for them and be ready to pay the price for them as well.  That type of discussion needs to happen sometimes openly but sometimes behind closed doors in the EU.</p> <p>  One of my main messages to the corporate giants is about responsibility and some honest solidarity towards Ukrainian companies but also about responsibility in not having the blood of Ukrainians on the profits they are getting.</p><p>Short-term losses in the Russian Federation could be a result of this responsibility and the value-based business strategies.  It could bring about bigger and better results in the mid- to long-term future.  Some are engaged in social responsibility.  Unfortunately, some are performing very strange policies of really protecting lives for about two years by withdrawing from the Russian Federation but paying one year or two years' salary to their former employees in the Russian Federation.  Maybe they could match that pledge with some assistance going to Ukraine.  It is case-by-case.  There are a lot of corporations here which understand a value-based approach very well.  They are leading by example and engaging others and are advocating with other companies in order to get out of the Russian Federation.</p><p> I thank the member for the question with regard to independent foreign policy.  I am one of those people who believes that neutrality for Ukraine, if it is accepted today, would mean slavery for us tomorrow.  It would confirm that Russia would have us under its sphere of influence and that we would be coming back to the great power struggle which lead to the First World War and the Second World War.  In 2014, according to our constitution, our laws and our legal system, we were a non-aligned and a non-bloc country.  That did not preclude the Russian Federation, which was a guarantor of our security, from grabbing part of our territory by illegal annexation and from starting the war in the east of Ukraine.  Therefore, once we win this war and once we restore our territory's integrity, the first step should be Ukraine being admitted to NATO.  Ukraine will be a huge asset to NATO and we will also benefit from being with other like-minded countries.  That common strength will be another deterrent to Russia from attacking further.</p><p> I would like to close by once again thanking the committee for such a thorough engagement in all the matters that are so important right now for Ukraine.  I would like to thank Ireland and the Irish people, Parliament, politicians and Government for everything they are doing for Ukraine.  I would encourage them not to get fatigued or tired.  As value-based societies, we do not have the right to be tired of this war until we bring it to common victory.  It has to be our common cause to achieve victory over the evil that has arisen again in the 21st century.</p></speech>

One of the many benefits Ukraine will realise when it hopefully takes its place in the EU eventually is how we feed in.  We had an Irish MEP here.  He was elected by Ireland and he comes to our national Parliament.  There is joined-up thinking.  It was good to see Mr. Barry Andrews, MEP, contribute earlier.</p> <p>  I would like to thank the ambassador for finding the time in a very busy schedule to visit Barretstown in County Kildare recently.  We had a large attendance there.  It was a place for volunteers on the front line to meet each other and to learn what is and what is not going well, but also a place for displaced Ukrainians fleeing the war to meet each other.  The event in Barretstown was a very successful.  Barretstown itself is open to all children, including children from Ukraine with serious illnesses.  It has really stepped up.</p> <p>  I received a number of representations on the day from the ambassador's proud country people.  Two of them took me by surprise.  I did not have to respond in writing but there was a bit of an impromptu clinic in Barretstown.  Two Ukrainian citizens asked me how they could thank Ireland for doing what it is doing.  They said they would really like to get that appreciation across.  It was a very touching moment.  Ireland, of course, has had its dark periods in the past, including the Great Famine.  It is the very least we can do in this awful, horrendous situation.</p> <p>  Most questions have been asked but I had another representation on that and I wonder whether it is materialising yet.  I am aware of at least two displaced Ukrainians in County Kildare who are so grateful for the welcome they got.  They will forever remember Ireland but despite the warmth of the welcome, they have decided to go home to the western part of their country because they are absolutely heartbroken being wrenched from their homeland.  Is that happening yet?  Does the ambassador have any information on traffic going back?  I emphasise that these people love Ireland but they have made plans to return to the western part of Ukraine.  Were they isolated incidents or is happening more generally?</p></speech>

The number of people who are returning to Ukraine exceeds the number who are leaving.  It is equal now.  I would say the number of people who are fleeing the country now is very low.  As can be seen,  the number of new arrivals to Ireland has decreased and has plateaued.  Of course, we hope that as the situation gets better in Ukraine, more people will return.</p> <p>  I thank the Chair for inviting me and our chair, Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze.

We represent staff who supported customers throughout Covid and went to work each day providing a professional customer service in very challenging circumstances.  Staff who show loyalty and dedication to their job on a daily basis are now been asked to shoulder the burden of decisions made by others to reduce customer services, cut staff numbers and, in the words of each of the banks, condense their call centre opening times, which is all being done to force customers to move to digital platforms.  We see ourselves and, more importantly, our members as key stakeholders in the finance sector.</p> <p>  The exit of Ulster Bank and KBC is the biggest logistical event to occur in the sector since the introduction of the euro.  It was clear from the outset that a change this seismic would require the setting of realistic timelines for completion, extra resources and staff to cope with the additional workload and the collaboration of all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is a transparent and co-ordinated approach to problem-solving.  It is a pity the banks did not adopt this approach from the start.  Banks take a very blunt approach to change and we stressed in all our meetings with them and other stakeholders that appropriate time, resources and transparency must be dedicated to this issue for a successful outcome and to gain the trust of the public.  The important issue of staff well-being and welfare had to be central in any decision-making process.</p> <p>  All the main retail banks have reduced their headcount during the past 12 to 18 months.  They have reduced customer services through branch closures, the removal of ATMs from local communities and reduced opening hours in their call centres.  This was all done with the knowledge that Ulster Bank and KBC would be exiting the sector.</p> <p>  The Financial Services Union expressed serious concern about staffing numbers as all reports and indications for some time have pointed to long waiting times for customers and staff shortages in branches and call centres.  Our concerns were ignored as issues such as the removal of the pay cap for senior management was prioritised by the banks and their lobby group, the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI.  It does not take much understanding of the sector to know the exit of two main retail banks would overload an already creaking system unless proper, detailed planning was undertaken and implemented prior to the exiting banks taking the decision to set timelines for customers to move.</p> <p>  Ulster Bank was aware when announcing the six-month deadline that the leaving banks were not ready to deal with the exits and the leaving banks knew despite their public utterances that they were not ready to cope with the additional workload.  This was confirmed last week by the receiving banks and also by the Central Bank on a number of occasions, one as recently as in its roundtable discussions with the CEOs of the main retail banks.</p> <p>  We have growing concerns for the health and safety of staff faced every day now with customers frustrated because they cannot open accounts on demand and dealing on the phone with customers still experiencing long waits who are equally frustrated.  This is against a background of the Irish Banking Culture Board's independent staff surveys showing staff suffering stress in two successive surveys.  In such circumstances, staff resilience is waning and hence our serious concern for staff, particularly from a mental health perspective.</p> <p>  On foot of our concerns, we employed an independent polling company, Ireland Thinks, to survey our members on staffing levels in their branch or department and how it is affecting customers services and their own well-being.  The results are stark and expose the reality.  We are launching the survey results today, Wednesday, and ask that urgent action be taken to respond to the growing concerns of staff and customers.  The survey results indicate that 88% of respondents feel stressed at work, either on a regular or very regular basis; 73% feel their workload has increased due to the exits of Ulster Bank and KBC; and 87% of respondents feel their department or branch is not adequately staffed.  This figure rises to more than 90% in both AIB and Bank of Ireland.  When asked what arrangements are in place when a branch is short-staffed, the predominant answer in an open-ended question was none.  Some 87% of respondents feel staffing difficulties have led at some point to bad customer service.  When asked are staff shortages impacting their personal life, 80% of respondents replied that staff shortages are either greatly or somewhat impacting their personal lives.  These results should not be tolerated in any sector but when the State is a shareholder and the sector is regulated by the Central Bank, these results should act as an urgent call to action for both.</p> <p>  We welcome the recent intervention of the Central Bank as the regulator in calling in the banks' CEOs and impressing on them the need to provide additional resources and to work in an inclusive manner with all relevant stakeholders.</p><p> A number of actions would give a basis for some hope that, working together, we can manage the exit of Ulster Bank and KBC in a manner that will not aversely affect staff and customers.  The actions would include but would be not limited to: a task force to be convened by the regulator to co-ordinate the agreed implementation plan; a transparent process where stakeholders can see how many accounts have been closed and switched on a weekly basis; a detailed plan in respect of staff recruitment; the setting up of a dedicated desk in each branch to deal with customers looking to switch accounts or open new accounts due to the exit of both banks; banks to publish training plans and statistics for new staff and for upskilling existing staff; a reversal of the opening hours curtailment for all bank call centres; a stop to any plans for banks to move to cashless branches over the next two years; a comprehensive communication plan for customers; and a commitment by Ulster Bank and KBC to keep the existing branches open until at least the end of 2023.  Despite the good work being done by the culture board, the recent survey undertaken by Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes on behalf of the Department of Finance shows that 58% of respondents feel that culture in the banks has either not changed, disimproved a little or disimproved a lot since the financial crisis.  This clearly shows that an urgent change in thinking, followed by actions, is required across the sector.</p><p> The FSU launched a policy document at the recent banking review round table held in Tullamore.  The document is our input to the ongoing discussion on the future of banking.  The imminent departure of Ulster Bank and KBC and the arrival of new digital platforms, taken together with hundreds of branch closures, removal of ATMs from local communities and ongoing reduction of staff across the main retail banks, show a real need for the sector to actively plan for the future.  A better and more innovative approach is required that involves all relevant stakeholders.  We need to build a stakeholder banking model like what works successfully across a number of European countries.  This requires new thinking from the banks and a willingness to change.  Better and more inclusive governance, with the inclusion of worker directors and a consumer advocate on the board of each of the retail banks, would put the interests of consumers and staff at the centre of decision-making.  If this was in place now a consumer and staff voice would have been articulated, which may have helped us to avoid the issues we are all experiencing.  We can achieve an orderly exit of Ulster Bank and KBC.  FSU is committed to that but banks must adopt an inclusive and progressive approach, work with stakeholders and show a genuine appreciation of the concerns of staff and customers.</p></speech>

In the context of the challenges that the retail banks have faced and that have been evident in recent months and since Ulster Bank and KBC announced that they are exiting the Irish market, it has been evident that the FSU has called it right from the get-go.  It anticipated that because of a scheme of staffing cuts across the retail banking sector the banks would not be capable of taking the kind of customer-focused and customer-centred approach that the Central Bank said they must take when managing the exit of two main banks.  The FSU called it correctly on the challenges that would be there for the receiving banks.  It said time and again that reducing hours and staff numbers in call centres would create problems.  That has come to pass and was clear from the evidence provided by the banks that appeared before us last week.  The timelines they set out from the get-go simply could not be achieved because of all the issues the FSU has highlighted in recent months and the FSU was correct.</p> <p>  I will ask a few questions in the limited time available to me.  I have to leave the meeting early, which I apologise for.  Could the witnesses elaborate on why they think a task force should be established to oversee the exit of Ulster Bank and KBC?  The idea and concept of a task force is a good idea and it needs to be inclusive.  Was that concept put to the Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland and to the Central Bank in the FSU's engagement with both?</p></speech>

We put that to them and we believe it is necessary.  We have already had a change in exit dates.  KBC announced a three-month window which has now gone up to six months and Ulster Bank announced that it branch network would close earlier and now it has extended that again.  If you look at it, it is extraordinary that KBC's extension brings it further into 2023 than the larger Ulster Bank.  KBC has 12 branches and Ulster Bank has 88.  As I understand from KBC's presentation last week, it is talking about an August exit and Ulster Bank is talking about a March exit.  If that is not a recipe for chaos, I do not know what is.</p> <p>  This can work, and we want it to work.  We have being saying publicly since January how it can work, but we are looking for engagement with the other key stakeholders, including the banks, the regulator and the Department, to pull together a comprehensive plan that customers, in the first instance, and, just as importantly, staff can get behind and agree on.  There is no certainty and nobody knows what the next date will be.  We think a realistic date is the end of 2023 and we can work towards that.</p></speech>

They are under tremendous pressure, which I know about from speaking to banking staff in my constituency, and that is objectively presented through the survey material and responses to the Ireland Thinks research, which is important to put on the record.  Is Mr. O'Connell in any way reassured by what he heard from the retail banks last week?  There seem to be some mixed messages.  I put a question to them about the reduced hours of opening and the reduced headcounts in call centres and they responded in a convoluted way and I am not sure they answered the question as comprehensively as I would like.  The FSU seems to be at odds with the banks, which are claiming they have not reduced their headcounts.  They say they have changed hours to some degree and that those who are leaving the call centres are moving up in the banks.  Mr. O'Connell would still agree that call centres need to properly staffed and that they need additional numbers to manage this process.  Has the FSU put a number to all of the receiving banks for the staff they ought to hire over the coming period?</p></speech>

The banks are converting a lot of people who are still working and who were working at the start of the year within the banks, and people are being made redundant.  There was a high number of redundancies over the past month in the banks so if they are still making people redundant it is not a fixed piece.  One of the most cynical moves during Covid was the reduction in call centre hours.  You can look at some of the websites today and they still refer to the hours being temporarily reduced due to Covid, staffing issues and so forth.  That became permanent in some of the banks and staff numbers were reduced accordingly.  That went to the point where the Central Bank identified that there was an average of a two-hour wait for calls.  I ask the Deputy to put himself in the shoes of someone working in that call centre who receives a call from any of us after we have waited for two hours.  It will not be a pleasant exchange but that is the exchange they have every day.  That is why we have concerns about the mental well-being of employees in the banks.</p></speech>

On that point, I am attracted to the FSU's proposal that every branch should have a desk that would be occupied by staff to help people to open new accounts.  That would be a positive development.  Ulster Bank said last week that it is working with the other banks to ensure there are staff available from the exiting and receiving banks to enable staff who are closing accounts in Ulster Bank to switch or open new accounts with the banks that are remaining in the market.</p> <p>  I have two further questions.  The FSU has almost admitted that the timelines the banks have announced are just not achievable and that this cannot be realistically done in the customer-centred and customer-focused way the Central Bank wants it to be done until late 2023.</p><p>I would venture that Mr. O'Connell knows more about this than some people at senior levels of the banks.  He deals with it every day, represents the staff and knows what the challenges are.  Does he believe that if it is the case that those timelines, which were introduced by the banks themselves, are unrealistic and unachievable, the Central Bank should use the power it has to instruct them to extend that timeline?  If they are committed to the customer-centred approach they say they are, will that not be required?</p></speech>

We have very little data at the moment on customers switching and so on, but the data we have tell us that it will require a timeline such as that we have outlined.  It is not as straightforward as just closing an account.  New credit lines will have to be negotiated with the new bank if there is a credit card or an overdraft and that will take time and resources because it has to be a person-to-person exchange.  We should not try to funnel people into a situation but rather create an horizon whereby people will feel comfortable that they are going to be supported through the process.</p></speech>

There is one missing body in the Central Bank's engagement on this.  It has had round-table discussions with the CEOs, but it ought to have included representatives of the workers in the bank, who know best what is required.  It should do that now.</p> <p>  My final question relates to the references Mr. O'Connell made to the future of retail banking.  It is welcome that there is now a process in place that will look at the future of retail banking.  It might not be as extensive as the kind of banking forum that people, including me, originally proposed.  Nevertheless, it is a very useful and important exercise and something the FSU has, rightly, for a number of years been calling for.  There will now be a banking duopoly in Ireland, with a challenger bank in Permanent TSB that has some capacity to get some more market share and be more important to the overall economy.  My remaining time is limited and our guests may elaborate on this later when my colleagues make observations and put their questions to them.  At a high level, how should the future of retail banking in this country look?</p></speech>

Equally, other people will be digitally literate and comfortable in that space.  Nevertheless, people have challenges and there are warnings all over the place at the moment regarding cybersecurity, so people have to have access to other human begins to be able to work with that blend.  If digital works for me or the Deputy, that is perfect, but it does not work for everybody.  The numbers that were outlined in the survey conducted by the Department of Finance show that a sizeable number of our population still want access to, and still want to do their banking through, a branch model.</p></speech>

I was in the Chamber, otherwise engaged, and could not leave.</p> <p>  I welcome our guests and thank Mr. O'Connell for his opening statement.  I agree entirely that personal attention to the customer is vital.  That will not change.  Banking systems, insurance systems and every other system we want to call on can do what they will to make it impersonal in the hope that will stick, but it will not.  The closing of branches and ATMs throughout the country is an indication of what the intentions are.  Eventually, there will be no branches and they will all disappear.  At present, customers have to make phone calls to a call centre, waiting for up to three quarters of an hour to get through.  That is utterly crazy nonsense, as though it would be tolerated in any other country, yet we all compete.  As an economy, we are in competition with other countries that have better services and facilities.</p> <p>  We all dealt with the banks in the aftermath of the financial crash regarding individual cases.  In some cases, customers were treated sympathetically, and in others they were not.  It depended on the individual and that still applies.  While I accept I was treated with courtesy and respect in my dealings, with very few exceptions, with the banks at management level, it did not always transpire that, in the smaller detail, banking staff were treated all that well.  One would have expected that banking staff would be treated with consideration and due respect, not least given most of those people had worked for the banks for several years.  They had worked unsocial hours and done all the extra duties they were called on to do, and there was no recognition of that at all.  The banks need to remember that now because it is not all over yet.  This game is not over, by a long shot.</p> <p>  I return to the closing of ATMs.  ATMs have been closed throughout the country but worst of all is the insult that the ATM in the Houses of the Oireachtas was closed.  There was not any consultation with the Members and no major upheaval took place, but it went in an instant and banks and financial institutions are since making excuses as to why it should remain closed.  Of course, the people we represent throughout the country have no chance if the Houses of the Oireachtas are going to be treated in that fashion.  I have had a discussion to say it is of the utmost importance that the banks realise that treating the Houses of the Oireachtas with some degree of respect is also essential.  In the course and aftermath of the financial crash, we all made extreme efforts to ensure whatever could be done to assist on either side would be done.  We tried to assure customers on a one-to-one basis that all was not lost and that we could recover given time, good advice and good practices.  That was not necessarily followed in all cases either, and there were many cases where the banks came forward and said the proposal was unsustainable.  They meant it was unsustainable for the bank but there was nothing about the customer, who did not count.  In my dealings with senior management in the banks, they were always very courteous and anxious to comply in every way possible.  Unfortunately, however, in the small detail and the course of events, that did not always follow.  We need some further illumination of what the proposals are.  While it was stated in the case of the Houses of the Oireachtas that it would cost too much to maintain an ATM, there is a cost in retaining customer satisfaction as well and that applies at all times to all people in all businesses.</p> <p>  I mentioned the issue of the transfer, which the banks may or may not respond to, as they see fit.  The transfer could have been smooth and seamless.  That was the way the banks leaving the jurisdiction was supposed to happen.  There was supposed to be no impact on the customer, but it is the other way around.  The impact is on the customer, the banks do not care and the response involves documents or letters saying the customer are required to do X, Y and Z.  Electronically, it is possible to transfer accounts in a way that was never available previously.  It involves getting permission from the customer, doing the job that was intended and making it smooth, seamless and effective, but that was not done and we do not know whether it will ever be done or whether it was ever intended to be done.  The longer we allow that to continue and the longer we allow ourselves to be treated to be contempt when we raise these questions, the worse that will get and it will develop into something else.</p><p> I have mentioned previously the situation whereby bad debts were written off by banks, traditionally, and banks paid income tax.  There are still, I have no doubt at all, a large number of bad debts that were written off in a way for some people but not for others.  There is a lack of consistency and, certainly, a lack of sustainability in any application of such a regime because, ultimately, customers find out.  The theory is that customers do not talk.  Customers do talk.  Wen they do, they compare notes.  If a customer finds he or she was treated in an offhand way by any institution, a bank or otherwise, they will talk and compare notes and differences will be found.  There is a need to ensure, insofar as possible, application of a regime throughout the country that is even-handed, courteous and personal.</p><p> If the idea is to close down all communication and to have just one central location in the country from which banking will soon operate, although we know that can be done, it cannot be done to customers' satisfaction.  In view of the fact that the State is pledged to extending economic activity throughout the country, spreading it all the time and creating jobs and business activity, it is essential that in towns and villages, some with fairly substantial populations, there would be a banking system whereby people can call to branches and get cash if they need it - and do so electronically if they so wish.  This nonsense of waiting for three quarters of an hour for somebody to answer a phone is absolutely ridiculous.  Do people think we have all gone mad or gone asleep or something?  It is just crazy.  I strongly advise that the lending institutions recognise that and recognise clearly that the customer counts.  If they do not look after their customers, they will fail and there will be further financial difficulties, a lack of investment and of attention, and political and economic implications for both the banks and the general community.</p><p> Those are just a couple of matters to which I have referred previously.  I have not covered all the issues because I do not wish to take up the time of the meeting, but I say this to banks: take note.  When I walk in one morning and see an ATM being wheeled into the Houses of the Oireachtas again, I will see that as a recognition that customers count, that customers throughout the country who, in the first instance, did not count are being recognised once again and that we, the customers here, are being recognised.  For God's sake, we should not let banks try to tell us that footfall during the lockdown was not the same as it was before.  We know that.  That is not an excuse for curtailing activity anywhere other than for the time being.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Connell is correct to say that the exit of these two banks is the biggest logistical event to happen in the sector since the introduction of the euro.  Last week, we had representatives of the three remaining banks before the committee.  They also accepted that it is an extremely significant event.  The reason the committee has invited today's witnesses before us and why we invited the banks before us is that we have a concern that when the banks exit, there may be some chaos left behind.  There are hundreds of thousands of people who need to transfer their accounts from the departing banks to the remaining banks.  The witnesses will agree that we are not being irrational or overexcited in having a concern about this.  Last week, representatives of the banks were before the committee and I asked each of them individually what extra resources the banks had put in place to ensure they could facilitate face-to-face meetings between bankers in the remaining banks and new customers.  They gave answers.  I do not know if the witnesses before us had an opportunity to hear what they said.  They answered that they fully recognised the issue and had allocated more resources to deal with the impending new customers.  Are they misleading us or are they just painting a rosy picture?</p></speech>

The reality is that there are fewer staff in the banks now than there were at the start of the year.  Some 3,300 staff in the banks have been made redundant in an 18-month to 24-month period to today, and they are still leaving.  It beggars belief, therefore, that, on the one hand, the banks say they are resourcing up and trying to hire staff and, on the other, there are people going out the door every week.  We cannot reconcile the two statements, and it is very hard to get a fix, therefore, on the actual number.  There are a lot of conversions of temporary and agency positions into permanent positions, which we welcome, but those are not new posts.  They were there in January and probably the previous January.  That is why we want a task force to get that clarity of-----</p></speech>

I gave a description of a call centre.  Our information is that there is a high turnover of new entrants working there because of the customer frustration they are experiencing.  We are trying to get a fix on the actual numbers the banks are recruiting because all these numbers are thrown at us and it is very hard to decipher them.  They talk about 90 contractors, they talk about converting 60 contractors and so forth.  We should just get a straight number as to what is-----</p></speech>

What could be the manifestation of that chaos?  If this goes wrong, what does Mr. O'Connell think could happen in the financial sector?</p></speech>

The first thing the banks need to do is to staff up to business as usual in order that when the Deputy or I go into a branch, we have a reasonable expectation as to how quickly we will be served and our business dealt with.  There is a business-as-usual element and then it is a matter of dealing with this surge.  Mr. Brian Hayes talked about flattening the curve and so forth, and that aligns with what we are saying.  If the time of the exit is lengthened, that will flatten the curve and will mean that customers will be able to plan or will be booked into the calendar for some time to discuss the matter, and the banks should be well resourced at that stage.  I met with a couple of them this week and they are still resourcing staffing to get back to business as usual.  I do not know if the Deputies understand or realise this, but staff numbers were really depleted in both call centres and branches.  There is no leave reserve system in the banks.  In normal employments there is a one-in-seven leave reserve system such that an additional person is hired so all staff can go on leave.  That does not apply in the banks.  I guarantee the committee that there were phone calls today between branches that resulted in people having to travel in order that branches could open because they do not even have minimum staffing.  We are not there yet.  The banks have committed to resourcing, but they need to be transparent, and that is where the transparency piece of our suggestion comes in.  They should be transparent with the numbers.  They should tell people that they will staff up to their complement in each branch across the country and in the call centres.</p></speech>

They are the people who require face-to-face banking engagement.  Am I correct in stating that they are the people who will be disadvantaged most?</p></speech>

Some people with very simple banking needs will be able to do their banking online - there is no question about that - but if customers have overdrafts or issues with credit cards, that requires engagement and getting a time slot in order to go in to make a case or a presentation as to what their requirements are and to get that dealt with.</p><p>It takes resources and time to do this properly.  We are confident that those two ingredients are available such that we can have a successful exit for the two banks.  However, if they are not available &mdash; this is Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's point &mdash; people who are least capable of being in that position will find themselves in distress.  Who wants to be a part of that?</p></speech>

The representatives seemed quite committed to it.  I presume Mr. O'Connell would like to see the regulator exerting itself more, saying one cannot leave if the appropriate number of transfers have not occurred.  Would that be fair to say?</p></speech>

Bringing in the CEOs and stressing to them the importance of success in this regard is a very good starting point.  The customer- and staff-centric approach of a task force, including the banks, would give us the transparency required.  However, we have already moved the dates once.  Our prediction, on which we have been fairly accurate so far, is that there will be a move again.  We would much prefer a collaborative approach with an agreed timeline to which we would all work.</p></speech>

We are calling for the data to be published so people can track them and then make decisions and timelines that suit them.

We have been out since these announcements were made.  Initially, we petitioned for Ulster Bank not to go.  With regard to KBC, the development came out of the blue for everybody.  We committed that we would work with Ulster Bank and the other banks as long as there was an orderly transfer.  What transpired?  One bank broke ranks and issued letters when the Central Bank, the regulator itself, was saying the banks were not ready.  We are still in that position because the staffing is not up to speed.  We are now in a situation in which one bank has declared and another is starting from 1 June, yet the regulator and we are saying the system is still not at a point where there is no need for us to talk about this anymore and where there is a seamless change for people so they can be served in branches or by call centres in a way that facilitates an orderly transfer.  We are not at that point yet.</p></speech>

Does Mr. O'Connell share our concern that there will be a requirement for face-to-face contact repeatedly?  Does he fear, like some members of this committee, that it is the ongoing objective of banks to transfer everyone to online banking, thereby reducing the number of staff and increasing profits?</p></speech>

During Covid, we all changed our behaviours because we had to.  Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland was publishing footfall figures &mdash; every other day, it seemed &mdash; because it wanted to emphasise that everybody was gone digital.  The Department of Finance survey busted that myth and showed that people still want to have face-to-face access.  Let me refer to the biggest problem at the moment, which has still not been dealt with and which we relayed to the Central Bank.  The behavioural change during Covid was all for the sake of public health and well-being and everybody understood the rationale, but the current change is different.  It is a change that involves two banks departing and three banks receiving.  We feel the change process is being used as a Trojan horse to force people onto digital platforms.  Consumers should be given a choice as to what platform they want to do their banking on.  By having no staff available in branches and call centres, waiting times and drop-off rates of 50%, one is being forced into a certain arrangement.  One has to do one's transaction in one way or the other.  We believe that what is happening is a Trojan horse to force people onto digital channels when they do not want that.  If people are comfortable with digital channels, that is fine &mdash; we have members working in all these areas &mdash; but it is an issue if they have no choice but to do something other than what they want because the service is so poor, locking them into that.</p></speech>

The only entity that can change that is the regulator.  If banks are not prohibited from trying to corral people into online banking, they will keep doing it and use whatever mechanism they have to achieve it.  Does the regulator not have a role to ensure a requirement that a certain percentage of staff be available to provide face-to-face contact with customers?</p></speech>

When we are talking about a customer-centric approach, we are talking about putting the customer at the centre and having all the other stakeholders work to that.  We believe the Central Bank has a genuine opportunity to influence the future shape of banking.  That is why we published our paper.  It adds a consumer- and staff-centric element to the governance of the organisations, in respect of which the real change occurs, but we also believe that the regulator has an absolute role in ensuring the banking model for the future is one in which people will have digital and face-to-face banking when they need them and can make a call to a call centre when they need to.</p></speech>

Given this and the fact that the change occurred during Covid, we believe the regulator had a role to play.  This is the opportunity to ensure the model does not reflect what occurred before.  Poor customer service should be a thing of the past, the ability to bank however you wish should exist, and the system should operate much more transparently than it does today.</p></speech>

Welcome to the committee.  Some ground has been covered by my colleagues.  I thank the Financial Services Union representatives for appearing before the committee.  I wish to put on record again my appreciation and that of my party for the work the union does in the financial sector.  It is an example of the benefits that come with greater trade union density and collective bargaining.  It is a good example of how that could bring other benefits to our economy.</p> <p>  We are in the middle of a major shift in banking in the State.  One of my colleagues suggested they were the first to call for a banking forum to be established.  In fairness, it was the Financial Services Union that called for it first.  We supported that call at an early point and then other parties did so.  It is a pity we do not have the structure that is desired but the engagement in Tullamore was quite interesting.</p> <p>  Some 1 million customers will be transferred to receiving institutions.  Some of them may not be banks but post offices and credit unions.  Since people may be watching, it is important for this committee to state there are also opportunities for people to open accounts in post offices and credit unions.</p><p>We have seen the Central Bank report about telephone delays.  I have been on the end of a call waiting for over an hour with AIB, missing loads of calls to me in that time and it is getting worse.  I can understand if anger is being vented on the staff even though it is no fault of theirs but they are on the receiving end.  In my case I never got through because I gave up after an hour.  We put it to the banks' representatives last week and they said that was old that it is all sorted.  They told us it was taking about 45 seconds and the outlier might be four minutes.  From the experiences of the Financial Services Union, is that an accurate reflection of waiting times with call centres today?</p></speech>

We await the second publication from the Central Bank which will either make that assertion stand up or we will expose it.  We do not have access to the data.  We only have access to our colleagues who work in the call centres and the level of pressure they are under.  Even today one of them identified to us that their unit is understaffed while top management is pursuing them on the issue of relief breaks for toilet and so forth oh.  That is the level of pressure they are feeling every day.  When they are on a call, they are receiving it from the customer who is frustrated about something, needs a query answered or whatever.  They are getting it from both sides.  I am outlining the real-time experience from a colleague today.</p></speech>

When representatives from Bank of Ireland, AIB, KBC and Ulster Bank appeared before the committee they told us about the number of staff they were hiring.  As Mr. O'Connell said, it is quite opaque because the number being hired included people who had been there for a couple of years and were being transferred from contracts that really should be counted as full time anyway so it was not additional staff.  Ulster Bank representatives claimed they had hired an additional 50 telephone staff to manage personal customers, 60 full-time employees to support business customers, 100 staff rising to 300 at peak levels across all channels.  KBC increased staff numbers in the contact centre by 30% in the past 12 months with a 25% increase in staffing in its operations centre.  AIB claimed it would deploy 70 additional staff to help deal with the influx of new customers and Bank of Ireland advised it was in the process of recruiting 100 additional contact centre staff and had mobilised dedicated programmes.  It claimed it had put an additional 500 people in place with 420 of those contract positions.  When I asked if they had been letting staff go, they suggested they had not.  Mr. O'Connell has given this committee the number of, I believe, 3,200 over the past two years.</p></speech>

It is very hard because the banks are very opaque with the numbers.  There is no doubt, based on information from their websites, that they are recruiting.  However, they are also letting people go.  It could be a zero-sum game for all we know.  This comes back to the transparency issue.  What are their staffing levels on 1 January 2022 and what are their staffing levels today?</p></speech>

Some of this was sudden, particularly with KBC, but it is not sudden anymore.  We have known of the trajectory for almost a year.  Even before Ulster Bank's announcement, there were serious concerns that this was a likelihood.  So why are banks not redeploying staff if they are letting people go?  We have this trend in banking.  When a crisis happens, for example, the tracker mortgage issue which still is not over, they take on a certain number of contract or short-term staff and then let them go.  Now there will be 1 million new customers more than likely between two or three banks and those banks will take on some people and let them go.  By the time they recruit people they are halfway through the process and people are getting frustrated because staff are not there and there are delays.  If they are letting people go, why are they not just redeploying them to this service?</p></speech>

They could simply pause the redundancies for a period of time.  In the main the people taking redundancy are very experienced officials who have a lot to contribute.  It puzzles us why somebody does not identify this as a leaking bucket, putting people in on one side while leaving people go on the other side.  When will we get to a situation where they have adequate staffing levels?  There was a call to the regulator to get the bank staffing complement to where it should be.  That will get us to business as usual.  We can then judge that to establish how many additional staff are required.</p> <p>  I gave Tullamore as the example of the future banking and its 30% deficit on the day the seminar was held.  That can be replicated across every branch in the country.  We did a survey on International Women's Day and the overwhelming response was a cry for help to get additional people to support those already in jobs.  That was before there was any publicity about anybody leaving any place.  This has been an ongoing issue.  It did not happen overnight.  However, when resources are drained to that level, it takes some effort to get it back up to a sustainable level of staff.  If the deputy were to go to work in one of these banks, what would he do?  He would contact a colleague who works there to ask what it is like there.  If it is not a positive description, he may decide not to take that up.  It is important to get the staffing right from the point of view of both the staff and the consumers.</p></speech>

Both AIB and Bank of Ireland are expecting a couple of hundred thousand extra customers and they will have fewer staff serving them than they had at the start of the year and considerably fewer staff than they had 12 months ago.  As Mr. O'Connell has pointed out there are staffing issues in all 500 bank branches throughout the country.  It would require 500 additional people just to put one extra staff member in each of those branches.  That is an example of the resources required.</p></speech>

These questions were asked last week and we may not have been given an accurate picture of redundancies.  The committee should write detailed letters to all five institutions asking about their staffing levels and the type of staff they have in place at various points over the past 18 months to provide a greater understanding.</p> <p>  How many staff were employed in KBC and Ulster Bank before they made the decision to withdraw?  If it was X amount, the staff complement at the three banks, which will take on probably about 90% of the customers and the loan books, should increase roughly by X amount.

They do not come anywhere near those.</p><p>Some banks are talking about 70 additional staff, which is a drop in the ocean.  Will the witnesses explain what is happening for customers of Ulster Bank who go into a branch of a receiving bank to open an account?  We had testimony at this committee that people must wait five days for an appointment on average.  Is that the same across the State?  Is it universal?  I come from Donegal and made the point that Ulster Bank had a heavy concentration in the Border region.  Maybe it is easier to get an appointment in Wexford where the bank might not have had as big a footprint as it did in Donegal, Cavan or Monaghan.  Have the witnesses information from their members about what is happening with appointments to open accounts?</p></speech>

That is not actually the best advice.  The best advice is to get an appointment to open an account first.  The switcher process exists and has law behind it.  The banks are required to make it available if customers want it to be available, then they start the transition.  I can use the Deputy's county as an example.  People find that when they go to one branch, they are told they cannot open an account and have to do it all online, then in another branch, they are told something different, are given a date or their name is taken and is put in a book.  We know that people are recording and so on in other counties.  The banks, including Bank of Ireland specifically, made a presentation to us.  They said they have set up a system to book in business customers, which they will set up for personal customers too.  Many resources are involved.  Looking at the workload involved, with people going flat-out, it does not equate with the numbers that have been presented to us.  That circle needs to be squared.</p> <p>  We appreciate that efforts are being made and that staffing initiatives are under way, but as the Central Bank stated last week, we are not there yet.  It again begs the question of why Ulster Bank pulled the trigger and whether KBC should pull the trigger on 1 June or if that should be deferred until the Central Bank, which is the regulator, states that the receiving banks are now ready.  It could say what the wait times are and what standard of service people can expect as customers of the receiving banks.  It is fair to ask if KBC should go ahead and if we can restart the clock with Ulster Bank.  We are saying that there needs to be a reasonable timeframe, until the end of 2023, to allow all of these things to go through.</p></speech>

This committee engages with the Central Bank and we have seen an approach from it, which is playing out in public, that is to be welcomed.  It is one thing to issue statements and do round tables with CEOs to say they are not ready, but it should not allow KBC to issue letters until it is ready.  It should not have happened with Ulster Bank either.  People are concerned and it is a major issue.</p> <p>  KBC staff will be made redundant.  In April, they received a pay increase of 2.5%, which is below what the sector secured more widely.  Do the witnesses have comments on this and the position it puts staff in who are now facing redundancy in that bank?</p></speech>

One was its right to transfer of undertakings to Bank of Ireland.  We fought that and registered a complaint with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission against the sale, on the basis that KBC would not commit to a transfer of undertakings.  In fairness, Bank of Ireland committed straight away to honouring the transfer of undertakings regulations, TUPE, but we required KBC to do it.  It eventually committed to that.</p> <p>  We put in a claim for redundancy.  While people have a right to transfer with their work, the redundancy package for those who do not transfer is decent.  The strength of being a member of a trade union came through again.  We highlighted and resolved major pension issues by referring the matter to the Labour Court.  KBC does not have a good track record with its employees or with engaging with stakeholders such as us in a collective bargaining format.  When its parent company recognises and engages with trade unions and lauds itself as being a supporter of collective bargaining in its environmental, social and corporate governance report, KBC is a two-faced coin from our point of view.  We will represent members and ensure that they are looked after, but we want engagement with KBC even at this late stage.  It should postpone matters until the regulator proclaims that the receiving banks are ready.</p></speech>

I know the Financial Services Union published its survey.  It is shocking that 80% of people are affected in different ways.  I echo the comment that while these are private banks, the State has a shareholding in many of them, which comes with responsibility.  If staff feel this type of burnout or pressure, there need to be interventions at a senior level to make sure that, where we have shareholdings, people are respected and there is dignity at work.</p> <p>  I have lost my train of thought.  I was concerned about the staff issue and morale.  We talked about KBC and Ulster Bank staff being made redundant.  Permanent TSB fought tooth and nail against an individual constituent of mine who took a case to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, FSPO.  It fought that case for many years, including for three years after the tracker mortgage examination was concluded by the Central Bank a decade since it began.  Permanent TSB has acknowledged that up to 200 other customers will be contacted and where matters have to be made good.  Some of these people lost their homes.  It is a terrible situation.</p> <p>  It is my view that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of other people who will find themselves affected by the tracker mortgage examination as more cases go through the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman and the courts.  We heard from the FSPO in Tullamore that hardly a week goes by where cases related to this do not come before her.  What happens when these apply to Ulster Bank and KBC?  What level of staff will remain in these banks a year or two after they have officially packed their bags and got out of town?  We know there has to be a regulatory presence here for many years.  What discussions have the witnesses had with those institutions about the core number of staff who will be able to make sure that these issues can be dealt with?</p></speech>

It is probably a different type of transaction in KBC.  We had a lot of engagement with Ulster Bank and reached an agreement about how staff would be dealt with when Ulster Bank was exiting.  I do not think we got to the detail of how many would remain.  There is still no decision about the tracker mortgage book in Ulster Bank.  We are at various phases for other aspects.  The banks spoke about bad debts while here last week and what they intend to do about them.  We have made our views known.  Further dialogue on those is to take place.  We think the branch network should remain until the end of 2023.</p></speech>

I thank our guests for attending.  We greatly appreciate the presentation.</p> <p>  I thank them also for the survey results they delivered to us.  Some of the figures are incredible.  Only 9% of staff feel their branch or department is adequately staffed and this falls to 6% in AIB or Bank of Ireland.  A total of 88% of staff feel their staffing difficulties are leading to bad customer service, an incredible situation.  Sometimes I believe there is a banking crisis happening in this country that is not being taken seriously by the Government.  There is a reduction in the number of banking companies, staff, branches and ATMs, and this is significantly hurting customers and staff.  That market is being radically concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer banks, which means those banks have more and more power over their customers.  It is leading to the physical retreat of banking in the sector and these decisions to retreat are motivated more by a reduction in overheads and increase in profits than by the patterns of behaviour of customers.  We often hear the banks say they are leaving the physical realm because people want to do their trade in the digital realm and are voting with their feet in that regard.  In our guests' view, is this being driven by customer wants and needs or by the desires of the banks to decrease overheads and increase profits?</p></speech>

If a bank is driven solely to satisfy its shareholders, the kinds of issues the Deputy described will continue to happen, and that is why we are at a crossroads in the banking sector in Ireland.</p> <p>  We have a choice.  We owned two of the banks and we have a stake in another bank, and we have a regulator and a Government.  We can determine the future of the banking system, just as simply as the banking system can have an input.  The central tenet of our debate and of the paper we have published on the future of banking relates to whether it should be driven solely for the benefit of shareholders.  In both banks, share buy-backs and share dividends were renewed recently, up against the kinds of services the regulator called out.  Those two issues do not equate.  Profits of that scale, at &euro;2 billion between the banks, cannot be taken while giving people that level of service and putting staff in that position daily.  There has to be equilibrium, with other stakeholders such as customers and staff getting a fair return and a fair service, given that is mainly what they look for-----</p></speech>

We are staking our claim and saying we believe the best way is to start with the governance and to include staff and consumer representation in the banks where the key decisions are made.  That should be a key focus.  There are some challenging issues in the sector, such as gender pay.   The Central Statistics Office, CSO, report of 2018 showed a 32% differential in gender pay, while some banks have published figures of 24%.  There are significant live issues to be tackled.  Others include cybersecurity, digitisation and artificial intelligence, AI.  There are many issues to consider.</p></speech>

Some claims are more difficult to take seriously than others.  One bank suggested its response times were in the seconds, yet as part of that very call, I made another call and it took two and a half minutes to get past the stage of pressing buttons for various options.  It took two and a half minutes before the call began ringing, so I do not how the bank could claim to answer calls within 58 seconds.</p></speech>

According to a UK study, it is as much as 64%.<br/><br/>As for skills lost, the Deputy makes a very good point.  These are regulated, highly professional individuals with a skill in lending that cannot be immediately replaced.  Therefore, a headcount perspective is not the correct way to look at it.  There should also be a skills aspect to what is in the industry and what is required in the industry.</p></speech>

A letter published in <i>The Irish Times</i>detailed how a lady had waited on the phone at home before going into the branch, being handed a phone, waiting on the phone and then having to abandon her exercise.  There is plenty of anecdotal stuff.  The Central Bank certainly analyses call times, but we have called on it to measure wait times in branches as well.  There is that element of frustration and there is also the expectation question of what is a reasonable period in which to get service in a bank.  The Central Bank should set out those standards.</p></speech>

The Deputy's questions make the case for what we have been calling for.  We have been aiming to bring together a task force to manage an orderly exit of both banks.  It could also be an oversight committee.  We do not really care what it is called.  There is such a lack of clarity on many of the questions.  It is very difficult to answer when you are given different numbers on staffing levels, recruitment levels and how many people are using the switching process.  Last week, the banks said that 10% were using that process.  Why is it 10%?  There need to be in the room people who are responsible for each of these matters.  Obviously, we are responsible for representing staff.  We are very happy to be in that room and to be held to account for staffing levels and so forth but we feel everybody should be in the room so there can be absolute transparency and clarity on all of the issues that have been raised today.</p></speech>

Many people - I would say nearly the majority at this stage - are living from overdraft to overdraft because of the cost-of-living crisis.  Very few people are covering all of their costs every month without having to dip into some level of overdraft.  Those overdrafts are typically secured from people's existing banks due to the relationship they have with them.  If those overdrafts are closed before another bank provides people with overdraft facilities, it will cause major financial difficulties.  What does the FSU know about how those overdrafts and debts are to be dealt with before the closures?</p></speech>

We have not seen the numbers that would allow for analysis.  That is where the time element and the question of adequate resources come in.  Anybody who is an unfortunate situation of that kind will require both of those things.  They will need time to resolve whatever issues there are and resources so that they can talk to somebody, perhaps on a number of occasions, to get those issues resolved.  Pushing everybody through the same gap just to get them through to the other side is not the answer.  It is about an orderly transition.  Let us transpose this back to the introduction of the euro.  If we had said that every bank could do what it liked about the transition to the euro, where would we have ended up?  It was a centralised approach through task forces and so on that achieved that success.  This can be a success as well, but it will not be if everybody is doing their own thing.</p></speech>

I have one last question.  It relates to cash.  With regard to the practice of banks retreating from physical banking, which I believe is the result of their profit-oriented nature and comes at a cost to communities and customers, are the banks taking a similar attitude towards cash?  Have they decided, based on a cost-benefit analysis, that it is better for there to be less cash in society and that they should make cash less available?  What is the FSU's view on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.559" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022052500002#J00900"><p>It fits into that overall picture we have painted.  We monitor the media for all mentions of banking and we see more and more reports of ATMs being out of service and no cash being available for periods of time.  These include reports about Tralee on Easter weekend and Cork on St. Patrick's weekend.  That could be remedied straight away by means of a service contract that provided for systems being restored within an hour should they go down.  Everybody has service contracts of this kind in respect of their IT systems and so forth.  The availability of cash reducing and so forth has to be part of the debate.  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is carrying out a public consultation on this matter.  We attended a future of banking forum in Northern Ireland and much of the discussion was on the issue of access to cash and how important it is to the functioning of society to have access to cash.  We are in a situation where the banks have sold off all of their ATMs aside from those located in branches.  We see a model elsewhere in which charging for ATMs comes in as the next step.  Access to cash is a central part of the debate on the future of banking.</p></speech>

Kiwibank, which is a public bank accessed through post offices, resulted in a great increase in competition within New Zealand's banking system.  Its introduction had a very health effect on the functioning of New Zealand's banking system while also making its post offices profitable and functional, allowing more to stay open.  The banking system and market in this State is in the realm of the dysfunctional, which is having a very significant effect on rural and regional Ireland, on small and medium-sized businesses and on people who are outside of the digital marketplace.  The decisions the banks are making and getting away with are being made because of a lack of competition.  I do not see any Government policy pointing towards increased competition, which means there will be no solution or end to this, which is unfortunate.  I thank all of the witnesses for the work they are doing.  It is appreciated tremendously.</p></speech>

The information provided has been very interesting.  The information from the Ireland Thinks poll of the union's membership is particularly interesting.  I will start with that mental crisis within the workforce of the banks.  The poll indicates that 88% of the FSU's members who responded regularly or very regularly feel stressed at work.  It also reports that 73% feel that stress levels and pressures have increased since the exits of Ulster Bank and KBC were announced.  We are at an early stage in this process.  The pressure will not remain the same or lessen.  It is only going to increase in the coming months, possibly rapidly at a certain point.  Everybody in society has experienced extra mental health pressures in the past two years as a result of the Covid pandemic.  These extra pressures being heaped on the FSU's members are a matter of great concern.  Do the witnesses share the view that those mental health pressures are set to increase on foot of these exits in the months ahead?  Can they give us a little bit of a sense of the workforce?  I imagine that many experienced people were lost with the job cuts in recent years.  Is the workforce mainly young?  Is it mainly female?</p><p>I would be interested in hearing about these issues.</p></speech>

Some have extensive service.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy that, if nothing changes, the situation will be serious in terms of staff well-being.  We are operating on the basis that the Government, the regulator and, in particular, the banks will sit up, take notice that there is an issue and decide to deal with it differently than they did previously because the old ways will not work and customers, staff and stakeholders will not tolerate that.  The situation does not have to be like this.  If staff saw the regulator or stakeholders taking a hold of this situation and dealing with change, they would start to feel that they were being listened to and heard.  Equally so with consumers.  Social media is on fire with people&rsquo;s experiences of financial institutions.  One need only look at social media to understand.  People are posting photos and stories of their waiting times and other experiences.</p> <p>  There is a way that this change can be managed, but what is happening is not it.  It should be done on the basis of a stakeholder approach.</p></speech>

The banks appeared before us last week and laid heavy emphasis on how they were recruiting extra staff to deal with the increased pressures resulting from the exit of the two banks.  Mr. O&rsquo;Connell has provided interesting information about people coming in one door and others going out the other.  He even raised the possibility of staffing levels continuing to decline despite the promise of extra staff.  Should the regulator intervene and put a moratorium on further job losses until such time as this situation is under control?</p></speech>

In other jurisdictions, there is an open debate on these matters.  Just as Members discovered that the ATM was removed from the Oireachtas, we do not want to wake up some morning and discover that customers have to pay to access cash.  These are the issues that we should be able to anticipate.  They have arisen in other jurisdictions.  We should be having an open debate about the model of banking that we want and whether it should be customer centric or shareholder centric.  We know what we want and we believe we know what the public wants as well.</p></speech>

The UK is considering legislation on access to cash, so it is much further ahead of us.  We have written to our Minister about considering legislation on accessing cash.  My local ATM, which was sold off a number of months ago, is now charging me &euro;2 to take out my own money.  A private operator has bought 700 to 800 ATMs and one would imagine that it is looking to make money from them.  It is only a matter of time.  It happens in the UK, although the UK has much better regulation as regards ATMs.  As Mr. O&rsquo;Connell mentioned, when we attended its banking forum a number of months ago, there was a great deal of discussion about access to cash and possible legislation.  The UK Government is running a public consultation process on the matter.  The UK tracks ATMs to see how far away people are from them, so the UK knows exactly where in the country each ATM is located, and its regulation on providing people with access to same is much stricter.</p></speech>

Permanent TSB is taking over approximately 25 of those.  Most of the 88 branches have an ATM as part of the branch network.  Once the 63 or so branches go, the ATMs will probably go with them and access to cash will be more limited in those communities.  Once something is limited, the chance of supply and demand leading to people being charged for that increases.</p></speech>

There is a third way of looking at this matter, though, which is that Ulster Bank and KBC should not be allowed to leave in the first place or, if they want to leave, that is fine but their assets stay behind and are taken into public ownership and managed in the interests of the people.

The general secretary indicated that if the correct measures were taken now, this situation could be managed and that staff would see light at the end of the tunnel as they would feel their concerns, having been voiced, were being listened to.  The flip side of that coin is that action is not taken.  I do not want that to be the case and neither does anyone here but there is no guarantee that this will not be the case.  If no action is taken and the mental health pressures, which have been vividly shown in the poll findings, were to increase as the pace and pressure of this situation increases, how bad would the scenario be in terms there being a potential mental health crisis in banks and among the union's members?</p></speech>

The findings of our poll are public in terms of how abandoned staff feel and what would start to rectify this situation.  We will not allow a crisis to happen and part of that is the publication of our figures.  The reason we got an independent survey is because the integrity of its findings could not be questioned.  Whatever the findings, we would have lived with them but it is clear that the findings send a stark message about staff and how staff feel customers have been impacted by the current free-for-all.  We need joined-up thinking to cope with this changed process.  We used a very co-ordinated process to manage the introduction of the euro and we can do the same in this situation.  Customers need not be distressed or stressed and staff do not need to be stressed.  We can resolve the situation but that requires adult conversations in order to get everybody on the one page and address the matter.</p></speech>

ESB has five main operational parts which are ESB generation; ESB Networks; engineering and major projects; the innovation strategy, which includes Northern Ireland Electricity Networks, NIE Networks; and customer solutions, and that includes our competitive retail businesses, which Mr. Colm &Oacute; Raghallaigh and I represent here today.</p> <p>  Customer solutions is primarily comprised of Electric Ireland, which sells energy to customers as well as e-cards, smart energy services, telecommunications and Electric Ireland Superhomes, which is a joint venture with the Tipperary Energy Agency.  As we are in a competitive part of the business there are regulatory rules and ring fences in place that govern our interactions with other parts of the business.</p> <p>  On the implications for customers as a result of the exit by KBC and Ulster Bank, as the committee is aware Ulster Bank announced its intention to exit the Irish market in February 2021 and KBC Ireland announced its intention to exit in April 2021.  In quarters 1 and 2 of this year, KBC and Ulster Bank, respectively, advised creditors and direct debit originators, which includes Electric Ireland, that they were preparing to write to their customers on a phased basis to inform them that they would have six months from the date of that correspondence to close their accounts with their bank.  We understand that while this process has begun there is still a significant number of letters that have yet to issue from the exiting banks.  On receipt of the letter from the bank, customers of both KBC Ireland and Ulster Bank will be prompted to open new bank accounts with another credit institution and to arrange to have any existing direct debits, standing orders or recurring card payment re-established.  Of course customers are entitled, and have been entitled, to change banks at any time for any reason.</p> <p>  As we understand it, there are two mechanisms through which customers, or their current bank, can provide new bank details to a creditor or new direct debit originator, DDO, such as Electric Ireland, or both after opening their new bank account.  Customers can update the new bank account details themselves by directly contacting Electric Ireland online or by telephone or post.  Alternatively, customers can utilise the code of conduct of the Central Bank of Ireland, CBI, on the switching of current accounts with credit institutions, which is generally known as the switching code.  The CBI's switching code requires that customers' current bank, which in this case is either KBC or Ulster Bank, would write to the existing direct debit originators such as ourselves and notify them of the customers' new bank account details.  The system in place for this notification is currently exclusively paper-based.  The CBI's switching was designed for individual bank account switchers under normal business-as-usual switching volumes.  In our view and experience, the code was not designed for bulk account switching acting resulting from the exit of banks from the Irish market.</p> <p>  In a normal year, Electric Ireland receives and processes about 2,000 direct debit amendment forms.</p><p>We consider this to be our typical or business-as-usual switching activity.  It encompasses activity from every bank in the Irish market.  We currently have a significant number of both residential and commercial customers paying their energy bills through either their KBC Bank or Ulster Bank accounts.  Some of these customers have both electricity and gas accounts or they could have multiple accounts with Electric Ireland if they have more than one premises or more than one business.  The number of Electric Ireland residential or commercial SME customers paying by direct debit through Ulster Bank and KBC Bank at present is almost 65,000.  That is broken down effectively as 16,000 for KBC Bank and 56,000 for Ulster Bank.  Some customers may have more than one account so overall we are talking about nearly 86,000 accounts with a similar split between Ulster Bank and KBC Bank.  In addition, there are approximately 400 large industrial customers paying by direct debit through either KBC Bank or Ulster Bank.  That is the scale of the activity that is impacted in our case.</p><p> The priority for Electric Ireland is to minimise the potential impacts and inconvenience to our customers by providing a smooth transition and an easy mechanism for customers to update their bank details once they have opened their new bank account.  We are mindful that our customers may have several distinct creditors or direct debit originators and payment organisations which they will need to notify of their new bank account details.  This is a shared issue for all creditors, in addition to payment organisations.  Electric Ireland is committed to update all bank details received regardless of how the updates are submitted to us.</p><p> We have been proactively preparing for the impact of the banks' exit as information has become available to us and we have been engaging with all the relevant fora.  For example, in January 2022 we established a team to explore what issues might arise and in February we commenced a monthly internal reporting process to monitor customer migration and to track issues that were arising.  We have also simplified and resolved any issues we have identified to date.  We have successfully migrated more than 4,000 customers from the exiting banks to the new bank chosen by the customer when the customer has initiated contact with us and given us the relevant details.  We have also modified our processes in line with experience gained to date to further streamline the experience for customers who will be in the same situation in coming months.  Our team stands ready, as the departing banks ramp up their customer communications regarding the closing of their accounts, to proactively communicate with our own impacted customers to explain how they can update their bank details as quickly and easily as possible.  Electric Ireland will also make arrangements to support and assist our registered vulnerable customers or those who may not have updated their bank details with Electric Ireland as the transitionary period draws to a close.</p><p> While we work to ensure that the switching experience runs as smoothly as possible, we are concerned about the paper-based Central Bank switching code and that customers may not open new bank accounts and inform us in a timely manner.  That is a risk.  However, and this is key, Electric Ireland assures committee members that we will be firmly focused on ensuring that there are no energy-supply related interruptions for our customers as a result of the departure of KBC Bank and Ulster Bank.  Our request of the committee is that if and when the members encounter any customers impacted by this issue, they will encourage them to open a new bank account as soon as possible and ask them to notify us of their new bank account details.  There are a number of ways they can do that.  We have different links on our website for personal or residential customers and for business customers.  There is the opportunity for customers to contact us through our contact centre and we will also take the information through the post.</p><p> We will now have large numbers of customers seeking to make changes to their payment arrangements at the same time - many multiples of our normal annual activity in processing direct debit and standing order arrangements and in a more concentrated period of time.  In this context, our focus will be to issue clear communications to advise our customers of the electronic means by which they can update their data with us on our website.  It is to be hoped that this, in turn, will minimise the number of manual direct debit mandates being submitted through the existing cumbersome and paper-based bank switching process.  In summary, Electric Ireland will aim to promptly update all new bank account details received for our customers, irrespective of the route through which they come to us.  As stated, we are clear on which of our customers transact with us via KBC Bank and Ulster Bank and we are entirely focussed on ensuring that our customers do not experience any service interruptions as a result of this process.</p><p> Over the coming months, we will continue to work with the respective banks and will issue our own customer communications so that customers changing bank details can do so with minimum disruption from an Electric Ireland point of view.  We will also provide assurance to our customers impacted by these circumstances that they will not be at any risk of loss of supply should they experience difficulties or delays during the banking transition.  We will stay close to our customers throughout this process to ensure that any concerns arising can be addressed.  Electric Ireland continues to engage with KBC Bank, Ulster Bank and the BPFI to assist in raising customer awareness about the steps they may have to take and to support a smooth transition for customers as they change their bank.</p></speech>

I have a few questions about the switching process and a more general question if the witnesses are in a position to answer it.  The switching process that has been outlined by the banks is that one can go through all the direct debits and standing orders in one's current account and do it oneself or one can use the switching code.  In reality, however, that is not the true state of affairs because if one uses the switching code, there are many direct debits and standing orders that one will have to switch oneself as well, with a more semi-do-it-yourself, part automatic type of code for gym membership, Spotify and so forth.  There was discussion with the banks about the fact that some direct debit originators would not accept authorisation from the financial institutions and that they needed the authorisation from the individuals themselves.  Is Electric Ireland one of those or what way does it operate that?</p></speech>

How does Ms Sayers find the switching code?  She says it is paper based.  Is she suggesting that there is an envelope arriving into Electric Ireland with a form and a stamp on it?  Is that what is happening in this day and age?</p></speech>

I will ask my colleague, Mr. &Oacute; Raghallaigh, to explain the exact process because he works in the payments area, but, effectively, we are getting much more paperwork than we would traditionally get in a year.

We receive an envelope with a paper form in it.  Typically, in a normal year we would receive approximately 2,000 of such forms.  With the number of customer accounts we have, there is potential that we will see a more than fortyfold increase in paper forms.  However, what we have seen to date is that the 4,000 customers who have transitioned so far are primarily using the online facility.  Approximately 25% of the customers who have switched already have used the paper-based CBI system.</p></speech>

Electric Ireland is among the top 20, if not the top ten, direct debit originators.  In this day and age the idea that somebody is putting a form into an envelope, sealing the envelope, putting a stamp on it and sending it off and Electric Ireland then has to replicate that journey does not make any sense.  They are not even being sent by email with attachments.  Is there a rationale for this?  Is it stipulated that it must be paper based or where is the block in this?</p></speech>

We certainly asked the question.  Given that we were told it is not possible, we are working with the arrangements that are available to us and encouraging customers to contact us directly through the website.</p> <p>  With regard to our customer book, approximately 35% of our 65,000 customers are electronic customers so they are well used to transacting through our website.</p><p>That makes it a 65% problem.

We are at the start of this process and customer behaviour is what it is.  Some customers will move early, will see the letter and deal with it in the next hour or the next day, while others will put the letter on top of the fridge, meaning to get to it but they will forget.  The banks will be taking out far more advertisements and there will be more talk about it as we go.  They will tell customers that it is only a week until their accounts are cancelled and so on and then there will be spikes in activity.  Is there anything else that could be done to streamline this process in the context of the pressure that it will put on Electric Ireland if thousands of these accounts need to be dealt with in a short timeframe?  Has Electric Ireland put anything on the table?</p></speech>

That way they will get hard-copy communication from us in case they missed the electronic communication.  We will make sure everybody gets that letter and hopefully that will reinforce the communication, on top of what the banks are doing and what other direct debit originators are doing.  It is not ideal that customers are getting a lot of communications but, on the other hand, if they are getting them from different locations and different places, they are more likely to open an account sooner rather than later.  We have some experience of being what is known as the supplier of last resort in the energy business.  That involves an electronic transfer to us of customer details on the electricity front.  We thought something similar might be available in the banking system but, as Mr. &Oacute; Raghallaigh said, that does not appear to be the case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.595" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022052500002#N00400"><p>I was going to come to that later but maybe I will deal with it now.  I attended workshops in Tullamore on retail banking last week where I mentioned that switching has to become simple.  It is a lot simpler in the energy market.  Switching bank must be something people can do easily.  Otherwise, the banks will be able to take advantage of the fact that people do not switch and therefore do not get the best available product.  The process we are discussing tells us that switching is far from straightforward.  For people who are digitally active it is relatively straightforward but for others it is more challenging.  It is completely different in the energy sector.  Ms Sayers referred to the supplier of last resort.  Electric Ireland benefited from this in February when it took on an extra 1,500 customers from Bright Energy which withdrew from the market.  We have a company withdrawing from the market in the energy sector and banks withdrawing from the market in the banking sector but the difference between the two could not be starker.  In the former case, the customers did not have to do anything.  They were automatically transferred to Electric Ireland with notification that if they wanted to move to another company, they could do so but that they had a home in Electric Ireland, they would be fine and did not have to worry unless they wanted to shop around for a better option.</p> <p>  Was any of that discussed in the forums with BPFI?  We have had a year-long lead-in.  When the banks needed to be rescued, they had no problem marching up to Government Buildings at all hours of the morning looking for emergency legislation.  In this day and age, I do not understand why we are looking at thousands of forms going to Electric Ireland.  These forms that are going to Electric Ireland are also going to multiple other direct debit originators.  We are possibly talking about millions of forms to be filled in by hand, processed and posted back.  It is just crazy stuff.  It seems deliberately designed to make the process more complex than it needs to be so that people do not readily switch.  A proper switching code that is seamless would actually benefit customers over the banks because it would make it easy for people to shop around.</p> <p>  I ask Ms Sayers to explain the difference in the situation for a Bright Energy customer as compared with an Ulster Bank customer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.596" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marguerite Sayers" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2022052500002#N00500"><p>It is very much as the Deputy outlined.  When Bright Energy exited the market customers were given a level of information.  We cannot really speak with any great expertise on the banking system but we can speak to what happened in the energy system.  Customers of Bright Energy were informed both by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, and by Bright Energy itself that they could select a new supplier in advance of the exit but those customers who still remained on the date that Bright Energy surrendered its licence were automatically transferred to Electric Ireland.  As part of the communications, they were told that they could stay with Electric Ireland, they had a home with us and would be looked after and that they did not have to do anything.  Approximately one month after they had transferred to Electric Ireland, if they so wished, they could then proactively look for a different supplier if they wanted to do so.  That was the arrangement under the supplier of last resort mechanism.</p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; Raghallaigh has attended the discussions with the banks until now.  There have been discussions around an automated system.  We made a suggestion and a company we are aware of also made a suggestion.  It was explored but found not to be workable, from the banks' point of view.  </p> <p>  We do not have any more to contribute on that issue, unfortunately, except in terms of drawing the parallel with our own experience in the energy sector.  An energy account is reasonably simple.  The customer transacts with one company but as we can see, with a bank account, money is coming in and going out all of the time.  Maybe it is more complex but it is not our area of expertise.</p></speech>

It originates from an EU directive which was transposed into Irish law a decade and a half ago.  It recognises that energy is a commodity upon which consumers depend.  It could be argued that access to banking, cash or money to pay for that energy is also important.  The parallel here is that there are customers out there who have not given authorisation to move their direct debit to Electric Ireland but they are moved anyway.  They have been told that they will be moved if they do not do anything but they have not proactively done anything.  They have not given Electric Ireland authorisation.  Surely to God that is what we should be doing in the banking sector but that is a wider issue.</p> <p>  To go into the specifics, normally Electric Ireland would make 2,000 direct debit amendments per year for people who are changing their payment details.  The company is now expecting to have 86,000 such amendments to make.  What has the company done to ramp up capacity, particularly bearing in mind that there may be surge points as customers get closer to the cut-off point?  What has Electric Ireland done and is the company confident that it will be able to deal with the scale of what is involved here?</p></speech>

We have concerns around the peaks the Deputy mentions and that is what we are seeking to mitigate as much as we can.  In our communication with customers we will reassure them about not losing supply and about setting up a new direct debit for them, if that is what they wish to do, as quickly as possible.  We have approximately 300 internal staff and while they are not all working in this area and would not all be available to us, a proportion of them, at around 100, could be repurposed to help with a backlog if one arises.  We also have around 400 agents in our contact centre and while they are fully occupied day in and day out, their focus can be reprioritised so rather than having a sales team or a loyalty team for a period of time, we will repurpose those agents and ask them to work on trying to deal with the peak.  We are making plans to do that.  Our communication with customers will also emphasise various routes through which customers can make the change themselves, if they contact us through our website.  As I said, 35% of the 65,000 customers are regular users of our website and hopefully they will effectively self-serve and that will reduce the scale of the issue.  That said, it is something of which we are very conscious and we will be keeping an eye on it.</p> <p>  Letters are going out in batches from the banks but unfortunately we cannot overlay with that because we do not know which customers are being contacted at what point.  We will also be communicating with customers in batches but, unfortunately, they may not align.  We know that as soon as we issue letters we are likely to see an uptick in activity and we have a plan for that.</p></speech>

The process is in phases and customers are getting letters.  There have been 120,000 issued so far.  They will need to have their accounts closed by the autumn or winter.  At that point, if they have not closed and transferred their accounts, they will be frozen out of their electricity accounts because the direct debits will fail.  Unfortunately, the reality is that certain people will be in that cohort.  What is Electric Ireland going to do when direct debits fail because people did not get around to switching their accounts?  People might be in hospital or have other reasons for not doing it.  What approach is taken to that debt?</p></speech>

We will be contacting customers by exception.  Some customers may want to set up their direct debits again.  It is important to realise, and it will be part of our communication, that direct debit is by no means the only option that customers have for payment.  Many of our customers choose to pay just by going into a bank and not having a direct debit.  They can pay through Payzone, etc., and go into a post office.  There are a number of options.  They can ring our contact centre.  Again, we will reinforce to customers the various options available to them.  We will reduce the extent of our communications and ensure we are communicating just with what we hope will be a diminishing group of customers over time that would not have re-established the direct debits to remind them it is a very convenient way to pay and to help them if they have any issues.  We will offer that assistance to them.  It is certainly part of the communication plan.  It is not the only means of payment and we will also reassure them they will not lose supply because of that.</p></speech>

I have a final tangential question.  Customers of Electric Ireland receive their bills and the energy credit that was passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We have had a number of queries about how Electric Ireland is applying the credit so could I get clarification on that?  Is the VAT being applied to the bill charge before or after the deduction?  If it is applied before the deduction, customers would pay &euro;24 more on a &euro;300 charge than if it occurred after the deduction.</p></speech>

That would mean it is the lower figure or the &euro;200 gross; customers do not get the double benefit of a VAT change as well.  The figure is &euro;192.</p></speech>

There is a unique mandate reference for every direct debit authorisation that a customer sets up with a direct debit originator, which is Electric Ireland in our case.  My understanding of the switching code is the customer's current bank can supply him or her with a list of direct debits.  In the case of Electric Ireland, we could certainly look into it but the unique reference in our case is the customer account number.

Our understanding is that all suppliers have applied the &euro;200 credit by now.  We have certainly applied it to all our customers.  We expect the number of people in that position to be quite small.  We can investigate each one of those as they arise if there is an issue.  Certainly, all our customers have had the &euro;200 credit applied.  They do not all know that yet because bills typically issue over a two-month period.  Even if it is applied to the account, people may not be aware of it until they get their bill, and that could be a number of weeks away.</p></speech>

Aithn&iacute;onn Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe an t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann leis an gceantar Gaeltachta is m&oacute; sa t&iacute;r at&aacute; lonnaithe i gContae na Gaillimhe agus t&aacute; meas aici ar an t&aacute;bhacht sin.  De r&eacute;ir fhigi&uacute;ir&iacute; dhaon&aacute;ireamh 2016, thug 49% de dhaonra Chontae na Gaillimhe, gan cathair na Gaillimhe san &aacute;ireamh, le fios go raibh siad &aacute;balta Gaeilge a labhairt, rud a chialla&iacute;onn go bhfuil an c&eacute;atad&aacute;n is airde, i dtaobh daoine a labhra&iacute;onn Gaeilge, i gContae na Gaillimhe.</p> <p>  Is teanga bheo &iacute; an Ghaeilge, a dtaca&iacute;tear l&eacute;i i bpobail &eacute;ags&uacute;la chomh maith le bheith ina hoidhreacht luachmhar a gcaithfear &iacute; a chaomhn&uacute; agus a chosaint do na gl&uacute;nta at&aacute; le teacht.  Cuirimid &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge chun cinn agus taca&iacute;mid l&eacute;i leis an ngealltanas at&aacute; d&eacute;anta againn seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge.  Aithn&iacute;mid an m&eacute;id ar leith a chuireann s&iacute; le h&eacute;ags&uacute;lacht chult&uacute;ir faoin sainch&uacute;ram chaomhn&uacute; na hoidhreachta agus na teanga.</p> <p>  Maidir leis na pobail sin arb &iacute; an Ghaeilge amh&aacute;in an rogha teanga at&aacute; acu, freastala&iacute;onn leabharlanna sa Spid&eacute;al agus ar an gCeathr&uacute; Rua orthu sin agus t&aacute; a leabharlann f&eacute;in ag gach ceann de thr&iacute; oile&aacute;n &Aacute;rann.  Freastala&iacute;onn an leabharlann taistil ar cheantair ina labhra&iacute;tear Gaeilge freisin, cos&uacute;il le Maigh Cuilinn, le Sraith Salach, leis an gCaiseal, le Carna, le Cill Chiar&aacute;in, le Ros Muc agus le hIndreabh&aacute;n.  Ar an gcaoi ch&eacute;anna, cuireann an rann&oacute;g scoileanna at&aacute; againn seirbh&iacute;s ar f&aacute;il do 39 bunscoil i gceantar na Gaeltachta agus do naoi nGaelscoil at&aacute; lonnaithe ar fud na coda eile den chontae.  Cuirtear an tseirbh&iacute;s sin ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge.</p> <p>  T&aacute; r&oacute;l l&aacute;rnach ag oifig shol&aacute;thair an Rialtais i dtaobh earra&iacute; agus seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il ar an mbealach is &eacute;ifeachta&iacute; agus is &eacute;ifeacht&uacute;la &oacute; thaobh costas de agus luach ar airgead a chinnti&uacute; don ch&aacute;in&iacute;oc&oacute;ir.  &Aacute;ir&iacute;tear gn&aacute;thearra&iacute; agus seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; chomh maith le ceannach agus sol&aacute;thar gach leabhar agus &aacute;bhar leabharlainne mar chuid den sainch&uacute;ram sin.  Cialla&iacute;onn s&eacute; sin nach f&eacute;idir leabhair leabharlainne a cheannach ach &oacute;n sol&aacute;thr&oacute;ir a bhfuil an tairiscint aige faoi l&aacute;thair na leabhair sin a shol&aacute;thar faoin gcreat comhaontaithe.</p> <p>  B&iacute;onn baint ag tithe foilsitheoireachta le hathchl&oacute; &aacute;bhair, leaganacha faoi chl&uacute;dach bog n&oacute; l&eacute;ar&aacute;id&iacute; leasaithe n&oacute; maisitheoir&iacute; nuachoimisi&uacute;naithe.  C&eacute; go bhfuil an t&aacute;bhacht at&aacute; le stoc a cheannach le cur in &aacute;it stoc at&aacute; dam&aacute;istithe n&oacute; imithe am&uacute; luaite go soil&eacute;ir in&aacute;r dtreoirl&iacute;nte forbartha baili&uacute;ch&aacute;n, t&aacute;imid d&iacute;rithe go m&oacute;r ar &aacute;bhar nuafhoilsithe a chur ar f&aacute;il.  De bharr go bhfuil &eacute;ags&uacute;lachta&iacute; can&uacute;int&iacute; i gceist i gCiarra&iacute;, i nD&uacute;n na nGall agus i nGaillimh, is f&eacute;idir le stoc a fh&aacute;il a sh&aacute;sa&iacute;onn riachtanais agus pr&oacute;if&iacute;l an phobail a bheith d&uacute;shl&aacute;nach uaireanta.  Is fi&uacute; a luadh go gcuireann gach leabharlann i gContae na Gaillimhe baili&uacute;ch&aacute;n d&rsquo;&aacute;bhar Gaeilge ar f&aacute;il do dhaoine f&aacute;sta agus leana&iacute; araon, ag brath ar mh&eacute;id an phobail.</p> <p>  T&aacute; an sainch&uacute;ram at&aacute; orainn l&eacute;itheoireacht na Gaeilge a spreagadh bunaithe ar an tuiscint gur teanga bheo &iacute; an Ghaeilge.  Ina fhianaise sin, cuirimid imeachta&iacute; agus tionscnaimh ar bun go gn&iacute;omhach ar bheala&iacute; spra&iacute;&uacute;la chun rannph&aacute;irt&iacute;ocht agus taisc&eacute;ala&iacute;ocht a chur ar f&aacute;il do phobail le h&uacute;s&aacute;id a bhaint as an nGaeilge.  Tr&iacute; chluich&iacute; boird i nGaeilge cos&uacute;il le Scrabble agus Monopoly a chur ar f&aacute;il, cuirtear deiseanna ar f&aacute;il don phobal lena gcuid Gaeilge a chleachtadh agus focail nua a fhoghlaim.</p> <p>  L&eacute;ir&iacute;tear &uacute;s&aacute;id neamhfhoirme&aacute;lta agus ionchuimsitheach na Gaeilge chomh maith leis an gciorcal comhr&aacute; a chuireann roinnt de na leabharlanna at&aacute; againn ar f&aacute;il.  Is bealach thar a bheith &eacute;ifeachtach &eacute; seo chun daoine sa phobal a spreagadh le h&uacute;s&aacute;id a bhaint as a gcuid Gaeilge, beag beann ar a gcumas, i dtimpeallacht r&eacute;ch&uacute;iseach agus fh&aacute;ilteach.  D&eacute;antar c&uacute;ram freisin sna cl&aacute;ir do thionscnaimh n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta cos&uacute;il le Seachtain na Gaeilge, nuair a thugtar deiseanna chun an teanga bheo a l&eacute;iri&uacute; ar aon leis an oidhreacht chult&uacute;ir a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge le ch&eacute;ile.</p> <p>  &Aacute;ir&iacute;tear ar thionscnaimh n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta eile nach bhfuil ar si&uacute;l ach i leabharlanna seo againne na tionscadail Preab Isteach sa Sc&eacute;al, R&eacute;alta&iacute; Samhraidh, agus Am Teaghlaigh ag do Leabharlann.  Tugann siad sin l&eacute;argas ar an bhfeachtas n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta at&aacute; againn, Ceart Chun L&eacute;itheoireachta, a spreagann forbairt litearthachta ar fud &aacute;r gcuid seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; agus a thugann ugach do theaghlaigh a bheith p&aacute;irteach ann.  Re&aacute;cht&aacute;lann rann&oacute;g na scoileanna agus bainisteoir&iacute; brainse ceardlanna, cuairteanna &oacute; &uacute;dair agus seisi&uacute;in sc&eacute;ala&iacute;ochta a mb&iacute;onn &uacute;dair agus sc&eacute;alaithe m&oacute;r le r&aacute; as &Eacute;irinn p&aacute;irteach iontu.</p> <p>  Rinneadh amanna sc&eacute;ala&iacute;ochta a re&aacute;cht&aacute;il ar l&iacute;ne agus l&eacute;adh sc&eacute;alta i nGaeilge agus i mB&eacute;arla, araon le haitheantas tugtha don &uacute;dar, don mhaisitheoir agus don fhoilsitheoir.  Baineadh lucht sp&eacute;ise n&aacute;r baineadh amach riamh cheana roimhe sin leis na seisi&uacute;in sin.  Tharla s&eacute; sin le linn dianghlas&aacute;il agus srianta Covid i bhfeidhm.</p> <p>  Re&aacute;cht&aacute;iltear com&oacute;rtas Europe Direct Soapbox gach bliain.

T&aacute; dh&aacute; chatag&oacute;ir i gceist, is iad 16 bliana agus n&iacute;os &oacute;ige agus 17 mbliana agus n&iacute;os sine.  Ba as Conamara do bhuaiteoir n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta na bliana 2021 sa chatag&oacute;ir 16 bliana agus n&iacute;os &oacute;ige agus rinne sise a h&oacute;r&aacute;id i nGaeilge.

T&aacute;imid ag s&uacute;il go m&oacute;r le tuilleadh obair a dh&eacute;anamh i gcomhar le domhan na foilsitheoireachta chun an saibhreas tallainne, cruthaitheachta agus cult&uacute;ir a chuireann an Ghaeilge ar f&aacute;il d&uacute;inn anseo i nGaillimh a chur os comhair an phobail.</p></speech>

I have some Irish but not enough to speak here.  Galway's Great Read, L&eacute;amh M&oacute;r na Gaillimhe, is an annual event where we put on a programme of events.  We do this in both English and Irish.  We try to foster and promote our literary heritage and our culture.  We look predominantly at writers from Ireland and particularly from the west and consider historical events such as the suffragette movement.  We create a programme around something like that and have events in our libraries.  We cannot do the full 29, but we always have some events in the Gaeltacht.  These are run through the medium of Irish and will involve speakers who will speak in Irish.  We have held events on the Aran Islands as part of the campaign.  It is not great because the weather is usually inclement in November and there can be many sick bodies coming back.  Over the years, we have looked at writers like P&aacute;draic &Oacute; Conaire, Walter Macken and Eil&iacute;s Dillon.  We have travelling bilingual exhibition boards that go around the county so, even if we do not have an event in a branch, the exhibition will go there.<br/><br/>In recent years, because of the pandemic, we had to change our whole tack, especially in 2020.  We could not have live events so we went virtual.  This presented a steep learning curve for us all even with regard to learning the language of speaking to recorders and media people.  However, it was very successful.  It was on Eil&iacute;s Dillon, a fascinating and prolific writer from Galway.  We looked at all aspects of her life.  Everything is on our YouTube channel.  When we do L&eacute;amh M&oacute;r na Gaillimhe, we look at the collections we have in the library and promote them.  Last year's theme was &quot;Westward Ho! A ramble through Galway, 1840-1950&quot;.  We looked at a lot of our travel writers.  As part of that we did a travel documentary with two archaeologists, Dr. Jim Higgins and Michael Gibbons.  We did a publication of essays and we had talks.  We are going to continue this theme this year but we will be doing it in south Connemara.  This will be predominantly in Irish or bilingual.<br/><br/>When we started this originally, we had a lot of events for children and did not really have anything for adults, so we decided this would be for adults only.  However, when we were doing P&aacute;draic &Oacute; Conaire, we realised that a lot of children in County Galway did not know about him or about Walter Macken, so we introduced a children's educational part to the programme.  We did visual interpretations of <i>M'asal Beag Dubh</i>.  With Eil&iacute;s Dillon, we took two of her stories and ran a programme called &quot;One Author; Five Islands&quot;.  We went to the Aran Islands, Inishbofin and Mweenish Island.  Even though it is called Mweenish Island, it is part of the county.  That was really successful and was done through the medium of Irish.<br/><br/>L&eacute;amh M&oacute;r na Gaillimhe is looked for during the year.  Everybody wonders what the topic for next year will be.  That is one of the ways we promote our collections and activities and events for older people to get them into the libraries.</p></speech>

Their sector has been very much in the media over recent weeks and their organisations, and more importantly their publicans, are getting their feet on the ground again after two and a half very difficult years, so we are looking forward to hearing from them on that.</p> <p>  We are joined by representatives from the Licensed Vintners Association, LVA, and the Vintners' Federation of Ireland, VFI.  We are delighted to have them here and thank them for taking the time to meet us.  On behalf of the committee, I warmly welcome Mr. Donall O'Keeffe, CEO of the LVA, who is joined by the newly appointed chairperson of the association, Ms Alison Kealy.   She is very welcome and I congratulate her on her new post.  I also welcome from the recently appointed chief executive officer of the VFI, Mr. Paul Clancy, whom I also congratulate, and Mr. Paul Moynihan, president.</p> <p>  I ask our witnesses to adhere to the time allocated for their opening statements in order that we will have as much time as possible for questions.  As they will probably be aware, the committee may publish opening statements on its webpage following the meeting.</p> <p>  To limit the risk of spreading Covid-19, the service encourages all Members, visitors and witnesses to wear face masks in crowded settings on the campus.</p> <p>  Before I invite our witnesses to deliver their opening statements, I ask everyone to bear with me while I go through some housekeeping.  Regarding parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references that may be made to other persons in evidence, the evidence of witnesses physically present or of those who give evidence from the within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and the statute of absolute privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  If, therefore, their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of any identifiable person or entitty, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not make comment on, criticise nor make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement whereby Members must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House to participate in public meetings.  I cannot permit someone who is not adhering to that constitutional requirement to contribute.</p> <p>  I ask members participating by MS Teams to identify themselves for the benefit of the Debates Office staff preparing the Official Report and to please mute their microphones when they are not contributing to reduce background noise.  I remind everyone also to switch off their mobile phones or to put them on airplane mode.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. O'Keeffe to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

We are represented by our chairperson, Ms Alison Kealy, who is just three weeks into her tenure, and me as CEO.  We acknowledge the committee and the Government for their support for the hospitality sector throughout the pandemic.  Without that financial support, we simply could not have survived.  We very much welcome the recent Government decision to extend the 9% VAT rate to February 2023.  This is a really significant support as we rebuild our industry.</p> <p>  It is widely accepted that the hospitality sector, and pubs in particular, was among the sectors hardest hit by Covid.  One of the direct impacts has been the considerable loss of staff, whether through international staff returning home or staff leaving the licensed trade to work in other sectors, such as retail, distribution or construction.  Two years of closures and restrictions has had a devastating impact on staff retention in our sector.</p><p>Some 79% of our members reported that uncertainty about the future of the pub trade was the main reason for losing staff.  In all, we estimate that about one third of our staff have departed the sector.  Given the shortages of skilled staff that existed pre-Covid, the loss of chefs, managers and senior bar staff from our sector during Covid has made a difficult situation all the more challenging.  While we are encouraged by the level of business since we reopened, it is fair to say that staff availability is now the biggest inhibiting factor to full recovery.  </p><p> We have provided the committee with a comprehensive submission setting out our views in full.  Based on our own member survey, some of the key business impacts of the shortage of staff include a reduced number of trading hours - due to later opening - and trading days.  Some 88% of members reported staff recruitment as a serious difficulty, while 89% of members worried about staff shortages in 2022.  The particular skills gaps that we identified are around general management, operations, customer care and event management.  In terms of attracting staff to work in the sector, we must focus on what workers themselves see as the key reasons to work in hospitality.  The F&aacute;ilte Ireland research found these to be a passion for a particular skilled job, with 66% of chefs noting this; a passion for working with people, which is the core of hospitality; seeing it as a long-term career, as mentioned by 71% of respondents; flexible hours, particularly for women; and generally enjoying the working environment.  To this end, we are encouraged by the launch of the F&aacute;ilte Ireland tourism careers marketing campaign but feel it should be widened to expressly include hospitality as well as tourism.  For its part, the LVA supports its members through the provision of a full-time HR advisory service run by a highly experienced HR professional; the LVA-designed diploma in bar and food management, which provides 60 hours of training; the running of seminars, workshops and conferences; and the provision of an employee assistance programme for staff.  Looking ahead, in an economy nearing full employment, we believe the following policy developments are required to address the skills shortages in our sector.  </p><p> We are calling on the Government and State agencies to complete a review of the efficacy of the work permit scheme to boost skills and supply staff more efficiently, as we do not believe it is fit for purpose for hospitality currently.  The process itself and processing times are very inefficient.  We are calling for a clear designation and establishment of a hospitality training division within an existing State agency, potentially F&aacute;ilte Ireland, and the elimination of current silos across Departments and State agencies with regard to hospitality.  We ask what Department and which State agency is responsible for hospitality.  The short-term immediate priorities of the tourism and hospitality careers oversight group, COG, make a lot of sense to us but the group's longer-term strategy must be finalised this year.  Critically, its policy recommendations must be funded for the medium-term supply of skills.  An independent chair with an appropriate budget would facilitate that.  In the longer term, sustained F&aacute;ilte Ireland investment in marketing of hospitality and tourism careers is also required. The hospitality sector itself also has a role to play.  We must build and market career benefits, invest in the training and development of staff, improve conditions over time, and highlight the flexibility available.  We all know that good employers will always attract the best talent.</p><p> In conclusion, the shortage of hospitality staff and management skills is the biggest barrier to the rebuilding of the pub sector.  A longer-term State strategy for hospitality skills, which is adequately resourced and funded, is now imperative.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to present our views.  We welcome any questions members may have. </p></speech>

I have no doubt but that my colleagues will have many questions.  Before we start the question-and-answer session, I invite Mr. Paul Clancy from the VFI to make his presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.810" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Clancy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022052500002#B00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend today's meeting. I am joined here by VFI president, Mr. Paul Moynihan.  As CEO, I would like to outline the context of how our sector arrived at its current position.  Even allowing for the impact of Covid-19, the tourism and hospitality sector is one of the key generators of employment in the country.  There were 260,000 jobs in the sector pre-Covid, or 11% of all employment in the country.  One of the critical aspects of this employment is that it is dispersed right across the country, and especially in parts where there is little alternative employment.  Of the 260,000 jobs, two thirds or 175,000, are generated in regional and rural Ireland.  Tourism has played a significant role in the revival of the overall economy since 2011.  It is important to remember that our sector has created the highest number of new jobs in the past decade.</p> <p>  So, where are we now?  The Covid pandemic was a game changer like no other.  On 15 March 2020 our pubs closed for an initial two-week period, but ultimately, they would remain shut for almost two years.  In that time many businesses were saved by Government interventions in the guise of the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and business interruption supports.  The pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, was also vital to support the many bar staff who lost their jobs.  Without these supports most pubs would have gone out of business, so it is important to place on the record the industry's appreciation of these interventions.  As mentioned, many staff lost their jobs during Covid.  Simply put, they could not wait around to find out when pubs would reopen.  If members recall, there were multiple times during the Covid crisis when pubs were given a date for reopening only for it to be postponed at the last minute.  This played havoc with people's lives and careers. They had to find alternative employment in other sectors.  Consequently, it is no exaggeration to say that Covid has had a serious impact on labour supply for our members, with a knock-on effect in respect of skills shortages that is restricting the capability of many businesses to survive.</p> <p>  Pubs have had to adjust to the serious skills shortage in many ways, including through reduced trading hours; the provision of additional hours for existing staff and, in particular, owner-managers training new staff who are both young and inexperienced; total closure for a period to allow existing employees annual leave; and increasing wage rates to meet the expectations of existing employees. This is not sustainable if businesses are to remain viable.  It also has the capacity to negatively impact customers' expectations of a hospitality setting.  This has a major impact on the tourism offering.  The lack of trained, experienced staff will impact the quality of service.  As we begin to reboot our tourism business, this has the capacity to be a negative factor.  The breadth of the offering will suffer.  Many outlets have chosen, out of necessity, to close for two days in the early part of the week.  In some geographical areas it remains challenging to get a booking for food on these nights.</p> <p>  On the actions required, the skills shortage will require a response on multiple fronts.  From an industry perspective, work has to be undertaken to convince school leavers that a viable career path exists in the pub sector.  With that in mind, the VFI has worked with State agencies including SOLAS and the National Apprenticeship Office, along with Griffith College, to develop a bar manager's degree apprenticeship - the first of its kind in Ireland.  In fact, the first 24 students have already started the course and feedback is extremely positive.  While there is a relatively modest student number initially, over time we intend that the degree will be available nationwide.  These students will go on to hold senior well-paid positions within the trade, with a lifelong career available if they so choose.</p> <p>  From a Government and State agency standpoint, we need the following actions to be taken.  The Government, through one of the dedicated agencies, needs to conduct an immediate labour market analysis to determine the precise scale of the current problem and the scale projected over the medium term of three to five years.  These data need to be used to frame a full response.  The work permit situation has caused huge frustration for our members.  Access to more suitably trained staff must be prioritised.  In in that regard, the COG working group on accessing European markets is so important.  Given the context of the nature of employment in the pub sector, access to a visa-free labour pool is crucial.  We welcome F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s new targeted marketing campaign designed to highlight the benefits of a career in the hospitality sector.  We will continue to work with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to ensure such campaigns are of specific value to the pub sector.</p> <p>  In summary, tourism and hospitality was a vibrant sector that continued to contribute significantly to the economy and job creation.  It has suffered a massive shock.  The shock has led to a major challenge in attracting and retaining staff.  Actions are required in the very short term to address this challenge.  I thank members for their time and we are happy to address any questions they may have. </p></speech>

I am sure it will initiate many questions from my colleagues and members of the committee.  The meeting is focusing on working conditions and the skills shortage, which have been addressed by the witnesses.  I will now open the questioning from members, who have the speaking order in front of them, so they know where they are.  I ask members to keep to the five-minute time limit for questions and answers.  We will begin with Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan.</p></speech>

My first question is for the representatives of both the LVA and VFI.  It was not addressed in the presentations, but to what extent is a lack of accommodation a barrier to attracting staff?  I have heard stories of pubs, restaurants and hotels that have identified skilled staff who want to come to an area and work there but accommodation is simply not available for staff.  I ask the witnesses to respond.</p></speech>

I think the situation is most extreme in Dublin, given the shortage of accommodation and the cost of rental accommodation.</p><p>It is difficult to attract back international staff who left during the Covid pandemic to Dublin when they look at the cost of living in Dublin in 2022.  That is a serious issue for us.</p></speech>

It is not so much an issue in rural Ireland.  I often hear that if places want to attract foreign staff back, they need to have accommodation for them, which is an issue for many publicans and businesses.</p></speech>

Individual publicans around Dublin are providing accommodation but they are the exception, not the norm.  We have members who are acting as guarantors for rents and deposits for landlords.  One issue we are struggling with on a practical level, which Ms Kealy will be able to give evidence of, is that international staff tend to return in smaller groups or in ones and twos.  Putting a group together to rent a house is difficult when the landlord wants to deal with one person responsible for the four- or five-bedroom house.  Accommodation for one person in a one-room flat is too expensive for hospitality staff.  It is a significant barrier to returning international staff.  It is also an issue for people from the country who move to Dublin to work in the hospitality sector.  They face the exact same problem.  The shortage of accommodation is a national issue and the Government's Housing for All strategy is needed.</p></speech>

The witnesses might note them and answer where possible.  This one is mainly for the VFI.  During the week, many regional towns with students attending college seem to have an issue.  The weekend is not as problematic because students are looking for work.  Is that an issue and how can it be solved?</p> <p>  This question is for both groups.  It appears that drink sales are down since before the pandemic.  Do the witnesses see that ever bouncing back to pre-pandemic levels or has there been a cultural shift?  Are they fearful it might not come back?  We have all noticed that people do not seem to be going to pubs as much as when I was in my 20s.  Is there a longer-term cultural issue?</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned security of employment and the fact that people are fearful about the future.  They also covered the visa waiver and visas for non-EU workers.</p> <p>  My final question is for the VFI.  This is a good opportunity to raise it.  Many of us have been contacted by local VFI members about the proposed sale of alcohol Bill.  Some aspects of it are concerning for the VFI in particular, such as the extinguishment issue.  There is much more detail in the Bill to be hashed out but the VFI's members might be fearful that, while the existing set-up is that a new licence is only granted where another licence is extinguished, there might be a free-for-all.  I would certainly be concerned if that was the case.  The witnesses might address that.</p></speech>

We have found, after Covid, that the hospitality and pub trade is focused on events.  Publicans have to work much harder to get the footfall during the week than they do at the weekends, when there is a lot of natural footfall from students.  They are working much harder to try to attract people into businesses to increase footfall, when it may have happened naturally in the past.</p></speech>

Some 93% of pubs around the country have reopened.  That is positive.  There are issues in certain areas affected by the pandemic.  Some publicans have decided not to reopen and there may be family issues.  The current status of the trade is positive for most publicans.  We are happy with where we are going.  There are issues in some cities where offices are not full yet, but generally speaking, around the country, we are confident about where we are and where we are going in the future.  It has bounced back well.</p></speech>

We are very busy at the moment.  We got a natural bounce-back.  To answer the question about pubs, since people could not go there during Covid, there has been a large return migration to them because people have enjoyed them being open and being social again.  There has been a natural bounce in the business because of that.</p></speech>

Alcohol is a drug and we need it to be sold responsibly.  We have to look after ourselves and to run orderly houses.  We have to get our licence every year.  We have to work with a fire officer.  We are fearful that if licences are diluted, it would be so easy to open licensed premises that every corner shop might be able to put something up in a corner and start selling draught beer.  It is a big issue and I do not think society really needs it.  What we have at the moment works well.  Why change it?</p></speech>

I will try to answer in two ways.  The Deputy is right.  Alcohol consumption has declined steadily each year over 20 years, from a peak of about 14 l of pure alcohol per person to 10 l per person today, which is in line with the EU average.  In Ireland, there has been a substantial shift from the on-trade to the off-trade.  Between 15 and 17 years ago, 80% of alcohol was consumed in pubs and 20% was from off-licences.  That has flipped on its head and today 65% is probably in off-trade and 35% to 40% is in on-trade.  There has been a huge shift over two generations.<br/><br/>Ms Kealy would be better able to explain this from an operator's perspective.  Since we reopened, we have seen people come back to the pubs in droves.  We are really encouraged by the number of young people who are coming back.  Our sales are running between 90% and 110% of 2019 levels if we compare each week.  The city centre is slightly weaker than suburbia because offices are not fully repopulated and tourism is only getting going.  Recovery is positive.  We can see it strengthening and getting going.  We are pleased with the demand levels we have experienced since we reopened.  One silver lining of the pandemic is that people realised that ordinary, normal social interaction and social occasions is something we missed when we were forced to stay at home.  People are socialising a little better or a little more.  Pubs in suburbia are busier in the middle of the week than they were before the pandemic.  Food is a huge driver of our business and is more significant than drink in the early part of the week.  We are optimistic in the medium term that Dublin will trade strongly.  The economic clouds are on the horizon for everyone but the near-term outlook is positive.<br/><br/>We are equally concerned by the sale of alcohol Bill.  The licensing regime does not exist to protect publicans from competition.  It exists for regulatory control reasons, to allow the Garda, public health authorities and Revenue to manage the sale of alcohol.  We believe we have a world-class pub culture in Ireland.  The regulatory regime is a big part of that because it puts a huge onus on licensees to run their pubs in a responsible manner.  The fact that licensees have to go to court every September to renew their licence is integral to having a solid licensing regime.  We note the long-term trends, with pub numbers having declined 21% since 2005.  We believe there are more than enough pubs in the country.  There are twice as many pubs <i>per capita </i>in the Republic of Ireland as there are in the UK, even though the UK is fully deregulated.  We have a substantial number of pubs, at 6,800.  We have 14,500 alcohol businesses in total, including pubs, restaurants, hotels, off-licences and on the supply side.</p><p>We are densely served in terms of outlets that sell alcohol.  We think that it is critical that the extinguishing requirement is maintained because it provides regulatory control.  We live in a world, both in Dublin and nationally, where there is huge competition between pubs, and between pubs, restaurants and hotels, which is in the interest of consumers.  Given that we have, in our opinion, a strong pub culture, we believe the Government needs to be extraordinarily careful about licensing reform in terms of the number of licences. </p></speech>

I thank them for their efforts and their opening statements on the issue of skills shortages in the tourism and hospitality sector.</p> <p>  My first questions concern ways to attract international workers to Ireland as part of the solution to the skills shortage.  What type of multifaceted approach is used to recruit local and international talent?  What measures have the members of both organisations taken and are taking in that regard?</p></speech>

The Deputy might have seen the F&aacute;ilte Ireland presentation, which is currently on various media platforms, and that seeks to attract people into the industry and make it attractive for them to join.  The presentation focuses on the flexible side of working in hospitality rather than on the negative side of, say, the late hours, and considering different age groups, and older age groups, that may be more interested in joining the hospitality sector.</p> <p>  From an international perspective, we work with EURES, the European Employment Services Network, as well as with COG and F&aacute;ilte Ireland with a view to arranging conferences in, possibly, Spain, Italy and Greece that have a high youth unemployment rate and encourage people to come to Ireland.  As an organisation, we are actively working on that with COG and F&aacute;ilte Ireland to encourage those initiatives.  We also work with our stakeholders in the industry such as the Restaurants Association of Ireland to get these initiatives going and create an awareness that there are opportunities here.  I hope that we will get some traction on all that.  We are looking both locally and internationally, while trying to make the whole industry attractive.  The spin that F&aacute;ilte Ireland is doing will have a good impact on raising awareness that the hospitality sector can be a great place to work from a life perspective, and if we can do that then, hopefully, we will attract more people to work in the industry but it is a challenge at the moment for sure.</p></speech>

Ms Gillian Knight, who is the LVA's HR professional, is a member of two of the working groups.  As the Deputy is aware, the LVA is involved in the working group that supports the industry to access staff from European markets because it is around the selection of which market has the best potential, which involves looking at the labour markets in those countries.  The LVA is also involved in the working group that supports Ukrainian people in Ireland who wish to work in the hospitality sector, and we are working with F&aacute;ilte Ireland and COG to identify the barriers in that instance.  That is where our primary focus lies in terms of international staff.</p> <p>  For non-EU staff, and I think this point has been made by everybody in the hospitality sector, the visa process needs to be re-examined.  For example, there is a requirement to have a job advertised for four weeks.  To then get an applicant and then process the visa is not a practical response for a business that needs a chef or senior manager this week or month.</p></speech>

We have advertisements on all of the websites etc. and have put up signs all around the place.  You are constantly talking to people in an effort to encourage them to work in the industry.  The minute you get a curriculum vitae from a good applicant, you ring that person and organise to meet with him or her but at the same time, you are scheduling yourself against many other places because the applicant will have five or six interviews lined up for that week.  So we must really sell ourselves to the applicants to get them to come in because there is a huge demand for employees in all sectors.  Once we get people in, then they find that they like working in the sector because, as has been said, the environment is social and has a fun atmosphere.  Employers must be more flexible as well, in that if an applicant tells us the hours he or she is available, then we will fit that into our schedule to encourage as many people as possible to work in the industry.  In my pub, through the LVA, we have put seven of our staff members through the course so there is career progression.</p></speech>

A lack of staff affects towns and villages all over the country, not just urban centres.  I know owner-operators who are crying out for staff.  They must close their businesses on Mondays and Tuesdays not because there is no business but because they cannot get staff and as owner-operators they cannot do the work of, say, three people and can only do what they can.  Earlier we also said that pubs must close down for a week in order give their staff a holiday.</p> <p>  During the pandemic, we were the longest-closed industry.  There was a stop-start approach and the industry was supposed to open a few times but that did not happen.  From a parent's perspective and looking at one's children entering the family business, they had to consider whether a pub can provide a future career for their children.</p><p>It is important for us to try to change that mentality.  We have been back open for a period of time where people can now see it is vibrant again and there is a future in our trade.  Both organisations, VFI and LVA, are trying to put apprenticeship and management courses forward to show parents there is a pathway to betterment in our business.</p><p> The Senator mentioned there is nothing better for a student than to work behind a bar or in a hotel or something like that to get the life skills that will bring them to amazing places, such as where the Senator has got to.  It very much stands to people.  I have son who was born and reared in a pub.  I was born and reared in a pub.  We are so sociable.  We can talk.  We have a head full of talk all the time.  It will get a person a long way.</p><p> We are confident going forward but, as I said, the problems are now.  This may all sort itself out in a year or two.  However, this summer there will be many tourists coming in, while pubs throughout the country will be closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.  That is not we want our tourists to see.  I think tourism in 2019 was worth &euro;9 billion to the economy.  This year, we have to be very positive.  Tourists have to have the experience of the Irish pub.  They all come to see it.  It has to be open, and it has to have efficient staff.</p></speech>

We are obviously going to be talking about later openings.  With later openings there will be staffing requirements.  I do not know what Mr. O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s perspective is.  I get all of the other points around the sale of alcohol, but obviously this is something we are looking at, particularly in the major urban centres.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.843" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Donall O'Keeffe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022052500002#E00300"><p>We are keen on late trading.  Our position, which we submitted to the licensing reform consultation, is that there should two forms of late trading licences.  These would be a late bar licence, which would allow opening until 2.30 a.m., which is in line with the current late trading hours, and a nightclub licence, which would allow opening until 5 a.m.</p> <p>  The important thing to understand about the nightclub licence is that it will be for a very small niche of the industry.  The vast majority of the industry in Dublin and nationally are happy with the current hours for the weekends.  Most of my members have no ambition to go beyond the traditional hours.  The guys who are running late bars are, broadly speaking, happy with the 2.30 a.m. closing on Friday and Saturday night.  However, there is a cohort of large businesses in the middle of our capital city that does see a market and an opportunity for later.  We attract many international tourists.  We have a big, local young population who are keen to go out late on Friday and Saturday night, in particular.  However, this will be a small niche of the industry.  I would be shocked if there were more than 25 of those business in Dublin if the licences were granted.  They will tend to be large businesses and they will tend to be city centre businesses.</p></speech>

These guys are specialists in the late-night economy.  They tend to attract those staff who are interested in that.  Currently, late bars are generally staffed with younger people who love the buzz, the energy and the vibrancy of a bar that is moving well late at night.  It will be a huge challenge to get to 5 a.m., which is a significantly later extension than we have currently seen.  However, I know those publicans who are interested in that late space have the ambition to do it, so they will make it happen.  That is what they are good at.  It is a huge challenge.</p> <p>  The other point I would make about the really late trading is there will be a ferocious challenge around insurance.  Late trading insurance for regular late bars, which close at 2.30 a.m., is ferocious.  I have a big cohort of members who are insured for 2.30 a.m. trading, who are spending between &euro;80,000 and &euro;140,000 per year on public liability insurance.  That is more than &euro;2,000 per week.  If the trade goes later, that will get more expensive.  Therefore, insurance is a real issue, as are the costs of staff and the availability of staff.</p></speech>

I concur with the best wishes to both Mr. Clancy and Ms Kealy in their roles.  I thank their predecessors who represented the organisations over difficult times.  During the week, Adrian Cummins made the point in a tweet that 150,000 people on the live register, and we have an industry that is struggling to get people working.  We met with the Restaurants Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotels Federation and F&aacute;ilte Ireland a number of weeks ago to speak about this same issue.  I say &ldquo;Well done&rdquo; to the VFI for its project with Griffith College, which I think could be expanded.  I asked about it at the time and is something I am working on myself.  We need a centre within the CAO, ETB and colleges of further education system dedicated to tourism and hospitality.  It is an industry where more than a quarter of a million people are needed to service our tourism and hospitality.  I have always put the two together.  It is important, as I have said here before, that people representing hospitality are on the board of F&aacute;ilte Ireland, because they are needed.</p> <p>  I had a meeting in my own county of Longford with representatives of the VFI, including the chair, to whom I spoke, and the vice chairperson, and of the Restaurants Association of Ireland, the ETB etc. about looking at doing what I mentioned in the midlands to service the country.  It would concentrate and specialise in particular on the catering end of things.  At the minute, Tralee and Cork are the only places in the country where a person can do certain types of chef training courses.  The reality is somebody from Donegal will not travel to Cork.</p> <p>  The people who are now running the most successful restaurants in the country went to the likes of Killybegs, Cathal Brugha Street and CERT.  All of those are gone, so there is a huge opening, not just for catering but for the entire tourism and hospitality industry, to link in with the colleges of further education and the CAO system to put something together.  When we put the emphasis on that, people will then see there is a career for them and it will get people into that.  I look forward to working with both Ms Kealy and Mr. Clancy on that, because I believe it can happen and I want to make it happen.</p> <p>  The minimum unit pricing of alcohol under the Public Health (Alcohol) Act, which was mentioned, is something of which I was supportive, and I spoke to the VFI in my area about it.  What are the witnesses' experiences of its effects since it has come in?  Has it been positive to the trade and businesses?  The witnesses quoted figures that indicate the market is changing.  What benefit do the witnesses believe that that has brought to the pub industry?</p></speech>

The abolition of the groceries order as far as it concerned alcohol was a very bad move at the time and we said so.  Multiple retailers have used alcohol as a loss leader and to drive volume sales.</p> <p>  The introduction of minimum unit pricing is a very important step.  There are two things to say about our response so far.  It only got going this year and we only got going at the end of January.  We opened fully on 22 January.  The initiative is strategically important in the sense it puts a floor on alcohol pricing.  Looking at broad comparisons of the retail price of alcohol in Ireland and in the UK last summer, for example, the scope for our prices to continue to decline was very real.  We believe the impact of a floor is therefore very important.  The minimum unit price level could be a little higher, but it is very important that policy initiative was taken and we believe it is in the long-term interests of the country, not just the industry.</p></speech>

We can see from the advertising by the large multiples there has been less focus on alcohol as being the central part of their initiatives to encourage people into their premises.  If you take 24 cans, Prior to this, they would have advertised 24 cans for &euro;25.  Now, 15 cans are &euro;25, so there is less.  They are repackaging them and people are getting less alcohol for the same price.</p> <p>  It is difficult to tell at this stage if footfall has been driven to the on-trade because of the minimum unit pricing.  That is difficult to establish that as of yet.  However, we would like to think it would encourage people to come into the pub and to drink in the pub.  From a community perspective, it is better to drink in there in a controlled environment than drinking at home.  We believe it is a positive thing.</p></speech>

However, we do not have housing for them, and that will be a problem.

If one listens to the radio at present, it is naturally and understandably tourism focused.  One would not make the connection from the advertisement to working in pubs.  We believe it has to be expanded to market hospitality as well as tourism because they are very complementary and completely interlinked but they are still a little separate.</p><p> For us, a State agency being responsible for training for hospitality and, as part of that, marketing careers in hospitality is probably the best way to go.  We believe, and the pandemic exposed it, that hospitality falls between F&aacute;ilte Ireland, SOLAS, further education, enterprise, finance and tourism.  We spent a lot of time, pre-Covid-19, seeking a response when we had issues being moved between the Departments in terms of who is responsible.  Hospitality needs a mother Department that takes responsibility for training and development for the sector.  As we said in our opening statement, there are real issues this summer, but there are also real long-term issues.  Please God we will be in a full employment economy over the medium term.  The country has emerged from the pandemic in strong economic condition and we see every sector, not just ours, screaming for staff.  Construction is very lightly staffed, hospitality is very lightly staffed and retailers are looking for staff.  Building skills capability for hospitality is the way forward in the long term, and that is something that takes time and effort.  It has to be State-led because, with the best will in the world, trade bodies or representative bodies do not have the capacity to develop national training programmes.  For it to be State-led some entity has to be charged with leading it.</p></speech>

We had 105 applications.  We have 24 on the course.  We are planning to roll that out into Dublin with Griffith College and into Cork and perhaps elsewhere.  There is an attractiveness to the course.  We have had great feedback so far from the 24 students on it.  There is a pent-up demand, more than many people think there is, and a desire to work in the industry, so I fully support what the Senator is suggesting.  That would make a great deal of sense.  We were pleasantly surprised by the level of response we got; we were amazed by it.  It is hoped there will be another cohort coming in September.  It is a three-year programme and we hope it will continue and grow stronger.</p></speech>

It is my turn now.  To extrapolate from what was said in the presentations today, Mr. O'Keeffe, you answered the question I wanted to ask in your statement.  You referred to the elimination of current silos across Departments and State agencies with regard to hospitality.  You are saying there are so many aspects to it that it has fallen between many stools, and you want to see the training, recruitment, advertising and all aspects of it coming under the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media.</p></speech>

It makes sense to us that the Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland would be natural homes for hospitality.  Currently, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has a clear remit regarding tourism, but not hospitality.  As it stands, hospitality probably sits in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, but under its SME business and perhaps even microbusiness for many of them because of the small number of staff.  Given the scale of the industry nationally, given that it employed 250,000 people pre-Covid-19, and we hope to rebuild to that, and given that it is in every parish, town, city and county in the country, there appears to be an overwhelming case for a single Government entity to take responsibility for hospitality.  As we have had such a traumatic pandemic, the challenge of rebuilding the attractiveness of the sector is going to be a multi-year and, ideally, State-led initiative.</p></speech>

For my generation, and I worked in a pub as a student when I was going to college, the pub was one of those part-time jobs.  One did not think about it as a long-term career unless one grew up with the business or it was a family business, as Mr. Moynihan mentioned.  It is great to see that shift and that now there is a degree available for students who want to pursue it because it is a very exciting, fun and energetic type of career.  I gather that there has been a difficulty in putting a degree course in place, in the sense that you are dealing with SOLAS, the further education sector and so forth.  Perhaps you wish to speak to that a little more.</p> <p>  Mr. Clancy said: "These students will go on to hold senior well-paid positions within the trade, with a lifelong career available if they so choose."  Can you give us an idea of what type of salary somebody who completes the degree can expect to start on?  Perhaps you cannot answer that question but I would like to know if it is possible to do so.</p> <p>  I refer to Mr. O'Keeffe's presentation.  You talked about where the gaps are - general management, operations, customer care and event management.  There are many courses in event management now.  When you spoke about them I thought to myself that they are key pieces in the entire industry.  If that is where the gaps are, there is a real danger that the scaffolding will come down around the structures there are in place if those key oversight people are not in the positions you mentioned.  Event management could be something in the arts or music and might not necessarily be driven towards your industry-----</p></speech>

Where do you get your operations, general management and customer care people with the required skills set unless it is something they have been in already and have come up the ranks?  I am guessing that if they are not there, you have lost them already.</p></speech>

One of the things that happened to us during the pandemic is we lost many senior, experienced, skilled staff who could not wait for the sector to reopen.  We were closed too long.  They had family and mortgage commitments.  They discovered that, due to the training they had and the experience they gained in our sector, they were highly employable.  They found jobs in retail, distribution and construction management very quickly and just moved on because they had to.  We have lost a massive level of experience.</p> <p>  On the question about training requirements and how to develop them, we have been running a diploma since 2017.  What we have learned in those five years, and as we knew at the start, is that it must be tailored specifically to the licensed trade environment.  Running an event in a pub is very different from running an event in a convention centre.</p></speech>

The other thing we learned, which is massively encouraging, is that many of the students who went through our diploma are now in senior management roles in large pubs or pub groups or are out working for themselves, where they have taken leases on pubs and are trying to build their own business.  What we find with students who have high levels of energy and enthusiasm is that their ultimate goal is to establish their own business and work for themselves.</p> <p>  One of the really important things about training provision, and the reason we believe there has to be a dedicated hospitality body for it, is that it has to be designed for the specific environment of the licensed trade.  It is not a nine-to-five job.  It is late at night and over the weekends, dealing with large numbers of customers and staff and all that goes with that.  However, one of the things we are encouraged by post the pandemic is that, like with the VFI apprenticeship course, the demand for our course is overwhelming.  Our September course is virtually sold out without advertising it at all.  The business now realises that we must invest in our staff given the brain drain we endured through Covid-19.  There will be huge opportunities in large commercial pubs throughout the country over the next five to seven years for ambitious staff.  Part of the challenge for us and the Government is to highlight that.</p></speech>

If that was being rolled out in further education around the country, there probably would be uptake for it.  There is a generation of young people now who feel, and rightly so, that they do not just want to grow up in a business.  They want to be given the skills set even if the family business is to be handed on to them.  They want the opportunity to have that skills set come from an objective point of view, not just from how their mother or father taught them how to do things.</p></speech>

It is to give them that set of skills so they can run a business, make it profitable and grow it.  They need a skill set to be able to do that in an efficient way.  If you identify somebody behind the bar who is showing he or she has aptitude, you want to retain such people and staff retention is another big issue.  On this degree course, the publican is investing in the individual.  There is a grant available but the publican has to dig deep and support the individual.  There is a mentor programme going on within the pub as well, so it is a win-win for both.  As the student goes away, he or she comes back with new ideas and can help the publican to implement those ideas.  It is an excellent initiative and it shows there is a different career path to success.  Somebody might start behind the bar and take up a lease or have their own bar in the future.  They might also take it over from their parents but it gives them the confidence, knowledge and skills to be able to develop their business and make it a success.</p></speech>

I am sorry I am not able to give a figure on it but at the end of the day, they are coming out with a degree and they will have that.  There is a potential for future income and a development opportunity for the individual.  If they want to travel, that qualification is recognised worldwide, as is our hospitality sector.  This piece of paper adds credence to their qualifications and if they go away they have a better chance of getting a better paid job in some other country.  It helps their job transferability across the world.</p></speech>

Part of our concern has to be this summer, particularly for the tourism product.  We all know there are few pubs saying they have plenty of staff; everyone is struggling.  There are things the industry can do and in our next session we will be talking with the assistant secretary of the Department.  Are there measures the Government can take in the short term that will assist?  We must bear in mind that nearly every sector is coming in saying it has skill shortages.  Are there economic or other measures that will help to address the problems this summer, particularly in tourism?  There are cost of living concerns but there are also concerns if somebody has a poor experience and is waiting for ages at the bar or before being served at a table.  Is there something specific that the Government can do?</p></speech>

The COG is looking at six different things, including: the integration of Ukrainians who want to work in hospitality; the international recruitment of staff in Europe into the Irish market; and building future skills.  The challenge for the COG process, which is the right process, is that somebody has to be made accountable for the delivery of the recommendations.  I am sure the group, which is due to finish its work in the coming weeks, will come up with sensible recommendations on how to drive this forward.  Then it becomes a matter of who is responsible for doing that and who is funding it.  We must also bear in mind that the COG is working across F&aacute;ilte Ireland; SOLAS; Enterprise Ireland; education and training boards; the expert group on future skills needs; the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Social Protection and Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media; and higher education colleges.  Somebody has to take responsibility for those outputs to make them happen.  One of the things we would ask of this committee is to ensure that is resourced to be delivered and that it does not just become a set of recommendations of things that must happen before we all wonder why it did not happen.</p></speech>

This is a long-term issue that will be with us for the next three to five years in an economy that is at virtually full employment.  We are in an economy where we will be competing with construction, retail and hospitality, which are all labour-intensive jobs.  Ultimately, the elements of the service industry all need huge numbers of staff.  While summer 2022 is hugely important, the bigger challenge is to develop a programme this summer that helps us to work our way through this in 2023, 2024 and 2025.  It would be disappointing if we were sitting here facing the summer season next year in an identical position.

I am joined by my colleague Mr. Bernard O&rsquo;Shea, the principal officer dealing with tourism policy development within the Department.  We listened with great interest to what the representatives of the vintners' associations said earlier and the discussion the committee had in April on this issue.</p> <p>  Many of the key figures have been rehearsed but I might recap some of the important ones for the sector.  In 2019, pre-Covid, tourism was worth &euro;9.5 billion in total to our economy, translating into about 260,000 jobs and &euro;1.8 billion in Exchequer revenue.  As the sector rebuilds post Covid, it is hoped we will reach about two thirds of that level and volume in 2022, which would make it among the very strongest rebounding tourism sectors in Europe.</p> <p>  Prior to Covid, the sector registered consistent increases in the numbers employed in Ireland&rsquo;s regions and was an important driver of greater regional balance and dispersed economic activity.  A sustained and, importantly, sustainable rebuild is essential given tourism supports communities and regional development in a manner unlike most other sectors.  The Minister at my Department, Deputy Catherine Martin, has worked tirelessly with colleagues across government to secure funding supports to keep the tourism sector alive during Covid-19 and then to support this initial rebuild phase.  It was very good to hear representatives of the sector acknowledge the good collaboration that has existed between the Government, the Department and the sector.</p> <p>  This year, again, the Government is providing a record level of funding for the tourism services budget, totalling &euro;288 million.  This includes &euro;50 million in business continuity funding and a &euro;35 million increase in the tourism marketing fund to support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism.  In addition, capital funding of &euro;36.5 million has been provided for tourism product development to deliver enhanced visitor experiences.  The sector faces a range of challenges, however, in common with the wider economy, such as sizeable increases in the costs of key inputs and difficulty in recruiting and retaining key skills.  Again, the earlier conversation was very illuminating in that regard.  These challenges are not unique to Ireland.  Indeed, they are shared by many countries around the world.</p> <p>  The wider tourism and hospitality sector is a shared concern for both my Department and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment as well as a range of other Departments.  Restaurants and pubs are a key part of the c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte Ireland offers to visitors.  However, as F&aacute;ilte Ireland has previously advised, about 80% of pub and restaurant trade is not tourism related.  This shared mission is reflected in the hospitality and tourism forum established earlier during the pandemic, which is co-chaired by the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin.</p><p>The forum is a valuable opportunity for both sectors to communicate their priorities and it is hoped to convene it again in the coming weeks.</p><p> At official level, we engage regularly with our counterparts in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on issues such as work permits and other matters that impact on tourism and hospitality.  As an example, both Departments are represented on the tourism and hospitality careers oversight group, COG, which brings together industry representatives, State agencies, Departments and the education sector.  The group has pivoted to focus on supporting the industry to address some of its immediate recruitment challenges in the months ahead.</p><p> Staffing shortages are not just a problem in the tourism sector.  Other sectors of the economy are facing the same challenge and it is common in tourism around the world.  When F&aacute;ilte Ireland appeared before the committee, it estimated that there were approximately 40,000 vacancies in the industry across all roles.  The Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland are working with industry and across Departments to ensure a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages.</p><p> Delays in the processing of work permits for chefs is a particular challenge for the sector, as noted previously at this committee.  The Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland have engaged closely with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to try to expedite chef employment permit applications that are already in the system, given the immediate pressure to recruit staff for the 2022 season.  All flexible resources have now been redeployed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to address processing times for general employment permit applications.  Processing times for trusted partners has decreased from 22 to 16 weeks as of mid-May.  Processing times for standard applicants remain at 22 weeks but should begin falling in the coming weeks.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment expects to see processing times for general employment permit applications being considerably reduced by the end of quarter 2, with further reductions in processing times across all permit types in quarter 3.</p><p> Our Department continues to engage with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science regarding the tourism recovery task force's recommendations, which were to strengthen F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s COG and formalise a relationship with that Department to ensure programme development and co-ordination of tourism education and training; develop a national tourism education gateway as a one-stop education access shop for all tourism employees; and ensure consistency in the quality and content of education and training provided by education providers in the tourism sector, in consultation with industry, to meet adapting needs and trends.</p><p> Regarding working conditions in the sector, F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s research indicates that 70% of people are very happy with their employment in the industry, enjoy going to work and see tourism as a long-term career option.  This is a good proportion, but we would like it to be higher and F&aacute;ilte Ireland has a range of programmes to build skills and capability for businesses and individual employees, including a suite of online self-directed professional development courses.</p><p> As part of the drive to promote tourism as an attractive sector within which to work, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has launched a new "Excellent Employer" programme to help all participating businesses to improve their employer practices and build their reputations as excellent employers.  It has also launched a transition year work placement programme and a major recruitment awareness campaign called "Works for Me".</p><p> When we look at the wider economy and the particular set of challenges facing the tourism industry, it is clear that a collective and concerted multi-stakeholder approach to tackling these challenges is required.  That is the approach that the Department will continue to pursue.</p><p> I look forward to members' questions.</p></speech>

There are two key challenges for the sector - staffing and cost.  Regarding cost, which is not always the same as value for money, an important message for tourism and hospitality is that it is vital that the sector maintain its long-term value for money proposition.  We will never be the cheapest destination in the world.  As such, it is about providing good value and thinking about pricing in the long term.</p> <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is doing a great deal of work on accessing talent pools.  We are on the COG, where we work with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is giving support to the industry to build relationships with further and higher education providers.  It is considering opportunities overseas, including specific trade and recruitment fairs.  It is working with the Department of Social Protection on the pathways to work strategy and trying to improve opportunities for tourism businesses to recruit from the live register.  It is also focusing on transition year to try to build a relationship with the sector and have it seen as a career for life.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is doing a great deal of work internationally.  It is also engaging with the European employment services, EURES, platform, which is a European co-operation network for employment services.  Within the COG, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is leading a new working group to support the industry in accessing talent pools in wider EU markets.  We are competing with other economies in that regard, but our Department is trying to support F&aacute;ilte Ireland in that work so as to ensure that the sector can continue to grow in the coming years.</p></speech>

The Minister is committed to the plan for rolling out an effective strategy for the night-time economy.  Tied into the reform of licensing laws, when will we start seeing avenues for late night openings of entertainment venues, which would support our towns and cities in having even more of a vibrant night life than is currently the case?</p></speech>

This is intimately linked with what is happening in the Department of Justice in terms of licensing laws.  I will check with colleagues in the culture division and revert with a written update.</p></speech>

Before I ask about the specifics of skills and staffing, I will ask another question related to the Department.  From seeing a great deal of coverage recently, the witnesses will be aware of the fears expressed that Ireland is starting to price itself out of attracting tourists to the country or encouraging tourism.  I am referring specifically to large hikes in hotel prices, particularly in the Dublin area.  Something that is impacting the regional parts of Ireland &ndash; I am from west Cork, but this issue extends right up the west coast from Kerry to Donegal &ndash; is the extraordinary increase in car rental prices.  There have been some reports of increases of more than 200%.  What can the Department do, and what does it intend to do, to address this situation?  Every constituency office across Ireland is inundated with passport requests.  There has been a great demand for passports.  This may indicate that people are looking to go abroad instead of holidaying domestically.  Perhaps there is a price element to this, with people getting more value for money abroad.  If so, that would be a shame.  We have bounced back and the hospitality sector has a significant opportunity to bounce back, so it is important that we not price ourselves out of the market and make ourselves uncompetitive on the European scene.  Will Mr. &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in comment on this situation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.894" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cian &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022052500002#L01100"><p>Those issues have been prominent in the media in recent weeks.  As we head into the peak tourism season and tourism&rsquo;s recovery gathers pace, there is an inevitable pressure on hotel and car rental capacity.</p><p>That is a statement of the obvious.  Hotels are also dealing with the same cost pressures being experienced by other businesses.  Nevertheless, all businesses in what I like to call the wider tourism and hospitality ecosystem have to be mindful of the need for Ireland to maintain its value-for-money proposition and they need to take the medium and long-term perspective.  There is a difference between pricing and value, but people need to think of the medium and long term rather than necessarily seeking to maximise profit.</p><p> I might outline a few facts and figures on the hotel sector.  The Irish hotel sector is rebounding strongly.  The Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC, has conducted research on this and the occupancy rates for Dublin hotels in April was 83.6%, which is way ahead of comparable markets.  In London, for instance, it is 72%, while in Rome and Amsterdam, it is 70%.  There is a wider question regarding tourism accommodation in general, given this concerns not just hotels but all the other inputs, and there is a compression in the sector.  There is pent-up demand as we have come into the summer, the night-time economy is being revived and more concerts are being held.  Everything is feeding in to this.</p><p> As a Department, we will continue to engage with the sector to encourage businesses to take the long-term view of the value for money they offer and of their pricing in order that we will be able to maintain a long-term, sustainable tourism business.  There is some positivity on the horizon.  Upwards of 2,000 hotel rooms are in the pipeline for Dublin specifically.  I do not have certainty as to whether they will come in this summer or later in the year but I think they will filter in over the year.  That will help somewhat but it is a challenge.</p><p> Similarly, in regard to car rental, we will give these messages of restraint and long-term perspective.  This is not specifically an area of responsibility for us but it does directly impact on the tourism sector.  The Car Rental Council of Ireland is part of ITIC.  As officials, we will sit down with ITIC and the Irish Hotels Federation to convey these messages, and we will also do that collaboratively with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.896" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1545" speakername="Christopher O'Sullivan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022052500002#M00200"><p>There has been much acknowledgement from the hospitality sector that the supports have been incredible during the pandemic.  The Minister fought hard for that 9% VAT rate, which we all welcome as a fantastic boost.  We have taken steps to help the hospitality sector bounce back.  Is there anything we can do, besides sending messages and making requests, to nip this in the bud and to ensure car rental will be affordable in order that when people look to visit Ireland, they will not be turned off by these car rental websites and hotel prices?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.897" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cian &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022052500002#M00300"><p>The challenge is that the Department has no regulatory or other function in regard to car rental.  From the bit of research we have conducted, it seems the car rental stock in 2022 is 40% of what it was in 2019, so there is that direct challenge between supply and demand.  Much of what we can do relates to maintaining the solidarity built earlier during Covid throughout the tourism and hospitality sector, being mindful of the support the Government has given and asking for reciprocity to maintain a sustainable, long-term tourism product.  It seems to us there are no immediate quick fixes specifically regarding car rental.  Much of it relates to global supply and a lack of cars in the wider pipeline.  In a way, had our tourism recovery not been so strong, this would not have been such an issue, but we have 40% of the previous car stock and we might have 70% of the tourists, so there is an immediate mismatch.  I suppose it falls into the category of good problems.  We would rather not have the problem, but it points to a very strongly performing tourism sector.</p></speech>

It was the owner of an artisanal food business.  I did not catch the beginning of the interview but the man was making the point that there was no suitable public transport and the business was depending on tourists to come in rented cars, so the odds were very much stacked against the business in that regard.</p><p>I thank both our guests for attending and for their presentation.  We had the advantage of hearing from representatives of the sector itself before the officials joined us.  One key issue I took from that earlier session related to the call regarding how that industry is falling between two stools.  I acknowledge the Department has done amazing work, and we would be the first to pay compliments to the officials and the Minister in respect of how the Government and the Department got behind that sector earlier during Covid to give it every possible opportunity not just to survive but to succeed.  Our guests from the previous session made the point that many of their industry's businesses would not be here today had that not been in place and the Department has to be sincerely congratulated on that.</p><p>On the point that the industry is falling between various stools, can our guests see any solutions for what the representatives of the sector outlined as the problems?  I can see where they were coming from.  The sector is caught between the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science<b></b>and that of our guests.  The industry needs just one Department to be a one-stop shop that can address issues as they arise in the sector.  Does Mr. &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in have any thoughts on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.899" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cian &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022052500002#M00500"><p>Thoughts, yes, but immediate and quick answers, perhaps not.  Covid has shown us the very significant value of the sector to the economy.  We really understood that when it was gone.  As I said earlier, it involves 260,000 people, reaching into every parish.  At the moment, the way in which the Government engages with tourism is quite clear.  The Department has a clear lead role in F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland and we deal with policy and funding.  The wider hospitality sector is more diffuse and spreads across a number of Departments.  For example, the Department of Justice deals with licensing, while local authorities deal with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Similarly, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Environment deals with work permits, a vital issue, while we work with marketing and tourism and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science deals with the issue of skills.</p> <p>  One of the positives of Covid was that all those Departments worked very well together and got a very good and consolidated view of how this sector is an entire ecosystem, with everything interlinked.  There are long-term learnings from this.  Earlier during the pandemic, the hospitality and tourism forum was established by the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister at my Department.  We and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment have worked closely.  There are certainly long-term questions to be answered as to how best to build on that co-operation, and we have heard the sector repeatedly ask for clarity on who leads on hospitality.  They are conversations we will have to reflect on and discuss with our Minister and Ministers throughout the system.  In any event, we are certainly in a much better position, post pandemic and having worked so closely together, to come up with answers that might help the sector thrive into the future and determine that clear lead.</p></speech>

It relates to comments and observations the representatives of the sector made during the earlier session.  They talked about F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s very successful efforts to encourage people to get involved in the sector in the context of recruitment.  They felt that while the campaign is only just up and running, it has been very successful.  I think we are all aware somewhere at the back of our heads, having listened to discussions about it on the radio, of the need to encourage young people, in particular, to get involved in, and to consider a long-term career in, this sector.  Our guests in the previous session felt people do not necessarily make the connection between what F&aacute;ilte Ireland is talking about with regard to the hotel sector and their own sector, comprising pubs and so on.  Is there anything that can be done in the tourism sector to respond to that call?</p></speech>

The vintners' associations referred to the plans that will emerge from the careers oversight group and we will certainly take those observations on board.  On tourismcareers.ie, a range of courses and careers are provided for and highlighted, including in the wider hospitality sector.</p><p>In practice, there is quite a degree of support for careers within the wider hospitality sector, but we will certainly take on board the comments of industry this morning.</p></speech>

I was quite impressed, frankly, by what was available.  Perhaps there is a need to increase awareness around that.  What is very useful is that a lot of those courses are very well dispersed throughout the country.</p></speech>

I am aware there was a &euro;10 million programme for professional development supports.  Will Mr. &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in provide an update on how that programme is being implemented?</p></speech>

In terms of the funding, F&aacute;ilte Ireland's total funding in the area of sustainable employment this year will be of the order of &euro;5 million.  This has been combined with funding for its digital programme around Digital that Delivers, which enhances the education available to tourism employers and tourism and hospitality businesses.  In terms of that funding programme, that has been achieved.</p> <p>  In terms of the other recommendations of the task force, one of them was that we would formalise our engagement with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and we have made some progress on that.  We continue to work and engage with that Department.  A task force is going to be set up to look at the particular recommendation around the establishment of what was referred to as a tourism gateway, to make it clear where all of the career possibilities lie, to make it clearer how a person could have a tourism career and to make the career pathway clearer.  We will continue to engage with that Department and look forward to participating in the subgroup.</p></speech>

The estimate for 2022 is the unemployment rate will be around 6%.  There is a real challenge there for the tourism and hospitality sector.  One element that is often forgotten about is youth unemployment.  I want to understand how the Government can respond to this across various Departments.  The Department of Social Protection is trying to drive down the live register, while the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media is trying to recruit.  Are there discussions among various Departments regarding a whole-of-government approach to youth employment support programmes?  Is work going on to make young people aware there are careers within the sector?  Is there an entry programme to enable them to get off the live register and move into the sector?</p></speech>

In terms of engaging with people who might be unemployed, F&aacute;ilte Ireland liaises directly with the Department of Social Protection on the pathways to work programme.  It has found that programme to be a good avenue for assisting with the provision of people to fill vacancies.  In terms of young people, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has reached out to the third level colleges to make students aware of opportunities and has put students in touch with employers for seasonal vacancies, for example.  It is also doing work in secondary schools with the school-leaver cohort to make them more aware of careers in tourism and how they might be able to take advantage of that later in their careers, as they make their way through the education pathway.</p></speech>

I can say that under the transition year programme on which F&aacute;ilte Ireland engages with secondary schools, 600 placements have been made.  That is an illustration of progress.</p></speech>

The candidates may be coming from outside the EU, from Europe or even from some other part of Ireland but accommodation is a real issue.  I know the Department is aware of this but is there anything it can do to ease that problem?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.919" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cian &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022052500002#N01800"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question and, again, it is an issue that does not have an easy solution.  Indeed, in addressing some of the accommodation needs of staff in the tourism sector, hotels and others are often using some of their own accommodation, which then further squeezes availability for tourists.  Our focus is on trying to keep open the pipeline of people engaging in the tourism experience.  Our focus is also on trying to ensure the long-term value for money proposition is maintained.  The accommodation issue is particularly extreme in Dublin and the major cities but we are also seeing it along the Wild Atlantic Way, where there is a real squeeze on both hotel and worker accommodation.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Shea might be able to elaborate further on the discussions we have had with F&aacute;ilte Ireland on this.  We are alive to this issue and perhaps my colleague has something to add.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.920" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard O'Shea" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022052500002#N01900"><p>There is nothing definitive but we are very much aware of the problem.  I will refer to Dingle as an example.  Dingle is a very busy tourism destination during the summer and trying to source accommodation for workers in the sector is a particular challenge during the summer.  It is part of the national housing challenge and, as industry representatives have said, the solutions lie in the Housing for All initiative.</p></speech>

Those are good reputable hotels which are good places in which to work.  Some hotels have changed from advertising in regional newspapers on a monthly basis to a weekly basis, which involves a cost factor.  The witnesses are aware of the challenges but those examples underline the difficulty in recruiting staff.  I appreciate the efforts and initiatives taken by F&aacute;ilte Ireland and by the Department to encourage people and get the message out that hospitality is a good career option.  Is the Department of the view there is still a hang-up from the pandemic, or a nervousness about the sector because of what happened during the pandemic?  Even though wages might increase and job security in the sector might become more positive, is there a nervousness about the sector because the next pandemic might be around the corner and the industry might shut down?  Is there a hang-up about that?  How would the Department address such nervousness about the sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.923" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cian &Oacute; Lion&aacute;in" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TOJ2022052500002#O00200"><p>I do not know if I would go so far as to call it a hang-up but there is certainly some background noise internationally in terms of international travel and tourism planning in the long term, whereas prior to the pandemic people would be already planning for 2023.  We have found that the timescales within which people are planning their travel and tourism are much more truncated.  If we follow that through to what is happening on the ground, it would probably be a reasonable assumption that there is a certain carefulness in planning to be a tourist or to work in the sector.</p> <p>  Having listened to the committee's conversation with the VFI, I was heartened to hear that employers are now focusing on the employees, on making the sector a good place in which to work and on working with employees to ensure a long-term employment relationship is built.  That is where the focus needs to be.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is doing its excellent employer programme to ensure we produce a generation of people who will view this as a sector they really want to work in because they can stay in their own communities and can do really meaningful and interesting work.  It is a very important economic sector but it should always be viewed as a valuable place in which to work and to have a meaningful career.  That is what we are trying to push.</p></speech>

I thank the gentlemen for their presentations.  I hope we might be able to take action on some of the ideas and suggestions from our earlier witnesses today.  I thank the witnesses before us who have responded very well to those suggestions.  I know they are working furiously in the background on this issue.  The truth of the matter is that this issue affects many sectors - not only the hospitality sector but also the retail sector and many others.  The problem of recruiting and retaining staff is one we are all hearing.  It is a major challenge.  The bigger picture from the VFI's message is that it is a long game and we must put a plan in place that will map out over the next three or four years how we will get people to take up courses or to view employment in the sector as a long-term career.  It is a challenge but I have no doubt that the witnesses are well capable of addressing it in their Department.  I thank them both.</p> <p>  I also thank colleagues for joining us.

The meeting will comprise two sessions.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome to the first session the chair designate of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, Dr. Declan Bedford.  I thank him for attending.  We look forward to his opening presentation.</p> <p>  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statement is potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members that the Constitution requires them to be physically present in the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate when they are not able to meet this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be reluctantly asked to leave the meeting.  I ask any member participating using Microsoft Teams to confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making their contributions.  Members attending in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  I ask Dr. Bedford to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am a specialist in public health medicine with a particular interest in alcohol and road safety.  I graduated from University College Dublin in 1976 and worked as a specialist in public health medicine with the HSE and as director of public health in the north east for seven years until my retirement from the HSE in August 2012.  I am a fellow of the faculty of public health medicine of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.</p> <p>  For three years, from 2015 to 2017, I was employed part-time by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, as health systems research and development adviser to the RCSI Hospitals Group.  In March 2020, I came out of retirement to work as a specialist in public health during the first wave of Covid for three months and again from January to June 2021.  My main responsibilities in that time were working with nursing homes and meat factories.</p> <p>  I am currently chairman of the quality, safety and risk committee of the National Screening Service.  I will complete my term of office there at the end of this month.  I have been involved in research for many years and my published research covers a wide range of public health topics, including suicide and mental health, alcohol, men&rsquo;s health, injury prevention, infectious diseases, health services and use of hospital services.</p> <p>  Regarding board experience, I have been a board member of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety since 2015 and chairman since 2017.  I am a former member of the North Eastern Health Board, the Drug Treatment Centre Board and the board of the faculty of public health medicine.  I was also one of the founding members of Alcohol Action Ireland and was a board member for many years until the end of 2021.</p><p>I was chairman of the Health Research Board for five years from 2012 to 2017.  The HRB is a statutory agency under the aegis of the Department of Health and the lead agency in Ireland responsible for supporting and funding health research.</p><p> I was chairman of the working party on traffic medicine in the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland as part of the national programme office for traffic medicine for seven years until January of this year.  This office was jointly established by Royal College of Physicians in Ireland and the Road Safety Authority of Ireland in 2011, bringing the specialty of traffic medicine to Ireland for the first time.  The goal is to help doctors and licensing authorities promote safe mobility in Ireland.  The best-known element of traffic medicine is the need for medical certification showing fitness to drive and we published guidelines on fitness to drive called Sl&aacute;inte agus Tiom&aacute;int, which are updated annually.</p><p> As chairman of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, I will continue to work to ensure that the bureau continues to achieve its mission to provide a high-quality national forensic service in alcohol and drug intoxicant detection in support of the effective operation of the road traffic legislation.  I will work with the director and other board members to ensure that we continue to review how we operate on an ongoing basis to ensure that we comply with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.</p><p> I will work with the director and other board members to ensure that we continue to implement our five-year strategic plan and objectives which include: to continue to provide a high-quality national forensic service in alcohol and drug analysis, the provision of bureau certificates and court assistance; to maintain the ISO accreditation status achieved for analytical programmes within the bureau and to extend the accreditation to additional areas; to adapt and incorporate into bureau activities any new legislation requirements; to build up a forensic toxicology knowledge base within the bureau scientific staff; to ensure that all the work in the bureau is maintained and improved where possible to a high standard of quality that is required of a national forensic laboratory in an efficient and cost-effective way; to maintain effective management systems and operate within best accounting practices and frameworks.</p></speech>

I thank him for his opening statement.  There is no doubt that he is very well qualified to do this role.  He has wealth of experience.  I thank him for his efforts in our struggles against Covid and for coming out of retirement and taking up that role.  Where are the offices of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety situated?  How many people work there?  How many tests does it deal with per week or per month?  What is the turnaround time for testing?  There seems to be an increasing prevalence of drugs within society.  Would it be fair to say there is an increasing detection of drugs among people driving?  What is the percentage breakdown between alcohol and drugs?  Is that percentage increasing?</p> <p>  When did the five-year strategic plan and objectives come into being?  When will that be reviewed?  Does that plan follow international best practice?  Has the bureau looked at other jurisdictions throughout the world including the UK and European countries?  Does it follow a particular model that is already in place?  </p></speech>

It was purpose built.  It started in 1968.  It we have a relationship with UCD in that all our staff are paid via UCD while being a totally independent unit.  We have approximately four staff with a few more promised in the near future.</p> <p>  The business is a laboratory examining samples of blood and urine to detect the presence of alcohol and drugs.  The main culprit at present is still alcohol.  However, drugs are trending upwards.  As the Deputy hinted, they are likely to continue to increase if more drug use takes place because a rising tide will bring up all ships.  The prevalence of drug taking has been increasing with cannabis and other drugs.  We have found an increase in the past two years and it is becoming more serious.  Some garda&iacute; on patrol say that it is only a matter of time before drugs and driving becomes more prevalent than drinking and driving.  The commonest drug is cannabis.</p> <p>  Canada legalised cannabis use in 2018 and the studies that have been carried out thus far are equivocal.  Some studies show an increase in crashes and some do not.  However, they have found a 5% increase in cannabis taking since it was legalised.  People can go into a designated shop and buy cannabis and, therefore, it is likely to increase.  If people smoke cannabis or take other drugs and drive, they will drive until they get caught.  The research in Ireland is very clear.  I did some of it myself many years ago and it has been followed up since.  For men in particular, why do they obey the rules of the road and not speed and drink and drive?  It is not from goodwill.  The fear of getting caught is the only deterrent.  As with everything else we need highly visible enforcement and that works.</p> <p>  As the Deputy has probably noticed, during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020 the number of detections increased.  Even though fewer people were driving, there were Garda checkpoints and people were presenting themselves and did not realise they were presenting themselves because Garda checkpoints related to Covid ended up picking up more people.  The number of positive samples we got in 2020 was 23% higher than in 2019.  While we have not finalised the figures for last year, it looks like it has levelled off at that level now.  It is much the same and has not continued to increase.</p></speech>

His CV is very impressive and he brings a lot of expertise to this.  Unfortunately, a lot of the work he does is probably of a tragic nature because, no more than the Road Safety Authority, he is delving into the cause of accidents, their aftermath etc.</p> <p>  I would like to take up a number of points, following Deputy Carey's questions.  I refer to drug-driving.  For decades, we have all been familiar with drink-driving.  Younger generations have come to grips with that and there are designated drivers who have soft drinks or zero alcohol beer on a night out.  In terms of drug taking, a term was bandied about years ago, namely "functional alcoholics", that is, people have a few glasses of wine every night of the year and can still, whether doctors say they can, get up the following morning, get to work and do a day's work.  We are now hearing there are also functional drug takers who can go into a bar at night, snort cocaine and then claim they are able to go into a job the following day, some of which are high-powered, high-paid jobs, and function in that regard.  Does that concern Dr. Bedford?  It is something he is seeing more of?  He has given us some statistics, but functional alcoholics will, no matter what the law tells them, get into their cars with the keys and drive.  Is he seeing an increase in terms of functional drug taking and people carrying on as normal the following day?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.970" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Declan Bedford" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022052500002#C01900"><p>We do not see it, but studies have been done by the Health Research Board and other international groups do European-wide studies on the prevalence of intoxicants.  Many people, in particular younger people who have not always seen the tragic consequences of addiction, think they can function after a hard night out and will be fine the next day.  Overall, it catches up on people.  For example, a functional alcoholic might be able to get away with addiction on a day-to-day basis, but alcohol over a lifetime is one of the leading causes of cancer. Some 10% of the cases of breast cancer in women are caused by alcohol.  People never think of that.  They do not think of all of the other side effects of being a functional alcoholic, such as the expense and the fact they are more likely to get into fights and arguments inside and outside of home.</p> <p>  The evidence is clear from a driving point of view.  Any amount of alcohol is detrimental to one's driving.  There are alcoholics who have difficulty with driving and have been caught drink-driving.  One of the actions in the new national road safety strategy is to examine an interlock system in cars.  People would have to breathe into an apparatus in a car and it would not work without the correct result.  The evidence is they will work as part of a programme, because the problem with a lot of alcoholics in Ireland is there is no effective treatment service for them.  To keep people off alcohol, they have to be part of a treatment service.  A working party is examining the use of interlock systems.  I am sure when it finishes that work, it will say it will have to be part of a complete rehabilitation programme for alcoholics.  People can recover, but too many people fall by the wayside.  It is difficult.</p></speech>

I believe the test is used is the Dr&auml;ger DrugTest 5000, an oral fluids test.  If I understand correctly, it can pick up traces of opiates, cocaine, benzodiazepines and cannabis.  The whole world of drugs is evolving by the day.  There are pills and small tablets I have never heard of, some of which were discussed on "Prime Time" recently.  If that test, dating back to 2017, is what most Garda cards are kitted out with, is it up to date?  Is it able to detect everything?</p></speech>

In fact, we are out to tender for some machines.  They have to go through a vigorous accreditation prospect process first because the machines get better.  In the laboratory, blood samples come in and when we find a blood sample where the blood alcohol level is less than 100, we test for drugs, including an array of drugs that are only coming on the market.  As they are not known to anybody, they are not illegal.</p> <p>  At the moment, we are testing for drugs from a legal point of view, such as, as the Deputy mentioned, cannabis, cocaine, benzos and amphetamines.  The interesting thing about benzodiazepines is, as I mentioned, one of them is Valium, which the Deputy might have heard of.  People are prescribed that.  People may wonder if they are stopped and have a legitimate prescription how they could be fined.  People with a legitimate prescription who are taking the right dose are not breaking the law by the mere fact of a positive test.  In that case, the issue is whether the person is fit to drive on the day.  Garda&iacute; have to make a decision as to whether the person is fit.  If a person is not legitimately prescribed a drug, then there is an automatic penalty.</p></speech>

As I see it, the killers on the road are speed, drink- and drug-driving, bad driving, which will always be a factor, and fatigue, which is very hard to measure.  I do not drink or take drugs and drive, but I find fatigue something I have tried to overcome when I am coming to the D&aacute;il early in the morning and late at night.  Many people face that.  I do not suppose Dr. Bedford has any metrics on that.  I am sure it is impossible to measure.</p></speech>

We can sometimes tell what the cause of a road crash is, such as where somebody has been driving, falls asleep and hit something without using the brakes.  People who are in a crash when awake slam the brakes on.  Somebody may crash into a tree having come off the road and were not paying attention because they fell asleep.  The interesting thing is we have all felt tired while driving.  Sometimes when we feel tired while driving we open a window, turn the radio up and do other things.  They do not work.  People have to get out of the car and take a ten or 15-minute break, have a cup of coffee and go for a walk.  My car tells me when to take a break.</p></speech>

One night I was coming back from Galway at about 1 a.m.  I live in Navan and was an hour and a half into the journey when the car told me I was looking tired and to stop.  It worked.  The national road strategy proposes that by 2050 there be zero deaths and injuries.  All of that technology will have to be involved.  The main message about driving while tired is there is no way of stopping it except for getting out of the car, having a ten-minute nap, getting some fresh air or having a cup of coffee.</p></speech>

I have some questions on the technology that is being used, which he mentioned in his response to Deputy Carey.  Is he satisfied with the equipment?  Is there a need for improvement?  Is it up to the best standard possible?  I assume given the changing nature of intoxicants, the technology moves with the times.</p><p>My background is in laboratory medicine.  I presume some sort of chromatography is involved.</p></speech>

Dr. Bedford said he is interested in bringing other areas under that standard.  I realise it is an arduous job.  Where does he envisage the expansion?</p> <p>  I have a question on the positivity rates.  Dr. Bedford gave us the figures.  Is there an increasing number of positives or are we getting more samples per year, for example?  Could Dr. Bedford make a point on that?</p> <p>  How would Dr. Bedford like to see the service develop during the period in question?  What are the challenges and opportunities?</p></speech>

The ISO standard is 17025.  Our analytical programmes have that accreditation.  We are looking at other areas of business in this regard.  Our equipment is always up to date and the best, and that is why we keep tendering.  The equipment has a lifespan.  It is a matter of staying with the best and ensuring it is as accurate, sensitive and specific as possible.  Our staff train the members of the Garda and check all the equipment regularly to ensure it is performing properly.  Since road safety fines represent one of the most challenging areas of legislation, the equipment has to be very good.  The standards are very high.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the positivity rates.  Of the approximately 4,800 samples we got, 2,151, or a little less than half, were positive.  Sixty-six percent of those were positive for cannabis, 46% for cocaine, 8% for opiates and 5% for benzodiazepines.  We encounter cases of polydrug or multiple drug use.  In the new road safety strategy, it is recommended that we consider increasing the penalties for the use of more than one substance.  A person might test positive for alcohol and one or two other drugs.  If a motorist is positive for two drugs, the penalty should be higher than for one.</p> <p>  Regarding where we look forward to going, what we do is based purely on the legislation.  If the legislation changes the limit for a new drug, that is where we go.  We respond to the legislation rather than doing otherwise.  However, we have to keep researching the trends also.  When drug trends begin to emerge, people recommend to the Oireachtas Members or others the inclusion of such and such in the legislation.</p></speech>

Also, we regularly check to see whether there is something better.  We have to keep replacing equipment all the time.  There is a programme for doing that.

They have to go through a process of rigorous testing to ensure they do what they say on the tin.</p></speech>

I have absolute confidence in his qualifications and experience.</p> <p>  I propose that the committee engage further with the Medical Bureau of Road Safety following today's meeting.  Its annual report for 2020 is an extraordinary piece of work that the committee should examine.  A report earlier this year revealed a trebling in the number of drivers behind the wheel after taking cocaine.  Second, the increase in the taking of alcohol and drugs while driving is a worry.  What is more worrying is that nine out of ten of those responsible are male.  Could Dr. Bedford comment on what committee members should report to the Minister and Road Safety Authority?  I recognise that the Medical Bureau of Road Safety does not have a role similar to that of the Road Safety Authority but could have a twin-track approach to improving road safety.</p></speech>

The percentage of those we have tested positive for cocaine over the past three years has not changed; it has stayed very much the same.  It was about 8% in 2019, 8% in 2018 and 8% in 2017.  However, there is an increase in the amount of drug-taking overall in Ireland, so it will filter through eventually to driving.</p> <p>  On the question on males, unfortunately it is the case, not just in Ireland, that most dangerous and reckless driving is done by younger males.  That is not to say it is not also done by females and older men but younger men tend to take too many risks.  They have a great belief in their own ability to drive but do not have the experience to match that.</p></speech>

We do not see the hazards.  Another problem is that when young men are with their mates in the car, there are high jinks and 100% attention is not paid to the road.  That is contrary to the trend among others.  When they have a passenger in the car, they are safer because there is another set of eyes on the road.  The difficulty with the young men is that they do not have the experience, are full of life and take too many chances.  Therefore, they will be involved in crashes and bad decision-making.  That is common the world over, unfortunately.  The trend is similar among the ladies, even though the percentage is much lower.  While only 25% of the crashes involve ladies, the number is higher in the younger age group.</p> <p>  When you look at the number of road crashes, it is remarkable that about 25% of fatal road crashes involve speed and about 30% to 35% involve alcohol or drugs.  One of the extraordinary things about road safety is that 26% of people involved in such crashes were not wearing a seat belt.  This seems extraordinary in this day and age.  I went to the Garda headquarters and reviewed 900 deaths over a period spanning a couple of years.  It was a bit harrowing at times.  One person who had been drinking and who had gone home to his bed was rung by a friend who said he could not get home.  He went out to collect him, not having driven earlier that night, and he ended up getting killed.  There was another case in which I saw an unfinished text by the driver.  As the Deputy mentioned before, the crashes are harrowing.  Unfortunately, young males are the biggest problem.</p></speech>

I am confused by a statement on page 21 of the 2020 annual report.  It states 86 station-based systems were available and that 43 of those were available for use outside the station.  It adds that, in total, 87 analysers were available exclusively for mobile use.  I am curious as to what that actually means.  Maybe Dr. Bedford might revert to me on it if he cannot answer today.</p></speech>

It is probably about the adding up.  The Deputy suggested he would not mind having representatives of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety back some day and that would be no problem for director or me.</p><p>The director is Professor Denis Cusack.  We could discuss the technicalities of any question the Senator has in that regard.</p></speech>

The amount of available data is unbelievable.  That is why I asked the question.  I was not in any way trying to trip up Dr. Bedford.  There is analysis of difference by county and charts indicating what happens at different times of the day, including the mornings, afternoons and weekend.  It is curious that the numbers on Mondays are higher than a Friday, for example.</p></speech>

They would be after midnight, for example, and that is interesting.  A couple of years ago, research I did indicated that between 15% and 20% of fatal road crashes occurred between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m., when people go to work.  People may still have alcohol in their systems at that time.</p></speech>

That 15% to 20% of fatal crashes in the morning have alcohol involved.  I was speaking one day with garda&iacute; at an education meeting and they told me it can be awkward and they do not want to be seen as Big Brother too much.  I said that if they set up a check on the road I use in the mornings, the M3 to Dublin, or if they put up a sign indicating a mandatory alcohol breath test stop, there would be drivers counting themselves lucky and saying that if they had been there five minutes afterwards they would have been caught.  Even if they did not do a single test and people saw them taking down the sign and started thanking God for it, if they did it a few times, people would get the word out and think they should mind themselves on the night before.</p></speech>

The work of the medical bureau on safety is something the committee should engage on more.  As a member of the joint policing committee in Cork city, I am conscious that there are discrepancies between urban and rural areas as well.  That is mentioned in the annual report and there is reference to analysis of incidents and detection rates.  Will Dr. Bedford comment on that?  Dublin had 1,799 recorded incidents and we can go down to Deputy Carey's county of Clare, which had 25 specimens received for analysis.  I am curious as to how that disparity arises.  That is on page 9 of the 2020 annual report.  It is a fascinating report, but it is something we should go back to.  We have had an appalling start to 2022 in terms of road safety.</p></speech>

In Dublin if somebody is on a night out, he or she can get the DART, Luas or the bus home, or even walk.  If a person is down in the middle of the country, he or she is more tempted to drive and take a chance.  Much of this is population-based but even still we see some variation between counties that are roughly the same size.  One would expect Leitrim, as the smallest county in the country, to have the smallest number, for example, but it is second to last.  That is over one year and we might find the county down around there every year.  We have discussed at board level putting these figures at per thousand of population, and that might balance it and give a better reading.</p> <p>  With regard to the Senator's other suggestion, the director and I, along with anybody else from the bureau, would be very happy to come before the committee again.</p></speech>

I am on the joint policing committee in Limerick city and county, and Chief Superintendent Gerard Roche and his staff come before us.  The number of drug-related testing of drivers is increasing relative to tests for alcohol.  We are told one in seven roadside drug tests prove positive, whereas one in 30 prove positive in alcohol testing.  When garda&iacute; test for drugs, one person in every seven returns as positive but with alcohol it is one person from every 30.  Based on the bureau's report, two thirds of everyone tested is under 34.  Some 30% of those people are under 24.  That is 1,335 individuals.  Another 38% are between 25 and 34.  Two thirds of all people tested in 2020 were under the age of 34.  They were predominantly male.  Is that correct?  That is 3,000 of 4,489 tests done.</p> <p>  Dr. Bedford might correct me if I am wrong, but detection of cocaine seems to be increasing exponentially relative even to cannabis.  The figure for cannabis detection was 1,747 in 2019 and 2,606 in 2020.  The figure for cocaine in 2019 was 852.  It increased to 1,494 in 2020.  The cannabis figure saw a 50% increase and the cocaine figure saw a 75% increase.</p> <p>  There is also the percentage of tests carried out.</p><p>In 2019, 36% of the 13,500 tests were alcohol tests and that went up to 43% in 2020.  Toxicology tests went up from 24% of tests to 33% and the number of evidential breath tests went down.  Are we seeing an epidemic on the roads, given drug testing is now overtaking alcohol testing?  Dr. Bedford might also comment on how long drugs stay in the system.  If someone takes a drug, be it cocaine or otherwise, they can get up the following morning and not have a hangover or the sickness people get from drinking alcohol.</p></speech>

It is slower if a person has been eating and so on, and it depends on other factors.  Cannabis can stay there for several hours.  The trouble is when people are smoking, they do not know how much they have taken.  If someone takes a pint of Guinness, they have taken two units, so they know that exactly, but when they take a drag of a cigarette or a joint, they do not know what they have taken.</p></speech>

When the test came in originally, it was new and it takes a bit of time to get up to speed.  That might explain some of it.</p> <p>  In one sense, there is a reward aspect because, if they are finding people, they will say it is worth doing.  They might say there is no point going out tonight because they will not get anybody, but if they go out and set up a roadblock, there is a chance of picking people up.  In one sense, that is backward because the idea of the legislation and the road checks is prevention and to stop people in the first place.  In Australia, there was a legitimate story of police officers going out to a road checkpoint with a trainee police officer.  They were there for a few hours and found nobody.  When the trainee police officer said it was a waste of time, the senior police officer said it was not, because people knew they were out there and they were not drink-driving or drug-driving.  That is what our legislation is meant to do as well.  The roadblocks and the enforcement are highly visible to stop people taking intoxicants, whether it be drugs or alcohol.</p> <p>  To go back to the point, drug taking is becoming more prevalent and the trends in Ireland are increasing.  If more people are taking drugs and these people drive cars, more people will be detected.  When people hear about detection and the higher rates, it may deter them.  People now say they cannot drink and then drive home.  They have to get that same attitude in regard to drugs as well.  That will be done by increasing the number of checkpoints.  Highly visible enforcement is the key.</p></speech>

I will continue on from the Cathaoirleach&rsquo;s point.  I think none of us is too shocked that there is an increase in the number of people who have drugs in their system when stopped at checkpoints or after accidents on the basis there is a huge increase in the number of people taking drugs.  When there is a case of GAA motions going to congress in regard to cocaine use, we are fairly sure it is prevalent throughout the community and beyond that.  Like many others, I have dealt with a large number of issues in the recent past, including drug debt, intimidation and all the rest.  The money would not be in it unless there were a substantial number of people taking drugs.</p><p>Let us deal specifically with these tests.  We are all looking forward to the day we will have a citizens' assembly on drug use because we need to look at something novel for how we will deal with the entire issue.  At the minute we are incapable of dealing with it from a health or policing point of view and we are not able to stop or stem the supply or demand.  That is not to take away from the fact that there has to be huge police action on dangerous criminals; that goes without saying.  That is my single transferable speech on drugs and I would like to be able to update it in the near future.</p><p> I know people have varying views on cannabis but we have heard that what one gets on the street is a hell of a lot stronger than what people would have gotten ten, 20 or 30 years ago.  Has the Medical Bureau of Road Safety noticed this among those who have been tested, following an accident for example?  Are they much more high than would have previously been the case?  I get that drug testing has only been happening lately.  I am asking about the potency of the cannabis.</p></speech>

He was congratulated on some of the work the Garda had carried out and it was down to the drug squad being put back into action, there not having been one for a couple of years and at that stage there were three or four members.  The superintendent said it was great and that hopefully they would get the numbers up to five but that he could do with 50 or 100.  He also asked if there was anywhere in the world where this has worked.  That is why I am saying we need to have that citizens' assembly on drug use as soon as possible, while also accepting that Ireland is small, whether it is 26 counties or 32 counties.  If something novel is to happen it would probably have to happen on a Europe-wide basis.  I do not expect Dr. Bedford to give a view on that and I accept that I am on a tangent.</p> <p>  I refer to Dr. Bedford's specific remit and the Chair has asked him about resourcing.  Is there a need for updated legislation to deal with the particular circumstances we are in?  There is another thing everyone talks about and there are people who are using cocaine at the minute but who are not necessarily getting penalised to the degree that they become pariahs.  I am not saying that necessarily works but this has been put to me by people who work in this situation and they say that at the end of the day, people who are heroin addicts end up going around and around with court cases and all the rest of it.  We do not have the appropriate addiction services either.  An awful lot of people who would see themselves as safe recreational users of cocaine may have good jobs and may otherwise be ticking the correct boxes but some of them can breeze through life and it does not have the same impact.</p></speech>

There is recreational use and there are the people who are unfortunately poorer and more deprived and they are in a vicious circle of heroin and poverty, which is very difficult.  On the questions about resourcing, the Department has been good to us and we have always had a good working relationship with it.  On legislation, two areas are mentioned in the road safety strategy which would be worth following up on.  One is the use of interlocks for drivers, which I mentioned earlier before the Deputy was here.  However, that has to be part of a programme of proper rehabilitation.</p></speech>

That is one area of legislation and the other one is with regard to the different penalties and increasing them for somebody found with more than one intoxicant in their blood stream.  A person taking cocaine could be in the pub all night having several pints as well and so they are only penalised for having the alcohol or the one drug in their system but some people have combinations of drugs in their systems.  That is another area we looked at.  It is mentioned in the road safety strategy as an area that has to be looked at with regard to legislation.  Those are the two areas we could focus on.</p></speech>

In Ireland we have always had a history of people drinking too much and you now hear that people use cocaine as a means of being able to drink too much and they can still go on a three or four-day bender with it.  That can sometimes end in absolute disaster.  I used the term "recreational" but there is a significant amount of people who think they will get through this OK and they will find themselves in bad situations when their families end up with a knock on the door from someone looking for a debt to be repaid.  It is a complicated issue.  I appreciate the information Dr. Bedford has given us and it is something we need to chase up on.</p></speech>

We do not have any yea or nay over the appointment of chairs.  This is purely a formality.  However, today's engagement with Dr. Bedford has been far wider than just being a formality.  I thank him for his engagement and for his willingness to engage with my colleagues on the area of drink and drug driving and the damage this does on the roads.  I have been driving for approximately 42 years and the first time I was ever stopped and breathalysed was at 2 a.m. in Sandyford while returning from Northern Ireland.  I was quite surprised to be stopped after all those years.  Thankfully, I passed the test.  I wish we saw a bit more of it, that is to say, more random checks.  I appreciate that it is quite hard to have random checks on the motorway network.  I would like to see a little bit more sense with regard to speed cameras.  It does not make a lot of sense to have a speed camera on the N11 when it is a dead straight and clear road.  There is no speed control on many of the country roads we travel.  I used to talk about a very elderly relation of mine who used to go to the pub every night and whose car knew its own way home.  The speed cameras should be on those roads.  I thank the Chair for allowing me in.</p></speech>

The Senator said this engagement is a waste of time.  From our point of view, it is not because our work is based on the legislation the Members here enact.

At the end of 2020, there were 130 devices available for roadside drug testing in comparison with the 75 available at the end of 2019.  That is an increase of 61%.  Is that figure enough?  Should there be more?  Should they be available at all checkpoints?  What is Dr. Bedford's view on that?  Am I reading it wrong?</p></speech>

As I mentioned before, highly visible enforcement is the key.  We do not get stopped very often on our roads.  I first started driving and got my car in 1979, which was an interesting year in the sense that 650 people were killed on the road.  That was the environment I was entering.  Highly visible enforcement is key.  Despite the amount of driving we do, we are very rarely stopped.  The more times people are stopped, the safer our roads will become whether they are stopped for speeding, drinking or seat belts.  Some 25% of those who die on the roads are not wearing seat belts.  That is extraordinary.</p></speech>

I was honoured to have been asked to take on the role of chairperson at Shannon Group by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, with the agreement of the Government.  It is a privilege to attend this committee as chair-designate of Shannon Group.  I will start by telling the committee about my background.  I am originally from Belfast and now live in Dublin.  I graduated in law from Queen's University Belfast in 1991 and I am a member of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.  I have over 15 years of experience at board level in both executive and non-executive roles across the aviation, telecom, retail and banking sectors.  Over the years, I have gained comprehensive board and corporate governance experience, both in chair and non-executive director positions.  I am the founder and chair of Fibrus, a telecommunications provider which has raised &pound;500 million to invest in broadband infrastructure in the North of Ireland.  Before Fibrus, I spent 12 years as CEO of Limerick-based Enet, a telecoms provider, taking it from start-up to its &pound;200 million acquisition by the Irish Infrastructure Fund in 2017.  As CEO of Enet, l also led what is now known as National Broadband Ireland, NBI, to become the winning bidder for the &euro;2 billion Irish national broadband plan.  Prior to Enet, I was commercial director at Ryanair, which gave me a good insight into how airlines think and operate, in particular into how the airline identified and developed new routes.  It is important to stress that I have spent a significant amount of my time in the mid-west over the years.  As well as running Enet for 12 years, I also served two terms as a director of the Shannon Foynes Port Company so I have a good understanding of the challenges associated with the region and with its economic issues.</p> <p>  This is an unprecedented period of challenge for airports globally and for the entire aviation industry.  This sector has been devastated by Covid-19 and there is no one in the industry that is not facing significant challenges.  We need to recognise that and, as we emerge from the pandemic, that the aviation landscape has changed.  The aviation industry, route patterns and work patterns are different.  We must quickly learn what is temporary and what is permanent.  We must develop plans to adapt to that and find ways to identify and deal with the new threats and opportunities that emerge from this landscape in post-pandemic Ireland.</p> <p>  I want to talk about the Shannon Group's potential.  The importance of the Shannon Group in supporting the regional economy does not escape me.  It is the beating heart at the centre of prosperity in the mid-west and our entire Atlantic corridor.  At the core of this group is Shannon Airport, which provides essential air connectivity that supports businesses and the livelihoods of thousands of people in the west of Ireland.  It is a vital national strategic interest that plays an essential part in bringing business people, tourists and cargo into the region.  As a gateway, the airport assists with the dispersal of international tourists, particularly US visitors, to the benefit of tourism, hospitality and service businesses right along the Wild Atlantic Way.  Over the years, Shannon Group has contributed significantly to economic activity and growth in the mid-west region.  I am already confident it will rebound fully, and the committee has my full commitment to assisting with this in whatever way I can.</p> <p>  I also believe that working together with the team in Shannon, the board and stakeholders across the region, we can build back stronger.  All of the ingredients are there for this to happen.  The group is uniquely placed to act as a catalyst for future economic growth through its mix of business activities.  It has a successful property portfolio, a strong investment strategy and the airport is recovering well from one of the worst catastrophes in the history of global aviation.  There is a strong management team at Shannon Group with a good business plan in place.  One only has to look at last week&rsquo;s announcement by Ryanair of a &euro;10 million investment, creating 200 jobs at the airport, as a clear vote of confidence in the group&rsquo;s CEO, Mary Considine, and her team, from our largest airline.  The group has made huge strides in its ambition to build back air traffic.  The immediate focus at Shannon has concentrated on restoring passenger traffic and I am pleased to see the airport already recovering, with 26 services to 11 countries on offer this summer.</p> <p>  Prior to the outbreak of the pandemic, 1.7 million passengers travelled through Shannon Airport per year.  It is important to remember that in early 2020, Shannon Airport was set for a year of growth, with new routes and having secured locally-based aircraft.  Since its establishment, the Shannon Group has invested &euro;146 million, demonstrating its commitment to stimulating regional growth.  As part of this, it has regenerated the Shannon free zone on its campus, stimulating foreign direct investment and indigenous investment and jobs for young people around the region.  Recovery is not a given, however, and it will only happen through the concerted efforts of all stakeholders pulling in the same direction.</p> <p>  In my role as chair, but also as a citizen, I remain deeply concerned at the widening gap between Dublin and our other four airports.  In Ireland, the east coast airport captures 87% of all travellers, while the four other airports in the west compete for the remaining 13%.  This undermines balanced regional development and will destroy competitiveness unless a way is found to create a more coherent airport offering.  Government support to date for Shannon has been welcome and I thank the committee for its role in securing this.  In the medium term, however, to allow them to fulfil their potential, airports like Shannon need continued support.  I would advocate for the airport to remain in the regional airports programme and I ask the committee today to support this move.</p> <p>  I want to assure the committee that I have not sought the role of chair on a whim.  It is something which I have sought for some time.  I know there will be challenges ahead but I have dealt with many challenges in my time and I am looking forward to working with the team to bring whatever expertise I have and whatever support I can to bear to make the most of the opportunities that I know exist for Shannon Group.  My focus as chair will be on working with the CEO and board on the recovery of Shannon Airport in the aftermath of what has been one of the most challenging periods the global aviation industry has ever faced.</p><p>I am ambitious for the group.  While restoring pre-pandemic traffic levels will be crucial, that does not mean we stop there.  I will do everything in my power to support the group to fulfil its vision of reaching further to build a thriving, connected place.  In a wider context, I strongly believe that, with the right policy supports, it should be possible to grow Shannon and to provide the vital air connectivity into our airport that will deliver a balanced economy for our citizens.</p><p> Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it has not escaped my attention that Shannon has an unparalleled reputation for driving innovation.  As chair, I hope to ensure the group builds on that tradition.  As we decarbonise our economy, there is an opportunity to develop the Shannon Estuary into what might be called the Aberdeen of offshore wind.  That will require a clear, co-ordinated approach.  I will ensure Shannon Group plays a full and proactive role in realising this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the mid-west.  As chair, it will be my privilege to lead the board and to guide Shannon Group on its journey through recovery, rebuilding and growth.  I am committed to pursuing Shannon Group's mission of restoring airport traffic and to building on its strong property investment strategy, all of which will enhance the group's economic contribution to the mid-west and nationally.  I welcome the opportunity to work with the CEO and the board to ensure Shannon Group continues to deliver successfully through the years ahead.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.  I would be happy to take Members' questions.</p></speech>

I thank him for his opening statement.  I had the pleasure of meeting him in Shannon a couple of weeks ago.  His passion and his ambition for Shannon are very clear and he has set them out in his opening statement.</p> <p>  It is clearly evident that Shannon has not reached its potential.  One of the key reasons for that is national aviation policy.  Mr. Henry will be aware from his movements around the mid-west and the western seaboard, working with different organisations, that this is a glaring omission.  As he said in his opening statement, the importance of an airport as an economic driver in a region cannot be overstated.  As he says, Shannon Airport is the heartbeat of the mid-west.  One aspect of that is the inclusion of Shannon in the Regional Airports Forum, which I advocate strongly.  It was right that Shannon was included this year, but I want to see a stronger statement from the Government and the Minister.  I look forward to working with Mr. Henry, this committee and the Shannon Airport Oireachtas group to put a robust case to the Government for our inclusion in that stream going forward.  This is fully coherent with EU state aid rules because any airport with fewer than 3 million passengers should be incorporated into that fund, yet this year was the first in which Shannon Airport received funding.  We can see the impact of that funding in the X-ray scanners and the security apparatus.  It is cutting-edge stuff.  Shannon Airport was the first airport in Ireland and, dare I say, one of the first airports in Europe where passengers can just go through the airport.  Passengers in Dublin Airport, for example, have to go through two security checks to go to the US.  In Shannon, they have to go through just one.  It is fantastic.  It has got a lot of coverage recently.  I congratulate those involved on that.  I look forward to working with Mr. Henry closely on that.</p> <p>  Limerick Chamber completed the Copenhagen Economics report in conjunction with Ennis, Galway and Shannon chambers.  That is a very significant piece of work.  It was completed in late 2019, in a pre-pandemic era, but highlights that Shannon Airport was not reaching its potential then, with 1.7 million passengers and only 36% of the capacity of the airport being used.  We can do far better but we need the support of the national aviation policy to kick in behind us.  I think that is recognised in other countries such as the Netherlands, Finland and Austria, which are referred to in the report.  We need to build on that and to place it as part of our robust engagement with the Government on the issue.</p> <p>  I compliment the Shannon Group on its property portfolio.  It has been a roaring success since the establishment of Shannon Group.  Ten years ago vast tracts of the Shannon Free Zone were derelict and unoccupied.  I think the zone was only 40% occupied.  There is now an occupancy rate of over 90% and nearly 100%.  There are very strong companies based there such as Jaguar Land Rover and MeiraGTx, and there is the expansion of Ei Electronics.  That is really significant.  Only the other day Ryanair took over hangar 5.  I encourage Shannon Group to continue to do the work it is doing in that regard.  I look forward to a major logistics company coming to the region, on the apron of the airport.  I will not mention its name.

I really appreciate the support.  He is absolutely correct that the services available in Shannon Airport now are state of the art.  I think members of the committee came to see the new scanning facility.  It is incredible.  The time it takes to pass through security in Shannon Airport versus the time it takes in the major airport in this State is chalk and cheese.  I think using Shannon Airport can remind travellers what using an airport can be like.  I passed through another airport this week and put out a tweet stating it felt more like an evacuation than a departure.  We were told to stand here and to go there.  It is a very unsatisfactory experience to be put through an airport in that way, and it is not like that in Shannon Airport.  It is very important we, as a group of stakeholders, remind potential consumers that Shannon Airport is a joy to use.</p> <p>  As for the Regional Airports Forum, I agree 100% that that level of financial support from the State is crucial in allowing us to invest in the likes of new scanning infrastructure, new air bridges and so on, and to continue to enhance the experience for our travellers.  That is crucial.  The Deputy is right that this year was the first year of Shannon Airport's inclusion in the forum, even though it is available to airports with passenger numbers under 3 million.  We really need that and we will work hard to try to convince the Government of that.  The committee's support in that regard is greatly appreciated, both in the past and going forward.</p> <p>  As for airport policy, I am very clear on the problem.  I have read the Copenhagen Economics report.  It is an excellent report.  It illustrates the problem with our airport structure in this State.  It is very lopsided.  There are four airports in the western and south-western half of the State and one on the eastern seaboard, and the latter takes 87% of all the State's traffic.  The region does not contain 80% of the State's population.  Today I came straight through Vienna International Airport, an airport of 25 million passengers.  It is a much more integrated airport.  We need to think about our airport policy in this State.  I appreciate that it brings up very local and very political issues, but for the sake of what the State looks like to the outside world, we really need to address the issue of the imbalance in airport traffic.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy Carey for mentioning the property portfolio.  As is always the case with property portfolios, occupancy is important, but all the occupants of Shannon Commercial Properties sites are job creators and they generate and create economic value in the mid-west.  In my previous life running a company called Enet, we could see the use of the Shannon Free Zone really take off.  It is a very important engine for economic growth in the mid-west.</p></speech>

I thank him for hosting us at the airport recently.  It was appreciated.</p> <p>  I have one eye on the screen because I am due to speak in the D&aacute;il Chamber in seven minutes, so I will get straight into my questions.  People in Clare and the wider mid-west are excited by Mr. Henry's appointment.  They see it as giving new life and new hope to the airport yet again.  However, there is a lingering question over Mr. P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's resignation.  How will Mr. Henry's tenure be different from his?  Is Mr. Henry there to stay and does he feel that the current managerial configuration allows him a meaningful function in the airport's running?</p></speech>

I am here to represent myself, the management and the board.  As far as I am concerned, there is an excellent management team in the airport.  I have come down and spent the past eight weeks working with the team.  I have seen my fair share of management teams in my time and this is a good one.  I feel confident about that and that the team can deliver for the organisation, with the right level of support from the board.  I will work with the board to ensure that happens.</p> <p>  I am here to stay.  I did 12 years at Enet and two full terms with the harbour company.  I am not a guy who passes through.</p></speech>

If a body is only doing its business at board meetings, it is not doing its business.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.1150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022052500002#L00900"><p>That answers the question I was going to ask next.  If the chair of a board is solely a chair, he or she arrives at board meetings, has knowledge of what happens but does not know the day-to-day workings.  I would use the analogy of a school in this regard, with the principal running the school and the chairperson of its board rubber-stamping decisions.  I believe Mr. Henry understands that the airport needs more than that.  The fact that he has daily contact is reassuring, as that is what is required.  Since the time of Mr. Brendan O'Regan, there has been a vision of where Shannon needs to go.  Those who have led the airport down the years have not been managing it in the here and now.  Instead, they have been thinking five to ten years ahead and positioning the airport for that.</p> <p>  I wish to ask two questions about the airport's positioning.  We are on the cusp of preparing a new national aviation policy.  The current one is defunct and bears no relevance as we exit Covid.  What are Mr. Henry's thoughts on what needs to happen to rebalance aviation and give a larger share back to Shannon?  I spoke to Mr. Henry about another matter when we met him at the airport.  Shannon has a considerable role to play in sustainable aviation, which is where the sector will go over the next six to seven years.  What role has Shannon to play in this?</p></speech>

A balance needs to be struck.  It is management that manages the business.  If someone becomes an executive chair, it can sometimes confuse matters.  I have been both a CEO and a chair previously and I believe I have a good understanding of how that balance is struck.  It is not my intention to tell management how to run the business - it is doing a good job already.  My intention is to support and evaluate the plan, ensure everything is on track and report back to the stakeholders and shareholder.  It is management's job to manage the business and I am confident that it is doing a good job.</p> <p>  Regarding national aviation policy, I am clear on what the problem is but I am not as clear on what the solution is.  The problem is the imbalance.  It is a very severe problem.  There are two elements to it.  First, there is only one airport on the east coast.  Second, there are five airports on the west coast, with four effectively competing for the same business.</p></speech>

Each of those four airports is undermining the competitiveness of the western airport offering, and reducing its ability to compete with the eastern airport offering.  Even though there are four airports in the west, there is a significant leakage of people from the west to the east because there is not enough route density at any of those airports.  People almost forget that they can fly from them.  The routes and frequencies they need are not there.  This is a significant problem, one that requires an understanding of how airports function and how people use them.  It will require tough political thought processes.  I am not sure-----</p></speech>

Ticket prices are important, but addressing those alone will not get people to fly out of Shannon.  We need to improve connectivity.  We have dithered around for a long time waiting to see whether coach operators will apply for licences to travel to and from Shannon Airport and make drop-offs there.  Mr. Henry is helmsman of the board.  Will Shannon Group take this situation by the neck and apply to the National Transport Authority, NTA, to run a service?  The group could contract it out to whomever, but such a service would ensure that there are drop-offs at the departure hall of Shannon Airport and that its passenger catchment area is the whole west coast and the midlands.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Henry give an interim commitment to the Shannon Heritage staff and those who depend on tourism in the region?  A process is under way and four Departments are convening to consider the transfer, fund it and do it right, but Shannon Group cannot take its eye off the issue.  It has managed these sites for a long time.  Ms Mary Considine has been CEO since before Mr. Henry entered his role.  There is a feeling among staff and people with a gr&aacute; for these sites that the Shannon Group has taken its eye off the issue.  It is like a divorce, in that the ship has sailed and is no longer on the group's priority list.  Will Mr. Henry give an interim commitment?</p></speech>

Shannon Heritage is effectively an exiting issue for me as incoming chair, so it is not high on my list of priorities.  However, we are committed to good governance and good practice and, as a management team and board, we will ensure that everyone involved in Shannon Heritage is dealt with in a fair and appropriate manner.  There is nothing within how management is dealing with the Shannon Heritage transfer that suggests to me that it is being done other than in the right way.  If there is, though, I will deal with it.</p> <p>  Regarding the NTA, I will not give the committee specific commitments because we are working hard on how to maximise bus connectivity.  I agree with the Deputy's analysis, in that we need to deepen bus connectivity to the airport.  Management is working on that and there will be developments, but I do not want to get hung up on committing to individual actions that may not be the right ones.</p></speech>

It does not make sense from a State perspective that we have an airport with a capacity of between 4.5 million and 7 million - Mr. Henry might clarify that - but that was only seeing 1.5 million before the pandemic.</p><p>Considerable capacity is built, ready and deliverable.  National aviation policy can do a certain amount.  I would love to see Shannon Airport at 5 million passengers and not in need of any State subsidy.  I would love for it not to qualify for a subsidy because it is processing that many passengers.  However, we are not there now.  It makes sense that the smaller airports qualify for subsidies and the threshold should be raised so Shannon qualifies.  However, the market cannot be rigged to force people into flying from Shannon because I do not think that logic works in the long term.  That said, Shannon has an awful lot going for it.  Travelling through the airport is a pleasurable experience.  It is straightforward to get from the car park into, and through, the terminal.  The security machines that we saw are amazing because passengers do not have to remove their liquids, laptop, cables and all the rest of it from their bag, as we are used to doing now.  Deputy Carey made the point that if someone is travelling across the Atlantic from Dublin, he or she has to pass the ordinary security gates and then pass through security again for the pre-clearance.  All of that is included in the first round of security checks in Shannon.  The shoes are the main difference between one check and the other.</p><p> Shannon has a lot going for it and I am not sure that message is sufficiently understood.  I am not having a go at Mr. Henry when I say that, nor am I having a go at Shannon.  This is an opportunity for me to say that anybody living in the midlands should be thinking about travelling from Shannon Airport long before they think about travelling from Dublin Airport.  Anybody within 50, 100 or 150 miles of Shannon should consider that even though the distance to that airport may be a tiny bit longer, the journey will be completed much more quickly.  People travelling will get to the car park quicker and will get through the airport quicker.  Their travelling experience will be much more pleasurable.</p><p> I once went through London Southend Airport, a smaller airport, and was off the plane and on the train in approximately 12 minutes.  They did not even check passports because they did not have to do so under the common travel area arrangements.  Because the airport had no other international passengers, its staff were able to waive the requirement to check passports.</p><p> I support an examination of national aviation policy.  Mr. Henry has skills and knowledge.  He is originally from Belfast, lives in Dublin and worked in Limerick.  That gives him an all-island experience and understanding of the various demographics involved.  He has worked with, and understands, Ryanair, which operates 22 of the 26 scheduled routes out of Shannon.  There are three Aer Lingus routes, one United Airlines route and 22 Ryanair routes.  I am sure Mr. Henry is still on good terms with Ryanair and that connection is helpful.</p><p> I note he is in daily contact with management at the moment and a chairman probably should not be in daily contact over the course of a five-year term.  I know he and the management team are on a learning curve.  He might touch on how much time he spends, and how much time he envisages spending, doing the job.  I am aware he also has other things on his plate and the fee for this job is not exactly a full-time salary.  </p><p> Mr. Henry has his work cut out, as has Shannon Group, in letting the world, Ireland and the travelling public know how good the airport is.  I was not aware how good it is until I got there.  I have a great interest in aviation and if I am not that familiar with how good Shannon is, I am sure the rest of the travelling public is not familiar with it either.  I presume Shannon is more competitive in respect of landing charges.  It is certainly more competitive on car parking.  It does not have the density of population in the catchment; that much is obvious.  It does not make any sense from a climate change perspective that people should travel from Dublin to Shannon to get on a plane to fly back towards Berlin or the Continent generally.  However, there is a positive message to sell about the travelling passengers.  It is also all about, dare I say it, bums on seats.  It is about volume.  The fixed costs are there.  The airport needs a volume of passengers.  </p><p> I am giving a speech rather than asking questions.  I would like to hear how Mr. Henry intends to get out the message.  Ryanair, for whom he worked, has the best publicity machine ever invented and I do not mean that only with regard to Michael O'Leary as a personality.  Ryanair is very good at getting the word out.  How does Mr. Henry see his role in that regard?  How does he see Shannon being able to tell the world and the Irish public how good it is for travelling out of the country?  How can Shannon be marketed as a place where Americans want to land because they want to do the Wild Atlantic Way and go to Connemara, the Burren, Kerry and Limerick?  All those places are right beside Shannon.  There is no point in flying to Dublin and travelling to the Burren, Limerick or Connemara when Shannon Airport is on the doorstep.  Mr. Henry might touch on what skills he can bring to help the management team to sell Shannon.</p></speech>

I have also acted as a non-executive chairman in a number of different industries and sectors.  I think I have a clear sense of this.  For me, the most successful relationship between a chair and a management team is one where there is a written plan that is agreed upon by all involved.  The process is then for the chair and the CEO to consider how they are doing with respect to the plan.  If things change, they must consider what that means for the plan and they must consider whether anything needs to be changed.  It is a matter of touches to the tiller.  As a chairman, one does not go in and do stuff.  One lets the management do the stuff and just checks all the time that stuff is getting done that is in line with the plan and that things are as they should be.<br/><br/>There might be some music fans among the committee members.

No alarms and no surprises is an important requirement between a CEO and management.  I do not want to encounter something we did not expect to happen.  There will be bad news.  Things will start to develop, for better or worse, and we must manage them.  I have selected and worked with management teams across a number of industries in the past.  I am very impressed with what I see in Shannon and I do not mean that lightly; I really am.  It is a very strong team.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about the marketing of the airport.  We are conducting a review of our marketing activity and will always review it.  I think we can do better but to be honest with him, policy is the issue here.  The issue is route density.  The airport is not used because there are not enough routes into it because all routes go to Dublin.  We put a second runway into Dublin Airport when we should have thought about alternatives.  A number of members of the committee will know I am a broadband guy.  I said for a very long time that policy can make a difference with regard to broadband.  Big policy changes can be delivered in that area, and we can discuss that on a different day.  There is a way to do things through policy that can make a big difference.  We need to think long about that.  National aviation policy should not be rushed out.  We should have an honest conversation about how we want our airport infrastructure to look in the long run.</p></speech>

Despite his very modest assertion that he is not an aviation expert, he brings a wealth of experience to the position and has demonstrated that today in his presentation.</p> <p>  We all come with competing interests in terms of Cork, Dublin and Shannon, but we should operate in the realm of policy change, as Mr. Henry said.  He spoke about the issue of route patterns changing.  How can we build route density?  Part of the difficulty with airlines is that they vote by passenger loads and incentivisation to use an airport.  Ultimately, because Dublin Airport is a hub destination and meeting point for the north, south, east and west, it is a place for people outside of the State to connect.  It is a connectivity airport as well.  How can capacity be built in the context of route density and route patterns changing?  It is not just about Government aviation policy.  It is about the policy of airlines.  We have seen, in a post-pandemic context, Aer Lingus's policy towards short-haul connectivity.  It has literally abandoned, to a great extent, its short-haul operations in Europe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.1187" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conal Henry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022052500002#N00500"><p>On that last specific point, it is not something I would like to comment on.  Airlines in Europe are almost entirely privately owned enterprises.  They make decisions based on what they think will maximise their shareholder value in the short and long term.  Aircraft, by definition, are moveable assets and are very easily moved.  An airport is never at a point that it can fix it because it is always under threat of the removal of that capacity.  As a result, we always have to stay on it.</p> <p>  Routes beget other routes, and the Senator said that in terms of Dublin Airport being a hub.  The more routes there are in an airport, the more likely it is to get other routes.  Each of the four western airports does not have enough routes to do that.  There are European hub routes coming into Cork and US routes coming into Shannon.  There are routes into London from Knock and routes into Germany from Kerry.  Those four airports are watching and trying to steal business off each other, meanwhile most of the traffic is going to the east coast.  There are enough passengers and demand for travel in the western half of Ireland to create a fairly significant aviation proposition.  How do we do that?  We will probably have to rethink the whole lot.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.1188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1637" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022052500002#N00600"><p>I agree.  That is why, arising from our meeting in Shannon and, hopefully, from our meeting in Cork, we will see the importance of the points Mr. Henry made in his presentation and how advocating that all airports outside of Dublin remain in the regional airports programme is essential.  The Shannon stopover was removed.  The whole aviation policy has changed.  IATA will tell us that there is pent-up demand.  Mr. Henry is right in that it makes no sense - I am wearing my Cork hat for a second - for people from Portlaoise or Thurles who are travelling out of Ireland to go east.  They should come to Cork or, in some cases, go west.  As a committee, we need to sit down with the Government and the airports to rethink and re-imagine aviation policy.  There are major issues in Dublin Airport as we have seen.  We need to return to this and invite the DAA to come back before us.  I commend Mr. Henry on his proactivity in respect of that matter.  We supported him in that regard during the private meeting in the context of the whole strategy.</p> <p>  I will conclude by wishing Mr. Henry well.  The day we were in Shannon, he demonstrated great ability.  Today, he has done the same.  I look forward to the transport committee having a strong influence, with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, on aviation policy in the coming months</p></speech>

We might have to take disciplinary proceedings afterwards, but not at the moment.</p> <p>  Mr. Henry has stated that he is listening.  We all get an understanding of the problem in that everyone would like to see a more distributed, dissipated - whatever term one wishes to use - a more logical, regional infrastructure as regards transport in general and, specifically, airlines.  In speaking to DAA or anyone else on this, as was mentioned earlier, Dublin Airport is a hub.  We are not competing with Shannon.  The issue is that we are competing with Vienna, London, Paris and elsewhere.  That is where the slots will go, and maybe that is easy from them to say.  I am wondering how one bridges that gap where we can have this conversation.  We can go round and round the gardens on this, which happens quite often.  We can all do that from the point of view that it will sound okay, particularly to a local audience, but that it will never actually happen.  How does one make it happen?</p></speech>

Coincidently, I came here today from Dublin Airport having flown from Vienna.  I literally used both products today.  In terms of passenger numbers, Vienna International Airport can handle 25 million and Dublin Airport can handle 33 million.  They are quite comparable.  The difference in product is immense.  One of the reasons for that is because Bratislava Airport is 25 minutes from Vienna and acts as its competitor so they have to keep their noses clean.  The likes of Ryanair can quite happily move that capacity out of Vienna and into Bratislava.  They are competed with on a local level as well, as are most of those other airports.  There is intranational and international competition for airports.  Dublin Airport is competing in an international environment, but it is not competing intranationally.</p></speech>

People have said that there may be logic in the context of certain routes as regards Shannon, but half the services that operate out of Dublin cannot suddenly move to the west coast.  It would not make sense to do that.</p><p>I know Mr. Henry is not necessarily proposing that but what is doable?</p></speech>

If the airport charges in Shannon are too high, the customers will go to Cork but if the airport charges in Dublin are too high, they are still going to go to Dublin.  Dublin's record is 33 million passengers, which is a serious number for a country of our size.  That is a hell of an achievement but the product is challenged.  The airport is at or ahead of capacity.  That same flight I talked about was actually stacked and that was a first for me.  Flights used to be stacked over Heathrow but my flight was actually stacked, flying up and down the coast.  From an emissions point of view, it is not good when aircraft are waiting to land.  That has never happened to me before.</p></speech>

We were just flying up and down between Howth and D&uacute;n Laoghaire.</p> <p>  As I said earlier, policy bravery pays off.  We did that with broadband and it will pay off.

At the end of the day, it is a courtesy call really.  That said, the engagement this afternoon has been really interesting.</p> <p>  My impression of Shannon Airport, the cohesiveness and dedication of the staff and the desire of the people we met on the ground down there to make this airport work and to challenge the 87% who are travelling east was remarkable.  My experience of Shannon will live with me for a long time.  I would happily sit into my car in July and drive to Shannon and fly from there to a holiday resort rather than face the bedlam I am going to have to face at Dublin Airport.  It is a remarkable resource.  I see Senator Buttimer looking at me and I am sure Cork Airport will prove to be equally as remarkable when we visit it.</p></speech>

When I opened it, a piece of marketing material about Shannon fell out.  It gave me a little bit of confidence that somebody somewhere is doing something to try to drive the airport.  I do not understand why there is not a bus route from the major population centres straight to Shannon Airport four or five times a day, even if it is loss making for the time being.  At the end of the day, the old adage applies that if you build it, they will come.  As far as I am concerned, a bus service would actually pay off.  It would make the airport really viable.  I have relations who fly over and back to Portugal and Spain.  They have moved from Dublin to Shannon in recent times purely because of the ease of getting out of the airport.  It is only a short hop down from Galway for them.</p><p>Mr. Henry has the team in place and he has the infrastructure within the airport itself.  What he is lacking is policy and connectivity.  Those are the two big issues right now.  The Government must take a serious look at its transport policy.  In the context of a greener, cleaner environment and reducing our carbon footprint it makes absolutely no sense to drive from the west to Dublin to fly out of the country.  </p><p>I put up some social media posts after I visited Shannon complimenting the airport on my experience.  The response was remarkable.  I used all of the main social media platforms and a number of people were thankful that I was talking about the positives in Shannon.  However, a certain number came back and called me a dozy so-and-so, asked why I did not see that one cannot get into the airport and pointed out that there are no buses or trains to Shannon.  Not only that, they pointed out that the routes are limited and are only on certain days of the week.  </p><p>If Mr. Henry is to be successful and if we are to measure his success at the end of his time, he must be provided with the mechanisms to drive success for the airport.  That requires a serious shift in policy.  Having appraised the situation, how close is Mr. Henry to coming up with policy shifts that he would like to see?</p></speech>

This is not something we can magic out of fresh air.  Frankly, it is not something I would do on my own.  What I am doing is asking questions of myself and other stakeholders to see if we can have a dialogue on the art of the possible.  The Senator mentioned the connectivity to Shannon, and the issue of route density is key.  If there are not enough routes to feed the buses, there will not be any buses and if the buses do not come, there will not be enough routes.  We have to break that cycle.  That will happen but it is not trivial.</p> <p>  The Senator spoke about the great service that Shannon provides and said he has friends and family using it now.  I urge all committee members to tell their friends.  This is a small country and we can get the word out just by reminding people or urging them to use the airport once.  Once they start using the airport, people tend to reuse it.  Lots of frequent and regular travellers use it.  </p></speech>

We are making good progress in that.  We need to reinvigorate the marketing of the airport and work is ongoing on that.  We need to look at road and bus connectivity into the airport.  Those are some short-term objectives.  In the longer term we need to work with all the stakeholders to come up with an aviation policy that makes sense.  I hope there will be one at the end of my five years.  It is one of those things where people plant trees they will never sit under.  The restructuring and this aviation policy will probably be a decade-long process.  I would like to think that is something we can start.  The Senator and I know each other from the broadband arena where we did it again.</p> <p>  We have not spoken about this.  While have spoken about the threat to Shannon, there is a massive opportunity for Shannon in two areas.  We have talked about the Shannon Estuary becoming the Aberdeen of offshore wind energy.  That will require a co-ordinated approach from all the stakeholders.  There is a real opportunity to do something very special there.  A number of people are working on it and I can get quite excited about it.</p> <p>  There is also the change in aviation technology and the aviation usage patterns related to decarbonisation.  Future Mobility Campus Ireland is located in Shannon.  Shannon's heritage of being involved at the cutting edge is almost second to none.  It has been at the cutting edge of every major aviation development since the advent of the aviation industry.  As we move to non-jet transport, drone-based electricity stuff, hydrogen fuels and all these sorts of things, we need to ensure Shannon is at the centre of all that.  It has great relationships with all the airlines, all the aircraft manufacturers and many of the leasing companies and, therefore, there is a way we can position ourselves to do that.  I would be really excited and hope that by the end of my term that will be-----</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Henry for that.  I believe he has answered it correctly.  Far too many people who have appeared before this committee in the past have talked about Shannon Group.  Shannon Group has been used as a methodology of hiding the failure of the entire entity to increase passenger traffic.  The whole thing is about aviation, but when Shannon Development was subsumed into the broader group, it was then started to be presented to us as a business and it was about profit and loss.</p> <p>  The Shannon Group did very well because it was created at a time there was a demand for property.  The property assets were put in under the umbrella of the airport and it took off.  They were given to the group for nothing, revalued, borrowed against and new buildings were built, which was all brilliant.  There is no issue with property development in the mid-west.  Any property developers given the Shannon Development asset would have made a success out of it.  Well done to the people in the group who did it, but the difficulty was it masked the considerable decline of aviation traffic at a time passenger numbers through the country were growing exponentially and Shannon did not even get its fair slice of it.  That is not to take away from the wonderful management in place.  In my view it was a failure of strategic direction by the then board.</p> <p>  I am heartened that everything Mr. Henry has said here focuses on aviation and not the ancillary stuff.  That is brilliant; that is really important.  However, people do not need to come in here to get a slap on the back for something that is going well.  It is about the challenge because aviation matters to the region.  It matters to the small businesses in Kilrush, Kilkee, Mountshannon, Scariff and elsewhere.  It matters for the small hospitality business that depends on three French tourists turning up today and four Americans tomorrow.  It is about the coffee shop in Labasheeda, the glamping facility there and others.  They depend on people passing.</p> <p>  Jaguar Land Rover is brilliant and creates great employment.  However, Shannon exists to support passengers coming through the airport, people going on holidays and people coming here.  If Mr. Henry sticks to that mantra, does not get lost in the profit and loss of the group, and challenges it every time it is presented to him that it is just about profit and loss, then he will have achieved success.</p> <p>  I compliment Mary Considine and her team.  They went through a lot during the pandemic.  She has done an amazing job.  Mr. Henry has an amazing person beside him there.  She has managed to handle it without strategic direction from a chairman for some time.  Hats off to the people working on the ground.  They are ready, willing and able if they get the strategic direction.  Mr. Henry's challenge will be to take the board in a direction that goes back to focus on key air connectivity.  His inbox will be filled with reports every day about which airport to go to.  I will not get into that.  He knows the key hubs in Europe that we need.</p> <p>  He needs to keep the focus on passengers through the airport, more airlines and more business for the region.  He should not get caught up on the profit and loss account.  I accept the company must be successful.  However, it has a significant property asset, which it got for nothing.  I know there are cross-compliance issues there.  He can come back with that as a policy request if that is what it is because that was put into a document at a later stage.  It could have been excluded and maybe it can be done now.  I wish Mr. Henry the best of luck and continued success.</p></speech>

I believe we have a very strong management team in place.  I am not committing to fix the passenger number issue in Shannon Airport.  That is an issue that is beyond my personal level of competence.  It will require everybody to work together to do that.  I am committing my best endeavours to do whatever I can personally.

If a policy decision must be taken to spin out the property aspect and allow it be privatised, that is fine.  Mr. Henry should not lose sight of this and he should not take the Kool-Aid that he may be presented with in certain quarters of society.  The only thing that matters to the people who vote for Deputies McNamara, Carey, Cathal Crowe, me and whoever else is a demand to see the airport achieve what it can achieve.  I know some people believe Shannon can go back to the halcyon days, but it cannot.  Mr. Henry needs to be honest with people and come out and have that discussion.  He needs to say what Shannon can and cannot be.  However, he should not present us with success because another company has decided to locate there.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will take credit for that.  Brian O'Connell up on the hill would take credit for it and what he does in a wonderful facility.  Mr. Henry must not fall into the property asset component.</p></speech>

The Senator knows me.  We built a privately funded business up North and we built that with a purpose, not just to generate profit.  It is a business of purpose.  I am in the business of building businesses of purpose.  The purpose of Shannon Group is to regenerate and be the heartbeat of the economic mid-west.  The most important part of that is to bring people into and out of the region.</p></speech>

Figures were presented to this committee and to the public about how great the group was doing.  It was just being presented as a block and an entity.  Of course, employment came to the region because Shannon Group built factories.  However, that was because IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland went after them.  That is where the credit goes in that regard.  We were getting a rehash of that about how great things were going.  Anyway, we will not go back there.  Let us be positive.  Let us learn from that mistake.  As was always the case, Mr. Henry will have a friend here in supporting the initiative.  I am motivated by the region that I have had the privilege to represent.</p><p>I am motivated by driving activity through the airport.  The rest of the business is self-sustaining, based on the way it was constructed from the start.  What has deteriorated, sadly, is a focus on driving more business through the airport.  It is not easy, to be honest, if passenger numbers drop.  There was some good work done.  Reaching out to Norwegian Air did not happen.  Other things have fallen through the cracks and that needs to be addressed.  Mr. Henry need to get his head around that and understand.  Mary Considine and others will know what is needed.  We will not be found wanting as a group of Oireachtas Members.  Through Deputy Carey we have ongoing engagement with management and the board and we will continue that.  When Mr. Henry has figured out what he wants, he should come calling.  We will not be afraid to challenge our party leaders, Ministers and so on.  Until we know what he wants in order to assist in the growth of that connectivity, less is more.  We do not want to overplay the profit and loss piece.</p></speech>

I will go to Deputy McNamara in a moment.  It is a five-year term, which I welcome.  The role of a board is to make strategic decisions about the way the group evolves, which are then implemented by management.  Management does a very good job on that.  We have to be honest here.  There would be a perception that over the last number of years, pre pandemic, the property side of the Shannon Group had become the main focus, as distinct from aviation.  That is just the perception and we have to be honest about that.  The group was there to ensure the airport could function as an independent body.  That is the missing ingredient.  Mr. Henry spoke about being a driver of the region and the group.  The airport is a significant key driver for the entire western region.  I have a few quick questions.  Everyone is coming to the consensus that an urgent review needs to be commenced on the national aviation strategy, not only for Shannon Airport but for the likes of Cork Airport and other airports.  As incoming chair of the Shannon Group, I ask Mr. Henry to go through what he believes are the short, medium and long-term challenges facing the airport.  What policy initiatives does he see the board taking with regard to linking with Galway, Limerick and even Cork over that period?  What are the challenges and opportunities for the airport to grow?  From a strategic viewpoint there would have been a view that the group was very successful on property.  Mr. Henry said it himself.  Over the last number of years Dublin Airport increased its share of the market by 12% to 13% while Shannon and Cork's fell back by the same amount.  Those are the facts.  I ask Mr. Henry for an overview on that.</p></speech>

We will see what the route configurations are.  The recent announcement of an investment in Hangar 5 by Ryanair is a huge endorsement of how the industry feels about the airport as a service.  On the perception issue, maybe the need for change is around how we have made people perceive us rather than what we have been doing.  Senator Dooley knows I am a good man for creating perceptions.  We will drive towards all the issues we need to address that we can control.  There is nothing the management team is not working on in terms of the stuff the committee has identified.

There are two Amsterdam routes out of Cork and there is no US route out of Cork.  Cork is looking at Shannon and wishing for US connectivity while Shannon is looking at Cork wishing for European connectivity.  Meanwhile, there is little competition provided through the other airports.  I am sue that upsets people and creates poltiical problems but that encapsulates the issue.  The four airports on the western seaboard are all competing with each other and that removes the competition for the airport on the eastern seaboard.</p> <p>  Specifically on putting a European hub into Shannon, we are working hard on that but these decisions are made in a fairly unpredictable manner within airlines.  The committee will have heard from my opening statement that I was involved with this a million years ago when I worked in Ryanair so I have some insight into the matter.  With the way those decisions are made, we can do our best but even our best might not be good enough.  The decisions are made with regard to a bunch of other factors that are outside our control.  What we have to do is go in, deeply understand what each of the airlines is looking for, deeply understand how we can provide for those airline requirements and be in constant contact with the airlines.  As I understand our route development work, that is exactly what is going on.</p></speech>

We need to do with railways what we did with motorways during the Celtic tiger period.  We need to throw the big shot and build a national fast-rail infrastructure across all 32 counties.  We also need to pick up Limerick.  Limerick and Shannon in particular are underserved by our railway network.  I have spent 12 years coming down to Limerick from Dublin.  I hope to never have to go through Limerick Junction again.  It just does not really work, particularly if you are coming from Dublin because it is the early morning.  Railways are one of those things that need to be done in the round and as a big policy.  I know there is a national rail review.  I strongly recommend that, regardless of what comes out of it, Shannon and Limerick should be at the centre of that network.  I believe they would be.  Those of us who have travelled all around Europe will know that there are wonderful rail links in Italy.  Everyone thinks of Italy as a slightly dysfunctional economy but you can go from Venice to Rome in a day.  It is something we need to do in Ireland.  That would be central to rebalancing passenger movement in airports.</p></speech>

One of the jobs of the board is to regularly check in to ensure the work needed to do that is still going on.  Even when you have won it, you have to work just as hard to keep it because these are mobile assets.  It is never-ending work.  It is probably not even in the plan to work hard to develop this because it is such a core part of the job that it goes without saying.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.1284" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022052500002#R01300"><p>What does Mr. Henry regard as the hinterland of Shannon?  What should a plan contain with regard to promoting Shannon within its hinterland?  You can sometimes forget what is in your own area.  I live near Holy Island.  It is a very beautiful place.  Senator Dooley also lives near it.  I do not know about him but I sometimes forget it is there.  You do not go out there or do not go back for a number of years but, when you do, you think it is a really nice place.  You can forget about something that you look at almost every day.  What is Shannon's hinterland and what needs to be done to create a greater awareness of Shannon in that hinterland?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.1285" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conal Henry" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022052500002#R01400"><p>I am not an aviation economist so any answer I give will be my own back-of-the-fag-packet view.  The hinterland today is probably Munster and a little bit of the Offaly side of Leinster.  It probably starts running out around Charleville to the south.  We could be better at attracting people from Galway.  I sometimes think Galway is too close to Dublin.  It should be anyone outside of the M50 south of the M5.  The whole southern half of the State should be using Shannon if we could get the connectivity right.  Perhaps that is a pipe dream but we do not seek to achieve it just because it would be great craic to make Shannon a better airport but because it would deliver a better aviation and tourism policy for the State and the 32 counties of Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-05-25a.1286" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022052500002#R01500"><p>I am very encouraged by that and particularly by Mr. Henry's mention of Galway because Galway is one of those destinations for people who want to go somewhere for a weekend and who do not want to spend three hours on a bus or a train.  Shannon is more or less an hour away from Galway.  This allows for synergies between the two.  Obviously, Limerick is a weekend destination too but it perhaps marketed more as a destination for sporting occasions such as rugby weekends and other sports events.</p> <p>  On the mobility of assets Mr. Henry discussed - he may not have the answer to this question and, if he does not, that is fine - there was a difference in aviation policy between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the pandemic.  This resulted in a lot of Ryanair flights starting from Belfast.  I appreciate that Mr. Henry may not know the answer but does he know whether Belfast has managed to retain much of that business?</p></speech>

I do not think I have every flown out of Belfast with Ryanair although I am a big user of Ryanair out of Dublin and Shannon, in case anybody is listening.  I do not know the answer but I could check.  I genuinely just do not know.</p></speech>

Manchester has its own difficulties.  The CEO at that airport fell on his sword as a result.  Other big airports in the UK are also having difficulties with security.  They are well documented in Dublin.  These issues and the lengths of queues present an opportunity for Shannon in the very short term.  I am intrigued by the extent to which Belfast has managed to hold on to any additional business that went its way during the pandemic.  Those are my questions.  I will not delay Mr. Henry any further.  I congratulate him again and wish him the very best of luck in his tenure at Shannon Airport and in the Shannon Group more broadly.  I am glad to hear that he views Shannon Airport as the key asset of the Shannon Group.</p></speech>

The passenger numbers at Shannon and Cork did not actually go down but went up over the period.  The numbers at Dublin went up exponentially, however.  Mr. Henry has a background in aviation.  It is not a question of passenger numbers at Shannon not increasing because they did.  However, they did not increase exponentially.  I believe it is the same case for Cork Airport.  I am working from memory but I believe I am not too far wrong.  Despite this, the numbers at Dublin increased exponentially.  Why is that?</p></speech>

I did work in aviation but that was 20 years ago.  What we are seeing is something I call route density.  When IAG acquired Aer Lingus, it started trying to reroute traffic away from Heathrow and into Dublin.  That has driven a lot of passengers there.  That is doable at Shannon.  There is no reason it could not be done at Shannon if you had the right level of route density.  If a passenger booking a flight from Newcastle or Bristol to JFK, who would currently go through Dublin, went through Shannon-----</p></speech>

Will it require, as has happened in Holland, some method of looking at a more strategic distribution of passengers across the island?

I am delighted and wish Mr. Henry well.  He has engaged and has covered quite an amount in this meeting.  I suggest that we have a further engagement six or 12 months into Mr. Henry's term in office.  The committee met in Shannon with Deputy Carey and others last week.  I believe a progress report to the committee would be worthwhile.  I presume Mr. Henry would be willing to provide one.</p></speech>
