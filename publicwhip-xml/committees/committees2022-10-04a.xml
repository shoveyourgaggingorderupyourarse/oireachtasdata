We have received apologies from Deputies &Oacute; Cathasaigh and Harkin.  Before we start business today, I would like to read some formal notices and the Covid-19 code of conduct.  All present in the committee room are requested to exercise personal responsible responsibility to protect ourselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  On privilege, I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the parliamentary precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.</p> <p>  For the information of the witnesses, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references they may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes from our previous meeting, the private meeting held on 14 July 2022.  These minutes were already approved at a virtual private meeting but I ask for their approval in public session.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p><p> There will be two sessions today.  The first is with representatives of the Teaching Council and the second will be the Teachers Union of Ireland, F&oacute;rsa and the Irish Primary Principals Network.  I propose that we have a short break between the sessions.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> I propose that the following arrangements apply.  We will first hear each opening statement and that will be followed by a question-and-answer session with members.  Witnesses are asked to ensure that their statement lasts only four or five minutes.  Each member will have four minutes.  Members may speak more than once and they will be called in accordance with the list of speaking slots, which was circulated previously.</p><p> The first item on our agenda are minutes.  Are the minutes for the private meeting held on 15 September and the public meeting held on 20 September agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Our second agenda item is consideration of autism policy.  Today, we will pay particular attention to education and related matters.  This session will conclude after one hour.</p><p> On behalf of the committee, I would like to extend a warm welcome to the representatives of the Teaching Council.  We are joined by Ms Phil Fox, acting director and Ms Br&iacute;d Murphy, acting head of initial teacher education and induction.  We are grateful to our witnesses for taking time out of their busy schedules to contribute to the public session of the joint committee on autism.</p><p> The education system at all levels is critical when it comes to enabling autistic children to reach their full potential.  The committee wishes to find out how autistic people are enabled to participate fully in primary, post-primary and third level education and how the transition between schools and further education and training is facilitated.</p><p> The committee is interested in learning how the education system interacts with other services, including health and employment support services.  We want to know if there is sufficient interagency co-operation.  An area of particular interest is how teachers are trained and supported in educating autistic people.</p><p> The Teaching Council is the regulatory body for the teaching profession and has 116,000 teachers on its register.  The committee would like to hear what policy initiatives are ongoing or are planned, including teacher training, to assist autistic pupils and students.  We look forward to hearing the views of the council on the issue of autism policy, particularly from the perspectives of teaching standards, initial teacher education, continuous professional development and anything else that may occur.</p><p> Before we hear from witnesses, I propose that we publish the opening statement from the Teaching Council on the committee's website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> I call on Ms Phil Fox, acting director for the Teaching Council to make her opening statement.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil Fox" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022100400002#C00200"><p>Dia bhur mbeatha ar maidin.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas as ucht an gcuireadh a thabhairt d&uacute;inn a bheith anseo don chruinni&uacute; seo.  I am the acting director of the Teaching Council and I am joined by my colleague, Ms Br&iacute;d Murphy, acting head of initial teacher education and induction.  I shall briefly summarise the details of our overall submission and we look forward to our discussion with the committee.</p> <p>  The Teaching Council is the statutory, professional standards body for teaching in Ireland.  We are responsible for promoting and regulating the profession of teaching as set out specifically by the Teaching Council Acts 2001 to 2015.  All of our activities relate to the practice and promotion of teaching as a profession.  This work spans a range of areas that we have summarised on page 1 of our written submission.  We currently maintain a register of approximately 116,000 teachers, which is the largest professional register in the country.</p> <p>  Our specific statutory role relates to teachers as professionals.  It is important to note that this does not involve any direct functions, funding or service provision within schools or educational establishments.  However, we have an interest from a policy and programmatic perspective on the contribution of teachers in the areas of concern to this committee.</p> <p>  Teachers and the practice of teaching have a massive influence on the social and personal formation and well-being of young people as valued and unique human beings in their own right and as valuable participants in our society and economy for the future.  This embraces inclusivity and respect for all educational needs for all of us care deeply about the education, progress and success of all learners.</p><p> The Teaching Council develops and sets the standards for programmes of initial teacher education, ITE, formerly known as teacher training.  Based on those standards, the council also has the statutory remit to review and accredit programmes of ITE provided by higher education institutions, HEIs.  Graduates of these programmes are eligible to register with the Teaching Council and to teach in recognised schools.  This is supported by a dedicated induction framework called Droichead, to support teachers as they start their careers and additionally by Cos&aacute;n, which is the framework for teachers&rsquo; continual learning and professional development throughout their career.  </p><p> The council holds the view that the best response to learners&rsquo; needs is one that is also informed and supported by teachers' ongoing professional learning.  This is particularly important in the area of inclusive practice.  As I mentioned a moment ago, there were almost 116,000 teachers on the register across primary, post-primary and further education.  Each year, there are up to 5,500 applicants for initial registration, who are now eligible to teach in schools.  The standards that are set for initial teacher education are called C&eacute;im: Standards for Initial Teacher Education.  This is the first step on the continuum of teacher education, with inclusive education as one of the seven core elements that underpin all aspects of programme design.  This is defined as any aspect of teachers&rsquo; learning that is aimed at improving their capacity to address and to respond to the diversity of learners&rsquo; needs and to enable their participation in learning.  The standards also seek to remove barriers to education through the accommodation and provision of appropriate structures and arrangements that are designed to enable each learner to achieve maximum benefit from their attendance at school.</p><p> Furthermore, the standards also identify that a truly inclusive approach to professional practice recognises that teachers encounter a diverse range of needs in the course of their teaching, regardless of setting.  This will include additional learning needs, autism, dyslexia and dyspraxia, for example.  It also includes learning needs that are associated with diverse linguistic, socioeconomic, cultural and ethnic backgrounds.  </p><p> In summary, the Teaching Council prioritises inclusive education among the key learning areas that teachers need to pursue throughout their careers.  We also provide research funding and offer a wide range of seminars, journals and literature to teachers with the latest insights on teaching and learning in this area.  The continuing success and evolution of the teaching profession is essential to the well-being of everyone in our society, with inclusivity, diversity and respect for all at the heart of that process.  The life and role of a teacher is a continuum whereby teachers contribute throughout their career to the learning experiences of our young people, from initial teacher education, to induction, to teachers&rsquo; ongoing learning.

What are their views on delivering a July programme for next year?</p></speech>

The July programme, or the summer provision programme, is a programme that in the main requires teachers to be registered.  In the past couple of years, the council has worked to enhance the supply of teachers available to students in receipt of summer provision or July provision.  I refer specifically to this year gone by and to the student teacher registration process that was brought in by statutory instrument last January.  This gave rise to more than 1,200 student teachers being made available to the system in order to provide summer provision to students who are in need of it.</p> <p>  Furthermore, during the time of Covid-19, to release some supply of teachers to those students, we initiated a measure in conjunction with the Department of Education to facilitate newly-qualified teachers who had completed their programmes but had not completed their registration to become involved and to be eligible to participate in the July provision and the summer schools programmes.  Therefore, students under that measure who had completed their vetting-----</p></speech>

How many teachers does Ms Fox think are needed to deliver July provision to everybody?</p></speech>

This is a key challenge for every teacher and for this committee.  While Ms Fox said 1,200, does she think 2,400 or 24,000 are  required?</p></speech>

She said it is the largest professional registration of all.  When we talk about teachers available for July provision, Ms Fox cannot give me any estimate between 2,400 and 24,000 out of 116,000.  She has given a figure of 1,200 who have been made available by the Teaching Council's changes to the entry level process.  It is difficult for this committee not to have anything in between.  If the Teaching Council does not know how many are needed, how will it make changes or facilitate teachers being made available?</p></speech>

Enrolment and allocations are available to the Department.  The Teaching Council's register relates to the number of registered teachers rather than the number of registered students.  A subset of that is the number of students who have additional needs.  We do not hold those data.</p></speech>

We are just trying to get a handle on who knows.  The Department knows the number of students.  The Teaching Council has access to all of the teachers.  Ms Fox tells me that there are 116,000 teachers and that the council is involved in regular dialogue with the Department about delivering this and assessing the numbers one way or the other.  I still do not know the number I am seeking.  I know how many teachers there are and how many student teachers became available.  I have no sense of the number of teachers that Ms Fox believes are necessary or how the Teaching Council will activate them.</p></speech>

We can all take that extra step towards proactivity.  This is a key challenge for children and teachers.  Everybody wants this to be delivered.  We can all do more than basically turning up.  We can be a bit more proactive.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1513" speakername="Pauline Tully" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022100400002#E02200"><p>I apologise for being late.  I read the Teaching Council's statements last night.  I wanted to query a couple of things.  The statement mentioned Droichead, which I am familiar with because I was a teacher before being elected.  Ms Fox mentioned newly qualified teachers employed in special settings in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>I have had engagement with several parents whose children are autistic, and who have been put into special classes only to find that the teacher is not qualified as a special education teacher.  What has happened is that the principal has told this newly qualified teacher that if they take the special class for a couple of years they will be guaranteed a permanent job in mainstream.  What happens is you have a young teacher in that position who is not qualified.  They will do their best, and the parents praise the young teacher who goes out of their way to try to learn what they need to learn to address the needs of the students.  However, it is not fair on the teacher who is put in that position because that is not their qualification.  It is not fair on the students because not only are they getting teachers who are not qualified to teach them, but they are only getting that teacher for maybe a year or two, and then they move on, and we know autistic children need routine and familiarity.  Has the Teaching Council come across this issue?  Can it address it in any way to ensure it does not happen?</p></speech>

All teachers once they are qualified and registered with the council are all qualified to the same foundational competencies.  On that note, I might come back to the initial teacher education programmes before I move into Droichead, if that is okay with the Deputy.  I think one precedes the other.  We have the role and remit to review and accredit all programmes of initial teacher education.  We are in our second cycle of accreditation at the moment and that process will span from 2021 to 2023, so we are amid that process.  What has happened since the first cycle of accreditation is we have engaged in consultation processes and commissioned research.  Two areas of note that came up during that research and that consultation process with stakeholders was that the areas where we needed to strengthen, or we believed we needed to strengthen, the provision at initial teacher education was in the area of inclusive education and working with parents.  The new standards, C&eacute;im, to which I referred in my opening statement, have inclusive education as one of the seven core elements which underpin all aspects of programme design.  Why I refer to that is that it underpins foundations, professional studies and school placements.  Under the newly configured programmes student teachers will spend either 24 or 30 weeks on school placement, depending on the model of provision.  Our standards, as set out, require that the student teachers would have at least two alternative placements in a variety of school situations and contexts, including special education.</p> <p>  The Droichead process is in place to support those teachers when they come out of that programme.  It is a daunting task for any newly qualified teacher, and like the Deputy I am also a teacher.  The provisions under the Droichead framework are to support newly qualified teachers, to give them access to experienced teachers and to the support services and national induction programme for teachers, to facilitate them meeting with one another in cluster meetings, to collaborate with each other and to have a professional learning activity of their choosing.  There is also a thread that threads through now.  Any student who started first year of teacher education in September 2022 will be on a programme that is measured against these new C&eacute;im standards where inclusive education is one of the seven elements underpinning every module they do and every part of the programme in which they are enrolled.</p> <p>  Part of that is Taisce, which is their learning portfolio, where they identify one of the areas they must work on is inclusive education.  That is now threaded through the continuum into Droichead where they bring that learning area with them as an area where they might look for support from more experienced teachers in their professional support team in the school, the national induction programme for teachers and from colleagues at their cluster meetings.</p></speech>

I know there is CPD but it is optional and many teachers do not show any interest in finding out more about inclusive education and addressing the needs of the students in their class, whether it is mainstream or special settings.  I know as a teacher that there were many teachers who had no interest in students who had additional needs and were only interested in the students who were easy to teach.  They did not even seem to be aware if a student had dyslexia or something like that.</p><p>Could it be made compulsory for all qualified teachers to undertake continuing professional development, CPD, in inclusive education?</p><p> A number of people with qualifications in autism studies provide assistance for students in a community setting where there are no school places and home tuition is required.  They get temporary registration from the Teaching Council.  Is it possible to broaden that so that people who are qualified in autism studies are recognised for what they do?  They are never going to be teaching in a mainstream setting so they do not need the additional qualifications necessary to do so.  They do, however, provide an important service in that they know how to relate to, and can help, even non-verbal students.  They can make them comfortable and form a way of communicating with such students.  It is frustrating because those qualified people get temporary registration but unless they take on a lot of extra study for something they are never going to use, they do not get permanent registration as a teacher.  Is that something that could be addressed?</p></speech>

I must refer to the provisions in the legislation that require us to hold and maintain the register of teachers.  In order to be registered with the Teaching Council, it is a requirement for a person to be a teacher.  The standards we have set and about which I spoke a moment ago apply to any teacher who wishes to register with the council.  As a professional standards body and regulator, it is our role to ensure those standards are maintained.</p></speech>

It has already been an informative meeting.  I will go back to the issue of July provision that Deputy Carroll MacNeill spoke about earlier.  Ms Fox mentioned the fact that there are 116,000 registered professionals, which is great to hear.  Would they all be capable of completing or teaching in a July provision programme?</p></speech>

Was that the amount of teachers, of that 116,000, who took part in this year's programme or was that the number of student placements?  I want to confirm that.</p></speech>

Those who are in third and fourth year now are eligible to apply under route 5 for student teacher registration.  That number was in addition to the established register that was already there.  It was an additional supply of teachers to try to assist the system in the difficulty it faced.  The point I was making about newly qualified teachers was that those teachers would not have received their awards in time to register for July provision.  To get ahead of that and assist with the issue that had arisen in previous years, we came to an arrangement whereby if those newly qualified teachers had commenced the registration process and, critically, had concluded their vetting process, we would facilitate them with an access route to participate in July provision, or summer provision as it was called on different occasions, as long as their registration was completed by October, at which stage they would be paid.  That released approximately another 3,500 teachers into the system.  I do not have the exact figure but it was approximately 3,500.  That was to assist with the difficulty in which parents, families and the system more broadly found themselves.</p></speech>

As Ms Fox will be aware from interacting with families, there was no July provision in major towns around this country.  Has she any idea of the number of teachers who took part in July provision?  Is that number available to her and will she share it with the committee?</p></speech>

I wish to raise one other issue.  I wish to put on the record that I am not a teacher.  This committee relates to autistic persons.  Ms Fox mentioned the ongoing Droichead induction.  How much of that is specific to autism?</p><p>Is there a module specific to autism?  Ms Fox also mentioned 24 or 30 weeks in special education.  How much of that is specific to autism?  Is that information available to us as well?  Ms Fox might comment on that.</p></speech>

The droichead framework is not modular; it is a mechanism to supply mentoring support to newly qualified teachers in whatever context they find themselves and whatever the area that is of challenge to them.  It might be working with parents or it might be working with children who have additional needs, including autism.  It is high-level and flexible for that reason and the newly qualified teachers themselves identify the area of concern to them and the area where they need support in their learning.  At primary level that is a minimum of 60 days and at post-primary level it is a minimum of 200 hours of engagement in the droichead framework.</p></speech>

The Chair has brought us around a number of special schools and one of the big issues was autistic person-specific training.  Ms Fox has said it is dependent on the training teacher coming back and asking for that.  Should there be autistic person-specific training, given the complexities many families and students have?  Is that something the Teaching Council will consider?  It seems to be a growing concern for parents and Deputy Tully also mentioned the concerns that parents face with students in special classes versus students going into mainstream education.  Is the Teaching Council looking at that?  I hate to go back to this again but the committee needs to know about autistic person-specific training.  Is that something the Teaching Council is considering, outside of the asks by its representatives and members?</p></speech>

It is not just something that we have been considering but it has been implemented in the core elements of the programmes for all teachers who will be qualified through the programmes provided by HEIs within the State, and those programmes are accredited by the Teaching Council.  I missed one of the Senator's questions.  Would he mind repeating it?</p></speech>

Ms Fox is saying there is a module that is autism-specific.  I ask Ms Fox to tell us about that again and what it involves.</p></speech>

In the new programmes which commenced last month - and the accreditation process is ongoing in that - inclusive education is one of the seven core elements that underpin all aspects of the approach and programme design.  Students will have inclusive education as one of the underpinning elements to each and every module and each and every aspect of their programme over the course of their four or two years, depending on the model of provision they choose.</p></speech>

Could the Teaching Council supply the committee with the number of teachers who took part in the July provision, be it home-based or school-based?  Ms Fox said the Teaching Council has those figures from the payroll and she mentioned that 1,200 students had taken part.

Senator Wall and I were just discussing this.  It appears from the witnesses' own figures that there are 119,000 people available to make a contribution towards summer provision.  Ms Fox spoke about the extra 3,500 and 116,000 so that is how I got that figure.  We hear constantly from parents that this cannot be provided.  It is a huge disconnect for us.  An OECD report came out this morning on education in Ireland.  It refers to extremely good outcomes and underinvestment but also to our teachers' salaries being some of the highest in the OECD.  I think they are the sixth highest in the OECD, which includes most of Europe plus the United States, Canada, Israel, Korea and so on.  It is a very broad group of countries.  We can ask the Department about this but we will not be able to get a sense of what people are doing privately through the Department because it is, of necessity, private so we will struggle with that.  Perhaps the teachers' unions might be able to provide us with better information on what number of teachers made themselves available for July provision in schools last year or the year before and what the need is.  On the face of it between those two things, it looks like there is a very large number of people available, who are paid comparatively very well, yet we do not have this service for our most vulnerable children.  That is our point of frustration, which I think is readily understood.</p></speech>

In recent times we have contacted and had communication with teachers on the register who may have been retired to encourage them to consider becoming involved in substitution where a need may arise at a local level.</p><p>In the future, we could look at communicating with the register to see if there are teachers who are available or interested in becoming involved in different programmes offered by the State to assist with the national effort on this.

How many teachers have specific training in the area of special education?  I am talking about teachers who are completely focused on the area.  Does Ms Fox have figures on that?</p></speech>

It is important to say that, once teachers are registered, they may add other qualifications to their registration.  It is a matter for teachers whether they wish to do so.  We can certainly provide data on any qualifications we have been informed of.</p></speech>

Some 80% of children in special schools, the most vulnerable children, did not get summer provision.  It will be said there is home-based provision but, unfortunately, some parents are not in a position to get a teacher to provide that home provision.  The children for whom the July provision, as it was then known, was set up are getting nothing for the entire summer.  That is not acceptable.  What is Ms Fox's view on that?  We have mentioned numbers and figures but the reality is there is not a sufficient number available to provide this.  There are towns in which there are multiple children with a need but where there is no provision taking place.  In the vast majority of our special schools, it is not taking place.  As I have said, it is not acceptable.  What is Ms Fox's view on people who work in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, system who have level 6, 7 or 8 qualifications but who do not have a Teaching Council number working in the summer provision system?  Could something be put in place to make them eligible to work in the summer provision programme?  My personal belief is it should be mandatory for all special schools in the country to provide the summer provision.  We need to look at a system like what Senator Wall mentioned, that is to say, where there are a number of schools in a town, they should be brought together to ensure there is availability for students in every single town.  What are Ms Fox's views on expanding the scope of eligibility to work in the summer provision programme, perhaps through providing a temporary Teaching Council number to people with a certain level of education?</p></speech>

I again refer back to my opening comments on the council's legislative remit and the provisions set out in both primary and secondary legislation - statutory instruments - on which the Houses of the Oireachtas have signed off.  We are required to ensure the standards are met.  I realise I am repeating what I said earlier.  Our role is to register teachers.  Matters of employment and deployment fall outside of the council's remit.  The council is very focused on its role, remit and responsibilities, which are quite extensive.  That is where the conversation and the work is focused.</p></speech>

What does the Teaching Council believe could be done to facilitate students in the July provision and in schools?  Ms Fox referred to the seven programmes, one of which is inclusive education.  Ms Fox stated that all 116,000 teachers can teach an autistic child with special needs.  Is that the case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.83" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil Fox" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022100400002#L00200"><p>Of the 116,000 teachers, some are registered under primary and post-primary and further education and once a teacher has met the standards for registration to enter the profession, his or her deployment and employment is outside the remit of the council.  The short answer to the Deputy's question is "Yes".  Once we are satisfied that teachers have met the standards, they can be deployed by their school management or their principal into the various settings according to the school need.  The council has no role in that provision.</p></speech>

I seek clarification that this is what Ms Fox is saying as the Teaching Council.</p></speech>

There are 116,000 on the register.  On how the numbers break down, I must say that some of those teachers are retired and they have kept their registration.  A number of those teachers may be abroad and have continued to maintain their registration with the council.  We are not clear on the number of those teachers because we do not hold their employment data.  This goes back to the same point again that we just told their qualifications, their vetting and other necessary data for them to be on the register of teachers.  Where they are employed and the decisions they make thereafter are not contained within our register or in our database.</p></speech>

The council seems to be only looking after the actual qualifications and that teachers are registered with those qualifications.  What I am getting back from Ms Fox is that thereafter, the council has no role in this regard, so we are going to have to go somewhere else for the details we need.  Perhaps Ms Fox can tell the committee what the Teaching Council would need to try to get more information or does she believe this is in the remit of the Teaching Council?  Is the council just happy to do what it actually does?</p></speech>

I am a member of the teacher supply steering group, a member of the teacher supply implementation group, and I chair the communications group.  We also have a nominee, the head of registration is on the teacher supply data group.  There is a lot of communication and collaboration regularly and frequently back and forth with the Department on the supply of teachers.  The information that we hold is in relation to teachers' registration.  To be clear, we do have other functions outside of registration but they are not in the arena of employment.  For example, we have the role to review and accredit the programmes, we have the fitness to teach and the maintaining of the register on professional standards.  There is also our research function.  There are many other functions where the council has quite an extensive and broad remit but not in the area of employment of teachers.</p></speech>

I just have a couple of questions.  I seek real clarity on the decision that the July provision must be done by qualified teachers.  Is this a demand of the parents of children with autism or is it a demand of the Teaching Council or the Department of Education?  That is my first question.</p> <p>  Can we increase training days for mainstream teachers in being autism-aware?  This would be for two reasons, the first being to help them with early diagnosis as there are still children who are slipping through the gaps.  On specific training for working with children with autism, I am not up to date with what the Teaching Council and the Department of Education have done to help teachers have better tools, based on the fact that we have seen a huge increase in the numbers of children with autism.</p></speech>

One thing I have not mentioned so far is the supports we make available to teachers under our remit to regulate and promote the profession.  One of those is our Collaboration Research for Ongoing Innovation, CRO&Iacute;, series.  Each and every teacher who is registered with the council has free access to the EBSCO library.  We have a research support framework through which we supply funding to teachers who are involved in formal programmes of teacher education.  Some of the teachers who are in receipt of those bursaries are focusing their learning on the area of special education and inclusive education.  We also have a suite of resources available on our website under the heading "Using Research in our School".  That is available to any teacher.  Inclusive education is, of course, one of the core elements of that.</p></speech>

They get mountains of resources posted through to them and everybody and anybody sends them links.  That is brilliant but my question was clearly on proper training, by which I mean training in the physical presence of somebody who knows how best to give teachers the tools to work with children with autism.</p></speech>

I see lots of resources being developed.  People are getting paid lots of money to develop resources to be put online but hands-on training is by far the best and would also increase the incidence of early diagnosis.

I hear from teachers about it all the time.  If the council is representing the teachers, is it making a case for increased training?

We have included inclusive education as one of the seven core elements, as I explained earlier.  The Droichead induction framework is also our policy.  In the areas under our remit, we focus on special education and inclusion in the round.  However, in areas that are outside our remit, we have a role in promotion.  With regard to the areas we promote, we had Mr. Adam Harris from AsIAm at our F&Eacute;ILTE conference.  I believe that was in 2018 but I am not sure of the year.  We always have inclusive education and inclusion as part of the brief for our F&Eacute;ILTE conference, which happens on World Teachers' Day, which happened to be last Saturday.

This speaks to my earlier point that teachers are the ones best placed to identify that need, which will be different from teacher to teacher and from context to context.  Those teachers may engage in a variety of learning settings.  I note that the Senator mentioned a specific training model.  That is one model of continuing professional development, CPD, or teachers learning but there are many ways in which teachers learn.  Sometimes it involves a professional learning community and sometimes a formal programme.</p><p> We also have a researcher-in-residence scheme that provides funding for teachers who are researching on an area within their own school.  We have teachers who are engaged in that scheme in the area of inclusive education.  That is what falls within our remit and that is a way we can support teachers.</p></speech>

I am asking specifically who is demanding that the July provision is done only by qualified teachers.</p></speech>

I presume the employer is making that a requirement.  I am not involved in the delivery of it.  We supply the stream of teachers, but we are not involved in the organisation of it.</p></speech>

The Teaching Council is trying to support the teachers.  I know teachers pay well to be a member of the Teaching Council.  It is blatant to everybody on the committee that there is a major issue with providing teachers for July provision.  Is anybody in the Teaching Council looking at alternatives?  We know that teaching is now more difficult than ever.  The number of teachers available is reducing every year as teaching becomes more stressful.  As we move forward, it is less likely that teachers will be available in July and August when they need that time off.  They usually spend a week or two in July wrapping up after teaching for the school year and a week or two in August preparing to go back teaching.  It is not realistic for the Teaching Council to think that they will be the ones sorting this issue out.  It does not seem to make sense.</p> <p>  In order for someone to teach, it is necessary to register with the Teaching Council.  That is great and it is good that we have a system in place.  However, the teachers are crying out for support on this and they feel bad that they cannot do the July provision.  They would like the children to get the support because most teachers are really dedicated to their pupils.  Is it not time for the Teaching Council to have a really frank conversation?  The Teaching Council may be pushing the notion that people other than qualified teachers may be able to do the July provision?  Does Ms Fox have any opinion on that?</p></speech>

That is the role that we occupy.  We have a supply of 116,000 teachers available on our register.  We have implemented measures to increase the supply of teachers to make them available for July provision at a time when it seemed it was very necessary to do that.  The requirement to be registered with the Teaching Council is in the employment space.  We do not occupy that space at all.  I again point out that the registration assures the public and assures prospective employers that a teacher is a fit and proper person and has the requisite qualifications.</p></speech>

That is the alternative for parents if they can get somebody because we do not have the school-based programme.  That is the source of the frustration among committee members.  There are tens of thousands of children who are not getting into the programme because the school-based programme is a very limited, particularly in special schools.  There are 8,000 children in special schools and over 80% of them have no programme at all.</p><p>We as a committee want to prioritise it for the summer of 2023.  We have a summer-based programme throughout the country that every child who needs it gets, but that needs qualified teachers to make themselves available or we need to change the legislation to allow either people working in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, system or people who have levels 6, 7 or 8 in education to work in this scheme.  Children and their families, particularly where the children have a higher need, need that programme.  That gap of eight weeks and longer for families is not acceptable.  The committee would like the Teaching Council to highlight that.  The council said we need to promote this to more teachers for them to make themselves available.  I am not criticising in any way but the children need it.  Otherwise, they will regress and then it will be a more difficult September and October.  We need more specialised training in special education.</p><p> Ms Fox mentioned teacher supply groups.  We have a teacher supply issue for the summer provision and all here accept the massive need.  I mentioned at our previous meeting that some schools have made a decision already that they will not be doing summer provision next year.  Thousands of families have already been told 12 months out that they will have no summer provision next year.  It is unacceptable we allow that happen.  Will the Teaching Council promote this to teachers to make themselves available?  Could we get the number of teachers who are registered and are perhaps retired who would be available to work?  Could we contact them to see what number would be available to work?  We need to start this work now to make sure we have this summer provision next year.</p></speech>

We wish it well with this work.  It is very important for everyone in society that this work is done.</p> <p>  We have the role to promote.  We have access to the register of teachers and we can communicate with teachers in that way.  Certainly, if that is something that would be of assistance, we can look at how we might be able to assist in that way.</p> <p>  One other point that might be helpful to know is that there are several routes to registration - primary, post-primary and further education - and there are different requirements under those routes to registration.  It may be the case that some of those in the ECCE sector would be eligible to register under some of the routes.  That would be worth checking for each of the individual teachers and it would be on a case-by-case basis.</p></speech>

I want to ask one question again that was half-answered.  If we are trying to increase the number of teachers registering for the July provision, would it not make sense for the Teaching Council to look to the Department of Education to run specific continuing professional development, CPD, training, or to do such training itself, to support teachers and give them the confidence to want to work in this area?  Not every teacher has the confidence to work with children with autism.  Surely they would be more empowered by having specific training, and I do not mean resources online but specific training to give them the confidence to believe they have the skills and tools they need, even though they are already qualified teachers, which is fantastic, but we all know teaching children can be challenging.  Does the Teaching Council have a plan to do clear training to support, encourage and empower teachers to put their names on the list for the July provision?  This would help us increase the number of teachers available for it.  I do not know where we are going if we do not have any figures on how many more we need.  That is probably not the job of the council either.</p><p>The Teaching Council has increased the number of teachers available for the July provision.  If we are not getting as much as we need, it might be worth seriously listening to my suggestion that the Teaching Council run CPD and proper training courses that will give teachers the confidence to believe that they can offer the July provision.  Maybe the teachers do not have children with autism in their school.  Maybe they are new teachers.  Maybe they do not believe they have the skills, although we all know they have.  Some specific CPD training could help increase the numbers on that list.</p></speech>

It would be helpful to make the point that programmes are available.  There are training programmes available through the Department of Education.  We are aware of them because teachers come to us with them to add them to their registration.  They are provided for teachers who are in a special education setting and who wish to increase their knowledge base and their skill base in relation to inclusive education and who have identified learning need-----</p></speech>

It might help to increase the numbers on the list of people willing to do the July provision if it could give them the information.  The Teaching Council is the only body with the database of teachers, because everybody has to register with it, and it could let them know about these training courses.</p></speech>

We are supportive of teachers and, of course, there is a continuum of teacher education.  It is our experience that the teachers are life-long learners and  they engage in CPD as and when they need to.  They are continually learning.  They are learning in their own context and they are making conscious decisions to learn where they have an identified learning need.  That has been our experience.</p> <p>  Last Saturday, more than 1,000 teachers attended our national conference, either physically or in a hybrid manner.  As part of that, one of those sessions was facilitated by a teacher who has autism.  That person is engaging in research and we look forward to hearing how that might go.  However, as regards being a provider of CPD, we are not facilitated by the legislation to do that.</p></speech>

It has been beneficial to committee to hear their views.  We will consider them when we are making our final report.  I know they are limited in what they can and cannot do, but I would ask them to highlight the concerns the committee members have raised ahead of summer of 2023.  We get the figures and we have a fair idea already that there are significant numbers of children who do not have that provision and who are regressing because of that.  We ask the Teaching Council to take those concerns on board and bring them to the teachers&rsquo; supply group and to any discussions it may have with the Department of Education.</p></speech>

From the Teachers' Union of Ireland, we have Mr. David Duffy, education and research officer, and Ms Anne Howard, assistant general secretary.  From F&oacute;rsa we have Ms Linda Kelly, national secretary of the health and welfare division, and Mr. Andy Pike, head of education.  From the Irish Primary Principals' Network, we are joined by Mr. P&aacute;iric Clerkin, CEO, and Ms Caroline Quinn, leadership team support.</p> <p>   For the information of the witnesses, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references they may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Before we hear from our witnesses, I propose that we publish their opening statements and submissions on the committee website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I will now invite our witnesses to make their opening statements.  First, we will hear from the TUI, which represents 19,000 teachers and lecturers in the Irish public education sector.  It is the third teachers' union to have met our committee.  We would like to hear how education and inclusion is working out in practice and what the is role for special schools and special classes, as well as mainstream classes.  I invite Mr. Duffy and Ms Howard to make their opening statements.</p></speech>

Data show us that disadvantaged schools enroll by far the most significant proportion of students with special educational needs.</p><p>In terms of options for schooling, it is important that all options are available to a student with special educational needs, SEN.  Therefore, both mainstream and special school options should be available and the deciding factor should be what is in the best long-term interest of the child.</p><p> The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act requires serious investment and a number of groups have questioned whether it is still possible to implement.  More than 15 years ago, the TUI emphasised that schools were not sufficiently resourced to implement some elements of the EPSEN Act, in particular designing and delivering individual education plans for students with SEN.  Since then it has become clear the medicalised model envisaged in EPSEN is no longer possible due to an unwillingness of the Department of Education over many years to facilitate ongoing resourcing and legislative arrangements.  In the absence of adequate resourcing, many of the needs of students with SEN are falling on parents.  Schools will need continuing professional development, CPD, teaching hours, time for administration and the restoration of pastoral supports.  The student profile or plan recording system needs to be redefined entirely.  Furthermore, schools, students and families will need to be able to access out-of-school supports such as occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, child and adolescent mental health services etc., in a timely fashion.  We are all aware of long waiting lists for access to vital supports, such as operational therapists, speech and language therapists etc.  The backlogs are not in any way the fault of the staff in those services who are trying valiantly to cope with unmanageable caseloads.  However, the waiting lists present significant difficulties for schools and families who are trying to support students with autism.</p><p> It is vital that students with autism continue to be able to access supports when moving into and through higher and further education.  College guidance and disability offices need to be adequately resourced to achieve this.  The disability access route to education scheme also needs to continue and, if possible, expand.</p><p> Education settings require support from relevant agencies with expertise in these areas if the school is adequately to support students with autism.  Those supports to students are frequently lacking.  Cuts to pastoral supports in schools, such as guidance and middle management, have also made it difficult for schools to support students in these difficult situations.  Numbers of posts of responsibility have also not kept pace with ongoing rises in student numbers.  Schools most urgently need time, resources and CPD to support students with autism.  Restoration of the special needs allowance would encourage more teachers to seek this important qualification.  Schools need time to do department-level planning as well as student-level planning.  Some schools do not even have an assigned special educational needs organiser, SENO.  The lack of integrated inclusive supports on site in schools, such as nurses, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists etc., makes truly inclusive education a dream rather than a reality.  A pilot programme, the school inclusion model, is available in some schools.  The TUI is cautiously optimistic about the prospects of such a programme and looks forward to the forthcoming research report on the pilot scheme.</p><p> It is vital all public buildings be made autism sensitive.  All new buildings should have the facility to incorporate safe spaces as well as room for special classes as required.  Many older buildings will require significant retrofitting.</p><p> The TUI would like to make the following recommendations to the committee.  Students with autism should be able to attend school with their siblings and neighbours without travelling long distances.  It is essential that vital support structures within schools are restored.  It is essential that students with SEN are able to access further education and training opportunities.  There needs to be investment in students with autism before, during and after their post-primary education.  Better forward planning is required for students due to move into post-primary education while they are still in primary school.  Hours allocated to SEN need to be used solely for SEN work, such as planning, direct student support, family liaison etc.  The Teacher Conciliation Council, TCC, has for some time been addressing the issue of a specific time allocation to schools for department-level planning.  A recommendation from the TCC soon would be helpful.  Follow-on programmes are required at senior cycle for students who pursued level 1 and level 2 learning programmes at junior cycle.  Resources for schools will need to be provided to enable this.</p><p> An extensive school building and refitting programme is needed urgently.  Significant investment is needed in out-of-school supports.  Investment is also needed in the health system to enable assessments of need, which are, after all, a legal right.  The National Education Psychological Service must be involved in schools from the ground up.  Every school should have an assigned SENO.  It would be useful if all staff had the opportunity, if they so wished, to engage in CPD on supporting students with autism.</p><p>The DARE scheme needs to continue and, ideally, expand.  The SEN allowance should be restored and the provision of special schools and special classes should continue until a viable and fully resourced alternative can be provided.</p><p> I thank the committee for listening to this opening statement.  The TUI would be more than happy to answer any questions members may have.  The TUI would also like to direct members to the more extensive written submission we made to the committee last month, which provides more detail on the matters outlined.</p></speech>

The Chair has outlined who we are and that we have made a dual submission covering areas of health or education, so I will get straight into the detail of it.</p> <p>  The health policy areas that have already been mentioned by my colleagues impact on the lives of people diagnosed with autism across a number of policy areas.  We cannot cover them all in this submission but we need to focus on some of the areas that are in crisis and require immediate Government and political intervention.  These areas are: the funding arrangements within the community and voluntary sector; children&rsquo;s disability network teams; and the need for a chief health and social care professional, HSCP, office within the Department of Health.</p> <p>  On the community and voluntary sector, everybody is well aware of the problematic funding arrangements that exist.  We have included in our appendices to our submission a number of documents and research the union previously published.  While those funding arrangements extend past the disability sector and impact across a number of different areas, they have a disproportionate impact on the provision of services to autistic people because of the impact on disability services.  It is still unclear whether the additional &euro;65 million announced last week by the Minister will prioritise having those pay claims addressed by staff within the sector.  That is tied into the children&rsquo;s disability network teams, whereby there are people working on the same teams and earning different rates of pay, which is untenable.</p> <p>  On the children&rsquo;s disability network teams, it must be acknowledged that the reconfiguration of any service is a challenging change of environment, a challenge made even more difficult by the Covid-19 pandemic.  Notwithstanding that, there are several significant issues within the service that can be addressed by the Government and the HSE if there is an investment in finance and leadership.  Rather than take up all the time with my opening statement, I have included an appendix on the significant issues that are causing a massive recruitment and retention crisis within children&rsquo;s disability network teams.  This all stems from the fact that we have a lack of a chief HSCP office in the Department of Health.  There is a clear and urgent need for the creation of this to bring a strategic focus in the Department of Health on all issues related to HSCPs.  Similar to the funding arrangements, while this would encompass many areas outside of disability, it would have a positive impact on the roll-out of progressing disability services.  We have set out a number of recommendations in the opening statement.  I liked them so much that we included them twice.</p> <p>  I will move on to our submission on education.  The Government&rsquo;s approach to delivering an inclusive school system has been disjointed, confused, and marked by a failure to deliver on key policy commitments.  This failure has let down many students, including autistic students, who stood to benefit from a more inclusive educational experience.  The policy initiatives announced by successive Governments in this area have sought to fulfil the commitments enshrined within the EPSEN Act and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities but unfortunately these commitments have not been delivered.  The blueprint for changing the nature of Ireland&rsquo;s school system was set out by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, across several publications and policy announcements, including the development of policy advice to Government.  The NCSE summarised these initiatives in its progress report on developing policy advice on special schools and classes in October 2019.  The council stated that &ldquo;substantive improvements&rdquo; had been made "in the wider system of supports for students with special educational needs."  However, the required changes have not been delivered.</p> <p>  The NCSE stated that in 2018 a demonstration project commenced to bring specialised therapies into 150 preschools and schools.  In the schools sector some 75 schools participated in the pilot in community healthcare organisation, CHO 7.</p><p>To date, the evaluation of the pilot has not been published and there are not verifiable outcomes against which this approach can be measured in terms of educational achievements or improved learning.</p><p> The council also stated that the commencement of legislation to compel schools to open a special class would quickly improve provision.  In fact, it was not until 2022 that the legislation was enacted and used.  The council stated that in 2019, a new schools inclusion model was piloted aiming to build schools' capacity to include students with additional education and care needs.  Again, no evaluation of the outcomes of the pilot has been published and the direction of Government policy remains unclear.  The Department of Education informed schools that a new mechanism for allocating special needs assistants, SNAs, to mainstream classes would be implemented at the commencement of the 2022-23 school year.</p><p> Mr. Pike is telling me I can skip the rest of the submission and take it as read.  In the time left, we will get straight to the meat of the issue, namely, the recommendations.</p><p> The recommendations are key from our perspective.  The first is to abolish the statutory special needs assistant scheme and replace it with a national SNA service with staff allocated to every school.  This would end the uncertainty for students and staff about the continuation of SNA supports year to year.  Every school should be inclusive and every school needs a complement of SNAs to work with students with additional care needs.  Second, the Government should establish a national school nursing service to provide advice, support and clinical care for students with complex medical needs in mainstream classes and special classes.  Third, it should work with stakeholders to agree a robust redeployment scheme for SNAs to ensure the right staff are in the right place to deliver the service.  Fourth, it should ensure the SNA workforce is properly trained and qualified to meet the need of students.  The national SNA training programme must be accredited and should continue.  The minimum essential qualification for SNAs should be modernised and accredited to at least Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, level 6.  Fifth, each student should be facilitated with a pathway to mainstream class provision if it is right for them and if it is appropriate.  This requires resourcing and assessment of school capacity and staffing requirements.</p><p> We are happy to go into detail on anything in the submission or its appendices.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.137" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;iric Clerkin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022100400002#U00300"><p>In its widest sense, inclusive education aims to enable participation, raise achievements, support well-being and create a sense of belonging for all learners, including those with additional needs and those who are most vulnerable to exclusion.  Special needs are either met or they are not and, if not, there is a consequential impact not only on the child with special needs but also on the other children in the class.</p> <p>  The IPPN recognises the current pressure within the system in terms of a shortage of places for children with complex additional needs in special classes and special schools in Dublin and elsewhere.  We fully support the principle of ensuring equal access to quality inclusive education for all learners, alongside their siblings and friends in the local area in which they live.  This inclusion must be planned, supported and fully resourced.</p> <p>  Under section 37A of the Education Act 1998, the Minister has the power to direct schools to make additional special education provision available and ensure sufficient places are provided.  It must be recognised that a requirement to exercise those powers means that the system has already failed to adequately prepare for the placement of children with complex additional needs into schools alongside their peers.</p> <p>  The IPPN encourages all schools to undertake to open a special class if or when an application is received on behalf of a child within their catchment area who has a recommendation for placement in a special class.  The reduced timeframe for the admissions process required under legislation does not afford sufficient time for the planning, support and resourcing to be undertaken that is required to facilitate the placement of children with complex additional needs in their local national school.  This was raised by the IPPN as an issue at the time the legislation was enacted.  We believe an amendment to the legislation to allow schools to receive advance applications on behalf of children who have a recommendation for placement in a special class 24 months in advance of their school start date would alleviate this difficulty.  This extended period would allow the school, in consultation with the SENO and parents, to address what needs to be put in place to ensure the child&rsquo;s access to quality inclusive education.  It would provide certainty to the parents about school placement, would obviate the need to invoke section 37A and, most importantly, would ensure that children with complex additional needs will be able to attend the same local national schools as their brothers, sisters or friends.</p><p>At the heart of the issues we hear about from our members is a need to differentiate between high-incidence special needs and more complex low-incidence special needs and how such needs are planned for, supported and resourced.  Adopting the same approach to both is problematic and incompatible with the differing challenges they present.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.139" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Quinn" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022100400002#V00200"><p>Children with low-incidence complex needs generally fall into three categories: those whose needs have been clearly identified and whose transition to school is anticipated, planned for and resourced; those whose needs may have been identified but have not been flagged to the school and, accordingly, have not been planned for and resourced; and those whose needs emerge when the child is in school.</p> <p>  The adequacy of a school&rsquo;s quantum of resources is compromised largely, but not exclusively, as a result of children presenting in the school whose needs have not been flagged to the school or children with identified complex needs who may not be linked in with a disability team.  Notwithstanding the excellent work of public health nurses, GPs, early intervention teams and early childhood educators, it is not uncommon for a child to present in school with clearly identifiable complex needs that have not been flagged in advance to the school.  Parents may not have identified their child as having complex needs nor have engaged with services, feeling the school placement may be compromised.  Either way, when such circumstances arise, it can have a profoundly negative impact on the experience of the child and a consequential impact on his or her peers in the class.</p> <p>  It is crucial the system is agile enough to respond quickly to an emerging need so as not to compromise unnecessarily or unduly the school&rsquo;s ability to meet and respond adequately to that need.  This is not currently the case.  Most children with low-incidence complex needs can thrive in a mainstream class setting or in a special class in a mainstream school if their needs have been identified to the school in a timely manner; there is sufficient time to plan for and put in place the supports the children require; and the school&rsquo;s allocation of supports in the areas of teaching, special needs assistance, technology, furniture, building modifications etc. is adequate.</p> <p>  In summary, the following key issues need to be addressed.  There need to be adequate resources and funding, including staff and board of management training regarding supporting children with autism.  The low-incidence complex needs profile of a school needs to be considered as a separate entity to high incidence needs.  The exceptional review process, by which schools can seek to have the accuracy of their SNA allocations considered, is unwieldy and slow in responding to emerging need.  The IPPN notes the targeted review process that is referred to in circular 0035/2022 and supports its piloting as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>  The IPPN acknowledges the increase in funding announced in the budget, including the extra 370 special classes to be opened, 234 at primary level, as well as the extra SENOs to be recruited.  Having an efficient number of SENOs in the system has a knock-on effect.  We do not want to go back to SENOs having between 60 and 70 schools on their caseload, which is not sustainable.  Where the resources allocated to a school are not sufficient to meet the needs, it makes no sense that the parent would appeal the allocation of resources to the school leader who has had no influence over the level of resources allocated to the school. </p> <p>  The pilot school inclusion model has merit with the access to additional assistance, such as behavioural support, added psychological support and therapy services.  There is significant doubt whether such a model can be delivered countrywide given the dearth of such qualified professionals available.  That causes an issue at school level, meaning people cannot be substituted or they are on maternity leave in the health services.  That adds to the burden on school leaders trying to access the reports for children in their schools.</p> <p>  There are other issues which we are more than happy to discuss with the committee today.  We thank members for taking the time to listen.</p></speech>

The committee is focused on the delivery of the July provision.  We have listened to 15 minutes of various contributions and I agree with many of them.</p><p>Not one representative in that 15-minute period mentioned the July provision or what teachers can do to enhance July provision.  I have the list of things that were mentioned, including investment in a whole range of things, all of which are important but not once did the representatives mention what teachers can do to offer and not once did they address our concern around the delivery of the summer provision programme.  Reference was made to the unwillingness of the Department to facilitate resourcing; investment before during and after; school building investment; school supports; and health supports - all correct; and assigned SENOs, special educational needs organisers.</p><p> I totally agree with Ms Kelly about the health and social care professionals, HSCPs, and the Department of Health and a range of other points and other criticisms, including redeployment schemes.  All correct but there was not one reference to what teachers can do to enhance July provision.  With every respect, there was not one reference.  It is like, "We have 99 problems but July provision ain't one."  I am not trying to be funny but 400 children out of 8,000 got the full four weeks of July provision last year.  We heard from the Teaching Council that there are 116,000 registered teachers, and an additional 3,500 were made available who could help to provide July provision.  As a committee, we just do not hear what is happening, what is the extra contribution for what can be done, or what is the plan.  It is of huge concern.  We are already engaged on the health side.  That is the point of this committee.  We are trying to address it piece by piece with everybody.  We are not here to hear a list of demands.  We are here to get solutions.  It is deeply frustrating to have listened to 15 minutes of important content but without one constructive point for what the representatives believe teachers will do within the next 12 months to make sure that this statistic in respect of children and July provision does not happen again.  I leave it open to the witnesses.  What is going to be different this time next year from the teachers' perspective?</p></speech>

It should happen and ideally it should be broader than it currently is.  It should be more available than it currently is.  We have been involved, even within the last year or two, in encouraging people to get involved in July provision because it is an important service.</p></speech>

We talk about this as the greatest danger to children, namely, the regression they face.  We are working through all the different issues but this is the single biggest gap.  We are told that the biggest problem in relation to it is matching the teachers to the need.  That it did not immediately jump out at the witnesses as the single most important question for us to be able to resolve is, of itself, concerning.</p></speech>

That was what we thought the committee wanted to hear about.  F&oacute;rsa's view on July provision is that it needs to become embedded in the school calendar.  It needs to become something that schools are expected to provide more than given an option on.  There are resource issues there that probably need to be looked at.  We do not know how many special needs assistants participated in July provision.  The only way one could find that out is to look at how many were paid the rate.  That is something that mitigates against SNAs necessarily volunteering to do July provision.  There are some issues there, in that the rates have not been looked at for many years.</p></speech>

We represent SNAs and health professionals.  I can leave it to others to look at the contribution that teachers can make.</p> <p>  One of the comments we continually make to the Department is that where the arrangements are announced so late in the school year, I should imagine that if one is a school leader such as a principal or deputy principal - my colleagues can speak on their behalf - it gives a person very little time to get everything organised.</p><p>If it was the case that the circular issued at the beginning of the school year, schools could at least plan with a little more information.

We believe that there are solutions that would make the situation better for families through the admissions Act.  This is an issue we have raised with all of our colleagues whenever we have had the opportunity because we believe it will make special education accessible for children in their local area.  We are very concerned that children are not getting the opportunity to attend school with their brothers, sisters and friends in their local community.  That is something we would like to see corrected and is therefore an issue we have highlighted today.</p> <p>  We absolutely support the July provision and want to see it succeed.  From a schools point of view, school leaders proactively promoted the scheme but, quite simply, they found it very difficult to get staff in a position to take it up this year.  As an organisation, we have proactively engaged with the Department with regard to supporting families, schools and children and we made it easier for them to access a teacher or special needs assistant, SNA, through our portal for education posts.  We developed that technology to support families.  That was very much our focus for this year.  We will develop that further.  We want to see the scheme succeed.  We appreciate how important it is for children who have missed out on a great deal over recent years and who are facing another very difficult challenge this year because many schools, especially in urban areas, have posts vacant and are not in a position to fill them.  We appreciate how important it is for children with extra needs and, as an organisation, we will be doing everything in our power to ensure it succeeds.</p></speech>

This year in particular was incredibly difficult because people were coming out of two years of the Covid pandemic and there were great demands on schools.  It was a very stressful environment.  People had been working in a very difficult environment over the two years.  Many of our members and colleagues on the ground were saying they were just exhausted.  When it came to the summer time, they just could not face back into the classroom.</p> <p>  I will address one of the difficulties.  This year, the Department rolled out an online claims process for teachers, which I really welcome.  That speeded up payment for teachers and was welcomed.  Last year, the situation was different.  The committee members will have heard reports of some people not being paid until December.  That was a real difficulty.  It was particularly difficult for one group.  As members will be aware, not all teachers get full 22-hour contracts when they start out, particularly in the post-primary sector.  Their contracts also do not pay them throughout the summer.  Some people's payments end at the beginning of June and they are not paid again until they take up a contract in the summer.  These people can be left with no choice but to take up other work during the summer months or to sign on for a jobseeker's payment.  Some such teachers were concerned that they would not receive payment until December and could not allow themselves to receive no payment during the summer months.  This is one of the reasons they did not engage.  I do believe this is a crucial service that should be rolled out.  If it is rolled out and if schools are given adequate time, it will be possible to run it in a good structured way.</p><p>It would become part of the system but, again, the structures and supports need to be given early to schools so they know what they need, what they have available and how many people they can employ to do that.</p><p> We would also like to see a number of things put in place in respect of the July provision.  For example, there is a situation whereby students in sixth class who want to avail of July provision are not able to do so in the post-primary school they are going to the following year.  It would be a very welcome change if it were possible for those students to avail of July provision in that post-primary school so they then get an opportunity to be in the place they will be in the following year.  It gives them a great opportunity to begin there.  It would be wonderful if the teachers in the school could be encouraged and facilitated to do that.  In order to encourage and facilitate teachers in post-primary schools to engage with that, it would also be great if continuing professional development was rolled out to them.  People should be given adequate skills and training so when the offer of engaging with summer provision becomes available to them, they feel they are equipped to do it.</p><p> There are a number of issues.  Mr. Duffy outlined the needs in our submission.  I understand the Deputy's frustration.  I know she sees this as a service that is essential to families.  It is even more so now, given what we have been through for the past two years.  It is very important because the disconnect is already there due to Covid.  To continue that disconnect, where students were unable to engage with summer provision, was a major loss to those families and not just to the students themselves.  We absolutely support the roll-out of July provision.  We are just saying to give schools, as with all roll-outs of SEN provision in schools, adequate time to plan, prepare and put the resources in place so they can roll it out appropriately without the stress.  Schools have become an awfully stressful environment, and they are incredibly busy.</p></speech>

I agree with and accept what Ms Howard said.  The number of classes, and I can see this in my constituency, has significantly expanded at secondary and primary level.  There is more to go but it has expanded significantly.  I have seen that since 2019.  That is just a fact.  I know the children who are in those classes.</p> <p>  Ms Howard is quite right about planning and preparation, which we will take up with the Department, but I want to hear an overwhelming rush from teachers to make sure that this happens this year.  What will teachers do differently this year compared with last year to make sure, from their perspective, that no stone is left unturned?  It should not be down to somebody else.  Everyone involved - teachers and the Department - should have been so proactive and got ahead of this in order that, despite any sort of clashes or people fighting with each other, the only outcome that will be acceptable will be proper July provision for children and their families.  Indeed, this will have a knock-on effect for teachers in not having to deal with regression for the first four or six weeks of the next school year.  It is absolutely in everybody's interests, and that is why we are so strong on the matter.</p></speech>

We have this difficulty whereby 116,000 teachers are on the register, an extra 3,500 teachers were made available, through emergency measures, by the Teaching Council last year, and more than 1,200 student teachers are in training.  We are being told that teachers are not available to offer July provision.  There seems to be a very large number of teachers.  We are told by the Teaching Council that teachers are the largest group of registered professionals in Ireland.  There is some gap.  Not all of them are needed, but a subset is.

It is about having people who are appropriately trained.  This is not just about money.  If the job of teaching was about money, we would not have so many people doing it, especially when we consider the fact many young teachers are not on full contracts or full-hour contracts, and are sometimes on half-hour contracts. This is not just about money; it is about adequately resourcing, making time available and ensuring that people have appropriate training to do the job.</p></speech>

This committee is focused on autism.  What we need to do to ensure the inclusion of autistic children in education, and, as much as possible, in mainstream education.</p><p>That is, I would imagine, proving impossible because of the failure of the progressing disability model.  How is that impacting on schools?  Since the establishment of the children's disability network teams, about one third of them have been understaffed and are not functioning properly.   If children are not assessed at an early age, they cannot be placed in appropriate educational facilities.</p><p> Mr. Clerkin mentioned having 24 months advanced knowledge.  At primary level, you are talking about a child of three, because they usually go to school at five, but they are not being assessed at that age.  We need to ensure that children are properly assessed, have ongoing assessments as they move through school and are put into the right place.</p><p> Our focus also needs to be on inclusive education.  We want to see the minimum of children in special schools and special classes, and more in mainstream.  Parents shudder when I talk of inclusive education.  They are fearful of their child in a special school or class going into mainstream because resources and supports are not there.  Have the witnesses had those conversations with the Department?  Is there a move towards that?</p><p> The EPSEN Act was mentioned.  It is being reviewed and we are told the review will be finished by the beginning of next year.  Mr. Duffy mentioned that the medicalised model envisioned is no longer possible due to the unwillingness of the Department of Education to facilitate it.  It should not be a medicalised model.  We ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, so we should be talking about a rights-based model and making sure that education is inclusive for all of our children, especially autistic children.</p><p> Reference was made to the social inclusion model.  Some people are not that positive about it.  That model puts resources into schools but the therapists in the schools deal with, talk to and advise the teachers.  They do not interact with the students.  If it were possible to combine our failed children's disability network teams with the social inclusion model, but where the therapists interact with the children so the children do not have to leave school to get these therapies, it would make for a better model.</p><p> Children are not getting assessed or getting early intervention, so are not being the best version of themselves and will need more supports down the line.  That is what we are seeing all the time.  Students who do not get early intervention require more assistance the older they get.  Have the witnesses had much interaction with the HSE on the progressing disability model or the Department on the social inclusion model?  How should we address the shortfalls in assessment and supports in the community for the children in the school?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.171" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;iric Clerkin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022100400002#Z00200"><p>I will take the first point and then hand over to Ms Quinn.  The Deputy mentioned the 24 months.  The admissions Act is transparent and we would argue that it is fair.  There is the section 29 process whereby if a parent does not feel the policy has been implemented appropriately, that can be appealed.  The problem is it is not working for children with complex special education needs.  It is not possible to put everything in place in that short a period.</p> <p>  In my school, we are taking applications now for next September.  By the time that is processed, we get back to every parent and go through the appeals process, it does not leave time to get everything in place for children with complex needs.  As a result, we have the section 37 process.  That is reactive and does not facilitate children attending school in local areas.  It facilitates children attending school somewhere else.  Most of them are being bused, taxied and brought across their communities to other schools.  We could achieve that through a slight amendment to the admissions Act, whereby children with complex needs could make an application earlier.  I take the Deputy's point that children are very young at three.  Some may not have been assessed but many are within the system.  We would be in a better position to prepare for those children and it would not in any way interfere with the admissions process.  The children would still only be offered places if they were entitled to them, which is mostly on the basis of age.  In most situations, you would be able to predict whether the child was going to get a place the next year or not.  Worst-case scenario, the admission would be delayed by a year because the child was too young.  We feel that is a fundamental issue and that is a message we are passionate about getting across.  We feel that will make things better.</p><p>The section 37 process does not work for families and does not work for children.  It does not get them access in their local school. </p></speech>

In times gone by there was a huge issue.  There was a dearth of people coming into the school and engaging with us.  In recent years this has changed.  I would certainly have seen it working very well in many cases.  One of things we had said quite a bit was that if each child had his or her own team, and then some of those teams and healthcare professionals are coming in to see other children, then resources could be used in a much better way if a regional team was linked to a whole regional group of schools.  I was in Killiney, for example.  It would be much better if one person, whether it is a psychologist or an occupational therapist, was coming in to see several children.  It worked best for us in our own school where we did our own pilot on a school inclusion model, and this was before the current pilot.  We had speech and language and we had occupational therapy.  We employed those people through the school.  They worked with the school, they worked with the teachers in the classes, and they worked with the parents. They worked with the children at home.  It was a real wraparound service and it was something we thought could definitely be rolled out and something worth thinking about if this school inclusion model was going to be expanded or changed.  The biggest problem being faced by schools at the moment is where people are on statutory leave such as maternity leave, or where they are sick and substitution is needed.  This is where there can be a huge gap in services.</p></speech>

We believe that at the moment one cannot really be certain as to what Government policy is for the provision of services to autistic students in mainstream.  The Government endorsed the schools inclusion model, and part of that is a move towards the allocation of staff according to a new model called "front loading".  That was due to be introduced at the start of this school year.  There were reasons for looking at the introduction of front loading.  There were many reasons it probably should happen, one of which is the move away from a student being required to have a formal diagnosis or to go through the assessment-of-need process to access supports from a special needs assistant.  It moves the assessment into the school.  Guidance was produced for principals, teachers and SNAs on how that was to be carried out but the Department decided not to proceed with that model.  I believe that the reason was that the metrics they were using are showing that they had got people in the wrong place.  To try to move people to the right place could not be achieved in the short space of time available.</p> <p>  The schools inclusion model itself involved 75 schools in the Kildare area in the main.  Nobody has seen the evaluation report.  The staff working in the schools just say to us that there is a sense of drift around it.  The therapists were employed by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, but they have had trouble recruiting and retaining staff.  The way it was supposed to work was that therapists were not necessarily employed to provide therapies directly with students on a routine basis, although they would where the need arose.  They were asked to design individual programmes that would be of assistance to the students in those 75 schools.  They worked with the teachers and the special needs assistants around how a speech and language programme could be delivered in the school.  It is the role of SNAs to assist with the delivery of such programmes.  It is something that probably needs to be looked at in the very near future.  We feel that if a family wants to give their son or daughter, who may be autistic, the best possible chance of getting the best experience out of an education that they would want to move them towards a mainstream place.  Mainstream places are hard to get.  The pathways from special classes into mainstream are just not there.  The failure to deliver on the model for special educational needs in mainstream is a real problem.  The guidance is still out there.  Some schools are conducting assessments of students who present with problems.  They may not have a diagnosis but the problem is that there is no way of matching that student with resources.  There is no way of getting extra resources into the school.  Some schools are doing those assessments but others are not because the whole system has not gone live.  It was supposed to go live in September.</p><p>When they look at who they have and where they are needed, they have not done any assessments of where they need SNAs in mainstream classes since 2019.  Consequently, many people will need to be moved from areas where there is no longer a need to a different school where there is a need.  However, there is no way of moving them from A to B.</p><p> Going back to the question on July provision, we suggest looking at the work being done to welcome and accommodate Ukrainian students to our schools, of whom there are now 6,000 or 7,000 enrolled.  The education and training boards, ETBs, on a regional level have co-ordinated the regional education and language teams involving groups of professionals from different organisations and have done that work really well.  It shows what you can do if you ask the ETBs to deliver something.  In each county there is an ETB.  Instead of asking or begging independent schools to get on board with July provision, maybe the Government could ask the ETBs to make sure there is sufficient provision in their catchment area.  They can instruct the schools administered by ETBs to run programmes; they cannot instruct a school that is run by a different patron.</p></speech>

There is no sugarcoating it.  Everybody recognises that.  Looked at from the perspective of a family or parent, it is overwhelming to try to deal with the challenge in both health and education.  Everything we try to do collectively has to be about making that process easier for the family at the centre of the service.  Our members on the health side, in terms of health and social care professionals, are clear that they want to provide a high quality public service to children with disabilities and their families.</p> <p>  We talk about engagement with the HSE or about leadership, such as in the three pages in the appendices around all of the issues concerning children's disability network teams.  Clinicians are asking questions, some basic and some more in-depth, and there are no answers coming.  When you look at what happened in recent weeks around the Government decision to reinstate health and social care supports to school, we had a gap of four weeks where there was no engagement from the HSE with us as the representative body for all of the staff working in CDNTs, even though we made ourselves available to be a willing partner in a constructive process.  We were against the decision to remove them in the first instance.</p> <p>  When we eventually got to meet with the HSE and got into the detail of what would happen, there was a comment to the effect that this was about returning health supports to education settings.  Okay, what does that look like?  Nothing.  How did the HSE propose to carry out the first tranche of recruitment for bringing people back into special school scenarios, which is only one educational setting?  The other educational settings are totally excluded from this decision, which is another area that clinicians have a concern about because it reinforces an inequity in the system.  We are talking about children now accessing two different teams, which I heard from a parents' group last night is being misrepresented across the system as people being obliged to transfer teams.  Families do not need to be dealing with this.  The answers are in services, with clinicians and with families.  Where is the investment into a change programme as fundamental as progressing disability services for children and young people, PDS?</p> <p>  There is acknowledgement that the communication strategy within the services is not working.  Where is the resolution for it?  So many things can easily be resolved.  We have clinicians who do not have offices, clinical rooms or access to assessments.  How are they to provide the service that families feel they require in order to hop over the arbitrary fence into education?  It is hugely difficult.  When the workforce planning was done last year on 11 October  - they will repeat it on 12 October this year, apparently, which is not far off - teams were operating at about 30% less than their capacity.  Most of that is unfilled posts but a number of those posts are to do with the gendered policy decision not to replace people going on maternity leave, which has a significant impact in a female-dominated profession.</p><p>It was something that came about during the austerity years and it absolutely has to be addressed.  Not only is it an issue for those who are not on leave having to deal with the increased workload; it also makes it very unattractive for women to want to come to work in these services.  The HSE's implementation of this plan from the Government is to reassign people.  If a children's disability network team is operating at 70% capacity and the HSE wants to reassign some of those people to provide a service in a special school, it means children on the list who are not attending at primary school will have fewer people to work with them.  It needs leadership from the HSE which is just absent at the moment.  It is causing so many systemic issues that have now rolled into such a multitude that it is seen as an Everest that somehow cannot be fixed.  It is infinitely fixable if there is leadership and investment.  Certainly we see that from the discussions with our members.</p></speech>

On the medicalised model, there is general acceptance now almost 20 years after the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, EPSEN, that the medicalised model is not the way to go.  The TUI has had discussions with the Department of Education, the National Council for Special Education and quite a number of the disability rights groups.  Indeed, we have made submissions to the Oireachtas committee on education about what might be an alternative way forward, where we do not end up putting impossible responsibilities on schools or creating an expectation by parents that schools can do something they are not legally mandated, able or resourced to do, that could provide a better model that does work.</p> <p>  My colleagues have more than adequately covered the school inclusion model.  We simply do not know what the report on the model says.  We look forward to seeing it.  We have asked to see it and await it.  On what was said about occupational therapists, OTs, speech and language therapists, SLTs, and so on working directly with students as well as a trickle-down or cascade model, we would strongly argue and have argued that the same should apply to the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, programme.  Students need one-to-one support from NEPS.  Trickle-down or cascade has an element of validity about it but it needs to be much broader than that.</p> <p>  I may well have taken up my F&oacute;rsa colleagues wrongly and my apologies if I have.  I would just say on the reference to R&eacute;alt and to ETBs, which is generally working very well, I have a fear it is not just about ETB or DEIS schools in the context of support for special needs, it has to be all schools.  There has always been a little bit of a fear, particularly in the ETB area and among DEIS schools that they are the first to try anything.  It needs to be much broader.</p> <p>  In response to the Deputy's original question about what we can do, as Deputy Carroll MacNeill has said it is such a broad thing to deal with here in respect of autism.  If I could boil it down to three particular areas where we could make things better, and of course I am leaving out a lot of other important areas, one is prompt access to assessments and, second, is planning for places years ahead of when we need them.  We cannot plan that exactly so of course there is going to be a little bit of flux.  However, we have a pretty good idea years ahead of time, particularly for post-primary as to where we are going to need those services.  There also needs to be prompt access to in-school and out-of-school supports for students, families and schools.  All three of those things have to be done, at least in the initial stages, at a national level.  The individual school cannot fix that.</p></speech>

I thank all our guests for being with us this morning.  It has been a very interesting discussion so far.  I want to come back to school places.  All the witnesses have mentioned forward planning.  I am from the lovely county of Kildare and school places are a big issue for us there, including for special places.  Every time I have met the Department and the recent Ministers, they talk about principals providing the information on school places and what is needed.  Who should be providing the information for school places?  I believe it is the Department.  They are the ones looking at this.  They know where the buildings are going and so on.</p><p>They and the NCSE have information.  However, it seems that much of the emphasis comes back on the principals and schools to provide that information.  Perhaps I could get a comment on that.  It is huge issue in places such as Kildare.</p><p> On transfer teams, I received two phone calls this morning on this, where parents were asked to transfer teams.  Ms Kelly is 100% right that it is putting much stress on parents and their children.  It is just unacceptable.  I think it was in appendix 4 that she submitted to us where she wrote about recruitment and retention and mentioned that this is fixable.  We have nine months to get a report together.  Can she give us some information on how she and the 30,000 people she represents would fix it in order that we can include something like that in our report?  As I said, unfortunately, we have nine months.  I repeat this and I said it to our previous guests as well - our remit is specifically in relation to autistic persons and young people.  If Ms Kelly has some answers, we would love to know them.  Perhaps she can expand on how we can help the retention and recruitment crisis that her union is facing at the moment. </p><p> On the SNAs, I wish to put on the record - I am sure all colleagues will agree - that SNAs do tremendous work.  Mr. Pike spoke about a school nursing service.  Perhaps he could expand on that.  I also want to hit on July provision.  It is huge for us as a committee.  As I said, we have a nine-month remit and it is huge for parents and routine for their families.  Where do the SNAs fit into July provision?  Mr. Pike mentioned money.  I know it is not all about money and I appreciate the great job that teachers do.  However, there seems to be a discrepancy between what a professional teacher may get and what an SNA gets.  Highlighting that is important as well.</p><p> I have two more quick questions.  Mr. Duffy mentioned expanding the Disability Access Route to Education, DARE, scheme.  I have many second level autistic students who want to go to third level and get involved in employment and apprenticeships perhaps at a different level as well.  What does Mr. Duffy believe the expansion should be and how can our committee feed into that?</p><p> Other colleagues mentioned the school inclusion model.  I am delighted to hear it is in Kildare.  I would like to see the report on it as well, because we are getting very little feedback on the ground as public representatives, in fairness.</p><p> Those are my questions to start with.  I might come in later on with some more.</p></speech>

The Department is not in a position to do that.  From Marlborough Street or Athlone, it will just not be able to reach out and do that.  That is one of the things we always thought the NCSE was set up to do.</p> <p>  On the school nursing service, this was part of the original plan for the school inclusion model, that one stream of activity would be the creation of a pool of nursing and other healthcare resources that would be available to schools in mainstream and special classes to assist with meeting complex medical needs.  This is a problem that restricts access to schools for many students.  Just to think about autistic students, quite a high proportion of them have autism and something else that is an additional care need.  Therefore, it is relevant to them.  The theory was that the Department of Education and the Department of Health would together be able to provide teams of staff that could go into schools.  They would be able to assist with the provision of clinical care and treatment, say, for students with diabetes or epilepsy, students needing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, PEG, feeding, and a range of other conditions.  They would also assist with the training of staff.  As Ms Quinn knows full well, in the special school sector, staff are trained up.  However, if a student who is epileptic or has unstable diabetes is to enter a mainstream class, the staff find it very challenging to meet those healthcare needs.  That was the theory.  We have not seen any progress on delivering that, even within the 75 schools in the catchment area of the school inclusion model.  It is something that would solve a lot of problems for autistic students and students with additional care needs in mainstream, were it to happen.</p><p> Back to our old friend, July provision, there is a difference in rates between teachers and SNAs.  It is not so much of a problem where a school is providing a programme directly because existing staff are paid their existing rate, and there is no argument there.  However, where there are no on-site programmes available for a family, there is the option then of home provision.  That is where there is a huge difference in rate, depending on if a person has a Teaching Council registration number or not.  If not, that person is paid at the SNA substitute rate, which is very low.  It barely covers the cost of travel and no travel expenses are provided.  People are paid in November and sometimes the payments have been delayed to December.  It is not an attractive option.  However, there is a real need there.  As other members have indicated, the spread of July provision is very patchy.  Where there is not a programme in a locality, there is the option, as a parent, to have someone through the home provision scheme.  However, it is very difficult to persuade SNAs to participate in that because they know they are paid about 40% of the rate a teacher gets for doing the same job.</p><p> I will hand over to Ms Kelly for the other questions, if she has anything to add.</p></speech>

There is a document from 2015 that is referenced in the appendix that looks at safe staffing numbers.  The HSE has told us it has set that aside.  It has not provided any sort of alternative to that or given any indication it is going to look to establish an alternative to that.  Looking at things in terms of a systemic failure and sustaining this into the future, how is that to be done if there is no plan for how many staff are needed?  It is one of the basic cornerstones that we need within the health service.  A recommendation from this committee that there be clear workforce planning guides would be powerful.</p> <p>  That is, for us, tied into the lack of a chief health and social care professional, HSCP, within the Department of Health, even though there have been political commitments left, right and centre.  Our friend, Robert Watt, was at the health committee last week saying it was going to be implemented.  I will believe it when I see it and it is actually in place.  That is a key strategic piece.  If we do not want to be here in five or six years&rsquo; time again, we need to have those pieces squared away.</p> <p>  On more immediate solutions that can be found, what we have at the moment within the HSE is an industrial relations process around a career pathway review for health and social care professionals that is 20 years overdue.  The HSE is implementing it in one section, in primary care, but not implementing it in others.  What we have then, in effect, is different streams of the HSE competing against each other for health and social care professional staff, because people are leaving disability services to go to primary care where they have more options for promotion and progression within their chosen profession.  That can be easily remedied.  We know the details of that process and it can be implemented in disability services.  It would demonstrate symbolically to staff that they are valued and are wanted to be retained.</p> <p>  One of the concerning pieces is that, anecdotally, what we are hearing from people on the ground is that they are actually leaving without another job to go to because they are so unhappy with what is happening.  Imagine that.  We have a scenario where health and social care professionals are leaving disability networks and are not going into any other employment because they have been so damaged by what is happening there.  We need a person who is responsible for this change management process, who has a budget to implement it and who can address things like the lack of offices, lack of assessment and funding for people around continuing professional development, CPD.  In the main, most of the people working in this, even though they are not deemed a clinical specialist, are in reality operating at that level.  We need to reflect that in what we provide for them.  Most of the detail of that is outlined in the submission, but I am happy to write in and provide further detail on that if required.</p></speech>

On school places, I would agree entirely with my F&oacute;rsa colleagues.  The NCSE has detailed information on students who are receiving support through the education system.  I would have imagined it would have the data that would be most applicable in that context.</p> <p>  School places also raise the question about buildings.  If we can plan in advance, we will not be in a situation, as we seem to find ourselves frequently at the end of the summer period, of trying to find or create school places where I would have thought we would have known a significant period of time beforehand.</p><p>What ends up happening then, with the best of intentions by everybody, is the special class gets created in a prefab out in the car park.  With all due respect to people trying to solve the difficulties at short notice, I am not sure what message it sends to the students that they are the ones in the prefab.  I would have thought the special class should be genuinely integrated with the whole school body, and a prefab in the car park does not necessarily say that.</p><p> I thank the Senator for his comments and question on the DARE scheme.  It needs some additional funding - not a huge amount, but some - and it needs some additional staffing so it can provide further supports to students before they enter college.  There also need to be additional supports after students have entered college so they can deal with what is quite a significant transition for any student, whether they have autism or not.  It requires support for the access offices, the disability offices and additional support for counselling services in schools for any student who needs to access them, not just any one particular group.  All students should be able to access them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.189" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;iric Clerkin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022100400002#FF00200"><p>The question was asked about who has the information and when it becomes available.  The Department has regional data but as to who has the information, on a local level it is the school.  When does it have it?  It has it as a result of its admissions week.  That is happening eight or nine months at most before the children are due to start school.  Again, the admissions process is robust, fair and good but it is not working for children with complex needs and we need to look at that.  It is a fix that can be resolved.</p> <p>  My school is in Dublin 15 where there was pressure on school places for a long number of years.  The problem is leadership at a regional level where there is pressure on school places through oversubscription of schools.  The way to resolve that issue, which again is very resolvable, is shared enrolment policies.  However, to make that work is getting more complex.  In many of the local areas, schools now have different patron bodies.  I have spoken to many of the patron bodies about this and there is a willingness to work together, but what is required is leadership at local level.  I suggest that leadership needs to come through the system such as through the inspectorate or a body like that, where schools are brought together to address some of the issues of concern where there might be oversubscription.  When schools work together, which I have seen in my own area, it can be ensured every child gets access to school at the most appropriate age.</p> <p>  To make the system really work well for children so they have access to a local school at an appropriate age, which is what we all want to see, we need to work together and find better ways to do so into the future.  This is especially so when we know that, in areas where there is pressure, we need to implement policies such as shared admissions policies.  However, we need somebody to bring that together and to steer that between the different schools because each of the schools is an independent body.  There is a willingness to do that but it is about helping them get over some of the barriers to it.</p> <p>  I return to the point that the admissions process does not work for children with complex needs.  Assessing eight to nine months in advance of a child starting school will not work and we will continue to face these problems in the future where we have section 37, which is reactionary, and we will never give those children the opportunity to attend their local school with their brothers and sisters unless we correct that.</p></speech>

It needs to be early in the school year and to be a very clear timeframe.  Under that timeframe should be clear guidelines as to what the school is expected to do to prepare for each section.  For example, one of my colleagues mentioned that some of the children in a special school may need to be PEG-fed.  If they are doing the July provision, we cannot just have anybody doing that.  Thus, the school leader needs to have the timeframe, know when he or she is to have the people in place, and all of those things.  CPD may be needed because sometimes young teachers or teachers in the final years of the their training may join in, so there must be some kind of training.</p><p> One of the things we did not mention regarding the July provision is a board of management must satisfy itself about health and safety in the school.  In many cases, the few weeks you have in the two summer months are the only time a board of management might have to do building work and so sometimes the health and safety impact of building work going on on the school affects the July provision as well.</p><p> If we really worked on this, you would find that there will be teams of people on staff who will become the July provision people, including both SNAs and teachers.  Mr. Pike has already mentioned the issue with payment.  The difference in payment is one element and the late payment is something that has been a huge issue for years.</p><p> One of the things that happened in the last year, which was very welcome in many schools, was that through discussion with the Department, a school could decide whether they would do the July provision, or summer provision as it is now called, in July or August.  In our own case, last year we were taking in quite a few new children or children whose emerging needs had just been identified.  We chose to have the programme in August because we felt we should take the children back a few weeks before they were due to come back and have them well settled in this big place they call school before it was necessary.  This year we took a different decision and had it in July because we did not have the other need, so there are all sorts of areas where schools themselves can make local decisions but if the overall framework is there and is clear, then we would go a long way down the road to ensuring it happens in many more schools.</p></speech>

In a way I feel I have a foot in both camps as I was a teacher for a number of years.  I agree with our guests that schools are very busy places.  We all like to think sometimes that our lives are the busy ones, and indeed they are, but lots of others have busy lives too.  The truth is when teachers get to their summer holidays they are looking forward to it, just like ourselves, and it is the same with principals.  July provision is not for everybody.  It is for some teachers but not for others.  In this committee we hear the heartfelt pleas from parents.  We have sat here and listened to some of the stories.  Our guests know as they are involved in this area, and we know from talking to our constituents, how much parents want to see that next year, July provision is in place in schools.  They are asking us to do something about it.  In that context, I have a few questions, thoughts and ideas.</p> <p>  I hear some of the points our guests have made.  They have talked about timely engagement and again that is something we can push for from here.  That means timely planning but also timely payment.  Again, that is something we can push for from here.  Ms Quinn mentioned CPD roll-out.  Are those courses in place?  Does the Department need to do anything in the next three, six or nine months to try to ensure the specific type of courses that would be useful to teachers and SNAs could be put in place?  Ms Howard spoke about making it attractive and Deputy Carroll MacNeill asked was that about money.  Of course it is about money, as well as the fact people are working in a system that works well.  Something being attractive is partly about money and partly about the system.</p><p>No one has to apologise for that.</p><p> My questions to the groups will be from that perspective.  As unions, do they have a proactive role in informing teachers or encouraging them to participate in working with ETBs or schools?  Is there anything more that the unions could do proactively this year so that we would have a better system of July provision next summer?</p><p> I wish to ask F&oacute;rsa about the barriers for SNAs.  The issue of money was mentioned.  The Teaching Council appeared before us earlier.  Unfortunately, I was not present, but I know that people need to be registered.  Is that an issue and, if so, how should we deal with it?  Mr. Pike discussed the role of ETBs.  While it sounds good, would it work everywhere?</p><p> I wish to ask about those who work in the childcare sector.  We have spoken to a number of representatives.  Many of them indicated their willingness to get involved in July provision.  What are the witnesses' views on this?  It should not just be teachers who are involved in July provision.  There are trainee teachers, SNAs, childcare professionals and OTs.  We can see how well the model in Malta works.  How do principals feel that schools can work within that system?  It is a significant challenge that requires a great deal of planning and is a large responsibility for schools.  What could it be done?  Is there something that the Department could do to facilitate it?</p><p> My final question has to do with what is going around in my head.  What are the witnesses' views on the possibility of putting July provision into a separate system?  Currently, the number of teachers participating is a trickle.  It needs to be greater.  Is there a possibility of a separate system for July provision?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.196" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Howard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022100400002#HH00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for her questions.  The issue of CPD is linked to her query on what the union can do to encourage people to engage in July provision alongside the engagement in working with special classes.  The roll-out of CPD by the Department would be beneficial.  There is a need for something to be devised and rolled out nationally.  At local level, schools are running programmes, sometimes independently, sometimes in the evenings.  When I was teaching, the school that I came from ran a course in the evening that teachers engaged with willingly.  The roll-out of CPD is important.</p> <p>  Connected with that issue, I will refer to the postgraduate qualification in SEN, which many teachers have pursued.  It is a great qualification and the Department should encourage people to pursue it.  It would be most beneficial if the qualification were paid for fully by the Department as the employer, given that all of the benefits of the course go to the school.  At one stage, an allowance was given for those who had achieved the additional qualification in SEN.  It encouraged people to give up their time to pursue the course, but it no longer exists.  It would be great to see it return to schools because the qualification is a significant benefit and resource.</p><p>An allowance is not just about making a financial commitment to people who engage with CPD, particularly at that level.  Pursuing the qualification takes a great deal of time from their families and their lives.  Obviously, the qualification benefits them and their schools, but we should be acknowledging and rewarding those who engage with it.</p><p> Regarding what encouragement we, as a union, can give, we are requesting that the resources that teachers need to do their jobs well, roll out special educational needs programmes within their schools and provide for their students be put in place.  Money was mentioned.  Sometimes, putting resources in place means that people are paid appropriately for their jobs.</p><p> On separating out July provision, consideration could be given to a separate post being created within a school as a subsection.  The connection between the student and the school is important.  The school is the place that the student is familiar with and the environment that the student knows and there is great security in it.  All of the people working on the scheme do not have to be teachers, but if they are familiar to the students who engage with the summer programme, there is great security in that for those students.  There is the possibility of a role being created within the school as a subsection.</p><p> I always have great difficulty with things being designated back to the school to do.  The school is a building and does not amount to an individual.  When something is once again sent back to a school for the school to do, the designation does not identify who in the school will take on that job.  The Deputy knows this, given that she comes from this environment.  Even in the past ten years, the extent to which demands on school personnel have increased has been significant.  The environment within the school has changed greatly.  If this job was designated to an identified person, it would take pressure off school management, including principals and deputy principals, who have done Trojan work.  This is something that could be considered.</p><p> Regarding the roll-out of SEN in schools, I am conscious of the fact that there has been an erosion of middle management roles in schools, including what are now AP1s and AP2s - assistant principals - at post-primary level.  If a school were to have a designated co-ordinator for SEN, it would allow for the co-ordination of all of the resources.  The Deputy spoke about health professionals being engaged to work with students in schools.  I would support the idea of health professionals coming into schools to work with teachers, but I agree that they need to be working with the students and the teachers if their engagement is to be beneficial.  If there is a co-ordinator role in schools, it should not be filled by people who are doing it on a voluntary basis.  It should be rolled out nationally and the same process and supports should be in place for all staff, not just those in individual schools.  Individual schools and ETBs have employed psychologists to do the necessary work on the ground, but that work needs to be done in all schools.  It cannot come down to a geographical lottery where people can only get what they need because they are in schools in particular areas.  All students in all areas should have access.</p><p> I hope I have addressed the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

We are not aware of problems with SNAs working within summer provision programmes.  It has always been the case that, if an SNA wants to work in a school, he or she needs to be Garda vetted.  That will often mitigate against SNAs working in new schools where their Garda vetting certificates have not been issued within the past two years and they need to be vetted again.  Where programmes are put in place at the last minute, as has happened in recent years, there may be a recruitment problem.  There is a recruitment problem in home provision, which we touched on a few minutes ago.</p> <p>  Regarding CPD, an important debate is ongoing about the accreditation of qualifications for SNAs.</p><p>We appeared before the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in June on that very issue.  There is a great deal that the Government could do to ensure that appropriate accredited training is made available to special needs assistants, SNAs, and to ensure its uptake by facilitating release against the obligation to be available for an additional 72 hours each year of non-classroom time.  That time could be used a great deal more for continuing professional development, CPD.</p><p> Looking at the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion for a separate system for July provision, we can think about a safety net service, where entreaties are made to a school to provide a summer provision programme, and it is just not possible in a certain location where the school cannot take it on.  Does the Government have a responsibility to step in and make provision available?  Yes, the Government does.  How can that be done and what levers are there?  There is the National Council for Special Education and there are also the education and training boards, which could be asked, or if necessary instructed, to provide something by way of a summer provision programme.  We have education centres in every county which could be used.  These programmes do not necessarily have to take place on school premises.  It would be better if they did but, as a safety net, there is a great deal more that could be done with a little imagination.</p><p> I would caution against the committee concluding that this is all the fault of staff or schools.  It is not.  We would be in a better position to respond to questions if the invitation to attend had directed us towards this particular issue but it did not.  It is not listed as one of the topics which the committee necessarily want to focus on.  I am a bit concerned that we are in a situation where the Department of Education issues notification very late.  There are always many queries about how to provide a programme.  There are resource problems and we may be moving into the space where the sole issue is what we need to do to ensure teachers and SNAs agree to work on the programmes.  This, if anything, is a failure of Government, rather than a failure of staff or individuals.</p></speech>

It is fair for someone to ask a specific question on the summer provision because it is something that is very important and is a major issue which we want sorted for 2023.  That is probably the reason for such an invitation and, as I say, every member is entitled to ask those questions.</p></speech>

School leaders need whatever support can be given because our job is all about relationships and building those within our school community.  We are there to support our school community and our families and to support children.  The last thing any of us want to do is to see a situation arise whereby a child is not getting the support they need, whether it be during the school year or during the July provision period.  Put quite simply, we have research coming out to show this.  Too much is being asked of our school leaders and there is not enough support for them.  As a result, all of the research will show it is damaging the well-being and health of those school leaders.  What is very frustrating is that most of the time is being spent on non-teaching and non-learning tasks.  Too much time is spent by school leaders on these tasks and we need to find a better way forward to help them to focus on the leading of teaching and learning.  What we are talking about today in regard to July provision is exactly that.  Every school needs access to greater supports as well as the required supports for the administration side of all of these tasks.  Every single one of them is a project in itself.</p> <p>  There are opportunities and the Deputy mentioned CPD.  We have promoted the opportunity to build leadership capacity even in respect of July provision and we have encouraged schools to look at it as an opportunity to give those who are interested in leadership an opportunity to lead that during the July provision period.</p></speech>

Within the framework, the elements would be designed, whether that is the CPD or how one actually schedules what happens during the July provision.  There is a certain onus and accountability from a departmental point of view on what is actually happening.  If one is a new school leader, for example, one very much needs the clarity of having guidelines which tells the person all along the way-----</p></speech>

I am not forgetting, of course, that we have learned through the Covid-19 pandemic period that some of the CPD can be delivered online.  Again, this must be done in a timely fashion and much earlier than the last-minute stuff that has been happening for the past number of years.  That is very important.</p> <p>  I do not believe it is a great idea to separate it from the system.  It has already been mentioned by others that there is a safety net service within the system itself.</p></speech>

By the way, I do not see this as a failure of teachers but of a system that does not work.  If the system is not working, then, perhaps, is it not time to look beyond that?  That is very much the question.</p></speech>

If one was to talk to families, parents and their children, they know that the safety net is probably in the building, or with the people they know, but there has been such a lack of clarity for so many years in this whole area that that is what is causing the problem.  We have only addressed some of them today.</p> <p>  Again, I reiterate that we would have been a great deal better prepared for today had we had a different focus.  There is a great deal of work to do but it has to be done within a framework where everybody is clear about what is expected and that the resourcing is then put in place in a timely manner.</p></speech>

My own experience of talking to colleagues and members on the ground is that they were exhausted.  The planning was not in place and the apology came from the Department in May when we met its representatives on the summer provision. The Department gave reassurances in moving forward that the documentation would go to schools much earlier and reassurances on the roll-out of payment to both the SNAs and the teachers who engaged in the work.  It said that it would also iron out many of the glitches that we had identified as issues at that meeting as we moved forward.  I am not sure that this year is a good yardstick.</p></speech>

That does not suggest that teachers are not or would not be willing or delighted to engage in the work.  It does come down, however, to making it attractive and making teachers feel comfortable, confident, willing and wanting to engage in the work.  To do that, it is about giving people the expertise, the knowledge and the opportunity to do so, where this is secure, safe, well organised and well constructed, and where they are not going in and feeling that they are not on <i>terra firma</i>.  All of the things that have been identified by all of us earlier on in how this is rolled out, moving forward, would give a much bigger or better picture of whether the system is broken to an extent, or is in the process of repair around the summer provision.<br/><br/>It is great that it and the possibilities have been very significantly extended out but we will not know until we get a &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, which is a word I dislike and is overrated, perhaps a more normal academic year which may give us a better indicator of the extent to which it is still broken.</p></speech>

I apologise as I intended to be in here earlier but I had an hour-long meeting which went on for two hours, which was not down to me, I might add.</p><p>I apologise for any repetition.  I assume I am like many other elected representatives in the sense that I am inundated with contacts from parents of kids with autism who are looking for services - everything from early learning through to primary, secondary and beyond.  We all know the issue we had with the insufficient number of places in secondary schools.  Everybody asked how it had not been planned for, in the sense that the numbers are known in advance for kids going to secondary level.  We have had an increase in the number of units.</p><p> Before I continue, I should say my son falls into this bracket.  He went to St. Joseph's National School in Muirhevnamor in Dundalk.  I do not think he could have had a better educational experience without his resource teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs.  That is not to say there were not difficulties, and that he did not create his own difficulties, because that can happen.  He is now in &Oacute; Fiaich College in Dundalk.  In fairness, the teachers, his SNA and the school are all doing their piece from the point of view of giving him the best educational outcome.  We will see where it goes.  It is a journey.</p><p> Many parents have made the point that even where they have had places in primary school - some parents say that their kids are not necessarily in Turlough's place - that they need a separate unit, where they may have higher needs and other issues.  They are disappointed that they do not have choice when it comes to secondary school.  In some cases there is anger at certain schools that do not have provision.  That is a very simple argument.  It is a question of what needs to happen.  What are the resources across the board that must be put in place so that we can offer what we need to offer?  I accept we cannot wave a magic wand and produce what we need, but if the witnesses could give us the answer in the next five minutes it would be very worthwhile.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.218" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022100400002#MM00200"><p>We have an extensive range of recommendations that all of the organisations have made and I am sure the committee will review them.  If I can, I will boil it down to three things.  There is an element of making it a little bit simplistic, but there are three key areas that would answer the questions addressed by the Deputy.  The first is prompt assessments.  The second is planning for school places years ahead of when they are required.  It should be easier to do in the post-primary and further education, FE, area because, in fairness to our primary colleagues, there is clearly a much longer lead-in time.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the Department of Education have a significant amount of data, so it is hard to see why it cannot be done significantly ahead of when it is required.</p> <p>  The third element is the provision and expansion of in-school supports and out-of-school supports.  I know the committee has a tight timeline to write its report.  We have covered the July provision extensively this morning and as my Irish Primary Principals' Network, IPPN, colleagues have rightly said, August provision as well, in terms of summer provision.  That is a very important issue, but I respectfully request that the committee would also look at how we support autistic children for the rest of the year because that is also very important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.219" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Howard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022100400002#MM00300"><p>One point that I would like to add is that in terms of allocations of time back to school and the use of the allocation, one step that would be hugely important in making the transition from primary to post-primary school is that an amount of time would be allocated to schools for engagement.  My colleague referenced earlier the communication between schools within a geographic area.  Some very important work that many post-primary schools are doing is that they are visiting primary schools so that they get the backstory.  They are making those connections and getting the information, so by the time the student comes into the post-primary sector the school has a very good and very clear picture.  That is an essential piece of work that should be included and embedded in the use of the allocated time.</p><p>As my colleague, Mr. Duffy says, the NCSE lists of primary schools should be a clear flag and indicator to the post-primary sector of how many places are and will be required down the line.  It is not a speeding train.  It is there on paper, and it is available.  It is about planning, which is key.</p></speech>

Good ideas are propagated from time to time but none of them are delivered across the school sector.  I will not go back over the school inclusion issue, but it is a shame that when the sector was gearing up for a new approach it did not happen and we do not know what the future holds.</p> <p>  In our submission we go through some of the problems that schools will face in managing SNA supports to autistic students because we were transitioning from a system whereby an SNA was assigned to a specific student to a system that we thought would develop something along the lines of a national service where SNAs would be available in most if not all schools on a permanent basis.  Again, that project is up in the air.  Moving away from a scheme towards a service which students with additional needs such as autism would be entitled to is the right path to take.  It should not be a lottery or depend on an application.  It should be a case of assessing need and if the need is there it should be met.  I will hand over to my colleague, Ms Kelly, to see if she has anything to add.</p></speech>

We must have an appropriate admissions process for children with complex special educational needs.  The admissions Act is well intentioned, and it works for the vast majority of children.  It is right that the admission is taken in the year that the child is due to start school.  It was not right that children who had moved to an area could never get access to their local school because they were coming in later than those children whose names were put on a list after they were born.  The policy is right, but it does not work for children with complex special educational needs.  A slight adjustment is needed, which is more time.  The simple answer is that we need more time.  Our position is that we need a lead-in time of 24 months.  For children with complex special educational needs, the school needs to be able to take that application 24 months in advance of the child being due to start school.  It does not compromise the admissions policy of the school.  The admissions policy will still be administered the next year, as is the case currently.  In most schools, it is age based so the older children are offered a place.  The school will be 90% sure whether a child would get a place the next year.  The worst-case scenario is that the child is too young and he or she will have to wait another year.  That means the school then has 36 months to prepare.  That is what is needed to get the infrastructure in place.  The point that we are making is that section 37 does not facilitate children to attend their local school with their brothers or sisters.  It is reactionary and it is not fair on those children.  The only way we will be able to address it in the longer term is to amend the admissions Act.</p></speech>

I will only take a moment.  In fairness, Mr. Clerkin has given me the core of what I was asking about.  When parents come in to deal with a particular issue they have a very specific question.  They want their child to be in a unit and the unit says it is full.  The parents want to know why there are not units in school X, Y or Z.  On some level, they give reasons there should be in terms of legislation and whatever else.  I am not saying that is fair, but such issues must come across Mr. Clerkin's desk at some point.  What is his view in that regard?</p></speech>

If we do not make the changes and recommendations now, it will not happen for summer 2023.  I gave the figures earlier, which are that 80% of children in special schools did not get any provision at all.  That is not acceptable.  Whatever we need to be put in place has to be put in place to make sure that this happens.  We have home provision that is advertised.  You have to be over 18 or vetted to do it.  We have seen cases where it was advertised on social media.  Parents are advertising looking for someone to give them that provision for the summer.  I have seen professionals and teachers on social media advertising that they would engage in summer provision and taking two, three, four or five children for a day.  They are not getting individual-based provision, which is what was set out.  That is why there is a strong focus on that today.  It needs to be changed for next year.</p> <p>  I am making a request of the teachers' unions and particularly of the principals' organisation because ultimately, many decisions come to the board of management and principal.  I have seen 2023 school programmes in place for the school year which have, as of two months ago, made the decision not to do summer provision next year.  That is not acceptable.  Should each of the 136-odd special primary schools provide, at a minimum, summer provision in 2023 for the 8,000 children with extremely high needs?  It has to happen.  It was mentioned that we should look at the ETB system, which is a State system with State schools, about providing it at post-primary level but in general, all the schools are State-owned.  Will the witnesses say here today that every school should provide it?  It is up to the State to put resources into the schools but we need schools to be open to doing it.  We need to ascertain what staff can work in it.  We have had evidence and met groups representing ECCE workers with level 6 and 7 education who cannot work in a school-based programme.  </p></speech>

As a result of that, I can point to international research telling us that the health of school leaders is being affected because of that.  We are finding it harder and will find it harder into the future, to recruit and retain school leaders.  They need more support from the system to ensure they can deliver what we ask of them.  While schools of course should do everything in their power to support their students and families, they need to be given adequate support to fulfil that.  More is needed from the system to support the schools in order that they can do that successfully.  I do not believe for one minute that any school does not want to provide this provision but in putting it in place, schools have found it difficult to staff it.</p> <p>  From a leadership point of view, we take our responsibility in this regard seriously and that is why, on our own bat as an organisation, we have put structures in place to support schools and families who want to access these services during the summer.  The last thing I want to see is people using social media to do so.  That is why we use our platform through EducationPosts to support families to access supports during the summer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.231" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1639" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Carrigy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022100400002#PP00100"><p>On the supports being put in place, the reality is some schools do it but the majority do not.  As each school has the same issue in trying to get staff, why are some schools doing it and yet, eight months away from next summer, other schools already have decided not to do it?  It is the vast majority of them.  It is the 8,000 children with the highest need who are getting no provision.  A strong message needs to come from this committee and from the representative bodies that we are neglecting and letting down those families and children if we do not put it in place.  That is our collective responsibility.  I would like to see a strong statement on that for summer 2023.  It is not acceptable that we have a repeat of the last number of years.  Families and children and being let down.  We are highlighting and, particularly through the health services, talking about early intervention.  If we do not give continuous help at a younger age, it will affect children in later life.  I make this point strongly and I seek support from the organisations present for the position that we will do everything in our power to make sure that summer 2023 is different from recent summers.  Parents have gone through Covid, lockdown and difficult times.  We need to put that in place to give support to them.</p></speech>

It is a whole different ball game to encourage our members and make a strong statement when we can say we know the resources will be in place.  Today, we cannot say that.</p></speech>

The vast majority are not, so the same situation holds firm.  We need to open up those eligible to work in it.  I mentioned ECCE.  We have people qualified in ECCE working 38-hour weeks, and then having to sign on for unemployment benefit while we have a perceived shortage of people working in that system.  That needs to be changed.</p></speech>

Up to now, schools are operating under conditions whereby they cannot have teachers working on it without a Teaching Council number.  As has been mentioned, everybody needs to be properly vetted and all that kind of thing.  If such clarity existed at an early stage, I guarantee the Chairman would see a different picture out there.</p></speech>

When you approach a summer programme, you cannot carry your vetting with you.  You need to go back to the Garda, fill in a fresh form and get it done, which can take weeks.  If the circulars come out as late as they did last year, it is a difficult timeframe to get vetting updated.  That is a practical issue but it is to do with the legislation around vetting.  That is within the gift of the Government to do.  It has always been in the gift of the Government to take this seriously.</p> <p>  I am not sure I agree that all schools are State-run schools.  My job in industrial relations would be much easier if they were but it is because they are independent that we are having this conversation.  If you looked at national schools or education systems in other countries, a department of education or government could ensure there is some form of provision in every school.  Our Government cannot do that because of the structure of the school sector.  A safety net could be provided and we would have no difficulty in recommending that SNAs worked in such programmes, should they wish to.  We encourage SNAs to participate in summer provision where their school is able to provide it.  There are real issues about the time of year the Department chooses to notify schools and about supports for schools that have never done it before.  In the 80% of the sector which may not at the moment be considering running a summer programme, I do not know how many of those schools have run a programme before and how many have not but for those that have not, there are many questions to answer.  It is in the gift of the Department to answer them.</p> <p>  Other arms of the State are available to help provide some sort of provision.  ETBs have a statutory responsibility, there are education centres and we have the NCSE.</p><p>If there is a shortfall in any region there are arms of the State, in one form or another, that could help.  It is best done in the same school a student is attending but where that is not possible we entirely accept the Government should be looking at providing something elsewhere.  It is a surprise it has taken this long for that it to happen.</p></speech>

That is a structural issue that can be fixed but it is extremely frustrating for schools and SNAs when you can be vetted to work in one school one day and if you want to work in the school down the road you have to get vetted again.  At the end of the day we are here to make life better for children but a child with special education needs not having access to an SNA, and in this case a substitute SNA, is a structural flaw that has to be fixed and that can be fixed.  It is a practical thing that frustrates schools, school leaders, boards of management and SNAs.</p></speech>

If we are just looking at DEIS schools, for example, that is unfair to them as they are already doing more than their fair share.  I would be nervous around that area.  On the point that schools should do something, as my colleague rightly said earlier, schools are buildings.  There is no problem with the availability of the buildings but there is a problem with the availability of the staff.  For example, our primary school colleagues' schools are still functioning in June and in post-primary level schools the State exams are being run in June.  In August all sets of schools are gearing up for the restart, which increasingly is around about 20 or 23 August, depending on the year.  What you have in June and August is staff in the school doing various types of work, much of it on behalf of the State.  July is when the receptionist, caretaker or school leader etc. go on holidays, as they are legally entitled to do.  There would not be an issue with the availability of buildings but what happens with staff?  July provision cannot happen with just a building.  I would urge caution around stating that schools should do X.  As my colleagues have rightly said, a lot of these issues are national ones that cannot necessarily just be resolved at the local level.</p></speech>

You need to monitor the supports kids are getting because you would hear anecdotal evidence that some of the learning supports are not being received within schools.  The point was made by Ms Kelly about an absence of leadership in the HSE and I totally concur.  At a management level the HSE is failing and those failings are letting down families and children.  If that was in any other business people in those positions would not be in those positions any longer because the company would fail.  The reality is it is children and families that are suffering because of that lack of leadership at that level to make sure we have the professionals in place.  The reality is we do not have sufficient places within our third level system, be it speech and language or occupational therapy, to have qualified people coming out of the system to fill the roles we need.  The witnesses mentioned the workplace plan the HSE had, and I forget the number that is needed, but we do not have sufficient qualified people coming out of the third level system to fill those roles even if everybody coming out of that system was employed by the HSE, and that will not happen because people will go into private practice or go abroad.  There is a leadership issue within the HSE.</p> <p>  The appointment of a chief HSCP officer was mentioned and that is needed.  We need a health ombudsman to rule over issues within the health system because when you put in a complaint it is often the person you are complaining about who answers you.  We have a Garda Ombudsman etc. and we need someone similar in health to allow parents and people to complain about where there are deficiencies within the system.</p><p> On the school inclusion model, I totally concur that we have not seen a report.  We hear anecdotal evidence that it was successful and so on but we need to see that.  It is something that should be rolled out across the country.  You should not take children out of the comforts of their classroom and bring them into a clinical setting for a half-hour session with their parents taking time off work, when that support could be given within the comfortable surrounds of their school.  That is something that needs to be pushed on and rolled out.</p><p> What would F&oacute;rsa think, as a trade union, about the proposal for ECCE staff to work in summer provision?</p></speech>

If schools are going to recruit staff, we would say there should be common conditions of service.  There will be a difference in rates between teachers and SNAs but that is according to established norms.  If other staff are to be eligible to work on school-based programmes, the consultation should have started on that a good while ago.  If that is being suggested as a solution, we will be down to the last minute again.  If our members see other staff coming into their schools to work on summer provision alongside them on higher rates of pay, that will just be a disaster.  What could be done in early years settings outside of schools is a different question.  We would have no objection to the Government exploring that but if you are going to bring other people in to work alongside SNAs, you have to have a common rate of pay.  Otherwise it will become a row that nobody needs.</p></speech>

The child protection designated persons, CPDPs, cannot be overlooked because you are bringing people in to work with children who have complex needs in some cases and less complex needs in others.  There is a fear factor on behalf of people around some of that.</p> <p>  There is a set-up that is not well established in Ireland but is in other jurisdictions, although it is emerging in the health service.  These workers do not even have a grade code, so that will tell you how emergent it is.  There are speech and language therapy assistants, physiotherapy assistants and occupational therapy assistants.  This comes back to the lack of workforce planning and a chief HSCP office.  In other health systems and in other jurisdictions that sort of support system is much better established than it is here.  What happens here is that they exist in pockets around the country and they do not even have their own grade code, so we do not even know how many of them there are globally in the health service system.  There are some synergies between health and education that could be leveraged if there was leadership in both sections, and the committee has heard from this side of the table that there is a deficit on that side at Government level.  Because of that we are not even in the space where you are able to talk about effective synergies and collaborations that, from a family perspective, would make the biggest difference and impact.  As was rightly said, we all have a role to play in how we look at that.</p> <p>  I want to come back in on the Chairman's comment on complaints because it was an interesting one.  We have seen that because the complaints process in health is so ineffective, our children's disability network team managers are highlighting to us that there is an increase in the number of inquiries and complaints into the service, almost going into the thousands.  If that is what you are spending your time doing, how are you planning for and providing services?  Because parents and families rightly have complaints about the quantum of service or access to same, they are submitting those complaints across a range of forums in order to get any sort of response from the HSE centrally.  For clinicians, that often means complaints are going into their regulator.  HSCPs are regulated by CORU in the same way that teachers are regulated by the Teaching Council and so front-line clinicians feel vulnerable to facing fitness to practice complaints, not because of anything to do with their professional practice or their competence but because of systemic failures on the HSE side around the provision and quantum of service.</p><p>We represent people in that process and we can see it.  The Chairman's point is well made that a complaints system that is effective is required.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.244" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Howard" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022100400002#SS00200"><p>The Chairman talked about making the roll-out of provision compulsory at primary level and not at post-primary level.  I would have real reticence about making it compulsory within any sector.  I certainly cannot speak to the primary sector as we do not represent the teachers there.  In the post-primary sector, however, there are already huge demands on principals.  I do not believe there is capacity within their workloads to add to them.  I referenced the need for an appointment to be made within a post-primary setting.  That is separate from a co-ordinator of special educational needs within schools.  That would be a separate role.  It would be run as an entity within the school and then at least then the recruitment process can start much earlier.  As my colleagues have pointed out, if people understand what is available to them, the roll-out of that will become much easier.  An individual will have the energy to drive that and not be caught up in the myriad of other leadership responsibilities that exist within the school.</p> <p>  With regard to the co-ordinator's role within the schools, many schools in the post-primary sector have co-ordinators who do very valuable work.  They are designated as co-ordinators, although no allowance is given for that role.  Whatever alleviation of time they have is the alleviation that comes from the allocation that is rightly applied because they are doing the administrative work regarding the roll-out.  However, they are also the people who need to co-ordinate with the external services.  I am really concerned about this because the services are not always available to them.  I note that even within the system, access to CAMHS and getting appointments with NEPS for students is just incredibly difficult.  Again, this is not a criticism of those organisations or the work they are doing.  However, they are under-resourced and, therefore, we just cannot get them.</p> <p>  I spoke to an excellent co-ordinator in a school recently.  She is so successful in her job because she is giving all of her time and energy to the job, but she loves what she does.  I would be concerned about burnout for people like that.  That is a real struggle for people in schools who work in this area.  One of the things she said was that no SENO was assigned to her school.  She did have access to a SENO who was assigned to another school or range of schools who she could ring if there was an issue she needed addressed.  There was nobody assigned to her school, however, because there was nobody available to do that.  Again, that is not a criticism of the work of SENOs but it is the under-resourcing with which schools are constantly struggling.  When Government says it will roll out the resources and ensure those resources are in place, schools will be thrilled and delighted.  They will welcome that, but they will need to see the evidence of it.  I am sorry, but they will need to see the evidence before they say "Yippee" and that, yes, this is something with which they can all engage and run.</p> <p>  Schools absolutely want what is best for the students of the ground.  They absolutely want what is best for the families because they know, as does the Chairman, that engagement by schools with families is fundamental for all children, but particularly for students with special educational needs.  Schools will welcome this, but they need to know the resources are there.  They will not welcome them until they see them.  We are meant to have access to the other services too but when we go looking, they are just not there.</p></speech>

If they wish to make any additional submissions to the committee, they should please to do so.  We will more than welcome them.  I apologise if there was slight crossover, if that is the right word.  This was not the particular focus of the meeting - it was just what we have heard in recent weeks and we want to change that for 2023.

Indeed, we made a fairly extensive written submission as well as our opening statement.  I will, however, come back to what I think are the three most important areas in provision for students who are autistic throughout the entire year.  It is around having access to prompt assessments, planning for places in advance and the in-school and out-of-school supports being available.  Schools are sometimes expected to do things they were never resourced or trained to do and sometimes do not even have the legislative framework to do.  Those are three very important things at a national level that would support schools in supporting autistic children throughout the year.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.257" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Fenlon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022100400002#E00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss Electric Ireland&rsquo;s role in the electricity market and, more importantly, the impact of the ongoing energy crisis on our customers.  I am executive director of Electric Ireland, which is the retail division of the ESB.  I am joined by two colleagues.  Suzanne Ward is on my right and David Vickers is on my left.</p> <p>  I will focus on three areas.  First, Electric Ireland&rsquo;s role as a supplier in the Irish electricity market; second, I will summarise why electricity prices have increased over the past 18 months, and third, I will detail how Electric Ireland is supporting our customers during these challenging times.  In addition, as requested by the committee, I will briefly cover ESB Group's profitability as set out in our recently published interim results for the half-year to 30 June 2022.</p> <p>  There are approximately 2.2 million residential electricity customers in the Republic of Ireland.  Electric Ireland, as Ireland&rsquo;s largest electricity supplier, has in the region of 1.1 million residential electricity customers and 170,000 residential gas customers.  Electric Ireland also serves the SME and large energy user segments of the market, with an overall market share across the residential and business segments of approximately 40%.</p> <p>  The ESB&rsquo;s generation and supply businesses are required to operate separately so that increased profits from the ESB&rsquo;s generation business cannot be used to offset costs incurred by Electric Ireland.  This means that Electric Ireland must operate in the residential market as an entirely stand-alone supplier, buying electricity and gas from the wholesale market to meet customer demand.</p> <p>  Turning to price increases, the electricity price for customers is made up of wholesale electricity costs, network or infrastructure costs, government policy regarding public service obligation, PSO, charges, VAT and the costs associated with operating as a supplier in the market.  Over the past year, the significant increases in customers&rsquo; bills have been driven by extraordinary and sustained increases in the wholesale price of electricity.  Such increases in Ireland have been driven primarily by unprecedented increases in wholesale gas prices in Britain and across the EU, driven by concerns over European gas supply, made much more acute as a result of the conflict in Ukraine and reduced Russian gas supply.  Wholesale gas forward prices have increased by more than 1,000% over the past 18 months.  This is an unprecedented level of increase.  Two years ago, Electric Ireland&rsquo;s annual wholesale energy costs were in the region of &euro;300 million.  At current market levels, we expect that cost to increase to around &euro;2 billion.</p> <p>  Electric Ireland hedges its wholesale costs to remove uncertainty and to stabilise retail prices for our customers.  We typically begin hedging about 18 to 24 months before delivery, and progressively increase our hedge position over time.  This approach protects our customers from short-term volatility by smoothing out cost movements over time.  In more normal wholesale conditions, this approach would be expected to result in small price adjustments, either increases or decreases, depending on the market movements each year.  In conditions where the wholesale market sustains at extraordinary levels, however, retail prices will eventually trend upwards as hedges expire and suppliers have to buy or hedge future purchases of electricity at prevailing elevated prices.</p><p>Hedging is the reason residential customer prices have increased gradually over a number of iterations rather than in sudden changes that reflect the real-time volatile nature of the wholesale energy market.</p><p> I will now talk about Electric Ireland's pricing and customer protection activities in this difficult period.  Electric Ireland is very aware that these price increases are difficult for customers to absorb.  We are committed to helping our customers during these challenging times.  We have maintained a lower standard variable tariff, SVT, for electricity than almost all competitors across the past 18 months.  We continue to offer enduring discounts for all existing customers.  Electric Ireland engages with any residential customers who have difficulty paying their bills and, where required, works with them to put in place manageable payment plans.  Disconnections are, and always will be, a last resort.  There is a regulatory moratorium on disconnections for the winter period for vulnerable customers.</p><p> We are also active in providing more specific targeted supports for our most vulnerable customers.  Electric Ireland recently launched another hardship fund of &euro;3 million, similar to the one in place during Covid, which will provide support to Electric Ireland customers who have difficulty paying their bills.  Access and administration of the fund and issuance of energy credits will be managed by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.  A range of products is also available through home electric+ for those with smart meters installed.  Detailed appliance insights, user data, and accurate monthly billing can all help customers to manage their energy consumption.  Electric Ireland is running extensive advertising campaigns profiling the benefits of smart metering to customers.</p><p> Electric Ireland is the designated supplier of last resort for electricity customers and has been instructed by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, to take on the customers of Bright Energy, Iberdrola and, more recently, Panda Power, all of which have exited the market.  This has significant implications for Electric Ireland, not least having to buy additional energy for these customers at current market prices.  However, we will endeavour to make this transition as easy as possible for customers.</p><p> Electric Ireland has always sought to deliver affordable electricity to all customers in Ireland.  The price increases we have had to announce over the past 18 months have been as a direct consequence of the unprecedented increases in international wholesale gas prices.  As we operate as a stand-alone energy supplier in the market, we have no choice but to increase our prices given the quantum of increase in our costs.</p><p> The ESB's generation and supply businesses are required to operate separately, so increased profits from the ESB's generation business cannot be used to offset costs incurred by Electric Ireland.  However, group profits are invested in critical networks, renewable generation and other important energy infrastructure, as well as used to pay tax and dividends to the Government.  Electric Ireland will continue to work with customers who are most challenged by these increases.</p><p> I will move on to the additional question on ESB Group profits.  I can talk about the published ESB Group financial results, however I am not in a position to discuss specific generation or network issues, other than as published or in the public domain.  The most accurate representation of the ESB's underlying financial performance during the first half of 2022 is the operating profit before exceptional items.  In the first half of 2022 this was &euro;357 million, which compares with an operating profit of &euro;363 million in the first half of 2021.</p><p> The ESB has recorded exceptional gains in the first half of 2022.  These gains relate mainly to the technical accounting treatment of financial instruments, for example, mark to market on commodity hedges, and are not cash-related items.  These non-cash gains are not related to the price paid for electricity by customers.</p><p> The ESB has more than &euro;17 billion in assets and &euro;5.8 billion of debt.  The company must earn an appropriate level of profit, so that it can service debt, reinvest in critical networks, renewable generation and other important energy infrastructure, as well as pay tax and dividends to the Government.  Over the past ten years, the ESB has invested more than &euro;10 billion in energy infrastructure and paid more than &euro;1.2 billion in dividends.</p></speech>

For context, that equates to &euro;2 million per day, or &euro;14 million this week alone, in profits.  During the course of this session, lasting a couple of hours, we are probably talking about profits running into the hundreds of thousands of euro.  Nevertheless, customers' bills are soaring.  Domestic customers have utility bills this month that are skyrocketing; they are doubling and sometimes trebling.  Business consumers and customers with Electric Ireland have bills that are increasing threefold or sometimes fourfold.  These are unprecedented increases in utility prices.  Does Mr. Fenlon accept how difficult it is for these customers to understand or accept that the blow of these prices cannot be cushioned because of technical accounting or because ESB Group is looking at financing future infrastructure?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.265" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Fenlon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022100400002#G00600"><p>We understand that this is a very difficult time for many of our customers who have significant difficulty paying the increased bills.  We are engaging daily with customers who are in difficulty and working with them to help them deal with those increases by putting in place payment plans.  We understand, therefore, that when people hear those profit numbers, they can be difficult to reconcile.  The ESB, as a State-owned company, pays half of its profits back to the State, between a dividend policy of 40% and tax, while the other half funds investment in energy infrastructure, which is critical to delivering not just reliable electricity supply but also the net-zero transition into the future for Ireland.</p> <p>  On the scale of the company, we have &euro;17 billion in assets.  The profit at an operating level is similar to that in the half-year period for last year.  From a competitive point of view, our prices - we have continued to try to offer prices that are as competitive as we can - and our standard variable tariffs have tended to be at the lower end of available prices for the past 18 months.</p> <p>  We understand the difficulty for customers .

Mr. Fenlon referred to a hardship fund of &euro;3 million, approximately 0.8% of the &euro;357 million profit.  Clearly, there is a mechanism for the ESB to do something for consumers, particularly those who are finding it most difficult to pay.  Surely the &euro;3 million figure can be looked at and increased significantly to ease the burden on those who are impacted most by these increasing bills.</p></speech>

We are in the process of recruiting 1,000 people in what is a very competitive marketplace.  Overall, it is important that we have market-based pay for our staff and to attract new talent to the company.  Regarding the specific question, the bonus is impacted by profit but up to a cap so increases in profits do not have any impact.  It is a percentage as opposed to being linked specifically to the profit level.</p></speech>

In north Kildare, constituents of mine tell me that they are cutting down drastically on their electricity use.  Some of them are taking the alarming advice to use dishwashers, washing machines and dryers at night time, about which I am sure every fireman and firewoman in the State would be very anxious.  I also want to ask the witnesses about Electric Ireland's customer outreach and whether as an essential service provider, not just a market provider, they think it is effective.  How does Electric Ireland measure customer reaction to its outreach activities?  Has it had any issues identifying vulnerable customers?  Does its outreach involve collaboration with the HSE regarding how to identify vulnerable customers because there are so many of them who are not registered with their provider?  Has Electric Ireland looked at the possibility of issuing monthly bills?  People on low incomes are telling me that they would find it so much easier if they had monthly bills.  Regarding Electric Ireland's customer outreach on smart meters, I believe that only around 4% of smart meters are being used.  How does Electric Ireland hope to educate people about how smart meters are meant to be used to customers' advantage?</p></speech>

Regarding smart metering and the figure of 4%, more tha 900,000 smart meters have been installed.  Some 400,000 plus Electric Ireland customers have smart meters and more than 70,000 Electric Ireland customers have now moved to a smart tariff of some form or other.  We are promoting this very actively.  We have been reasonably successful in continuing to do that because that is the means by which people can have further control and possibly make further savings on their bills.  If they have a smart meter, we would encourage customers to-----</p></speech>

We are working hard to increase that number and hope to get it up to 100,000 by year end and grow it beyond that.  I might ask Ms Ward to comment on the question about outreach.</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, quite correctly pointed out the disparity between Electric Ireland's profits and its hardship fund.  As a State-owned company that is giving back all the profits to the State in the first place, for reinvestment by the State, it is necessary to highlight that &euro;3 million is a drop in the ocean and consideration should be given to increasing that fund.  That should be done promptly.</p> <p>  I want to know the answers to some technical questions on the overall price of the product Electric Ireland is offering, both gas and electricity.  Has it worked out the impact of the proposal to decouple the gas market from the electricity market and what impact that might have on its customers?</p> <p>  My second question relates to the variable, that is, the standing charge that goes from company to company across gas and electricity.  As we found out recently, these are not determined by the CRU.  They are in fact determined by individual companies.  In that sense, again, as a State-owned company, consideration should be given to standardising that charge, lowering it or eradicating it.  That would show to Irish consumers that, as a State entity, Electric Ireland is only interested in supplying a product, whether it is electricity or gas, with the State in mind.  Of course, profits will be made.  I am not suggesting that the standing charge is the basis for the company's profit; it is not.  On that basis, consideration should be given to it.</p> <p>  Another question relates to the CRU proposal for peak-time rates, that is, charges would be increased from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. and lowered for the rest of the day as a result.  Has Electric Ireland factored in any consideration of that in respect of the consumer price Irish people will have to pay should such a measure be brought in?</p></speech>

That is managed directly with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and MABS.  We will work directly with them to monitor how that fund is being drawn and we will review that as this winter progresses in particular.</p> <p>  As for the standing charge, to put it into context our standing charge is &euro;277 per annum so it is about 15% of the total typical estimated annual bill in terms of the current price from 1 October.  In supplying electricity there is a mixture of fixed costs, including some of the infrastructure costs, as well as costs in running the supply business.  There are also variable costs which is purely the amount consumed.  So there is a mix and there is always a balance between the best way to recover fixed costs versus variable costs.  Our total cost that we recover through customers does not change.  If one goes up, the other will go up by less.   On a combined basis it does not change the amount in terms of the estimated annual bill.  It does vary so if we reduce the standing charge, some customers will benefit for example people with holiday homes which is low usage.  On the other hand other people, who have high volume consumption, particularly families, would pay more if we ended up putting up the unit rate and reducing the standing charge.  There are balancing factors to consider what is the right mix and relative to the market, we have tended to be mid-range as regards of the standing charges that are currently out there in the marketplace.  </p> <p>  I will turn to Mr. Vickers to answer the other two questions.</p></speech>

As he has mentioned, the design of the Irish electricity market is a marginal-based market where all generation assets make their capacity available at price.  The market ranks them cheapest to most expensive and the plant that is needed to meet demand sets the price for everyone.  All suppliers pay it and all generators receive it.  It is common to the design of electricity markets in Europe.  The Deputy asked if I had done an impact assessment on decoupling the market.  I have not.  I have seen these proposals being made.

Would the witnesses agree that the ESB as originally structured was an absolutely perfect model for a society because it did not have a for-profit mandate and it generated, ran and distributed the energy on what some would have perceived as a monopoly basis but it also worked efficiently for this country and returned a huge sum of money to the Exchequer because of its international operations and delivered the cheapest and most reliable energy, probably in the world?</p> <p>  Would the witnesses be in favour of returning to that sort of system, to removing the not-for-profit mandate of the company and returning us back to a nationalised energy system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.333" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Fenlon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022100400002#L01700"><p>I thank the Deputy.  It is not for me to say what is the market structure or legal or regulatory construct in which ESB operates.</p><p>Our job is to operate in the marketplace with the rules and regulations put in place by the Government and the regulator.  On the not-for-profit mandate, that was in the past, I would think.  In the current environment we are investing over &euro;1 billion per annum in critical electricity infrastructure, which is important for maintaining security of supply and connections for renewables.  It is also critically important in delivery of net zero for this country.  The ESB Group needs to borrow on the international bond markets and without generating appropriate cash or a suitable profit being returned, we would not be able to fund that investment.  Of the profit the ESB Group makes, over 50% of that goes back to the State in the form of dividends and taxes; the rest effectively funds investment in infrastructure for the country, which is critical to deliver net zero.  Also, we are in a competitive market and in Electric Ireland, our prices are, have been and will continue to be competitive in that marketplace relative to other suppliers in terms of offering value to our customers.</p></speech>

I suppose it was a bit unfair of me to ask him what his political opinion was, but I guess I am using it as an opportunity to talk about something I am very passionate about, which is nationalising the energy sector to deal with both the climate and the cost-of-living crises; I think it would have that double whammy for us all if we did that.  In the limited constraints of what Electric Ireland actually does deal with, I want to drill down into how we are going to protect the most vulnerable.  The last time we had the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, in, we had a discussion about the definition of vulnerability and we went through that carefully, discussing how there are two sorts of definitions.  Of course, there is the financial vulnerability of a huge cohort of people.  We can see from the figures how many people are already in arrears, never mind coming into the winter and the higher prices.  Will Mr. Fenlon outline for us what can be done, beyond this &euro;3 million fund, which is really a pittance compared to the challenge that people are facing.  What can be done to protect all of those in vulnerable circumstances?  What can Electric Ireland do to alert its customers to the fact that they can register their vulnerability and, therefore, will be guaranteed that they will not be cut off.  My understanding of what CRU told us was that the instructions to Electric Ireland or any other company is that if their customers register their vulnerability, they cannot be cut off, never mind during this limited Christmas period.</p></speech>

We actively engage with the financially vulnerable customers.  We work very closely with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, as Mr. Fenlon outlined earlier.  We also have payment plans in place for about 9,000 customers currently.  With those payment plans, in some cases we put in industrial meters to help the customers manage their consumption and pay their bill.  On the hardship fund, we work very closely with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and MABS to make sure that fund is directed to those financially vulnerable customers.  As Mr. Fenlon said, we are going to continually monitor that fund.  We looked at the fund during the Covid-19 period and we had 4,000 customers that needed to benefit and benefited from that fund at the time.  We will continually monitor it, but we will be putting in payment plans in that to make sure the financially vulnerable customers are actually looked after.  As Mr. Fenlon said, there is also a moratorium on disconnections for vulnerable customers going forward for the winter period.  That is coming into effect shortly.</p></speech>

Dual pricing in the insurance market has been criticised but essentially, Electric Ireland does that.  New customers get a better tariff than existing customers.  Has Electric Ireland considered, as has been widely called for by a range of agencies, putting every consumer on the lowest possible tariff?  I presume it is making a profit on all tariffs or does it have a loss leader?</p></speech>

I missed the first couple of speakers and apologise if I cover similar ground.  I return to the hardship fund, which my colleagues have had questions on.  Mr. Fenlon points to the mitigation measures which are in place for vulnerable customers such as the &euro;3 million hardship fund but separately, he mentions that within the broader regulatory framework, the generation and supply aspects of the ESB must be kept separate.  Does that same regulatory separation apply in terms of profits?  To be clear, in the first half of this year ESB had a profit of &euro;679 million.  I join my colleagues in questioning whether there is a regulatory obstacle to it but after today's contributions and the scepticism around the &euro;3 million figure compared to the broader profits, will Electric Ireland now consider increasing that figure of &euro;3 million?</p> <p>  In July, it was announced that the standing charge would increase by 11.35%.  My colleague Senator Higgins had exchanges with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities last week and was told that the basis for the standing charge was a socialisation cost and that the regulator stated that where homes are connected to the network, there are costs associated with providing those network services to those customers that must be recovered.  Some of those costs exist even when the customers use very little electricity such as in a holiday home or because they have upgraded their home to A-rated status or whatever else.  Perhaps some use solar or photovoltaic, PV, power for their electricity during the day but still require electricity at peak times.  There is a basis for having a standing charge.  It is a socialisation cost, which ensures that everybody pays their way and that customers who can afford to invest in upgrading their homes are not being subsidised by customers who cannot afford to do so.  The increase to the standing charge on your customers' bills does not differentiate nor socialise costs.  Disadvantaged households are facing the same increase.  What is the basis for the increase in the standing charge, in particular with regard to how the regulator describes what such charges should be used for?</p></speech>

I think they were the three areas asked about?</p></speech>

The profit level in Electric Ireland is very modest and for the first six months of this year was practically in line with the same period in 2021.  As for the &euro;3 million fund, a number of people have commented on it and we will keep that under review. It is effectively the second &euro;3 million to be put in place.  It is early days yet but we will review how that is being drawn down and as we progress through this winter.  Mr. Vickers will comment on the standing charges.</p></speech>

Within Electric Ireland's cost structure we have fixed costs and variable costs and our fixed costs are mainly those associated with running the business and accessing the distribution network.  Our variable costs are mainly energy costs these days but there are also variable costs associated with accessing the transmission distribution network and the market.  As mentioned, our bills structure has a fixed component as a standing charge and a variable component which is a unit rate.  When we set our tariffs, we have to look at the overall costs we are trying to recover and then we look at how our competitors are priced because we have to act in a competitive manner.</p><p>As Mr. Fenlon mentioned earlier, our standing charge is about mid-table compared with other suppliers at the moment.  When we increased our price most recently, we did not increase our standing charge.  Perhaps the Senator is referring to our prior price increase, where we increased both the standing charge and the unit rate.  We did that when we assessed the quantum of costs that we were trying to recover.  We decided that it was a better allocation of those costs to put some of it on the standing charge and less of it on the unit rate.  It does not go to generate any extra net revenue for us as a business.  We just felt that it was a more appropriate management of those costs to put some on the standing charge in order that we could lessen the impact we would have to place on the unit rate.  </p></speech>

It would benefit households that have more use.  Therefore a household of four or five people might feel the benefit of that compared with a holiday home or a household with fewer people in it.</p></speech>

With respect, that is a kind of corporate speak.  It is spreading costs but it is actually penalising people who have made an effort to insulate their homes and reduce the cost of electricity because it is putting a higher standing charge on them.

We are told that smart meters are supposed to work to assist us to manage the usage of our electricity to consume a lesser amount of electricity at peak times.  Electric Ireland has already indicated by the increase in the standing charges that it does not see that as hugely important.</p> <p>  Electric Ireland has a sales team, I assume, which will be engaging with people who want to purchase its product.  Does the company incentivise them in a way that would help consumers to reduce their consumption of electricity?  If one of the stated objectives of investing in a smart meter is to help people to reduce their consumption of electricity, should it then follow that Electric Ireland would incentivise its sales team for the amount of electricity that people ultimately save or do not use?  </p></speech>

That is evidenced by the effort we have put in to the promotion of smart metering tariffs and the smart metering tariffs that we have available, which do provide incentives for customers if they can move their load away from the peak time.  We understand not every customer can do that, but we do have alternative offerings available.  For example, one of the tariffs allows a free weekend day on a Saturday or Sunday.  We do have incentives available in the smart metering tariffs for customers to shift the load where they can.  We are happy to work with customers to see what will suit.</p></speech>

I will conclude on this point.  Mr. Fenlon was CFO of the ESB until recently.  He will be aware that the ESB in an auction in 2019 bid a phenomenally low rate to provide capacity.  I think it was about &euro;46 per MW.  After two years, in 2021, the ESB, having won the contract on a very low rate - or a significant amount of what was tendered - put its hands up and said it would not able to deliver.</p></speech>

Does he accept that the failure or whatever decisions were taken then have impacted and added to the potential for blackouts this year on the one hand, and a significant increase in the cost of electricity into the future?

The ESB has responded comprehensively to those queries that were raised in the past and they are on our website.  They were published in January 2022.  The generation business operates in accordance with the rules that are in place.  To cut it short, our website has published documents responding to all of those questions.</p></speech>

Several of my questions related to the standing charge.  I would like to continue with the point Senator Dooley mentioned at the start of his contribution.  It seems to me that the more the Government uses taxpayers' money to put money into reducing the overall use of electricity, the more the ESB is increasing its standing charge and therefore it is not having the desired impact that it needs to have across households.  The poorest in society are the ones who are using the least energy.  Does Mr. Fenlon agree with that?  In general, the smaller households and those with less income probably use less electricity.  They are the ones who are footing the bill when it comes to the standing charge.</p></speech>

As I mentioned, it was not a way to increase profits, it was to reduce the unit rate of electricity, which would benefit households with higher usage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022100400002#Q02000"><p>Over time, we are going to see a reduction in overall use.  That is where all the Government funding is going.  It looks a little bit like the ESB is protecting its base and protecting the profits in the long term by putting more into the standard charge than into the unit rate.  With respect, that is the first point I would make.</p><p>Our guests mentioned the ESB&rsquo;s competitors a few times and responding to what they are charging for standing costs versus unit costs.  The issue I have is that the competitors are dropping out of the market and, as a result, fewer companies are making decisions as to what the standing charge is.  Representatives of the CRU who appeared before the committee last week stated that they have no control over what companies do with the standing charge.  Is it appropriate that the regulator does not have any control over that, while fewer competitors will be operating in that market and making these decisions for our citizens?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, as the Senator mentioned, three supply companies have exited the market, but we hope there will not be any further exits.  It is in the customer's interests that the supply market flourish, so we hope that will not happen.</p></speech>

We are seeing more and more that it is the most vulnerable who find it most difficult to access information on what is available for them.  Will our guests commit that from today they will contact people and make a greater effort to ensure that everybody who is financially or medically vulnerable will have much more contact with the ESB as to what their rights are, whether they can draw down money from a fund and so on?</p></speech>

How is the network charge element of the ESB's price set?  There has been some controversy about the extent to which network charges should be stable but there seem to have been increases in standing charges and that has caused people considerable concern.</p> <p>  To what extent is the additional &euro;2 billion wholesale energy cost built into the price the ESB is charging customers and how much of it has yet to be seen on bills?</p> <p>  It is disappointing that even the ESB, as the best company, has activated only one in six of the smart meters.  Does the reason for this relate to general data protection regulation, GDPR, restrictions, and have our guests spoken to the Data Protection Commissioner to see whether there are ways in which, during a crisis of this nature, we can get round some of those GDPR restrictions that might be in place?  It is in all of our interests that people have the opportunity not only to reduce their bills but also to switch their electricity use to the time when renewables are on the system.</p> <p>  The ESB is significantly increasing its daytime rate for those who use smart meter charges and the very low rate applies at between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.  It is difficult for consumers to regulate their consumption to have peaks between those hours.  Can it be made a little more user-friendly, perhaps even by changing the times in order that when there is plenty of renewable energy, the company will not charge consumers an excessive rate?  These meters can accommodate dynamic pricing, and it seems that the charges the ESB is publishing might not be very attractive to people.</p></speech>

I will ask Mr. Vickers to answer the question about the increase in wholesale costs to &euro;2 billion and I might ask Ms Ward to comment on the GDPR question.  Network charges are regulated by the CRU.  As one supplier in the market, we basically accept a regulated network charge as approved annually by the CRU and receive it on the same basis as every other supplier in the market.</p> <p>  Regarding the time period from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m., that is one.  We have three different offerings available.  There is one with a peak rate, a shoulder rate and a lower rate off peak, there is one that has that 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. rate and there is one that has free electricity at the weekend on either Saturday or Sunday.  It depends on someone's profile.  The one with the low night rate might suit an e-car use or he or she could charge it at the weekend so it very much depends on individual circumstances.  It is early days when it comes to the roll-out of smart metering.  About 900,000 out of 2 million meters have been installed.  Out of 400,000 of our customers, 70,000 are already on smart tariffs.  This number is increasing on a daily basis.  We will continue to evolve our offerings depending on what we learn from our customers and what does and does not appeal to them but there is a range available there that will suit some customers over others.  </p></speech>

In summary, the gas market is up by 500% while the electricity is up accordingly - about 300%.  Given that as a rule of thumb, electricity makes up about half of a consumer residential bill, that would imply that an adjustment of about 150% was needed in bills to reflect the current electricity market.  If I go back year on year, Electric Ireland has increased its bill by about 100% to 120% if I go back just over a year.  In answer to the question, I believe most of what has happened in the wholesale market has been adjusted for in the last set of price changes by suppliers.  If there are more to come, and it is unclear, it is a direct function of what happens in the wholesale market over the next number of months.</p></speech>

Examples include Bright Energy, Iberdola Ireland and Panda Power.  Given that Electric Ireland is the supplier of last resort, what impact has those companies leaving the market had on the bills of Electric Ireland customers?  What percentage of the cost is it?  Unfortunately, we do not have a nationalised electricity supplier and Electric Ireland is in a competitive market.  Is there not a cost to Electric Ireland consumers caused by those companies leaving the market?</p></speech>

We are doing that for Panda Power and we did it for previous customers.  There is a cost associated with that and we are working with the CRU to understand a framework for compensating Electric Ireland for taking on that cost as its supplier of last resort.  </p></speech>

It is wrong that Electric Ireland will pick up the tab for companies going out of business but it will then pass the cost on to consumers, or else it will be passed on across all electricity customers.  The example I used when CRU was before the committee was that of Iberdrola, a profitable company which is still active, albeit not in the Irish market.  Would the witnesses be in favour of a bond system whereby these companies cannot just walk away and leave Electric Ireland to pick up the flak?</p></speech>

They advise the customer and we work with them to install it, if that is deemed the best option for that customer.

The issue of the standing charge has come up quite a bit.  I ask for a note to be sent to the committee on the calculation of that charge.  I have received feedback, as have colleagues on the committee, regarding people who are extremely apprehensive about having no wriggle room in respect of that charge.  It has increased over the past while, so a briefing note on it would be most welcome.</p> <p>  I will turn to an issue also raised by my colleague, Senator Dooley, namely, that of customers being told to use appliances at off-peak times - we have seen those rates increase over the past while - and what was said about 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. being the hours for the cheapest rates for some of the tariffs Electric Ireland is offering.  That has, for example, implications for multi-unit developments, such as apartment complexes, where everyone is running machines.  We then get complaints regarding noise.  We obviously have to consider more social hours.  However, people who are trying their best to consume less energy, and at the most beneficial times as regards charges, feel snookered right now because they are being told to use energy off peak but off-peak rates are going up at a rate of knots.  I ask for an answer to that.</p> <p>  I note that &euro;3 million has been set aside for the hardship fund.  How many customers does Electric Ireland expect to avail of that?  The company has earmarked that amount.  It would be interesting to hear what its expectation is in that regard.  Equally, on smart meters, I know that Electric Ireland works with many of the charities in the context of pay-as-you-go meters, but sometimes the problem with them is the delay in getting them installed.  How many requests for pay-as-you-go meters are outstanding with Electric Ireland right now?  If I have time, I will come back in later.</p></speech>

To put it into context, I remind the Deputy that the standing charge is approximately 15% of the typical end-user bill.  I will ask my colleague to come in on the complementary &euro;3 million fund and the number of users.</p> <p>  I will have to come back to the Deputy on outstanding requests for pay-as-you-go meters, unless one of my colleagues has the number to hand.  I do not think it is that high but I have not got the exact number to hand.</p> <p>  On off-peak rates, overall rates have gone up but where people have smart meters installed, and more than 900,000 have been installed throughout the country - 400,000 of the customers involved are with us - depending on customers' circumstances, there are a few different options, which we hope will allow many customers to take more control and maybe move to a lower rate where they can.  We understand that is not feasible or practical for people in certain circumstances but we are trying to make different options available for customers so they can avail of that.  We understand circumstances are different in individual cases.</p> <p>  On the number of users of the fund, it is too early to say for this winter coming because it has just started.</p></speech>

The difficulty during Covid was that people were still in receipt of money and, in the vast majority of cases, were still working.  This is a cost-of-living crisis.  People may be working but they do not have enough set aside to cover the cost of energy.  That number may exceed what Electric Ireland earmarked for Covid.</p><p>Mr. Fenlon made a point about individuals being reluctant or maybe unable to move over to a smart meter.  What is Electric Ireland doing for its existing customer base?  This is a problem for all utilities.  A customer who is locked into a traditional tariff does not get a call to say that there is a cheaper rate.  What is Electric Ireland doing to incentivise, encourage and inform its existing customer base, notwithstanding those customers it will inherit from Panda and others that have exited the market?  What is it doing to ensure that those who are already with Electric Ireland know that better tariffs are available to them?</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. Joe Duignan, the regulation and commercial manager for ESB Networks.  We welcome the opportunity to speak to the committee about our central role in facilitating the transition to a net-zero society and achieving the targets set out in the Government's climate action plan.</p><p>This is a time of significant concern for both industrial and domestic customers, with large increases in the cost of electricity and the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, together with concerns about security of supply.  It is more important than ever that Ireland accelerates its climate action response and achieves improved energy security based on a low-carbon energy system.</p><p> I am briefly going to explain ESB Networks&rsquo; role in the electricity sector and then I will cover a few key points on renewable connections.  In our submission we also included a few summary points on the national smart metering programme and our national networks local connections programme.  Both of these programmes are building blocks for the energy transition and the electrification of heat and transport but in the interest of time I do not plan to cover them in this introduction, although I am happy to take any questions on them from members.</p><p> I mention the role of ESB Networks.  ESB Networks plans, builds, maintains and operates the electricity distribution network.  We also build and maintain the electricity transmission network, the planning and operation of which is the responsibility of EirGrid.  Since 1999, these licensed activities have been overseen by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU.  ESB Networks is a ring-fenced part of ESB Group and there is strict regulatory separation between ESB Networks and the areas of ESB Group responsible for generating and selling electricity.  ESB Networks has served all electricity customers for 95 years and we have a proud history of delivery and innovation.  We work every day to deliver electricity safely and reliably to all customers, irrespective of who they buy their electricity from.  We provide a 24-7 emergency response.  During outages in severe weather, our crews work to restore electricity to affected areas as soon as is it is safe to do so.</p><p> We have approximately 2.4 million customers and to give a scale of the network we have: 158,000 km of overhead lines; 27,000 km of underground cables; and 670 high-voltage substations.  Approximately 30,000 new customers connect to the network every year.  The CRU approves the electricity network investment and operation expenditure through five-year contracts called price reviews.  ESB Networks invested &euro;5.3 billion over the past decade and during the period of the price review from 2021 to 2025, which is Price Review 5, we plan to invest &euro;4.4 billion in electricity infrastructure.  Each year our investment programme is delivered through our 3,400 employees and specialist contractors, and is supported by a global supply chain.</p><p> I will move to ESB Networks and climate action.  The electricity distribution system is evolving to become a low-carbon electricity network where 80% of the electricity generated in Ireland will come from renewable sources by 2030.  The electrification of heat, transport and our economy will see citizens and businesses adopting low carbon technologies, including heat pumps, electric vehicles, and microgeneration such as roof top solar.  ESB Networks is at the centre of the transition to a low carbon energy society, and we are proud of our leading role in this transformation.  In fully supporting the Government&rsquo;s climate action plan, ESB Networks has delivered all our lead actions to date and we are supporting the progress and delivery of many other actions.</p><p> I will make some final comments on connecting renewables to the electricity network.  Ireland and ESB Networks have a strong track record in connecting renewables.  Today there are over 5 GW of renewable generation connected to the electricity system.  We expect to have connected 25 new grid-scale renewable wind and solar projects during 2022, increasing the total to 5.4 GW.  A further four battery energy storage projects are also expected to be connected, totalling 80 MW.  The combination of the Government&rsquo;s renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, auctions and the regulated connection process is delivering a strong pipeline of projects each year.  These are essential to ensure a steady drumbeat of projects connecting to the system each year between now and 2030 in order to reach the climate action plan targets.  ESB Networks will continue to work in partnership with generators and all key stakeholders to ensure delivery of these targets.</p><p> Since 2011, electricity network generators have the option to build their grid connections, except for specific works that ESB Networks must carry out, such as work in live electricity substations.  This gives generators control and choice over who builds their grid connection.  When customers choose ESB Networks to connect a generator to the system, we design the minimum technically acceptable connection method.  Our charges are benchmarked and are approved by the CRU.  Costs vary depending on the upgrade works required.  Regulated charging policy requires that the cost of upgrade works to the network is borne by the generator.</p><p> I will finish with some of the recent key achievements in this area.  The year 2022 is likely to be a record year for renewable generation growth, with approximately 700 MW of new renewable generation expected to be connected, bringing the total to 5.4 GW.  We are processing in the region of 90 grid-scale connection projects every year.  These include commercial solar and wind projects, community projects and auto-producers.</p><p>We have also put systems in place to allow for electricity suppliers to settle energy payments for microgeneration electricity exported to the grid.  Over 40,000 microgeneration customers are now registered with ESB Networks and we expect many more to do so over the coming years.  In December 2021, in line with the climate action plan of 2021, CAP 21, we launched the mini-generation pilot for connections of less than 50 kW.  We have since extended this to 650 applications.  Last week, we were very pleased to launch a small-scale generation pilot for connections between 50 kW and 200 kW.</p><p> In summary, there has been very significant progress in the growth and deployment of renewables and the initial stages of the electrification of heating and transport.  The collective challenge now is to build on the very positive progress to date and to achieve the targets in the Government&rsquo;s climate action plan, and beyond that to net zero.  We are happy to take any questions from the committee.</p></speech>

As we have just over an hour left, I will be strict with the time.  I propose, as in the previous session, that five minutes be given to members for back-and-forth engagement with our witnesses.

I will focus on the cost of connections and the speed and flexibility of the organisation in facilitating connection requests.  We have heard from a number of representative groups and community groups that the cost is very expensive by international comparison and prohibitively expensive in some cases for community groups that might be considering projects around renewables.  I note what is in the opening statement but what would the witnesses say in response to that charge?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.477" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nicholas Tarrant" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022100400002#Y00400"><p>Since 2011, customers have had the option of building the connection themselves for their generation connection.  This means that over the last decade or so, customers have had a choice as to where they go.  For renewables connections overall, taking RESS-1 connections as an example, approximately 70% of the connections are being built by the developers themselves.  In that case, they have control over the costs around the main part of their connection.  Then there is a component that we have in our live substations.  The connection charging policy is something the CRU consulted on.  It has gone through a benchmarking exercise and there have been opportunities for developers to comment on this.  Ultimately, the CRU has approved our overall charges.  The Deputy asked specifically about community energy projects.  I will ask Mr. Duignan to talk about that as he is heavily involved in that area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.478" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Duignan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022100400002#Y00500"><p>I will expand on a few points.  There are a number of elements to a grid connection.  There is the grid connection or the electrical connection, which is our portion, but there is also landowner consents, land access and so on.  Sometimes people put it all in one pot.  For the electrical grid connection, as Mr. Tarrant said, the contestability is there.  Customers have been able to elect to do it for the past ten years or more.  The way we do our element is by having what is called "least-cost technically acceptable".  We do a technically acceptable method, which is carried out by our planners and specialists, and there are planning standards that are approved by the regulator for that.  We look for the minimum technically acceptable level.  We are not looking for the Rolls-Royce model here.  We are looking for something that works and is safe for people on the network and other users.  Once we have designed that, there is a charge associated with it.  The regulator's policy is that the generator who drives the work pays for it.  Otherwise, it would have to be socialised across other customers and that is not a decision for networks.  That cost is there.  Our generator standard charges were benchmarked internationally with consultants and the regulator.  They are benchmarked with the UK distribution network operators, DNOs, and they come out favourably.  There is consultation by the regulator on this where the industry can put in its charges and compare.  It is quite a thorough process.</p></speech>

The other issue we hear from industry is around work practices within the organisation that restrict the time of day or year when connections can happen.  Is it to do with when the clocks go forward and back?  Is it during that period?  Can the witnesses speak to that charge?  It seems very strange to me.</p><p>For example, one cannot get work done before 9 o'clock in the morning or in the winter months.  Are these long-standing practices appropriate at this time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.481" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nicholas Tarrant" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022100400002#Z00200"><p>The issue has a couple of dimensions but the most important one is access to the network.  There are restrictions as to when outages can be taken on the transmission network and that depends on the time of year.  At times of high demand on the system one wants to keep as much of the electricity network available to meet the needs of customers at that time.  With a high demand period over the winter one tends to minimise outages, which can have an impact as to when one can connect or do work on the transmission system or even the distribution system.  We view the transmission outage programme as a window over the spring, through the summer and into the autumn.  A huge amount of work is still done during the winter period.  For example, we expect a lot of commissioning activity to take place as we approach the renewable electricity support scheme or RESS 1 auction deadline at the end of next year.</p> <p>  In terms of hours of work and that kind of issue, we operate 24-7 and we have an on-call rota that gets customers back on supply.  We also have network technicians, supervisors, engineering officers and engineers who work every day to connect people to the network.  They do lots of other work around maintenance, new projects and in many other areas.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.483" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022100400002#Z00400"><p>I thank the delegation for their presentation.</p> <p>  I wish to probe the issue of the approved network charges.  Earlier we heard that CRU approved these regulated charges so Electric Ireland plays no role in them.  The network charges have increased so has that been the driver of increased standing charges?  Can the ESB show the network charge on the bills provided to consumers so that they feel there is some element of the increase, which they may have to pay, in terms of the charge for running the network?</p> <p>  Does the ESB think that energy companies can do more to make it easier for consumers to opt for solar energy, smart technology, insulation, sharing platforms or electric vehicles?  Can more be done?  We seem to have reached a moment when customers are under a lot of pressure and companies like the ESB need consumer goodwill to roll out infrastructure worth &euro;4.4 billion.  The ESB has a perfect opportunity to step up to the plate and say, "we are going to help a national energy resilience campaign and help our customers".  If that were done it would result in a win-win situation because people would see the benefits of having more renewables on the system and allowing networks to be built.  We have heard elsewhere that planning objections have been a big drag on the ESB's system.  This is a moment when the ESB could do a very positive thing that would sell the idea of more renewables on the grid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.484" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nicholas Tarrant" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022100400002#Z00500"><p>The Deputy has asked a number of questions.  I shall start by responding to the first question about ensuring network charges and tarriffs appear on bills.</p> <p>  The CRU approves network charges because the ESB is a regulator monopoly notwithstanding the point made about contestable connections for renewable generators.  That goes through a process where our revenue is set every year.  As we collect revenue from the suppliers we do not control what goes on the bills that suppliers issue to customers.  We have a certain charge and I ask Mr. Duginan to comment on the exact quantity, say, for the distribution network that is charged and passed on to customers.</p> <p>  The Deputy made an important point about building infrastructure and the long-term nature of these investments.  Ultimately a company like ours, and the regulatory model for a company like ours, involves investing over decades and then recovering that money through customers' bills.  For example, the distribution network is over 45 years but the transmission network is over 50 years.  The way to minimise the impact on customer bills in the here and now is to recover that money slowly over time in order to recover those investments.</p><p>In the previous session, reference was made to the scale of the network charges.  I ask Mr. Duignan to comment on that and on the wider role we have in the network or the system to do with encouraging decarbonisation.  Perhaps we will come back to that.  Mr. Duignan will comment on the distribution charges.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.486" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Duignan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022100400002#AA00200"><p>There are a few elements to the distribution charges.  As Mr. Tarrant has said, all the charges are approved by the regulator and then we charge them on to suppliers.  How the supplier passes that on is up to them so they can have different bundles and packages and so on.  That is different for them.  With our charges, if we go back one and half years ago before the current situation with the price of electricity, typically the distribution element of the tariff for a customer would be in and around 22% or 23%, or in that ballpark.  It has not moved since in terms of the euro amount.  What has moved is the wholesale price of electricity.  The overall bill has gone up but the distribution element has not.  I would say that this 22% or 23% element has dropped significantly.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the fixed and variable elements.  Again, from a distribution to perspective, our tariff is about one third fixed and two thirds variable.  In other words, one third is a standing charge, on average, across customers, and the other two thirds are variable.  Our actual costs for providing the infrastructure are more fixed than variable.  They are quite low.  In comparison with other European jurisdictions, the trend is to have higher fixed costs for the network element of the bill.  That trend is going up even higher, but ours have been stable now, at about at about 30% or thereabouts, for a while.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.487" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nicholas Tarrant" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022100400002#AA00300"><p>There is an absolutely massive change going on in the industry overall, and that is leaving aside the whole volatility that is having a huge impact on customers at the moment with prices.  The whole journey around electrification and achieving the 80% target out to 2030 is a massive challenge for the entire industry.  If one takes the smart metering programme as an example, in respect of which there has been a great deal of discussion and many questions, ultimately, these are building blocks of infrastructure that will enable customers over time to really get value from their energy providers and will be really crucial.  As well as things like the smart metering programme we also have a climate action plan around creating more flexibility for customers in how they manage their demand.  Ultimately, the long-term role of smart metering will support the electrification of transport with people charging the cars at night time, for example, and will support the Government's target of almost 1 million electric vehicles by the end of the decade.</p> <p>  The challenge now is to keep working as part of a wider society and to drive on with the change of achieving the 80% target and then on to net zero.  We are planning to play a key role in that.  We are launching a customer portal, for example, to give access to customers of their data in the smart meters later this year and into the new year.  We continue to promote micro generation, mini generation, and the continued electrification of transport.</p></speech>

It is safe to say that this area is quite complex.  For customers, it is quite complex.  We had several sessions and we have an understanding of who has responsibility for which area.  Even if one is to look at the climate action framework, several agencies are involved in a lot of those particular areas.  One of those is smart metering.  I believe it is between the ESB and the CRU.  As already indicated, almost 1,000 have smart meters at this stage.  When I asked for details about how many are actually using the tariff, it is actually very low.  Three seems to be an awful long way to go - I believe that 40,000 people are on the best tariff based in the context of their smart meters.  What is being communicated to me is that people are opting to go without the smart meter, and to go another route because they have identified that it is cheaper and particularly for electric vehicle owners, which would be one aspect.  What more can the witnesses do to play their part?  It is pointless having everybody signed up to a smart meter if they are not deriving the benefit from it.</p> <p>  The second point relates to renewables.  The ESB has a key responsibility there.  Do the witnesses feel that they are ready for the scale of the challenge, particularly when it comes to offshore wind?  The target is now 7 GW by 2030.  There is a massive amount of work the ESB needs to do in order to be able to facilitate companies investing here.  Where is the ESB at in that regard, and is it ready for the challenge?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.489" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nicholas Tarrant" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022100400002#BB00100"><p>Smart meters are a fundamental foundation for the climate change that is coming.  We are hoping to hit the target of installing 1 million smart meters this month.  By the end of 2024, the vast majority of customers will be on smart meters.  We are at the early stages of people adopting smart tariffs.  Ultimately, by providing data we expect to see more competitive offerings coming in from suppliers, providing different options to suit people's lifestyles.  We expect it to develop and grow.  This is part of a European and even a global change relating to having data available to customers who can use that to best effect.  I know it is easy to say that at the moment because customers are really suffering out there.  However, over the years ahead it will fundamentally change how customers use electricity and engage with their suppliers and the whole climate transition.  It will be a very important programme.</p> <p>  Regarding our promotion of it, we are doing a lot to highlight the benefits of smart meters for customers.  At the end of the day, we are effectively a neutral party in the system in installing this infrastructure and maintaining it.  There is the benefit of not having estimated bills for customers which has been a major issue for people.  Over time, we will see development in the market regarding charging EVs at night-time, weekends or whenever it might be.  We are committed to playing our part and promoting the increased use of smart meters over the long term, which is fundamental for the electrification of heat and transport.</p> <p>  It is worth summarising briefly the different roles relating to offshore energy generation.  The Government made a decision that the transmission asset owner of the offshore assets is EirGrid.  ESB Networks' role is as the onshore transmission asset owner.  The fundamental issue for us when it comes to offshore energy generation is the scale of the reinforcement work that is needed on the transmission system to enable the achievement of the climate action plan targets.  There is an enormous amount of work to be done on the transmission network in the east coast area where the majority of the first phase of projects will be coming in in the coming years, particularly in the Dublin area.  That is in addition to us developing and investing in the distribution network at the same time.  There is an enormous scale of work.</p> <p>  We are working closely with EirGrid on the early stages of the development of the projects for which it is responsible.  ESB Networks has responsibility for the detailed design and procurement, managing the contractors and managing the projects through the delivery phase.  There are many different strands relating to building up key resources, and going out and procuring contracts in the marketplace.  With so much to be delivered across climate action in general, access to resources will be key in growing the amount of delivery that is possible.  That will be the challenge and ESB Networks is up for that challenge.  We know what is ahead of us and we are committed to doing everything we can to play our role in the growth of offshore wind energy.</p></speech>

I have two questions.  The opening statement referred to demand flexibility.  What actions or measures will ESB Networks take to reduce demand for large energy users such as data centres?  We know that the consumption of energy by data centres increased by 265% between January 2015 and December 2021.  We need to be clear that that burden cannot be carried by households.  I would like to discuss the measures being taken to reduce the consumption by high energy users.</p><p>While I welcome the emphasis on climate transition, this year the <i>Irish Independent</i>reported that the ESB had resumed purchasing coal from the Cerrejon coal mine in Colombia to be burned at Moneypoint.

That is grand.  I outlined the abuses and the pollution on the land and in the air.  I know that the ESB is a member of the Bettercoal initiative, but aside from that, has the ESB implemented any form of due diligence on the supply chain?  I take the advice on who the question may be directed at, but perhaps it is something the witnesses could take back or the committee can write to the company on behalf of the committee to ask the question if it is not relevant to the witnesses today.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, it is not something we can comment on today.</p> <p>  There are probably a couple of dimensions to answering the question on data centres and demand.  I might ask Mr. Duignan to comment on the decision made by the CRU on the policy on connecting data centres and where that is at.  I might come back to the second part of the question, which is what happens in the event of system alerts or emergencies in situations relating to large users and domestic customers.  Mr. Duignan might first take the question on the announcement by the CRU on policy on data centres.</p></speech>

This is something that is managed through EirGrid, with which we work very closely, on a dynamic basis.  If there was a situation where there was a tight system and a need on a planned basis to reduce demand, various steps are gone through including mandating extra-large users to reduce their demand at that time.  There has been ongoing engagement with the extra-large users by both ESB Networks, as the distribution system operator because we have data centres connected to our network, and the same with EirGrid, to reduce demand in those situations.</p></speech>

Does ESB Networks have to pay companies for coming off the system?  I am not sure whether it is ESB Networks or EirGrid, but I believe there is a facility in that regard for a payment to be made to the companies to use their own power generation.</p></speech>

That is perhaps a bit outside of our remit in ESB Networks, but what I was more referring to in my previous answer was a situation where the electricity demand is very tight on a particular day and there could be situations where steps would have to be taken to manage demand in that situation, including requesting or mandating extra-large users to reduce their demand at those times so that we EirGrid could balance supply and demand on that particular occasion, but there are other mechanisms to do with this in the DS3 market and the wholesale market, which I do not know-----</p></speech>

I think my next question does fall into ESB Network's remit.  It relates to us scaling up to the challenge to meet the renewable targets.  It does create a significant opportunity for employment but, equally, we know we have skills shortages across the board and the CRU and EirGrid seem to have problems recruiting people.</p><p>Is it a similar situation for ESB Networks?  Has the company forecast how many people it will need and what skills we need to train people in?  Have the witnesses had the conversations with the relevant Ministers about what they are doing to make sure that we do have those people as they are needed?</p></speech>

I mentioned in my opening statement that we have approximately 3,400 employees.  We have approximately 1,400 network technicians who are out working on the network every day.  We are planning to bring in approximately 90 in total this year into that group alone.  We could be recruiting somewhere in the region of 300 to 400 because we will have a retirement profile as well in the next couple of years.  We have a very active apprenticeship programme, which is crucial for us.  This year we have the highest number of first-year apprentices we have had, which is evident if we look back over the past four to five years.  We have 96 first-year apprentices.  I often call them the lifeblood of the company coming in at that level, but there are many other areas as well where we actively looking to recruit at the moment, including specialist engineers for network planning, for example, project managers and many others.  This is a very important time to grow the staff, but also our contractor base is another key area.  We had a contractor conference in June, where we met our contractors to talk to them about scaling up the delivery for the years ahead.  It is in order that when we are preparing projects at distribution level and jointly with EirGrid for transmission, we have the contractor base externally to both organisations but also our own internal resources.  It is a critical area.  It is a massive opportunity for the country in terms of employment and the skills base.</p></speech>

Are the dots joined up in terms of forecasting what we are going to need and investing in those skills and recruitment?</p></speech>

There is a high level of awareness.  That is fundamental, but ultimately we must convert it into action and get the people we need.  We have spoken to contractors who are looking to expand and bring in people from outside the EU, for example, because of the shortage of skills.  The point about the climate transition is that it is not just Ireland, every country is going through the same thing.  I would say there is a high level of awareness but there is always more that can be done to keep the momentum going so as to have the skills in this country to deliver what is needed.</p></speech>

What are the key things that need to happen given that he says more could be done?</p></speech>

We must continue to have the policy frameworks that do exist in terms of looking at investment for the future.  That is what gives confidence to people to be able to build the resources and to have the investment profile.  There is a very good environment at a policy level for that to happen already.</p></speech>

I compliment the engagement that ESB Networks has with us in the Oireachtas through the company's Oireachtas team, which is very proactive and responsive to queries.  That is appreciated.</p> <p>  In the opening statement it was mentioned that ESB Networks plans, builds, maintains and operates the electricity distribution network.  It was further stated that the system is evolving and it is to become a low-carbon electricity network where 80% of the electricity generated in Ireland will come from renewable sources by 2030.  We have a national target to meet and ESB Networks has a target to meet by 2030 and onward to 2050.  What progress has been made to date, in particular on solar panels?  What are the plans in the short term as well as the long-term strategy?  I have a few others questions but I ask Mr. Tarrant to respond to that question first please.</p></speech>

A total of 51 projects are in distribution and ten of them are with the transmission system operator, TSO, but about 500 MW of that is solar.  The completion of those projects is scheduled for the end of 2023.  The total solar connected at the moment amounts to 153 MW approximately.  As for RESS 2, between wind and solar, there is about 2,000 MW, about 1,500 of which is solar.  These are projects that have come through the connection process, whether ESB Networks or EirGrid, and then through the RESS auction.  By the end of 2025, those projects that have come through that will be connected to the grid.</p><p> Turning to the smaller scale projects, a variety of microgeneration is on rooftops and there is also mini-generation and small-scale.  I might pass to Mr. Duignan to comment on those areas, which are also very important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.517" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Duignan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022100400002#EE00200"><p>There are a few elements.  I might start with microgeneration, which relates to domestic houses and solar power.  There has been significant development in that space in recent years.  Getting a grid connection is a free process and requires a simple application form.  A total of 40,000 customers are now registered with microgeneration.  In the year to date, there has been a 50% increase compared with the total of 2021, so we are seeing a great deal of microgeneration.  If we were to add that to mini-generation, which is up to 50 kW and for which we launched the pilot in December of last year, at the end of the year 50 MW may have been connected over the year in terms of microgeneration and mini-generation, a big increase.  That is as a direct result of national policy, support schemes, Government policy and so on.</p> <p>  In mini-generation, which is the next stage up, we launched a pilot on that around December last year.  The pilot was heavily oversubscribed and, within three or four months, we reopened and extended it and increased the number of applications from 150 to 650, and we are processing them at the moment.  There is great interest in that and there has been considerable take-up.  As recently as last Friday, we launched a new pilot for small-scale generation, the next stage up again.  That will open to the bigger players in terms of capacity.  We can see the momentum-----</p></speech>

This is probably not in the ESB's remit and our guests might or might not be able to go into detail, but in light of recent events such as sabotage or attacks on energy systems and given the ESB is developing networks and protecting its own ones, has it reviewed its security?  I am not asking our guests to go into detail but they might comment on the process in the background.  What kind of security methods are there and have they been improved or reviewed in recent times given what is happening in the world?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.521" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nicholas Tarrant" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022100400002#EE00600"><p>On security overall, there is the physical security but there are also issues such as cybersecurity.  We invest heavily in that area and have been active in it for many years.  In recent years, there have been growing threats at a global level in that regard and we have continued our investment.  With the continued growth in investment in IT systems and in smart networks, that is an area that is going to be of key strategic importance for us.</p> <p>  As for our physical infrastructure, our infrastructure is nationwide and we have tight security in respect of places such as our control centres, our main offices and so on.  Looking at our infrastructure in general, it is not possible, given the length of network I outlined earlier, to have security around all of it.  Nevertheless, we are investing in our physical security and keeping it under review.</p></speech>

It may be EirGrid space but, in regard to the substations, is that the ESB's call for a development or proposals to go to EirGrid if it proposes that a new substation be built, or is that EirGrid coming to the ESB or another provider to say it needs a substation in a given location?  Whose responsibility is it and how does that work?</p></speech>

EirGrid makes the case for a new substation, perhaps to do with low growth, for the transmission network.  It takes it through to a certain stage of development and then it comes across to us for detailed design, procurement and construction, and we own the asset over its lifetime.  Once we come down to distribution level, where there are also substations, that responsibility end to end is with us.</p></speech>

I am wondering whether for offshore there needs to be a connection with a new offshore scheme.  I am not sure whether it is a matter of distribution or transmission, because it could be either.  Whose call is that?</p></speech>

Because EirGrid is going to be the offshore transmission asset owner, that is going to be in the ownership of EirGrid.  There is also going to be a need for new onshore substations as part of the transmission system reinforcement I mentioned earlier.  Those assets will ultimately be owned by ESB Networks as part of that.</p></speech>

By the end of 2024, it hopes to have the vast majority of its customers on smart meters, quite an ambitious target given the volume of customers it has.  Current events will lend themselves to people requesting them, as we saw in our previous session.  What is the ESB doing to ensure that it will happen by 2024?  Will it be at the start of 2024 or by the end of 2024?</p></speech>

We are installing somewhere between 10,000 and 11,000 meters a week at the moment.  Approximately 400 people are employed through contracts for fitting those meters and there is good momentum.  There were some global supply chain impacts early in the summer but they have been resolved.  We hope that, subject to the continuing progress we are making, we will have those smart meters installed by the end of 2024.</p></speech>

It concerns lampposts throughout the country.  Some of them are owned by the ESB, I understand, while others are owned by local authorities.  Do not ask me how or why that happened but that is the case, according to a reply I received to a parliamentary question.  How do we go about getting one of them replaced?  The council will automatically direct queries to the ESB, but I have got responses from the ESB stating that some of the lampposts are owned not by it but by the councils.  How can this conundrum be resolved and can we resolve it at a meeting of this committee?</p></speech>

It was good to hear about the uptake and the fact it is popular.  The cap is 50 kW but it seems there are many businesses, in particular, that would certainly have roof space for solar and a demand for more power.  The scheme, therefore, might not be ideal for them.  Why is the cap 50 kW?</p><p>If you want to install more than 50 kW, the bureaucracy is different and there are different safety requirements, all of which add costs which may be prohibitive for people thinking about putting reasonably large systems on their premises.  Is thought being given to increasing the cap beyond 50 kW?  </p><p> I believe it was said that there had been an increase from 150 to 650 applications.  I suspect that, given the current climate of high energy costs, this will increase exponentially.  Are there plans to connect many more than that because it is still a very small percentage of prospective premises?  We are talking about a cap of probably 20 MW or 30 MW but we could possibly get new capacity to the order of a few hundred megawatts through a scheme of this size.</p><p> There is also the related question of the resources ESB Networks put into processing these applications.  It is one thing to say that so many new connections will be made but, if ESB Networks does not have the resources, it will take a long time.  Given the current surge in interest - I find myself using electrical language such as "surge" and "current" all of the time - are more resources needed to process applications to the mini-generation scheme to get more people onto the network with their new solar installations?  I have other questions on offshore generation but I will come back on those.</p></speech>

As we mentioned, the microgeneration scheme is for rooftop solar installations in the home.  The mini-generation scheme is the next step up.  In recent days, we launched the small-scale generation scheme, which is the next step up again.  We are looking to process applications and to have people with various sizes of generator connected to enable homes and business to develop and generate their own energy.  Mr. Duignan might provide a little bit more detail.</p></speech>

I can address all three questions.  On installations of greater than 50 kW, we launched the pilot scheme, which was for less than 50 kW.  Lessons have been learned from that and there has been engagement and so on and so forth.  We built on that in the small-scale generation scheme, which we launched last Friday and which allows for generation of up to 200 kW.  It is the next level up.  People can still apply for greater capacities under what is called the enduring connection policy.  There is still that route but we looked at how to streamline the process to make it as simple and fast as possible.  It still has to be technically acceptable but we sought to minimise impact and allow it to be done as quickly as possible.  The mini-generation scheme I was talking about was a great success.  It was oversubscribed and full within three or four months.  We doubled it and added more capacity.  We are seeing that.  We still have headroom.  It is still being called a pilot scheme but we are working with the regulator to treat it as business as usual and to increase the scheme.  We do not intend to stop it but to keep going forward with it although it was launched as a pilot.  The small-scale generation scheme for generation of up to 200 kW was just launched on Friday and we have already had feedback from stakeholders we did not engage with.  As an example, Teagasc has come back to tell us that it is a good scheme for poultry or pig farmers as they can make use of their rooftop space.  That will open it up to the next group, the group the Chairman was talking about.  I hope that addresses his question.</p></speech>

Does it make sense to get more people into the mini-generation scheme by increasing the cap to 60 kW, 70 kW or, perhaps, 100 kW?</p></speech>

That is one aspect of it.  There is already a mechanism there with regard to supports.  That is why the pilot scheme was launched in advance.  We have launched the pilot scheme for small-scale generation in advance of the outcome of a consultation process the Department is carrying out with regard to support mechanisms for such generation.  We have launched a pilot ahead of that so lessons will have been learned and can be taken from it.</p><p>From an electrical network perspective, you are talking about trying to connect different capacities onto the system.  They have different impacts on the capacity on the network and require different upgrades.  Splitting into small groups means that the small guys do not have to go through the same issues, challenges and builds as the bigger ones.  That is the idea of subcategorising whereas heretofore a small person would have to apply through the enduring connection policy.  Again, the reason for this is to make the process as simple and streamlined as possible.</p></speech>

The expansion of the mini-generation scheme was based on us looking at how to resource the scheme internally to make sure that we could process the applications and have the confidence to expand it further and make it part of business as usual, in consultation with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and other stakeholders.</p></speech>

We have now opened it up and, to the best of my knowledge, it has not been fully subscribed as of yet.  We have allocated dedicated resources to process applications.  Perhaps Mr. Duignan can comment on exactly how long people are waiting.</p></speech>

The first thing is to look again at the different categories.  The microgeneration scheme, which is that used for rooftop solar, is a free process.  It is called "inform and fit".  The customer just lets us know and can then proceed.  There is no work on our side.  With regard to the mini-generation pilot scheme we launched, there was a lot of upfront engagement with the industry as to the standard of the application form and going back and forth in getting to know it.  There were a lot of lessons learned from that pilot.  We would not see the turnaround times to date as representing business as usual.  We have also changed our model as to how we carry out the studies.  Rather than doing it centrally, we have spread it around the country and look at them locally.  We have changed our structures and streamlined our process as well.  We are looking at a very fast process with regard to carrying out the study and letting the customer know.  We have also built in mechanisms for the customers' benefit.  For example, they can choose to tick a box and do a maximum export capacity, MEC, reduction.  This means that, if their project is going to drive an upgrade, they can tick a box and get fewer megawatts on and not drive that reinforcement.  That brings them on more quickly.  Of course, they can still get the bigger connection if they wish to.  We are now working on a report and engaging with the regulator on the lessons learned thus far.</p></speech>

ESB Networks is thinking about 650 applications now but it may be the case that every second small or medium-sized enterprise in the country will want to do this in the very near future.</p></speech>

What we have seen in respect of microgeneration is that, once national Government policy changed, the increase came.  That is why we are doing the pilot scheme of mini-generation in advance of the support scheme being put in place.  The level of Exchequer funding for support and how that support scheme is run will also impact takeup.  There are several factors but we are gearing up for a very large increase in this space.</p></speech>

I would like to know how a specific issue with microgeneration was resolved.  One of the issues was the question of whether someone who is not buying electricity and who is selling onto the grid pays the standing charges related to running the network and how standing charges are shared between those who have the option to sell onto the grid and to buy from it and those who are captive and have to pay for everything.  How was that resolved in a fair way?</p><p> People will be pleased to know that with the present pressure on supply that ESB Networks is not connecting the new data centres and that data centres will take the slack if there is pressure.  I have questions on the longer-term issue of data centres.  Am I right in thinking that if we tap into our offshore resource that Ireland is a good place to have data centres?  In the short term we may be in difficulties but am I right to say that in the long term it would represent a good use of our offshore resource rather than having to export it or turn it into hydrogen or whatever?  Am I right to say that because data centres are in the emissions trading system they are not counted on our inventory as carbon when it comes to effort sharing obligations under EU rules?  There is great negativity around data centres but I think there needs to be proportion in this debate.  I am interested in hearing how data centres impact on the work done by ESB Networks.    </p></speech>

In terms of the standard charge, approximately one-third of customers' tariffs are paid through the fixed element, which is called the distribution use of system charges, DUoS, and the other two-thirds are fixed.  Consumption will change if someone has microgeneration or with the electrification of heat and transport.  Right now, we are about one-third fixed versus two-thirds variable, which is low by international standards as there is more of a move to fixed in other jurisdiction because the network tariff element of the infrastructure that we provide is a fixed cost predominantly but it is one-third.  Right now, the regulator is running a consultation in the form of a tariff structure review.  The regulator ran a consultation towards the end of last year and is considering that.  There will be more phases to that consultation and then that will decide the optimum solution in terms of the tariff structure so fixed versus variable, etc.  The regulator sets the standing charge.  The regulator as part of its consultation is engaging with lots of stakeholders and we will feed into that.</p></speech>

At a time when one has a drive for customers to use more electricity from the point of view of the electrification of heat and transport and maybe a competing one around more energy efficiency and reducing use the whole shape of tariffs might need to be different.  One can expect that there is a potential for changes in the future.  As Mr. Duginan mentioned, there is a tariff review process but with the direction of the industry there could be further changes along the way but that is a matter for CRU.</p> <p>  On data centres, for ESB Networks, and it is a similar role for EirGrid but I will just talk about ESB Networks, once we get connection applications we are obliged to connect people to the network whether that is a factory, data centre or an individual house but subject to policy.  We did get a direction from the CRU on the connection of data centres that led to the current situation.  If one looks at the future of supply and demand, and the amount of electricity needed for data centres over the next decade, on which there has been a lot of commentary, there is also huge potential for offshore renewable electricity through offshore wind.  Ireland is in a unique position in Europe because of our island nature and offshore assets but it is a matter for the Government to decide the policy regarding the growth of data centres. </p></speech>

EirGrid has a strategy document called Shaping our Electricity Future that outlines different options for developing the transmission system and one option is to site large demands near parts of the network where it is stronger.  The fundamental issue with bringing onshore offshore wind is that there would need to be huge investment onshore to reinforce the existing onshore transmission network as well as bring the projects onshore.  It is a matter for the Government to decide no matter whether it is an industrial policy or a business-related policy for data centres.  Our role in networks, if the Government policy is to connect these projects, is to get them connected and then make sure that we have the infrastructure to meet the demands placed on the network.</p></speech>

Moray East Offshore Wind Farm is incredibly impressive.</p> <p>  It seems to me that the system in this country has been very east coast-leaning throughout its history thus leading to a faster growth of the east coast.  We have pushed infrastructure and responded to demand.  Notwithstanding the current plans, and most of the phase 1 offshore projects are on the east coast, there is a greater opportunity in the long run for renewables on the west coast.  Therefore, we must start planning to reinforce our infrastructure on the west coast side of the country and not view that as a prospect in the distant future.  I believe that development will come on pretty quickly and developers will look to the west, particularly with the advent of floating offshore wind technology.  What role can be played by ESB Networks?  I ask because it was mentioned earlier that the Dublin grid needed to be reinforced.  That is true but we need to plan for west coast infrastructure as well.</p></speech>

We are talking to EirGrid over the last period about in the region of 380 projects with a priority of around 80 projects.  It will depend on which options are chosen around the development of the transmission system.  We are talking about offshore projects but let us consider what happened with onshore projects.  Significant infrastructure was put into onshore wind projects to develop the assets that were growing in the west.  From the south west right up to the west coast there was a huge amount of investment to enable the bringing of that wind on to the system and communities have reaped huge benefits.  The future development of the offshore industry could be on all parts of our offshore area and definitely with the growth of floating as a technology for the future.  Ultimately, the first phase will depend on a continuation of the RESS auctions and then beyond that as the offshore wind industry takes off in this country.  I think that the industry has a fantastic future.</p></speech>

The ESB Networks gave information to the Central Statistics Office saying that 10% of residential homes use less than 1,000 KW per hour, which is below the median of 3,658 KW per hour.  The CSO has said that that is a good metric for looking at the number of vacant and holiday dwellings.  Does Mr. Tarrant share the view of the CSO and think that this is a good way of identifying which households are most likely to be vacant or derelict if they fall below the 1,000 KW per hour usage?</p></speech>

There can be a variety of reasons for low usage by any customer.  It is probably not our role to make a decision or recommendation around what a threshold is for an unoccupied dwelling.  There can be all sorts of reasons, for example, somebody in a household is working remotely and their usage is low because of that or sometimes older people living alone have very low usage, for whatever reasons.  Those are two examples but there could be many reasons for low usage.  Coming back to our role around providing data, it is not our role to make a decision on a cut-off to decide if a property is vacant or not.</p></speech>

Before we commence our engagement with the witnesses, I need to deal with another item, namely, the decision of the committee regarding two EU Commission proposals.  COM(2018)271 is a proposal for a Council recommendation on high-quality early childhood education and care systems and COM(2021)93 is a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council to strengthen the application of the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value between men and women.  Members considered both proposals at a private meeting of the committee on 28 June and have agreed that no further scrutiny is required regarding these proposals.</p></speech>

The witnesses are all very welcome and we thank them, and the Minister in particular, for coming in today.</p> <p>  I ask members to only use the chat function on Microsoft Teams to make us aware of any technical issues or urgent matters.  It should not be used to make general comments or statements during the meeting.  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings.  Members will not be permitted to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting.  I ask any member who is participating via Teams to confirm they are on the grounds of Leinster House before making their comments.</p> <p>  In advance of inviting the witnesses to deliver their opening statements, I remind those participating from the committee room of the longstanding parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p></speech>

After the publication of the final report of the commission of investigation in January of last year, many survivors were disappointed and angered by the treatment of testimony they provided to the confidential committee.  Having gone to the effort of engaging with the confidential committee and reliving what happened to them in institutions, many felt they could not see their own words in the final report.  For many, the commission&rsquo;s report, grounded as it was in the legal approach of a statutory inquiry, felt removed from the profound grief, loss and trauma of their lived experiences.  From my engagement with survivors, I know the hurt that has caused.</p> <p>  As we know, the confidential committee module was created alongside the inquisitorial process to allow those with lived experience of the institutions to provide their accounts as informally as possible.  Although this was envisaged as a way to allow the truth as survivors wanted it told to emerge, I recognise that this has not happened for many.  In June of 2021, following comments attributed to one member of the commission, I indicated the possibility of a review of the testimony offered to the confidential committee.  I have always recognised the importance of these testimonies.  That is why I went to some lengths to secure the audio recordings of these testimonies when originally they were believed to have been deleted.  I believe that a process with the capacity to record, preserve and recognise survivors&rsquo; personal accounts presents the most meaningful opportunity to address the concerns expressed to me.  Such a process can restore choice and agency to survivors.  The accounts will be housed in the national centre for research and remembrance.  This rightly places the lived experience of survivors at the heart of our national archives in a visible and powerful way.</p> <p>  A number of factors have influenced the proposed approach.  First, the core concern expressed to me by survivors is that their lived experiences have not been adequately reflected thus far.  They do not see their words in the commission&rsquo;s report and they feel their voices were ignored.  Second, we must recognise the continuing influence of the legal framework provided by the Oireachtas to facilitate and direct the independent commission&rsquo;s work.  Significant legal complexities would arise in seeking to facilitate an external review of accounts provided privately and in confidence within the robust legal framework of a commission of investigation.  The Government cannot, via a non-statutory process, retrospectively alter or interrogate the independent commission&rsquo;s findings or methodology.  We must be upfront about such complexities.  However, this does not prevent human rights experts or others from conducting further analysis of these matters.  Notably, part 5 of the final report details the sources used by the commission for the express purpose of supporting such work.  Finally, I believe that such a review could not fully respond to the concerns of those who were unhappy with the record of their testimony created by the commission.  It would not change the commission&rsquo;s report and it would completely exclude those who had not had the opportunity to engage with the commission.</p> <p>  The new initiative will focus on respectful recording and acknowledgement of the lived experiences of those who spent time in institutions.  The process will be underpinned by statute and operate on a voluntary basis with the consent of participants.  Those who recounted their experiences to the confidential committee will have the option of permitting the reuse of this testimony and-or offering new or additional oral or written testimony.  If someone does not want to give their testimony again, they can use the existing testimony that has been recorded by the commission, which was recorded orally by the commission&rsquo;s archives.  No one will be asked to recount their experiences again if that is something they do not wish to do.  This process will be overseen by a team with expertise in human rights, trauma and memory, communications and oral history.</p> <p>  In advancing our deliberations, we are consulting with relevant legal and technical experts to develop the initiative in the context of work on the national centre for research and remembrance.</p><p>Most importantly, we will also consult survivors on their views.  The initiative demonstrates the State&rsquo;s willingness to hear about and to formally acknowledge the deeply personal accounts of survivors and I will bring specific proposals to Government for its approval.<br/><br/>In my time as Minister, I have endeavoured to improve the manner in which we communicate the actions we are taking to respond to legacy issues, to survivors and former residents.  As such, I regret the indirect and limited manner in which survivors heard about deliberations on this issue, via a response to a media query.  My preference, and my clear intention, was to update survivors using existing channels, which we do on a regular basis, to ensure that survivors are the first to hear of developments.  To that end, details of this initiative were included in our most recent quarterly update on the action plan, which recently issued to our mailing list.<br/><br/>I have always been clear that the report of the commission is not the end point in our engagement with the legacy of mother and baby institutions.  Last November, I published the Government&rsquo;s action plan, designed to address the needs and concerns of survivors and their families.  Intensive work is under way to deliver on this.<br/><br/>Members of this committee are aware of the significant legislative developments which have taken place this year.  The Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022 was enacted in June.  The information provisions came into operation yesterday.  To update the committee, already 1,898 queries have been received by the website <i>birthinfo.ie</i>, with people inquiring and looking for access to their information.  Similarly, in July, the Institutional Burials Act 2022 was signed into law.  This morning, the Cabinet agreed that the final order establishing the Tuam agency would be agreed.  It has been determined that no environmental impact statement, EIS, is needed in respect of the Tuam site, and that eliminates any potential delay on that ground.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has given approval to the Public Appointments Service, PAS, to appoint a director and that process may begin shortly.<br/><br/>All elements of this work are hugely important, and they are a priority for me and for the Government.  I thank the Chair and members for their attention, and I look forward to answering their questions. </p></speech>

I thank the Minister for his statement.</p> <p>  As the Minsiter can appreciate, much disappointment arose over what was an apparent U-turn.  The fact is that people went in and gave their testimonies to the confidential session within the commission.  The Minister cannot change the content of that report nor would we want him to have the ability to do that, naturally.  However, there is a necessity for a mechanism, because there were individuals who felt they had been reflected in the report, but that it was incorrect and that there were errors in their testimony.  There were also those who felt they misunderstood the process or that it was not clearly outlined to them exactly how the confidential evidence would be treated.  It would appear, with due respect to everybody involved, that the treatment was very legalistic in how it was dealt with, rather than engaging with just how sensitive this was.  People went in and relived the trauma of their youth and their time in these institutions over a considerable period, and they shared that.  </p> <p>  For many, an archive is not sufficient.  It is not an official enough recognition of a process they believe was committed to.  They believe that the Minister gave a commitment to have their independent testimonies reviewed and for a report to be compiled from that.  I would like to hear the Minister to elaborate on that beyond what he said in his opening statement.    </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.586" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022100400002#B00400"><p>What we are seeking to achieve in these proposals is to have the actual words of both those who gave testimony before the confidential committee and other survivors of these institutions on the record and for that to form part of the historical record.  It is not just an archive that we are looking to create here.  This is going to be part of the wider Government response in the centre for research and remembrance, which we hope to base in Se&aacute;n McDermott Street.  It will be designed by experts who have the most knowledgeable approach to oral history and to the communication of sensitive issues such as these, as well as about how the actual words of survivors can be conveyed to the public and how they can stand as part of the historical record and as part of the history of what happened in these institutions.</p> <p>  Senator Seery Kearney rightly says that one of the issues that impacted on survivors was the legalistic approach to the testimony that they gave.  What I want to avoid and what I am seeking to avoid in this proposal is going down that strictly legalistic route again.  I am trying to provide a forum where the literal words of survivors form part of our record.  As the Senator says, 550 people went before the confidential committee and for some of them it was a very traumatic experience.  They set out what happened to them in these institutions.  The only evidence of that on the record are these condensed paragraphs that are in the report.  Sometimes, it is one person&rsquo;s story that has been condensed and sometimes a number of stories have been condensed into one.  I know from survivors who have written to me and who have spoken to me that that is a source of anger and that their own experience is not being expressed here.</p> <p>  We have an opportunity here to get their written transcript or the taped transcript of their testimony through a subject access request.  Then we can allow that to form part of the lived experience initiative; we can do that and allow them to add extra material, or we can let them re-record their own lived experience.  It is also important that this is open to others as well.  Again, we do not want to just narrow this down to the individuals who gave testimony.  There are other people who have come forward following the huge publicity the issue of mother and baby institutions has received over the past two years and who now wish their history to be recorded as part of this as well.  That is why we are taking this approach to not go a legalistic route, as was adopted in the end regarding the testimony given before the confidential committee.  Instead, we are going for this broader route that is informed by oral communications and that is trauma-informed to allow for their words to stand as part of the history.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.587" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1682" speakername="Mary Seery Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022100400002#B00500"><p>I thank the Minister for that.  I would appreciate a slight explanation.  I have had experience in training people for counselling post-genocide in Rwanda and have visited the genocide memorial in Kigali.  It is powerful to hear the lived testimony of people in their own voices as one goes through it.  It is an incredibly moving experience and it brings one into the experience of all that happened.  There is no doubt that if something similar to that will be our outcome here, that we would be a valid memorial and a lesson to future generations in Ireland as well as to our own.  That would be valuable.</p> <p>   I understand we would want to avoid a legal route, because the legalistic approach removes the person-centred testimony that was shared.  However, is that the only reason?  Once the State allows for matters to go on the public record, how is that protected?</p><p>If we are not going to a review because there are legal complexities, why are the same legal complexities not arising in the context of a memorial?  I just want to understand that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.589" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022100400002#C00200"><p>I absolutely take the point the Senator is making.  On the initial point, the Senator has described what I would like to see in terms of the final outcome.  Obviously, as I have made clear, it will be people who have much greater expertise and knowledge in these areas, both in the collection of this material and its subsequent portrayal in the records of a memorial centre, who will make the determinations about how that is best done.</p> <p>  On the Senator's second point, were the Government to take a position to undertake that more legalistic approach that would be seen as a reviewing and a contradicting or rewriting of certain elements, and the confidential committee is just one element of the workings of the commission of investigation, that does become problematic.  It becomes legally difficult in the context of the commission of investigation legislation, which very clearly establishes an independent commission of investigation.  For one part of its workings to be reanalysed or re-critiqued does pose a difficulty.</p> <p>  Following the appearance in Oxford, I am aware that the chair of the commission wrote to this committee and outlined the approach it took to the testimony.  I know the survivors subsequently may have taken issue with the chair's description of how that testimony was treated.  I recognise that.  This is why in the proposal we are looking to bring forward, we are looking to move away from that purely legalistic approach, which has caused very significant upset, and particularly in the terms.  We all recall the phrasing and the design of the executive summary of the commission's report, which again is highly legalistic and was insulting to survivors and may also have obscured some of the more important legal findings that the body of the commission's work actually did reach.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.590" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022100400002#C00300"><p>We are all here today because of the continued refusal of the Minister, this Government and the State to respect basic principles of justice and laws, as the will and preference of survivors in relation to the mother and baby institutions.  At all stages, survivors have been met with paternalism, disregard, disrespect and attempts to undermine their position.</p><p>In June 2021 the Minister announced a plan for an independent expert to examine, through a human rights lens, the testimonies given to the commission.  Why?  It is because the Minister knows, I know, and we all know that the findings of the commission's report were incorrect.  The Minister's decision to do this only came after months of sustained criticism from survivors, human rights experts and researchers, concerning the commission's methodology, treatment of witnesses, inconsistencies, and overall poor quality of the final report and its findings, down to the most basic things such as no evidence of illegal adoptions, things we all know happened.</p><p>There was an overwhelming consensus that the review was necessary to correct the major issues with the final report as the definitive document on the long history of the State and church abuse of children, girls and women in these horrific institutions.  The review remains essential to respect the wishes of survivors, to meet our international human rights obligations, and to inform redress.  It was also around the time of the refusal of the commission members to provide any form of accountability at this committee and the Government's inability to act.  The Government would not extend the commission and would not do anything even though we warned the Minister that this would fall back on the Government as a result, and here we are.</p><p>Despite the fact that in June 2021 the Minister had proposals ready for Cabinet, 14 months later in August this year survivors discovered, via Elaine Loughlin in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, that the Minister had abandoned the plan.  In the words of the Tuam Mother and Baby Home Alliance, the Minister has denied members and those who provided testimony to the confidential committee the opportunity to have those testimonies reviewed by an independent expert with a human rights background, as previously promised.</p><p>The Minister's opening statement says it all.  The Minister has said: &quot;I believe that a process with the capacity to record, preserve and recognise survivors&rsquo; personal accounts presents the most meaningful opportunity to address the concerns expressed to me.&quot;  The Minister has satisfied himself but nobody else in the process: not survivors, not campaigners, and not human rights experts.  Unilaterally, the Minister has decided what is best, has betrayed another commitment, and now is trying to tell the people directly affected that this is the best thing.  The Minister knows that he knows better than them.  I wonder if the Minister understands the arrogance and paternalism of his words today to those people.</p><p>In June 2021 the Minister had a proposal ready for consideration at Cabinet.  More than one year later the Minister decided that &quot;Significant legal complexities would arise in seeking to facilitate an external review of accounts provided privately and in confidence within the robust legal framework of a commission of investigation.&quot;  Why were these legal complexities not discovered before the Minister announced the independent review ?  From his own accounts the Minister had an ill-prepared proposal that gave false hope to a highly vulnerable group of people</p><p>On the Minister's third point he said: &quot;I believe that such a review could not fully respond to the concerns of those who were unhappy with the record of their testimony created by the commission.&quot;  There are two issues here.  In June 2021 a review was an appropriate mechanism to respond to survivors' concerns.  Then in August 2022 it was not.  The Minister is contradicting himself.  Then there is the issue of deciding how to address survivors' concerns and not asking them.  Again, without input from those affected, the Minister is deciding for them.  This is more paternalism.  Does the Minister not see those contradictions and the paternalistic attitude?  I actually do not understand how there is not any kind of shame about these kinds of inconsistencies and the misleading of people.</p><p>Another excuse that the Minister mentions is &quot;The Government cannot, via a non-statutory process, retrospectively alter or interrogate the independent commission&rsquo;s findings or methodology.&quot;  The Minister can interrogate the report via a statutory process so why is he not looking into that?  Is the Department looking into that?</p><p>Reading over all of the documents, the Minister's statements, and the initial announcement in June 2021, I can only come to one of two conclusions.  Either the plan for an independent review was poorly prepared, did not stand up to any form of scrutiny and had to be abandoned, or the plan was opposed by the Minister's Department or another State actor and the Minister was shut down.  Both are plausible from the evidence available to us: the disgraceful treatment of survivors with this &quot;make it up as you go along&quot; approach, or the prevalent ingrained structural forces in Government Departments and State bodies not to provide survivors with justice.  Which is it?</p></speech>

There was no proposal coming to Cabinet in June 2021.  I am not sure, but I am aware there was some newspaper coverage of that.  There was, however, no specific proposal.  Indeed, in July 2021 when we debated the issue in the Houses I spoke about trying to ensure that the testimonies of persons who appeared before the confidential committee were on the public record.  I said explicitly then that I did not know how this was going to be done because we had nothing prepared at that stage.  From my point of view there was not a proposal in June 2021.</p> <p>  On the wider issue, and Deputy Cairns's statement about me ignoring the will and preference of the survivors and acting unilaterally, over the course of my time in this Department I have met a significant number of survivors, through groups and individuals, either online or in the Department here.  A significant number of survivors have also come up to me on the street and at events to identify themselves to me.  They told me that they had been in such and such an institution and had been subject to an illegal birth registration.  They discussed their views on where they see the actions of the Department and my actions as the Minister over the past two years.</p><p>Some were undoubtedly critical.  Others recognised the steps that have been taken.  At the time that the issue came up and the time following the appearance of Professor Daly at the seminar in Oxford, the key issue for survivors who wrote to me was that their words were not being reflected in the historical record.  That is not something I thought; it is what survivors were saying to me in their communications.  They did not feel their experiences were being reflected.  They had gone to the trouble, and through the trauma and upset, of going before the confidential committee and all their input had been boiled down to a short paragraph that, in certain cases, was not just their own story.  It is on that basis I am bringing forward this proposal.</p><p> The steps involved with this proposal are that we will first seek Government approval before a consultation, after which we will come back and provide a legislative basis.  There will be an opportunity for survivors to give their views on what we are trying to achieve.  A memorial centre in the national records is one element of our response.  It is a response to what I heard from survivors.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.593" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2022100400002#D00200"><p>I apologise if the Minister did not say he brought a proposal to Cabinet.  I heard him talking about the issue on the radio so he certainly brought the proposal to the national airwaves.  I spoke on the radio after the Minister and asked what he will do if we have two reports, one of which states there is no evidence of illegal adoption or incarceration, all of the things we know happened, and another report from an independent person who examined the report through a human rights lens, which would likely find there is evidence that all those illegalities and crimes occurred in those institutions.  Everybody knows those things happened anyway.  I believe the Minister went on the radio that day in good faith because he thought there should be an independent review because, like all of us, he recognises that need.  The Minister said that key to changing his mind was his engagement with survivors who told him their main issue is that their experiences are not recognised enough, which can be addressed through the national archives, or another means.  This is the committee for the Department and the members of this committee can tell the Minister that is not the only concern people have.  They also want justice.  The findings of those reports being so fundamentally flawed has a profound impact outside of experiences not being documented.  That is important but there are also issues in respect of redress.  It is not fair to just pick one issue that was important to people and scrap the plan to provide them with justice and acknowledge that what they went through was horrific.  That is what is missing.  The Minister is unilaterally deciding what is best because of some engagements he had.  What about what the committee has to say about the issue?  We have spent a lot of time engaging with people about this particular issue.  It is not fair.</p> <p>  I do not mean to trivialise the situation by explaining this but if the situations that occurred in mother and baby homes now happened in a home or another State-run institution, the normal processes of justice and laws would pertain.  There would be accountability, justice and all of those things that have always been denied to people who were in those institutions.  This whole process, which has gone on for the past two years, has been a longwinded way of doing that again.  People, including the Minister, wanted an independent review.  He knows it was for reasons other than just recognising the experiences of survivors.  Of course, that is an important part of justice.  Will the Minister at least acknowledge that he understood it was about more than that?  Perhaps his mind has changed because other State actors have shut down his proposals.  We need to know what is happening because this is just another chapter in a very long tale of denying people basic and fundamental principles of justice in this democratic country.</p></speech>

We have sought to address the specific things they want to see done.  I have spoken already about information and tracing, which has been delivered by the Government.  I have also spoken about the Institutional Burials Act, which has been delivered by the Government.  The final draft of the redress scheme will be brought to the Cabinet shortly.  Speaking superficially to redress and the point the Deputy made in that regard, the Government has been clear that its redress proposals are not fixed on the commission's suggestions.  The Government's response to redress was much broader and encapsulated a greater number of survivors and former residents than anything the commission put forward.  It is important to recognise that.  I have always said that the commission's report is one piece of this, but only one piece.</p> <p>  Turning to what can happen now, we have already seen independent analysis by a group of academics of elements of the commission's report and the executive summary that was redrafted by the Special Rapporteur for Child Protection and the human rights analysis of the report.  The commission's report is just one piece of the State's response.  My focus and that of my Department has been on meeting the explicit needs of survivors and the range of issues they have set out.</p></speech>

That means it can be done in a statutory way.  Will the Department consider that?</p></speech>

The Deputy has made a suggestion and has on a number of occasions raised a point about a general repudiation of the commission's report.  That raises fundamental questions.  If this Government takes a decision to repudiate a report that is disagreed with, what will happen when a commission of investigation report is undertaken, criticises a future Government and that Government decides to repudiate that report?  The Deputy may disagree with me on this point but a decision by a Government to repudiate an independent commission of investigation report has serious consequences that may be unforeseen.</p> <p>  There are undoubtedly legitimate criticisms of elements of the commission's report.  There is also material of considerable value in that report.  It is clearly documented and evidenced in the report that the State knew what was happening in these institutions and failed to act.  Inspectors from the Department with responsibility for local government were writing reports stating that children in these institutions were not being properly fed and that children and mothers were dying.  That was ignored by officialdom.  I do not want those findings repudiated.  That is an important element of the findings.  That is on the specific issue of this report.  There is also a broader issue about a Government making a determination to repudiate an independent report and the precedent that would set.</p></speech>

In the process that flowed from my PhD, the subsequent Government inquiry, led by Dr. Eileen Doyle, and the revelations of September 2021 from "Women of Honour", it seems to be a recurring pattern that the concerns of those who are targeted by others, or who find themselves in a vulnerable position in institutions such as our Defence Forces or in mother and baby homes, seem to be subordinated to either the moral and legal concerns of adversarial approaches, or other procedural or administrative purposes.</p><p>We have to remember that people who make these disclosures relive the experiences. They are retraumatised.  It is extremely important that their very powerful and compelling testimony can been seen explicitly to facilitate acknowledgement and healing, as opposed to further traumatising and adding further injury. </p><p> I am coming late to this issue, given the circumstances of my arrival in the Seanad but it occurs to me that we already have very powerful instruments and methods for getting to the heart of these very sensitive issues.  We have experts of international renown in all of our universities.  We have some amazing women and some men who are very well placed to carry out incisive and qualitative phenomenological research into the testimonies and experiences of these survivors.  A huge body of international literature already exists on how best to go about doing this.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, knows this from our shared background as academics.  I am always really puzzled as to why such inquiries are led by senior council or judges when we have an embarrassment of riches in the country.  We can put together these very compelling disclosures from survivors, weave them through with all of the secondary sources available to, and with the resources of, the State, to arrive at extremely compelling findings that can contribute significantly to knowledge and assist us to move forward.  When findings are constrained and confined within this quasi-legal frame, it really limits through very positivistic and deterministic thought processes.  It narrows and undermines.  I hope that the survivors' personal accounts housed in the national centre for research and remembrance would be amenable to this type of research.  I agree with everything said by Deputy Cairns and it chimes with my own experience in this regard.  We find, 20 years after the original research, that women in our armed forces are still targeted in this way.  There is a judge-led inquiry under way at the moment to investigate that.  Can we not learn from this?  I ask the Minister whether it is possible for him to suggest to Cabinet that in the future, rather than appointing senior counsel, judges and so on, we look at the resources we already actually have to assist in truth and reconciliation.  There is a lot more to follow.  There are other areas of Irish life that require this type of inquiry. </p></speech>

I might give my reflection on what he has said because it is really valuable.  In the 18 months following the publication of the commission of investigation report, we can see the huge problems with dealing with issues as sensitive as those the commission had to address in the context of the commission of investigation legislation.  Deputy Cairns spoke about the importance of justice.  Finding justice, without going that quasi-legal route, is extremely difficult because as soon as we talk of issues of justice, we talk of issues of accountability, responsibility and culpability.  We then bring in a requirement for people to be able to defend their legal name and their actions, as well as the need for cross-examination and fair procedures and that is a consequence of the common law legal system we exist in.  That system does not work well with a process seeking to understand the lived experiences of individuals.  While I was not in the Oireachtas when the specific terms of reference for the commission of investigation into the mother and baby institutions were drafted, I think the confidential committee, as a sub-committee of the actual commission itself, was created as an effort to try to bridge that.  It was to be a separate source where people could give, perhaps not sworn testimony in the same way that testimony before the commission was sworn, but another place where testimony could be given.  We know now, in terms of the overall outcome, how unsatisfactory, to put it mildly, that was for those 550 survivors who gave testimony before it.  To come back to the Senator's first point, the approach being adopted under the lived experience initiative, which will be adopted with the records and memorial centre, will be one that is trauma-informed and one based and undertaken by people who have an understanding of oral history, human rights and how people coming to give their personal stories need and should be treated. That is why we wanted to provide the flexibility.  Should an individual who has already relived his or her story before the confidential committee not wish to do that again, that person could use the recording testimony that is already preserved in the archive and need only give permission for it to flow into the lived experience initiative.  That is all such people would need to do, as well as giving the option to add to that or start afresh and allowing new people beyond this 550 to be able to do the same thing as well, albeit all in a trauma-informed manner.</p></speech>

Within our libraries and academic research, we have tens of thousands of research projects that look in great detail at extremely sensitive issues such as this.  They do not require legal examination.  In the processes, oversight and the governance which the Minister and I are so familiar with in the university sector, from time to time, research on the public record, in a permanently digitably-searchable archive and open to everybody, can occasionally be referred for legal advice.  It happened with my own research back in 1998.  It was referred to Arthur Cox and certain observations were made but all of that sensitive information was still published and is on the public record.  It has led to a greater understanding.  I am concerned that we do not put the cart before the horse.  The legal filter, if you like, is not the one that should be applied first.  We should take tried and tested, centuries-old, methodological approaches to these very sensitive issues and let in the light.  Let the findings speak for themselves.  If there is a concern, let legal counsel have a quick look at it.</p><p>We are in danger of making the same mistakes over and over again and letting down survivors if we impose this kind of overly legalistic, adversarial, and almost confrontational, approach to people who make disclosures.  First of all, they need to be believed.  There is so much in the literature on how to deal with the most sensitive matters and there are no impediments to proceeding on that basis.  However, if we keep doing it the way we have been doing it thus far, we are doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over again.  We are going to let down survivors and that it is going to have a chilling effect on the willingness of people to come forward to help us to understand our Republic and how we got to where we are and the measures we need to take to ensure we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.  When it comes to children with disabilities, children with additional needs, we are making the same mistakes over and over again.  Therefore we need to learn.  The academic model we have is a very powerful instrument for moving forward.  If we were to apply the restrictions outlined by the Minister to academic research, we would have to close our libraries. </p></speech>

That is the approach we are hoping to take with the records and memorials centre.  We will have a source of records, and a legal basis for access to these records, where academics will be able to access them and make their own conclusions and judgments.  These records will be open to everyone, academics and others, who wish to inspect this archive.  That is what we are seeking to achieve.  In terms of the specific lived experience initiative, the idea is again to move away from a narrow, legalistic approach but allow the spoken words of former residents of these institutions to form the record, unfiltered by legal concerns or the like.  That is what we are looking to achieve here.</p></speech>

That was one of the concerns I had.  Some survivors still feel their testimony should be reviewed and the Minister has addressed that here.  He spoke in his opening statement about some survivors not being able to see their own words in the final report.  I can only say that I have been on this committee since it was originally formed and I know from working with the Minister that he has been listening to survivors.  He has met survivors in my own area of Carlow-Kilkenny and has come down to visit them.  He has been listening to their concerns.  There is a slight issue with communication, particularly in this instance, although I welcome the information given by the Minister on the radio recently that more than 1,898 survivors have looked for their birth information.  That is very welcome.  As part of our remit in this committee, we have to find solutions.  We have met so many survivors and as previous speakers have said, this issue is so sensitive for the survivors and their families.  The Minister and I, and the committee, are finding solutions and the only way we can do that is to work together.  I see the Minister spoke in his opening statement about Government approval been sought in the coming weeks for publication of the mother and baby homes institutional payment scheme.  One thing I have said and will always say is that survivors are not getting any younger.  We have a duty of care regarding payment as soon as possible.  Local authorities need to play a bigger part in this going forward.  I am working at the moment on a very sensitive case around housing need, medical cards and things like that.  We are not giving this issue the urgency it needs.  This needs to be communicated better and, if nothing else, we need to deliver on all the different things we have agreed to.  The one thing we need to do now is make sure that there are payments, housing, grants and enhanced medical cards.  I understand that much of this has been worked on but there are many things that have not.  If we do nothing else as a committee, for ourselves and for survivors, we have to deliver on that.</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about the national centre for research and remembrance.  That is so important but we need more joined-up thinking across all the different agencies.  This needs to be a priority.  The timescale is of utmost importance.  When he returns to the committee, can the Minister provide more information and some sort of timescale that we can give to survivors?  They really need that.  As committee members, we are fully committed to making sure the outcome is the best we can get for a situation that is so sensitive and has affected so many lives and people in our community.  As someone who has worked with the Minister and with the survivors, I can say he has always written to them, met them and come back to them.  I am very respectful of that, as are the survivors who I have asked him to talk to.  </p></speech>

I recognised in my opening statement that this issue was not communicated properly.  That is something we should have resolved.  We have our quarterly bulletin but we should have provided an update on this specific issue.  Survivors should not have been reading about this in response to a media query.</p> <p>  The Deputy makes the very fair point about the age of many of the survivors.  On the issue of the payments legislation specifically, the final touches are being put to the full draft of that legislation.  I need to bring it to Cabinet and then we will look to bring it rapidly into the D&aacute;il for Second Stage.  If it is of any reassurance, we are not just working on the legislation but are working on the basis that it will be passed and are putting in place the mechanisms that will actually allow for the processing of these payments.  There will have to be a significant infrastructure behind this.  We are talking about up to 34,000 individual payments and 16,000 enhanced medical card applications.  There is a lot of work that has to go into delivering that and in a timely manner.  That is happening at the same time as the legislation.  As I say, I hope to have the legislation to Cabinet this month and then it will be brought swiftly into the Oireachtas after that.  I am not meaning to sound defensive in any way, as this legislation needs to happen, but just to recognise that the unit in the Department has delivered the Birth Information and Tracing Act, and a lot of work around this; not just the legislation itself but its implementation.  It has delivered the Institutional Burials Act and, even today, there is a piece of work going through Cabinet in terms of delivery of the agency. The Department has been working on this lived experience initiative, on the records and memorials centre, and on other elements of the scheme such as the funds orf memorialisation being undertaken by groups.  I think eight of the 22 items of the action plan have been completed and another 12 are under way.  An intensive body of work is being undertaken.  I take the Deputy's point that redress is of huge importance to survivors and needs to be acted on swiftly.  </p></speech>

The Minister even acknowledged how people found out that the commitment that was given was not going to happen.  It is really important that we have the memorialisation and archives and people get to tell their story but when people go to a commission, while it is not a criminal investigation, they nearly see it in the same light.  They see as if they were giving a statement in that they feel that there is potentially a pathway to justice.  That is possibly what is missing for people.  </p><p> I hear what the Minister is saying about the legal complexities but in respect of the High Court case in January 2021, were changes not made at that point?  If there were, was it possible for the State to look at making other changes to the commission of investigation?  If there is an issue around legal difficulties, was there any way through amending legislation that this could have been changed?  </p><p> My next question concerns the information and tracing legislation.  Could the Minister remind people how they register for that?  I know a significant number of people have already registered for that.  Could he address any changes arising out of the High Court?  If there were changes, was a precedent set then so that we could have made other changes?  Was there a way of changing legislation?  The memorialisation is really important but everybody has heard that people felt that there was nearly an attitude or a certain tone throughout the report along the lines of "well those were the times we were living in and it was unfortunate.".  I know some of the findings were very robust and they were welcome but that is what people felt.  They felt it was nearly half an apology along the lines of "we're sorry this happened but sure those were the kind of the times we lived in and it's a pity.  Let's all move on now.".  That is why when people thought someone with a human rights background was going to look at it, they really welcomed it because it felt like this was going to get the scrutiny it deserved.  To a certain extent, it is probably the commission members who have us in this situation and they were the ones who would not come before this committee, which is unfortunate.  We are relying on the Minister to pick up the slack for want of a better word.  </p></speech>

Another commission of investigation - the Farrelly commission -  is ongoing.</p><p>Regarding the point about the High Court case, a case was taken by a number of survivors and former residents seeking that certain paragraphs in the commission's report be struck down.  An agreement was reached between the State and those survivors and that agreement, which was ratified by the court, was that a statement be appended to the commission's report, be present wherever the commission's report is officially displayed and outline the fact that survivors should have been consulted in terms of the process and should have received the final draft of the report to allow them to comment and that subsequently they do not agree with certain findings.  It lists various paragraphs of the commission's report.  That is a really important step because we all know that from the day the commission's report came out, there was very significant anger about some of the conclusions.  It is really important that this anger and dissatisfaction is now reflected in the official record.  That is an official statement that lies beside the commission's report.  </p><p>In terms of the information and tracing legislation, the key route there is an online route but it can also be accessed via phone and through a letter as well.  The website address is <i>www.birthinfo.ie</i>.  The website is quite easy to use.  You pick which category you belong to, for example, are you a mother, an adopted person, somebody who was subject to boarding out or illegal birth registration or somebody with questions about your origins.  You then draw down that menu and tick whether you want to register in the contact preference register and whether you want to receive information.  It is an easy-to-use site.  I know there was one issue yesterday about people registering from the US.  There was an issue with US phone numbers.  My understanding is that this has been resolved.  There was very significant drawdown on the first day with almost 2,000 people seeking information.  It is good to see it being taken up and used.  </p></speech>

A judge of the High Court oversaw that process.  It was not the Government doing something independently.  It was scrutinised by another branch of the Oireachtas.  Commissions of investigation are a creation of the Oireachtas.  They are formed under that legislation.  It requires a motion from the D&aacute;il to create them so if the Government was to append a statement about the outcome of a commission of investigation, it would need the independent scrutiny of a court process.  This is why that was the outcome of the judicial review process.</p></speech>

I fully understand what the Minister means about that.  It is, however, important for us to acknowledge here today that there are consequences for not repudiating a report that has incorrect findings and which did not even produce any kind of methodology into how it came about those findings.  This needs to be acknowledged.  It is actually very sickening to hear the Minister say in response to Senator Clonan that he would take that approach on memorialisation, about which the Senator spoke so eloquently.  That approach has not been taken in relation to any of the other legislation that we have been dealing with.  Why is it just with memorialisation?  Is it because there is no cost to the State then?  The consequences of a report with incorrect findings like that has an impact on issues such as redress.  The Minister spoke about the redress scheme as if it is fantastic, but of course if the report found that there were these obscene human rights violations in them, redress would be more appropriate for the crimes that were committed.  Perhaps a person might get &euro;5,000.  That is ridiculous.  That a person must have been in an institution for longer than six months is, again, ridiculous.  Of course there are consequences to having this report.  If we are acknowledging the consequences of potentially repudiating it, it must also be acknowledged that there are consequences to not doing that.</p></speech>

We did not base our redress proposals on the commission's report.  We did not limit ourselves to the limitations that the commission set out.  Indeed, in terms of the action plan and our response we did not limit ourselves to the commission's report.  Notwithstanding that there are severe criticisms of some of the findings of the report, which are expressed on the record now, the report is one part of the history of what happened in the mother and baby institutions.  As a Government we are trying to respond to elements of that and to respond to the broader issues the survivors have brought to us as well.  This is what we are seeking to do around the birth information in the context of the Institutional Burials (Amendment) Bill.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister and his officials: Aileen Nolan, acting director and Cathal Duffy, principal officer.  The format of the meeting is in the usual manner.  We will hear an opening statement, followed by questions and answers with members of the committee.  I ask members to be concise with their questions to allow everyone an opportunity to participate.  As the Minister has indicated that he needs to be in the Seanad at 4.45 p.m., we will finish with enough time to allow him proceed to his next engagement.</p> <p>  I remind witnesses and members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make that person in any way identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of any person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and any such direction must be complied with.  For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present in the room do.</p> <p>  Members are reminded that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  I welcome those members who have entered the committee room.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement and thank him for joining us.</p></speech>

I hope we will have time to go through the high-level action plan later on because I know members will have detailed questions on how we are taking things forward.  I very much welcome this opportunity to engage with the members of the joint committee on matters relating to the Report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, and I look forward to hearing their contributions.</p> <p>  The establishment of a Commission on the Defence Forces was set out in the programme for Government and was a key priority for me as Minister for Defence.  When the commission&rsquo;s report was published in February of this year, it recommended widespread and unprecedented changes for the Defence Forces and defence provision in Ireland.  The report contained 130 recommendations in total, ranging from reform of high-level command and control structures to revitalisation of the Reserve Defence Force.  However, the overarching theme was the urgent need for cultural transformation within the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  At the time of the report&rsquo;s publication, I made a commitment to revert with a memorandum to Government detailing a proposed response to the commission&rsquo;s recommendations and a high-level action plan.  Since then, a significant body of work has been progressed by me, my officials and the Defence Forces culminating in the approval of the memorandum and high-level action plan on the 12 July.  The Government approved a move over a six-year period to a level of Defence Forces&rsquo; capability equivalent to level of ambition 2, LOA2, as set out in the capability framework devised by the commission, which will entail funding increases to reach a defence budget of approximately &euro;1.5 billion at January 2022 prices by 2028 through the annual Estimates process.  A conservative estimate means that will be a defence budget of between &euro;1.8 billion and &euro;1.9 billion by 2028.  This represents the largest funding increase for defence in the history of the State.  This afternoon I would like to talk about the Report of the Commission on the Defence Forces and the subsequent Government response, and the significant progress that has been made since publication.</p> <p>  As members will all know, in December 2020 the Government authorised the establishment of the commission and agreed its terms of reference and membership.  The terms of reference covered the structures and size of the Defence Forces, defence capabilities, HR polices and strategies, the Reserve Defence Force, governance and high-level command and control in the Defence Forces and pay structures.  The work of the commission was carried out against the backdrop of the defence policy framework set out in the White Paper 2015 and the White Paper update of 2019, both of which were developed by joint civil and military teams.</p> <p>  The publication of the commission&rsquo;s report last February represented the culmination of 13 months of intensive and dedicated work carried out by the commission members.  The report was wide-ranging, challenging and comprehensive and proposed significant changes for the Defence Forces and defence provision in Ireland.  The illegal invasion of Ukraine within weeks of the publication of the report acted as a catalyst that brought defence matters to the forefront of public discourse.  With the deterioration of the international security environment, nations across the world reassessed their defence capabilities and Ireland was no exception.  The commission&rsquo;s finding that Ireland&rsquo;s Defence Forces would be unable to conduct a meaningful defence of the State from a sustained act of aggression by a military force with its current capability brought the need for investment and transformation into sharp focus.</p> <p>  The report made a wide range of recommendations regarding high-level command arrangements, Defence Forces structures, defence capabilities, the Reserve Defence Force, and funding with a significant proportion of the recommendations focussed on strategic HR and cultural change.  The commission identified the urgent need for clarification of the levels ambition for the Defence Forces, and in the absence of such clarity they created a framework focused on three levels of ambition, LOAs, the first of which, LOA1 represents Ireland&rsquo;s current capability, LOA2 represents enhanced capability, and LOA3, which represents funding on a par with similar countries across the EU.  One of the key recommendations of the commission was that consideration be given to a move to LOA2 in the short term.  The commission also recognised that any proposal to move to LOA3 could only be considered in the context of a step to LOA2 in the first instance, which is exactly what we are doing.</p> <p>  Due to the large number and wide range of the recommendations, many of which were highly complex, a period of five months was required to give the recommendations detailed consideration and to develop a high-level action plan.</p> <p>  Following the publication of the report, I engaged extensively with ministerial colleagues and other stakeholders, including representative associations.  A civil-military team was also established to work on the response to the recommendations and the high-level action plan.  This involved intensive engagement across the defence organisation, as well as with a wide range of other stakeholders and Departments, in particular the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Following detailed analysis of the recommendations and extensive engagement with stakeholders, the high-level action plan set out a position of "accept", "accept in principle", "further evaluation" or "revert" for each of the 130 recommendations.  I am very pleased to say that 103 of the 130 recommendations were either accepted or accepted in principle, with 17 subject to further evaluation.  I will be reverting to the Government with proposed responses to the remaining ten recommendations at a later stage.  Reverting does not mean we do not agree with them.  It just means we need more work and in particular legal advice on some of the main recommendations, which will be provided by the Attorney General.</p> <p>  The commission&rsquo;s report identified five core areas to be addressed in an implementation plan, which were captured in the high-level action plan as five strategic objectives, which are: strategic HR and cultural change to be delivered; new command and control and joint structures to be established; services to be reformed and restructured; the Reserve Defence Force to be revitalised; and a joint capability development to be implemented.</p> <p>  The high-level action plan set out initial implementation and oversight structures including a high-level steering board chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, an implementation oversight group with an independent chair and the establishment of a civil-military implementation management office.  The high-level action plan also identified 38 early actions to progress a number of key recommendations from the commission&rsquo;s report, which will also provide the necessary building blocks to develop an implementation plan within six months of the Government decision.</p> <p>  A number of key appointments were proposed in the high-level action plan to progress the implementation of the recommendations and the transformation agenda, including a civilian head of transformation, a civilian head of strategic HR and a gender adviser who will all report directly to the Chief of Staff.</p><p>A digital transformation officer will also be required to lead the digital transformation agenda, and will report directly to the head of transformation, who, in turn, reports to the Chief of Staff.</p><p> On 12 July of this year I brought a memorandum to Government and a high-level action plan detailing the proposed response to the Commission's report, which was approved.  As I mentioned earlier, the Government approved a move over a six-year period to a level of Defence Forces' capability equivalent to level of ambition 2, LOA2, as set out in the capability framework devised by the Commission, which will entail funding increases to reach a defence budget of &euro;1.5 billion - at January 2022 prices - by 2028 through the annual Estimates.  As I stated earlier, this represents the largest increase in Defence funding in the history of the State.  A number of measures relating to pay and allowance structures have also been accepted for implementation.</p><p> The move to LOA2 also entails an increase of some 2,000 personnel above the current Permanent Defence Force establishment of 9,500, of which we are more than 1,000 below at present.  It is clear that a significant task lies ahead for the Defence Forces and my Department.  Implementation of the recommendations requires significant resources and expertise, both internal and external.  The Department has a significant role to play in enabling, supporting and overseeing progress of the transformation agenda.  To do this it, too, will require additional resources.</p><p> I believe we are currently in a strong position to deliver this unprecedented transformation, thanks in no small part to the leadership and strong working relationship displayed by the Secretary General and the Chief of Staff, both of whom are working remarkably closely together.  They are drivers, in some ways, and champions of the transformation agenda within the Department and the Defence Forces.</p><p> Finally, I thank the Chairman for inviting me here today.  I look forward to hearing members' thoughts and views on matters relating to the Commission on the Defence Forces.  I have tried to touch on a number of issues.  I would be delighted to address these and any further issues of interest that the members might like, in particular, the early actions.  We have made some progress on those and I could bring them up to speed on the 38 early actions.  It might be a useful process for the committee, if the Chairman wants to go through that.  I am happy to take questions on whatever the members want to ask questions on.</p></speech>

I am going straight to members of the committee. Conscious of the fact that we are under something of a time constraint, I see seven members of the committee present.  I will call Deputy Brady first and then proceed to call other members of the committee.  I suggest that in order to ensure that we maximise our engagement with the Minister we insofar as possible keep ourselves to questions rather than speeches.  As always, I am in the hands of the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.657" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1625" speakername="John Brady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022100400002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chair and thank the Minister for coming before us to discuss what is a really important report and something that has been a long time coming.  I welcome the opportunity to engage the Minister on it.</p> <p>  I commend the work of the Commission and all its members and the lengthy process which they embarked upon and welcome the findings of the commission.  The report is only as good as the implementation.  I certainly would be eager to hear about the 38 early actions, as the Minister mentioned.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister has moved on one of the more important and timely issues, namely the associate affiliation of PDFORRA to ICTU.  I welcomed that at the time and merely restate that.</p> <p>  It is a particularly important report.  We are aware of the serious challenges within the Defence Forces in the haemorrhaging of members and the challenges of recruitment.  That was only highlighted again during the week by a media report where an entire class of Naval Service recruits had left the force and allegedly signed up with the private sector.  It highlights the serious challenges and the need to stifle the haemorrhage in not only the Naval Service but also the Air Corps and, indeed, the Army.</p> <p>  To touch on the recommendations, I mentioned the 38 early actions.  It would be good to get an update on those.  Of the 130 overall recommendations, 103 have been agreed and 17 are subject to further evaluation.  I do not expect the Minister to give details of all of them here but it would be good to get a report or note from the Minister outlining what has been agreed and what is gone for further evaluation.  On the remaining ten recommendations, the report states that it is proposed to bring forward recommendations at a later stage.  The Minister might elaborate on that.  "A later stage", to me, suggests kicking it down the road and essentially means being put on the long finger.  I would be eager to get a response on that.</p> <p>  From the outset, a level of ambition, certainly from my perspective, is what we should be aiming to achieve.  I speak from the perspective of us being a militarily neutral nation.  With that, it means investing in the Defence Forces to ensure we can defend our neutrality.  Unfortunately, military neutrality has been an excuse to under-fund the Defence Forces up until that point and let this Commission report be a change in the approach to it.</p> <p>  Was the fact that the Department was not part of the Commission's remit an oversight and is its inclusion needed?  When we are dealing with the civilian and military management, it all should be part of analysis and review.  What are the Minister's views on that?  Is there a plan at any stage to carry out a review of the Department and the civilian aspect of the Defence Forces as well?</p> <p>  Pay is a major issue within the Defence Forces and a deciding factor for so many of the excellent members of the Defence Forces to leave.  There are recommendations here in terms of the seagoing allowance, the long-service increments, etc.  The Minister stated in the past that these issues are still up for consideration.  Can I get an update as to where we are in terms of the allowances' expansion and, indeed, reintroduction, because one of the allowances that was abolished previously, which is not recommended in the Commission report and which should be, is the specialised instructor's allowance?  The Minister might give a view on the implementation of all of those allowances and also the specialised instructor's allowance.</p> <p>  The Reserve Defence Force is another aspect of the Defence Forces that is haemorrhaging members.  It is very much on its knees.  There is a recommendation in the report that there would be a regeneration plan for the RDF, with clear and specific timelines developed and published by the end of 2022 on how to reform and fund the reserves.  What the Commission is talking about is ambitious.  We are not only talking about building up the Reserve to what it used be in the past.  The Commission is also recommending that there would be reserves within the Air Corps and an establishment figure there of 400 within the Naval Service as well.  They recommend that report would be started by now and concluded by the end of this year.  The Minister might tell the committee whether that is included in the early actions and whether that work has commenced.</p> <p>  Implementation will be key to all of this.  I hear what the Minister is saying in terms of the high-level action plan in terms of the implementation oversight group with an independent chair.  All of that is welcome as well.</p> <p>  The situation in Ukraine has focused many people's minds in terms of defence, including our own defence capabilities.</p><p>I have questioned the Minister previously on our defence capabilities, particularly at sea.  The Nord Stream gas pipelines raise serious questions about our defence capabilities at sea when we have data cables going through our waters and are not able to put ships to sea.  This plan speaks about a six-year timeframe.  Is that realistic?  Are there opportunities to move further and faster on some measures where there are gaping holes in our defence capabilities?</p><p> The implementation oversight group will be critical.  What oversight will be there in terms of that group?  Does the committee have a remit to call in and question the group?  It will be important that such oversight be there.  The Minister has a key role and the Department of the Taoiseach will be critical, but this committee should have an oversight capacity on the implementation of the recommendations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.659" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022100400002#D00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and his officials and thank them for the presentation.  There is a huge amount of work to be done.  As Deputy Brady has said, one of the issues involved is the timescale for what will happen.  It would be useful for us to have an idea of what the targets are and when.  Without targets, things can slip.  I am anxious to know if the Minister can provide a date as to when these actions will happen.  That will really get things moving.</p> <p>  I will focus on the Reserve.  There is talk of a Reserve assistant chief of staff and that each service chief should be supported by that person.  When will that person be appointed?  Deputy Brady mentioned the regeneration plan for the RDF that was supposed to be published by the end of the year.  Will that happen?  If not, why not?  Hopefully, it will.  Where is the joint office of Reserve affairs with senior staff from the RDF and supporting the PDF?  Will it be established pretty soon?  There is an urgency to all of this.  I know the Minister agrees.  We want to support him in driving this forward as best we can.</p> <p>  There is talk of a clear and focused recruitment plan for the RDF with milestones and annual reviews.  Where is that?  It can take a long time from when a recruit applies to join the RDF to when he or she is attested, as there are so many steps and jumps.  </p> <p>  What is happening with respect to safeguarding the jobs of civilian staff who join the RDF and are on service for a period so that when they want to go back to the civilian job, it is there for them and they do not suffer in any way?  What can we do to ensure that?  It is a major concern preventing people from getting involved and, particularly, going overseas in specialist roles if their civilian job is not safeguarded.  We have had discussions about legislation coming down the track on that.  Where is that at?</p> <p>  On diversity in the Defence Forces, will the Minister indicate his plans and those of the Department and Chief of Staff to ensure people from the many diverse backgrounds in Ireland are encouraged to join the forces at all levels?  Will a policy be articulated and published on that?  Deputy Brady has covered most of the other stuff I wanted to ask.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.661" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1589" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022100400002#D00400"><p>It was suggested by Deputy Brady and supported by Deputy Stanton that the Minister might give us a progress report in the form of a written note on the recommendations.  If that was colour-coded, it would give us an idea of the implementation plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.662" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022100400002#D00500"><p>That is helpful.  On the 38 early actions, some members will have a copy of Building for the Future - Change from Within, which is the high-level action plan for the report.  On pages 16 and 17 are the 38 recommendations for early actions, which in some cases put foundations in place to do more and in others are definitive actions from which people will notice change.  We have moved, for example, on the temporary association membership.  That is done.  On the legislative and policies objective, that process has commenced.</p> <p>  On pay and allowances, which people are very interested in, we have agreement in principle but are still talking to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about removing the requirement for a three-star private or able seaman to mark time for the first three years of their rank - in other words not getting any pay increases for those three years - and ensuring all personnel, including private three-star and able seaman rank, are paid the full rate of military service allowance, MSA, applicable to that rank.  The combination of those two things is worth about &euro;6,000 per year for those impacted, which is approximately 1,500 people.  For people looking for immediate and direct benefit from the work of the commission in terms of pay and allowances, there you have it.</p> <p>  For people starting out in the Defence Forces this change to the current system of having to mark time for up to three years and effectively having only half of an MSA payment for a period is worth a significant amount in take-home pay and we hope will be a significant incentive for people to join the Defence Forces and stay there and to retain the kind of people who have, unfortunately, been targeted by the private sector because of their skill sets and capabilities.  We have to hold on to those people.  That is a practical example of the pay and allowances.</p> <p>  We have committed to providing immediate access to the seagoing service commitment scheme to direct-entry personnel into the Navy.  That is a small number of people but an important point of principle.  If we bring somebody with the right skill set on a direct-entry scheme into the Naval Service, we want to make sure they can benefit from what everybody else benefits from.  We have commenced further evaluation of replacing the existing seagoing allowances with a less complex seagoing duty measure.  We want to simplify these payments if we can so that people understand clearly who qualifies and at what level of payment.  Work is under way on that.</p> <p>  We are looking at the concept of a long service increment to pay scales for all ranks of enlisted personnel.  That is not straightforward because it creates precedents across the public sector more generally.  However, we are talking to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about that and it was focused on in the commission report.</p> <p>  Those are some good examples of what we are looking at, progressing, have agreement in principle on or hopefully will make further progress on between now and the end of the year.</p> <p>  On recruitment strategies, we have commenced measures to enhance the visibility and wider benefits of membership of the Defence Forces in recruitment campaigns.  The Be More campaign for the Defence Forces is one of the best recruitment campaigns I have seen in some time but it is in a marketplace of full employment where there is a lot of competition for the skill sets we are looking for.  We need to continue to enhance that.</p> <p>  We are looking at recruitment and induction strategies that can deal with the volumes we need to bring into the Defence Forces.  For example, we are looking to turn Gormanston into a specialist training centre for new recruits.  It would be two-star training, effectively.  There is much planning going on within the Defence Forces as to what that might look like but, in simple terms, we must have the capacity to train between 1,000 and 1,200 people per year to get a net increase between 400 and 600 per year, because we will lose people through retirement and other reasons for exit.</p><p>That is going to put considerable strain on the Defence Forces.  We are looking to design an infrastructure that can facilitate that.</p><p> That brings to me a question Deputy Brady asked in respect of allowances for specialised training and instructors.  There is a long history around this issue.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has a clear perspective on what was agreed and what was not in previous negotiations.  Having said that, I have sympathy for this issue.  We need to try to progress it through the commission recommendations.  If we are going to put a lot more pressure on the Defence Forces to train more people and maintain high standards, we must put financial incentives in place to ensure we have enough instructors to do that work.  That is not going to happen overnight.  I spoke to the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, about that issue only last week.  We will work with RACO to progress something in that space.</p><p> The matters of diversity and inclusion strategies have rightly been raised by committee members.  There is going to be a post for a full-time, senior-ranked position of gender adviser.  That is being progressed as we speak.  Gender diversity and unconscious bias training is also being included in the training programmes.  Some such elements already exist in the programme and are being enhanced.  I compliment the Chief of Staff on strongly pushing this agenda.</p><p> One matter that has not been raised but which I am focusing on is the programme for Government commitment to access to private healthcare for enlisted personnel.  That must be progressed.  It will take some time to work through those issues with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but at the moment, officers in the Defence Forces have extremely good health cover.  It is similar to a VHI-plus package, or however you want to describe it.  I would like the same cover to be available to everyone in the Defence Forces, enlisted personnel and officers.  The Government has committed to doing that and we hope to make progress next year with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is not a straightforward thing to do and it is costly.  We think it will cost approximately &euro;10 million per year.  We would like to make progress in that regard.  Quite a lot is being done around that issue.</p><p> The issue of the working time directive has been touched on and we are making good progress in that regard.  We are trying to finalise the exemptions that will be required for the Defence Forces, which everybody accepts need to be there to ensure the Defence Forces can function in an emergency or in the environment they have to operate in, whether that is overseas, on the deck of a patrol ship or whatever the case may be.  We are now approaching the end of that consultation and discussion process between the Chief of Staff, his team, the Department and our team, and the representative bodies to try to get agreement as to where those exemptions should apply.  We hope to then be able to frame legislation quite quickly.</p><p> The Defence Forces vision statement will be in place by the end of the year.</p><p> The high-level command and control is a matter on which we have to revert to the Government.  It is a good example of something we absolutely want to do and agree with but cannot pursue until we have legal advice.  We want to make our Chief of Staff a chief or head of defence, CHOD.  That is the international norm.  To create that position, we must also create a defence headquarters.  That would mean a change in command structures within the Defence Forces.  It would also fundamentally change how the Defence Forces interact with the Department.  We need, and are getting, legal advice from the Attorney General on the legalities around that, the legislation that would be required to underpin it and so on.  We need that advice before we make a commitment.  We are not going to be waiting long.  We will have the advice of the Attorney General by the end of this month.  That is going to be a good news story for the Defence Forces in terms of that ambition.</p><p> The positions of head of transformation and head of human resources, HR, are being advertised externally, and that is progressing.  There is a technical issue around the implementation of administrative solutions and how complaints to the ombudsman are sometimes treated because there is a time limit for submissions.  Some cases have been timed out and so on.  We are considering changes to the legislation, where necessary, in that space.</p><p> The Army force design planning process has commenced, which will interest Deputy Berry.  This is a complex piece of work for the Defence Forces to undertake and we need to keep politics out of the process, if we can.  The issue is where the Army headquarters will be located in the future and how that structure connects with the new CHOD headquarters.  That process has started.  I expect it to take 18 months to finalise because there is a lot of work involved.  As Minister for Defence, I will take advice on the basis of what is good for the military structure in respect of operations and so on.  There is a lot of work involved.</p><p> In respect of the naval fleet and staffing, we have already engaged with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, regarding the consideration of smart metrics for patrol days, which essentially means we need to patrol in a way that is smarter, linking in with both the Air Corps and the Naval Service, which will, of course, become the Air Force and the Irish Navy.  Everybody here is familiar with the pressures that the Naval Service, in particular, has been under.  That is something I hope we are going to be able to reverse with double crewing, more ships and the better technology that will be coming on stream in the coming years.</p><p> Deputy Stanton always asks about the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, and he is right to do so.  We have said we will have a regeneration plan by the end of the year.  I hope we can meet that target.  It may go a little beyond it but not far beyond it.  The office for Reserve affairs is being established as we speak and it will be established in the next couple of weeks.  We need that office up and running.  It will then put in place the RDF regeneration plan.  We are effectively putting the pieces in place to make that happen and, as I said, it is to be hoped we will get it done by the end of the year, but if not, it will be done shortly thereafter.  It is about getting that right, working with the RDF to do so and ensuring its members are happy.</p><p> I am quite strong on the review of Defence Forces tasking.  We have significant commitments, for example, to Portlaoise Prison, where there could be up to 50 personnel.  They cover approximately 75,000 man days per year, which means, in respect of the required resourcing, it is a bit like a mission overseas but in Portlaoise Prison.  While the Defence Forces do a remarkably good job in the prison, we must ask whether we need the Defence Forces there or can find other mechanisms to provide that role without requiring the Defence Forces to be there.  We are starting the conversation with the Department of Justice on that issue.  We are also having conversations in respect of the Central Bank and Irish Industrial Explosives, both of which have a reliance on the Defence Forces.  I want, where possible, to focus the Defence Forces on what its members have signed up to do and trained for, which is defence, security, the protection of sovereignty, overseas missions, and all the other things that are core Defence Force roles, rather than having to supplement other areas because we have a good skill set and experience within the Defence Forces.  That work is under way.</p><p>The capability development structure is very much under way.  The capability development planning process and the permanent structure have already been established.  The structure is a civil and military team that are very much working in partnership.  I have already come to this committee with new permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, projects that we should be involved in for EU capability development.  We are very much pushing ahead with that and have done so already.</p><p> With regard to the enhancement of Defence Forces capability, we have commenced planning for military radar capability, including primary radar.  The civil-military discussion that is taking place in this area is not just about a primary radar line along our coastline, it is very much around how the Air Corps, the Naval Service and the Army, working together, can provide a much more complete operational picture in terms of radar capability and technology.</p><p> I wished to give a sense that there were some cynics who said this commission report would be another report that sits on the shelf, on the back of which nothing would really happen.  However, a tonne of stuff is happening on the back of that report.  We only approved it at the very end of July.  The month of August is a quiet time for actions but, in the month of August and September, all of this stuff has been progressing at a pace that I have certainly never seen in the defence sector before and with a partnership between the Defence Forces and the Department which is really strong.  We have much to do between now and the end of the year and we will then move on to all of the other recommendations as well.  I suspect we will implement virtually all of the 130 recommendations, but some need more work before we can finalise that and some will probably need a new Government decision to move ahead.</p></speech>

It probably covered nearly all of the questions that I was asked.  I apologise, I have not covered the organisational capability review, OCR.  This issue has been raised repeatedly and I am pretty sure I have answered this question a number of times.  Why did the Commission on the Defence Forces not look at the Department as well?  The Department got a pretty robust assessment in parallel and the result of that OCR has been approved by the Government and will be published in the coming weeks.  The Department has had a pretty comprehensive review.  I have seen it and it will be up on the Department's website very shortly if it is not up already.</p></speech>

Within that, we get the scale of the challenges that face the Minister and the Department.  However, behind all of that, we still have 270 personnel who have left the Defence Forces this year.  This time last year, this committee visited the Haulbowline naval base.  What we found there I can only describe as incredibly committed naval people at all levels.  They outlined to us some incredibly grim experiences about their pay and conditions.  If we visit that same naval base in 12 months, what differences would we notice?  If we visit in two years' time, what differences would we notice?  I could apply the same to McKee Barracks or the Curragh, but let us take Haulbowline as an example.  What will we notice in a year or two?</p></speech>

I will focus on a number of the recommendations that Government accepted in principle, especially around the areas of cyber and intelligence.  There are two intelligence recommendations, Nos. 111 and 113, which were accepted in principle, and that deal with the "overarching legal and governance framework" and into "oversight in relation to intelligence" needing to be set out in legislation.  Recommendation 9 in the area of cyber that has, again, been accepted in principle, is for, "the creation of a Joint Cyber Defence Command that should manage, Defence Forces IT Services, CIS Services and Cyber Defence".  Why accept these recommendations only in principle?  The structure should be there at this point to be able to put them, at the very least, into the "accept" bracket and take them out of the "accepted-in-principle" bracket.</p> <p>  The one that the Government has earmarked for further evaluation is the national defence academy and an apprentice school to support future tech-enabled force.  How does the Minister see those recommendations moving from accepted in principle to the area of further evaluation, to the delivery of the national defence academy?  Does the Government intend to accept that proposed national defence academy?</p> <p>  I will ask further questions on gender.  Recommendation 37 looked for, "a guaranteed minimum female participation rate of 35% on all command and other relevant career courses by 2025".  It was, again, accepted in principle.  How will the new gender adviser of whom the Minister spoke determine any future decision by the Government with regard to that 35% rate?  What impact is recruitment having on attaining that rate of 35%?</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about Gormanston and the potential reworking of the site.  Are there any other facilities that the Department has looked at or that military management has flagged as being of potential further or new use around the academy for cyber and intelligence?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.673" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022100400002#F01200"><p>We can all do that, but what we are doing here will span across multiple Governments and whoever is in government in three, four, five or ten years' time will be part of implementing these issues.  I have done what I can to try to make this as factual as possible and to keep politics out of it.</p> <p>  I go to the naval base pretty regularly.  I live very close to it.  Every time I go for a run, it is generally to the naval base.  I am very familiar with the infrastructure there.  What I would say to everybody who is thinking of joining the Defence Forces and to the people who are currently serving in the naval base is that we understand, only too well, the pressures in the naval base but we have a capital investment plan that is worth approximately &euro;72 million over the coming ten years for Haulbowline.</p> <p>  We have just opened a new accommodation unit which is probably the best accommodation unit of any, in any of the barracks or military facilities we have in the country.  It is phenomenal, if people get a chance to see it.  I opened it just a few weeks ago.  We have opened a new jetty facility there as well, which significantly improved the capacity, both for visiting vessels and our own vessels in the naval base.  We will putting a new gym facility in there.  I hope we will be able to upgrade the dive unit facilities too.  We are investing in a whole range of other things such as a new accommodation block and a new office block and, of course, we are reconditioning the whole island as well, with regard to the former Irish Ispat site, where the State is certainly committed to spending another &euro;20 or &euro;30 million, if necessary, to completely refurbish and make it safe.  There is a lot going on in Haulbowline with regard to Government investment to improve the quality of life and work there.  </p> <p>  If one is in the Naval Service in a few years' time, one's time and demands at sea will be very different to what they are now.  One will be, in all likelihood, in a double-crewing arrangement, which means that ships will have two full crews, rather than one.</p><p>That means less time at sea and a quicker turnover between being at sea and being back at land training and so on.  The quality-of-life issues, which we are trying to recognise and design into what the Irish navy - as opposed to the Naval Service - will look like over the next few years, are quite significant.  Next year alone, there are two new ships coming in from New Zealand.  That will be in the first quarter of the year, hopefully in January or February.  They are smaller vessels but still modern, predominantly for the Irish Sea.  We will also be developing a base on the east coast and the west coast so the voyage times for those ships getting back to base will not be so long.  That is also about improving quality of life and recognising family pressures for both men and women in the Defence Forces and the Naval Service.  I hope to also simplify and enhance the allowances for going to sea.<br/><br/>With all those things added together, the Naval Service should be a very attractive option for people leaving school and college today, and hopefully an attractive option for people who may have been in the Defence Forces or the Naval Service to come back in through some form of direct entry.  The accommodation will be better, the work environment in Haulbowline will be enhanced significantly and the quality of the ships will be modernised.  We have just decommissioned three ships, which were all 40 years old.  We do not have any ships now in that category with regard to going to sea on an older vessel versus a more modern one.  While the <i>L.&Eacute;. Niamh</i>and the <i>L.&Eacute;. R&oacute;is&iacute;n</i>are not the newest vessels in our fleet, they are still pretty modern.  There is a huge step change in the quality of accommodation on the newer ships over the older ones.<br/><br/>I am very positive about the future of the Naval Service.  We have had a lot of challenges.  There is very aggressive headhunting from the private sector because the people in our Defence Forces are good people and are a real asset to the private sector if it can get them.  We have to find a way of putting a package together that makes serving in the Naval Service and the Defence Forces generally more attractive.  That is a big part of what we are trying to do here.  That includes women as well as men.<br/><br/>To answer Deputy Clarke's questions on the gender side, when the commission made that recommendation for 35%, it raised an awful lot of eyebrows.  We are at 7% at the moment, which is slightly better than where we were a few years ago but not much.  The commission was insistent that we need one third of our Defence Forces to be women in the future.  That is the best way of dealing with a lot of the cultural issues, which have been very problematic.  That is what happens when there are 95 men for every five women in the Defence Forces, or close to that.  Everybody, including the commission, accepts that getting to that 35% figure is going to take quite some time.</p></speech>

That also relates to participation in courses.  It is about trying to drive a priority of getting more women into the Defence Forces and also getting them higher up the scale in the Defence Forces, into positions of influence and so on.  We are going to have a head of transformation who in all likelihood will be a woman and that person will also be a civilian.  The head of HR will also be a civilian trying to bring in new ideas, new thinking and a fresh approach to how we grapple with these issues.  Both of those people will be reporting directly to the Chief of Staff.  In other words, that person will be very high up in the command and control structures in the Defence Forces.  That will be quite disruptive but I think that disruption is necessary.</p> <p>  Regarding Gormanstown, the Chief of Staff and the team are working on a plan, which has not been finalised yet.  It is about trying to increase the capacity significantly for training more people and maintaining very high standards in that training.  The way to answer the challenges in the Defence Forces is not to dumb down training or reduce the thresholds that people have to pass to be accepted into the Defence Forces or to be promoted.  Instead, it is about building a lot more capacity.  In order to do that, we have to build purpose-built facilities and Gormanstown is going to be at the centre of that.  Obviously, the Curragh will still be hugely central to everything the Defence Forces do.  Three-star training and so on will probably not be in Gormanstown but two-star training certainly will be.</p> <p>  On the difference between something being accepted in principle and accepted, I asked the same question when looking at how we were categorising things.  The only difference between those two things is that accepted means the recommendation is accepted for implementation.  In other words, we are accepting it and we know how we are going to deliver it.  Accepted in principle means that further consideration is required on the optimal approach to meeting the intent of the commission.  In other words, we agree it has to be done but we need to do some work on how we actually implement that in the optimal way.  That normally means the Defence Forces themselves, if it is a Defence Forces recommendation, have to go away and put a plan together and come back and get approval, or the Department needs to do it if it is the Department's side.</p> <p>  In most cases there is a civil-military team looking at how to implement what we all agree needs to be done but sometimes we need to get external expertise, or even international expertise, to make sure we have a plan that makes sense.  There is not really any question about the recommendations.  Once we accept something in principle, we are not going back.  It is just a question of how we get it done.  That is kind of the same for further evaluation or reverting as well.  There are not really any recommendations in the commission report, that I can think of, that we do not want to implement.  I am not aware of any.  It is just a question of being realistic.  If I recommend something, the Deputy will rightly ask when it will be done, what it will cost and how I am going to do it.  If I do not have those answers, then I cannot put it into the "accepted" box.  It has to be categorised as either further evaluation needed, accepted in principle or revert.  Once we move something into full acceptance, I need to be able to answer those questions of how, when, with whom and so on.</p></speech>

I am conscious of the clock as my other colleagues have to get in as well.  Does the Government intend scheduling some time in the D&aacute;il Chamber on this matter?  The Minister is going to the Seanad after this but if we had an opportunity to debate the commission or at least give statements in the next couple of weeks that would be very helpful.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister for his opening statement and for clarifying the funding issue.

That is still only half the EU average but it is half a step forward from our point of view.  Is there a table available, particularly for the next two budgets, which are the remaining budgets of the Thirty-third D&aacute;il?  Does the Minister have any idea where he would like to be with the 2024 and 2025 budgets?  I would just like some visibility on that.

The Minister said that does not include the Building Momentum pay deal that is currently being balloted on.  We obviously do not want to prejudge what the trade unions are going to say or do.  Perhaps the Minister might use this opportunity to state clearly that there will be additional money on the table through the Finance Bill if the Building Momentum pay deal is passed.  That would be very useful.</p> <p>  A big concern of mine, which I think is shared by all members of the committee, is the situation in Ukraine and how Ireland does not really have a big say in how that situation is going to develop.  The trajectory we are on at the moment is not reassuring.</p><p>There is a risk that the conflict could spread and could do so rapidly and very seriously.  Is there provision for additional funding if we need to scale up our Defence Forces at very short notice?  That is it on the funding side.</p><p> I welcome the general thrust of the opening statement.  I agree with 99% of it.  I highlight the last sentence of the second paragraph, which states: "However, the overarching theme was the urgent need for cultural transformation within the Defence Forces."  I agree that cultural transformation is a component that needs to be addressed, but for me the overarching theme of the report is Ireland's lack of military capability as a result of years of under-investment.  That is where the levels of ambition 1, 2 and 3 came from in the first place.</p><p> The implementation piece was correctly mentioned by my colleagues.  It was suggested that an independent chairperson would chair the implementation oversight group.  Do we have any idea who that person will be or when he or she will be appointed?</p><p> I thank the Minister for highlighting what the pay proposals are.  They are significant for people with less than three years' service.  A pay increase of &euro;5,000 to &euro;6,000 a year is significant.  I suspect everyone here would have confidence that if there is a central national wage agreement, it would be paid very quickly, but people in the Defence Forces do not have much trust in the sector-specific agreements.  I use the example of the &euro;1,000 pandemic bonus that was announced in January but still has not been paid.  What is the likelihood that these improvements for people with less than three years' service will come in before Christmas?  That is a realistic timetable and if it was delivered before Christmas, it would certainly assist from a morale point of view.</p><p> My final question is about the working time directive.  To clarify, will it be done by regulation or legislation?  The temptation here is to have a blanket exemption for everything.  Everybody accepts that the Defence Forces are different from other public servants, but a distinction should be made between what is an emergency or wartime period and what is normal peacetime.  We are trying to get people to join and stay in the Defence Forces, in particular from a gender-balance point of view.  The only way to do that is to make sure there is an appropriate work-life balance.</p></speech>

The commission report was a commitment in the programme for Government.  We should not be shy about acknowledging that the commitment has been honoured.  Like all reports and recommendations, it is now about the implementation.  I hear what the Minister has said about the 130 recommendations and I support the Chair's request for him to provide an update to us in a colour-coded or other format on the recommendations that have been accepted, those that require further evaluation and the ten that are outstanding.</p> <p>  I welcome much of what the Minister stated about the work that is already progressing on foot of the report on areas from HR to facilities and equipment, as well as the issues mentioned by Deputy Berry.  The Minister also stated that on foot of the report being accepted and approved by the Government with regard to the commitment to level of ambition 2 over six years, moving on to level of ambition 3, which relates to the aim to have achieved a level comparable with the defence forces in similar-sized European countries, a steering group will be put in place.  This will be headed by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach and will devise an implementation plan within six months.  That will be the roadmap that will set about delivering the changes on an annual basis, not only in the next two budgets but the four following budgets, as contained in the plan approved by the Government initially.  When does the Minister envisage the implementation plan being agreed by the group headed by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, and being open to evaluation, question and delivery by us and others?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.686" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1688" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022100400002#H00300"><p>The issue of recruitment and retention permeates all the matters raised.  While it is perhaps somewhat separate from the recommendations in the report, I would like to get the Minister's view on recruitment strategies and campaigns.  While I appreciate that he does not draw up or develop the campaigns, how important does the Minister believe it is that we ensure the campaigns are all-Ireland in nature?  Without being reductive on this issue, the bigger pond we fish in, the more chance there is of getting greater numbers.  In recent weeks, we had the freshers' fair at Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University and there were also visits to Belfast and Derry by some of the Naval Service vessels.  Should there not be an aspect of those events that incorporates a recruitment campaign that is targeted and directed across the Thirty-two Counties?  Many people from the North have served in the Defence Forces over long careers.  While I agree the Be More campaign is a very slick and professional marketing strategy, I am not sure how many members of the Defence Forces would agree it is reflective of their lived experience.  I have seen it on RT&Eacute;, but I have not seen it on UTV.  Does the Minister agree that we need to target such campaigns in order to ensure we get the highest number of men and women recruited across the entire country?  Sin an m&eacute;id.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.687" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Chairperson" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022100400002#H00400"><p>A number of questions have been asked.  Just in case we do not get an opportunity for a further round, and having regard to the clock, I add my appreciation and thanks to those involved in the preparation and publication of this report.  Chapter 6, Capability Requirements for a 21st Century Defence Force, lays bare in very stark and certain terms very serious inadequacies in our Defence Forces.  The publication of the report was just prior to the unlawful invasion by Russia of Ukraine.  Hence, it appears to me to suggest a sense of urgency involved here.  I acknowledge the significant increase in expenditure that the Minister managed to secure in the recent budget, which all members very much welcome.  Could he share with us how vulnerable he believes Ireland is in the context of certain issues that are germane to current world affairs?  We saw what happened last week in respect of the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline.  Russia stands accused of being responsible for four explosions in the Baltic Sea.  We discussed with the Minister earlier this year the situation in the Atlantic, not too far from our territorial waters.  How best does the Minister feel he can address issues of urgency?  In other words, do we know the purpose of the Russian naval exercises earlier this year?  Does the Minister acknowledge the fact that Ireland is particularly vulnerable?  Do we or will we have the capacity to monitor the cables?  Do we acknowledge that we do not have the capacity at times to know what is going on in close proximity to our territorial waters?  I accept the reliance that we have on our allies but at some stage in the future, will we be in a position to set our own strategic objectives?  In terms of timescale and investment to deal with the matter of maritime capacity, how soon will we be in a position to guard and protect the strategic cables within our territorial waters?  Will current global uncertainties in many ways hasten the type of investment all of us on this committee and the Minister himself would like to see take place?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.688" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022100400002#J00100"><p>I will try to answer every question if I can.  I will answer Deputy Berry's eight questions first.  I certainly hope we will have time to debate this in the D&aacute;il.  As Minister for Defence, the more we can debate defence issues, the better.  We have to ensure that there is a realistic understanding of why defence matters, why we need to resource it properly, why the work of the commission is arguably the most strategic report that has been produced for the defence sector since independence and why we need to implement it in full and, therefore, the answer to the Deputy's first question is "Yes".</p> <p>  The funding will be &euro;1.5 billion at 2022 prices.  I insisted on defence budgets being effectively linked to inflation.  Given what is happening in Ukraine and other parts of the world, we will see significant increases in the cost of defence equipment.  The Deputy will know that only too well.  Virtually every country in the EU is increasing defence budgets significantly.  Many of them have shared defence equipment, weapons and ammunition with Ukraine and they will want to rebuild stocks.  The last thing I wanted to sign up for was to have funding of &euro;1.5 billion by 2028 and to find that it was lower than what we have today in real value.  We have agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that we will take the prices before the Ukraine war started and before the commission reported, which was in January 2022.  We will use the defence procurement prices in January 2022 as a benchmark.  We have agreed the defence budget will be &euro;1.5 billion in those prices.</p> <p>  I will give the Deputy an educated guesstimate.  Even with a modest figure of 4% to 6% inflation, though I think it will be higher than that, then we will need to spend between &euro;1.8 billion and &euro;2 billion on defence budgets by 2028.  It may be even higher, though we will have to wait and see.  That will be determined by circumstance, inflation and so on.  We have pegged it clearly to a point in time when we knew the prices.  That protects the defence budget in a way that is helpful.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about tabling what the budgets would look like.  It would have been unreasonable for me to ask the Government, particularly the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to agree exact figures for each year over the next six years.  The Government would not agree to that precedent because many other Departments would demand the same.  We have a clear commitment regarding where we need to be by 2028 and we need incremental steps to get there.  When what I hope and expect will be an accepted pay deal is added, it will be worth &euro;47 million or maybe slightly higher or lower.  It has to be finalised with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but that will be the approximate impact of the agreement on both pay and pensions.  Adding the &euro;67 million of extra expenditure comes to a total of approximately &euro;115 million extra in one year.  There has never been such an increase in the defence budget that I can point to.</p> <p>  There is a capacity issue in the first couple of years of getting the numbers to where we need them to be, according to the commission's report, in recruitment and in the capacity to deliver capital investment, whether it is for new ships, airplanes, APC fleets, or anything else.  The procurement lead-in times will mean that some capital investment will be towards the end of that six-year period rather than the front.  Given that, increasing our overall spending on defence by more than &euro;100 million in the first year is not a bad start.  I would have taken more if I could.  It signals that we are trying to address the commission's report seriously.</p> <p>  The detailed reports that I get about what is happening in Ukraine are depressing.  The loss of life there has been extraordinary.  The resilience, courage and success of the Ukrainian military in recent weeks has been extraordinary.  The Ukrainians are on the front foot.  They are gaining ground and retaking parts of Ukraine that were lost to Russia.  They are, unfortunately, uncovering atrocities as they do that.  We will continue to support Ukraine's efforts in that regard.  I hope Russia is not willing to use weapons that many of us regard as completely unacceptable and off-limits to ever use, in an effort to save face or try to change momentum on the battlefield.  The world would respond to that in a significant way should Russia do that.  I hope we will not see the Kremlin making such decisions.</p> <p>  Regarding cultural transformation, the Deputy made a distinction regarding the overarching theme.  I know he read the commission's report.  There are three or four chapters dealing with human resource management in the Defence Forces.  That is not an accident, but because we are not managing people as well as need to, first, to keep them in the Defence Forces and, second, to get the diversity that we want and need in the Defence Forces.  In particular, we need to increase the number of women to a double digit percentage and then beyond that.  Human resource management, how people are paid, how complaints are dealt with, how allowances are applied, the structure of recruitment and retention campaigns, promotions and transparency about them, and linking that in with a command and control structure, since this has to function as a military, is a significant challenge.  That is why cultural transformation and how we manage people is such a big theme.</p> <p>  I take the point that capability was a significant exposure.  It was not a big surprise for me; I suspect it was not a surprise for other people who follow defence issues.  Having capacity constraints and gaps pointed out in such a blunt, clear and stark manner, as the Chairman said, has been helpful for me in getting the Government and Cabinet to sign off on an investment plan which will change much of that.</p> <p>  We have approached a number of people about the role of an independent chair but they have not been able to do it because of other commitments.  I hope to have that position filled soon.  I have a number of people in mind.  It is an important position.  I need to ensure that the Defence Forces and many others, including the Department, will trust that the chair is genuinely independent of the system and able to assess progress in delivering on the goals we are setting ourselves in a fair and blunt manner.  I hope to have that position filled in the next few weeks.  That independent group has met on a temporary basis, chaired by the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General, but that is just a temporary situation.</p> <p>  I do not want to give the Deputy an exact date for changes to pay and pay allowances.  We are making some progress with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister for Defence cannot just decide to change allowances even when a commission report recommends it.</p><p>We have to get agreement from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  As I said, we are making some good progress on some of those areas, particularly around the military service allowance and so on.  Hopefully, people who have entered the Defence Forces in their first few years will see the benefit of that soon.</p><p> By the way, I will just say that I share the frustration about the pandemic bonus payment.  To promise that in February and still not have it delivered for some people who will clearly qualify for it at the start of October is really not where we need to be.</p></speech>

What would the Minister think about the Department of Defence paying this, recognising that the Department of Health is supposed to do so?  Could the Department of Defence actually front-load the payment and ask the Department of Health to reimburse it?  The Department of Defence would take ownership of this to pay its own people and then get reimbursed thereafter.</p></speech>

I spoke to the Minister for Health about it as recently as last week and he also understands the urgency of the situation.  It is not just the Defence Forces, by the way; other people are waiting for this and it needs to be paid soon.  To be fair, the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is very much on the same page in wanting to move this on.</p> <p>  The working time directive will require legislation.  It will not be through statutory instruments; it will require legislation.  Some exemptions are needed to make sure the military can do what it needs to do in the environments in which its personnel work.  As far as I am concerned, however, where work can be scheduled in terms of training programmes and so on, we should be consistent with the working time directive in as many areas as we possibly can while, at the same time, ensuring that the Chief of Staff and his team are happy that they can deliver for the State in the areas in which they are expected to deliver from a defence and security perspective.</p> <p>  In terms of Deputy Cowen's questions, this was very much a joint commitment in the programme for Government.  It has been transformative for the Defence Forces and now we need to deliver it and accelerate its implementation.  In my view as Minister for Defence, when we get to level of ambition 2, we should not be stopping there.  I would like to see a future Government make a decision to go beyond level of ambition 2 because I think we need to.  As an international non-military aligned neutral country, capacity probably needs to in time go beyond level of ambition 2.  We have to get there first as a staging point, however.  That is what the Government has made a decision on.  Between now and 2028, we get to level of ambition 2 and then we build from there if a future Government decides that is the right thing to do.  We will have done much of the work in advance of that to actually prepare for that decision if we want to go beyond level of ambition 2 at that point.  As the commission said, however, we cannot get to level of ambition 3 unless we put the foundations and platform in place that is level of ambition 2, which is where we are heading.</p> <p>  On when the implementation plan will be agreed, first of all, we have agreed much implementation already in the 38 areas in which there are early actions under way.  If members look at the high-level implementation plan that is in place already, each action has next to it a label of "Further Evaluation", "Accept in Principle", "Accept" or "Revert".  Therefore, members can see exactly what we have committed to do on all of the 130 areas.  What we do not have yet is a timeline in terms of the delivery of each of them and that is what we will have to develop in terms of the civil military co-operation that is going on at the moment.  The implementation of that, of course, will be overseen by the oversight group, which will have an independent chair.  It is really important that we have an independent chair who is outside the public and Department systems, as well as the Defence Forces system and that he or she is seen as genuinely independent and, obviously, competent to do it.</p></speech>

It was noted by the commission that when its representatives visited both Finner Camp and Dundalk, there were a particularly high number of people in the Defence Forces from north of the Border.  It is a fair point that we should ensure that our recruitment campaigns are all-island.  So far, that has not been the case but I believe there is a real appetite in Northern Ireland to join the Irish Defence Forces and we should take advantage of that.  It is a fair point.</p> <p>  I am not avoiding that question on vulnerability.  We could spend much time talking about Nord Stream 1 and 2 and sabotage and so on.  All I can say is that we are having, and already had, meetings with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  We also had meetings with that Department, Gas Networks Ireland and EirGrid to look at infrastructure offshore.  We are currently agreeing with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications how we might respond to that in terms of increasing the number of patrols in those areas, both from the Naval Service and the Air Corps.  The owners of that infrastructure also have responsibility.  For example, EirGrid has a private sector global company monitoring cables under the sea.  It is important to also say that most of that infrastructure, particularly the pipelines, is actually encased in concrete and under the seabed.  There are, therefore, already pretty secure pieces of infrastructure.  As members would expect, however, we are reviewing that at the moment.  I think we will see increased Naval Service and Air Corps presence in the parts of the sea where infrastructure is under the seabed.  There is also an equipment issue that we obviously need to review and look at to see whether we need to factor it into the capital investment programme we have.</p></speech>

From the HSE, we are joined by Ms Ann Marie Part, Dr. Deirdre Mulholland and Ms Deirdre Lavin.  The opening statements have been circulated to members.</p> <p>    I will begin with a note on privilege.  Before we begin, I want to remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  For witnesses attending in the committee room, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contributions to today's meetings.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  Both members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy.  It is my duty as Chair to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I will also note that there are housing statements starting in the D&aacute;il Chamber from about 3.50 p.m.  Members may have to leave and come back, but that is no indication of their interest in the subject, which we are very pleased to have the witnesses here to discuss.</p> <p>  I invite the witnesses to make their opening statements.  I will call Dr. Ryan from the EPA first and then call Ms Part from the HSE.  Please keep your opening remarks to five minutes.

I am Dr. Tom Ryan, director of environmental enforcement with EPA.  I am joined by EPA senior management colleagues Mr. Noel Byrne, Ms Mary Gurrie and Dr. Michelle Minihan, all of whom have various responsibilities for water quality issues within the remit of the EPA, which is very broad.  It includes acting as the drinking water quality regulator for public water supplies; enforcing wastewater authorisations; co-ordinating and implementing the national monitoring programme to assess and report on water quality; and assessing the impact of human activities and pressures on the status of water bodies.  In this context, the EPA publishes a series of reports annually including the drinking water quality in public supplies report; the urban wastewater treatment report; and the water quality in Ireland report, all of which are due for publication over the next few weeks.</p> <p>  The last time EPA was invited to address this committee was in October 2021 in the aftermath of two very serious incidents at drinking water treatment plants in Ballymore Eustace and Gorey towards the end of summer 2021.  At that time, EPA highlighted our concerns that the existing arrangements for the delivery of safe drinking water in terms of managerial oversight, operational control and responsiveness were not working satisfactorily and were posing an unacceptable risk to public health by failing to ensure safe and secure drinking water.  I will take the opportunity of this opening statement to update the committee on the current status of drinking water quality, with some remarks about water quality generally in Ireland.</p> <p>  Our drinking water is sourced from our rivers, lakes, springs and groundwater and must be treated to make it clean and safe to drink before it is supplied to people.  To that end, the EPA is the drinking water quality regulator, which is responsible for enforcing the drinking water regulations.  Irish Water is responsible for providing the public water services and ensuring that drinking water quality meets the standard in the regulations and that it is "clean and wholesome" for consumption.  Irish Water has responsibility under the regulations for approximately 800 drinking water treatment plants in Ireland, for the most part operated by local authorities under a service level agreement for Irish Water.</p> <p>  The EPA enforces the drinking water quality regulations through an annual programme of audits, assessments and through promotion of our remedial action list, known as the "RAL".  The RAL is a dynamic list of public water supplies that EPA has identified as priorities for significant action and investment by Irish Water to improve plant performance and resilience in supplying drinking water.  A supply may be placed on the RAL if it cannot provide drinking water that is free from certain microbiological or chemical substances, or if the treatment plant is not operated effectively and correctly.  It is important to emphasise that compliance with the microbiological and chemical standards for drinking water supplies remains high, at greater than 99.7%, which means that the water in our public water supplies is safe to drink.  In addition, Irish Water had reduced the number of people served by RAL supplies from just over 1 million to approximately 370,000 at the end of 2021, which was a positive and very welcome development.</p> <p>  Some key achievements by Irish Water in 2021 included the commissioning of a new plant at Vartry, serving approximately 127,000 people, and an upgrade of Leixlip, serving approximately 590,000 people.  Those supplies were subsequently removed from the RAL.  However, issues at a number of other of other treatment plants in the first half of this year have reversed some of these positive gains.  The number of people currently served by supplies on the RAL stands at approximately 560,000 consumers.  This reversal underscores the challenge that, while water quality remains high, drinking water treatment in many supplies is still not as resilient as it needs to be to ensure the supply is safe into the future.</p> <p>  The EPA&rsquo;s 2021 drinking water quality report, which will be published later this week, sets out in detail the main issues affecting the quality of the drinking water supplied by Irish Water that require action, including ensuring adequate disinfection; reducing the levels of trihalomethanes, THMs; addressing poor treatment control processes; and the need to replace lead water mains and household pipes.</p> <p>  I will highlight two issues for the purpose of this opening statement.  The first is persistent THM failures.  The number of people affected by THM failures has increased in 2022 by over 133,000 people due to five supplies being added to the RAL.  This erodes the progress that was made in 2021, particularly following the commissioning of the new water treatment plant at Vartry.  It should also be noted that the European Commission is progressing infringement proceedings against Ireland for failure to address THM compliance.</p> <p>  The second issue I would like to highlight is poor treatment control processes.  At the end of 2021, 24 supplies were on the RAL for poor treatment control processes.  While it is an essential step to have all required infrastructure in place, a water treatment plant must also be managed and operated correctly and be able to adapt and respond to changing conditions and to incidents, in particular.  Essential alarms, monitors and staff training are critical prerequisites for a well-run drinking water treatment plant.</p><p>An inadequate response to plant alarms was a significant contributor to the incidents in the Gorey and Ballymore Eustace plants, which in the case of Gorey resulted in illness and hospitalisations in 2021.</p><p> I will turn briefly to the issue of boil-water notices, or water restrictions, that Irish Water imposes from time to time in consultation with our colleagues in the HSE.  While boil water notices are a cause of inconvenience to people, they are necessary to ensure that members of the public do not consume water that could be contaminated and make them ill.  Boil-water notices increased significantly in 2021 and affected far more people than in 2020.  More than 211,000 people were affected in 2021 compared to fewer than 75,000 in 2020.  However, this increase is attributed to improved vigilance by Irish Water and staff training after the Gorey and Ballymore Eustace incidents.  The primary cause of the need to impose such restrictions is a failure in the disinfection or pathogen-removal processes.  Assessments and improvements under Irish Water's national disinfection programme are continuing but clearly have not yet proved sufficiently robust to mitigate the need for boil-water notices.</p><p> I will move on to the drinking water legislative framework.  It should be noted that the framework will undergo a significant amendment with the transposition of the new drinking water directive which is due before January 2023.  The EPA continues to work with the Department and other stakeholders in support of that process.  The transposition will bring new and more challenging drinking-water-standard requirements and will also provide an opportunity to address some gaps identified by the EPA in the enforcement regulatory framework.</p><p> I will finish with a few brief remarks about the general water quality in Ireland.  In short, water quality in Ireland is not as good as it should be.  Our rivers, lakes, estuaries and groundwaters continue to be under pressure from human activities such as agriculture, forestry, wastewater discharges and physical changes like land drainage.  Slightly more than half of surface waters are in a satisfactory condition, which means that a large number are not in good ecological health.  These are unable to sustain healthy ecosystems and are failing to meet the legally binding water-quality objectives set by the EU water framework directive because of pollution and other human disturbance.  Urgent action is essential to drive and sustain improvements while preventing further deterioration through the implementation of the next river-based management plan.</p><p> I assure the committee that the EPA will continue to monitor and report on water quality issues, provide regulatory oversight of Irish Water and work closely with the HSE and the Department with the primary objective of ensuring the protection of human health and the environment.</p></speech>

I am assistant national director for environmental health at the HSE and I am joined by my colleagues Dr. Deirdre Mulholland, area director of public health; and Dr. Deirdre Lavin, regional chief environmental health officer.<br/><br/>The safety and quality of drinking water has a direct influence on the health of consumers.  As the committee is aware, a number of bodies are involved in ensuring the supply of drinking water.  The responsibility for the provision and supply of safe drinking water rests with Irish Water, local authorities, committees of group water schemes and those who individually provide their own drinking water.  The EPA is the drinking-water-quality regulator responsible for enforcing the drinking water regulations for public water supplies.  The HSE has a key role in assessing and advising on potential risks to human health.  The HSE has a statutory role in the context of drinking water as a statutory consultee under Regulation No. 9(1) of the EU (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014 and has a further role under public medical officer of health legislative provisions to investigate and prevent spread from probable sources of infection, including water.<br/><br/>In accordance with the drinking water regulations, where Irish Water or a local authority considers that a supply of water intended for human consumption constitutes a potential danger to human health, it must consult with the HSE.  The water service authority is obliged in so doing to obtain the agreement of the HSE on the action it proposes to take to protect human health.  I have attached an excerpt from the drinking water regulations for the committee's ease of reference.<br/><br/>The environmental health service and departments of public health are the main services within the HSE with which water services authorities interact about drinking water safety.  In addition, HSE laboratories provide analysis of clinical samples and microbiological expertise for the management of some drinking water issues.  In some laboratories, they also provide analysis of water samples.  To enable the application of Regulation 9, statutory consultation, an agreed process, referred to as the management of initial notification of drinking water issues of potential danger to human health, is in place.<br/><br/>In summary, an initial notification record, INR, has been developed and implemented by all those with an interest in the provision and monitoring of safe drinking water.  The process outlines the consideration and steps to be followed by the appropriate parties when dealing with a water incident.  On becoming aware of an incident in the supply, Irish Water or the relevant local authority undertakes a review and a risk assessment to determine whether it is necessary to consult with the HSE in accordance with Article 9 of the drinking water regulations and prepares a submission to the EPA.<br/><br/>Initial contact with the HSE national environmental health service is made via the local principal environmental health officer, EHO.  The principal EHO will assess the information provided and further consider the matter in consultation with colleagues in the local public health department to ensure a consistent and cohesive engagement within the HSE and in response to the water service provider.  The INR procedure also outlines the steps to be followed by the HSE environmental health service and public health departments, should they become aware of water incidents on foot of their work.  The identification of potential cases or outbreaks may come about due to public health monitoring of infectious disease notifications.<br/><br/>If a drinking water issue is of sufficient seriousness and complexity an incident response team, IRT, will be convened and chaired by the local authority or by Irish Water as appropriate.  The incident response team includes representatives of the various relevant agencies that have an input into the provision of safe drinking water.  In the event of an outbreak of infectious disease where a drinking water source is suspected to be the cause of illness, the HSE may request that the water services authority convene an IRT.  If a HSE outbreak control team is also convened, the outbreak control team, OCT, will liaise with the incident response team and<i>vice versa</i>as appropriate.<br/><br/>Separately, the national drinking water group within the HSE is an interdisciplinary forum to support best practice and promote competence of HSE personnel who have a role in the protection of public health in relation to drinking water.  It reports to the relevant heads of service for environmental health and public health and includes representatives from the environmental health service, public health departments, health protection surveillance centre, microbiology and public analysts laboratory services.<br/><br/>My colleagues and I are happy to assist the committee in any way we can on the subject of water supply and quality.</p></speech>

It seems an inordinate length of time to wait for a 2021 report.  There are many agencies and bodies are in the country.  Farmers who were at the agriculture committee a number of weeks ago were exasperated that it takes so long to produce this report.  Many staff and a lot of money are allocated to this.  Why is a 2021 drinking water report not issued until October 2022, especially in the context of all the issues the EPA highlighted about water quality?</p></speech>

We endeavour to get these reports out as quickly as possible.  As the Deputy can imagine, a huge amount of data has to be assessed in order to draw the conclusions that go into the reports.  We get that data from Irish Water.  Each year we try to get through that process more quickly.  We had hoped to get it out during the summer this year and it is our intention for next year, but I appreciate the comments.</p> <p>  Of course the report is not the only thing we do in enforcement of these matters.  While the report highlights the issues for the public and the committee, we are working with Irish Water, the Department and with stakeholders as issues arise during the year.

Dr. Ryan led with water quality and stated that agriculture, forestry and physical changes such as land drainage are the big issues.  The farming community would take big issue with that.  There are a lot more factors at play in terms of water quality.  Has the EPA not seen a huge change in farming?  Has it not seen farmers engage with the process and be inordinately proactive over the past ten years in particular as regards water quality?</p></speech>

Our reports are just reflective of the sources that impact on water quality.  We know that there is a huge amount of work going on with farmers and the farming community in terms of best practice, smart farming, mitigation and all of that.  That feeds into the river basin management plan and the targets and ambitions around catchment management.  We are very much aware of the engagement of the farming community in that process.</p></speech>

I acknowledge from the presentations and from what the representatives tell us that when boil water notices kick in that the factors or transgressions are marginal before they implement a boil water notice.  When a boil water notice comes into play, how proactive are they?  Is it in real time that they are assessing the information and making a decision?  For example, we had a boil water notice in Longford a number of months ago that caused a lot of frustration.  To give comfort to the wider public how quickly does the HSE respond to that information when it receives it and how quickly are does it unenforce boil water notices?</p></speech>

We are very conscious of the impact they have on society and the community and on economics.  However, when they are introduced they are introduced because that is what is needed to protect public health.  That is the reason that the environmental health service and the public health service are called upon for advice by Irish Water.  We respond to those consultations very quickly.  We respond to them out-of-hours, if required.  They are done through an agreed process; they are done by phone call initially and then they are followed up.  We monitor and work with the local authority and Irish Water, and the EPA, if necessary, to ensure that every action is taken as quickly as possible to lift them.  The time that boil water notices used to apply has reduced significantly but it is certainly not something that is done lightly; it is done because we feel that there is no other option.</p></speech>

In Irish Water 30 days is considered a long time for a boil water notice.  Is there any reflection or report done afterwards or any accountability when a boil water notice is implemented?  For example, regarding the boil water notice in Longford, is there anything we can say to the public that it will never happen again and that steps have been taken to ensure whatever transgressions occurred there in water quality, safeguards are in place?  Do we learn from them or do we just deal with them, move on and not take any actions?</p></speech>

The EPA performed an on-site audit there in late November 2021 - I do not have the exact date here today - and we were accompanied, I believe, by the HSE, Irish Water and Longford County Council on the day.  The risks were very clearly there and acknowledged by everyone on-site and the boil water notice was necessary to protect public health.  An ongoing upgrade of the Longford central plant under way to address a few issues there - both trihalomethanes, THMs, and filter performance.

I thank Dr. Ryan, in particular, for continuing to be very frank with this committee in his presentations.  The three reports that have published make for very uncomfortable reading year-on-year but, as a committee, we would do ourselves an injustice if we did not take the facts in those reports seriously because that is exactly what they are.  This is very timely because the purpose of these discussions and the series of meetings we are having on water quality generally but tomorrow the Water Environment (Abstractions and Associated Impoundments) Bill 2022 will finally make its way through the Houses starting with the Seanad  and, therefore, this debate and the debate on that legislation are very timely.</p> <p>  I have three questions for the EPA.  First, to go from 370,000 to 560,000 people is a 51% increase in a very short period.  Can Dr. Ryan give us a sense of the reasons for that from the data he has and also the severity?  It is 560,000 people I presume rather than households but there are varying levels of negative drinking water quality that is impacted.  Any extra information on that would be helpful.</p> <p>   The second relates to my usual bugbear, which is the ongoing infringement procedures by the European Commission for breaches of the urban wastewater treatment directive.  Can Dr. Ryan give his view on where that is at and where progress has been made and if any are slipping behind?</p> <p>  It is also important to remember we have significant deadlines under the water framework directive of 2027.  Given Dr. Ryan's stark concluding remarks, which I thank him for, because no matter how difficult the truth may be for us to handle we should get the truth, how optimistic or concerned is he that those key targets for 2027 will be met?  That specifically relates to his third more general water quality report due to be published.</p></speech>

Six supplies were removed from the remedial action list last Friday, which is a measure of some progress.  We did, however, add 11 supplies to the remedial action list.  Five of those were for persistent THM exceedances and notable among those was the Clareville plant in Limerick city, which serves approximately 114,000 people and, therefore, that accounts for a considerable jump in the population on our remedial action list.  A number of supplies went on for EPA audit observations where we found issues at plants.  Another large supply was the Srowland water treatment plant in Kildare, which serves four different water supply zones, and we had other isolated issues around supplies on long-term boil water notices.  We had poor turbidity removal in some of them and inadequate treatment for cryptosporidium.  There was a variety of reasons but the vast majority of them were for THM exceedances.</p></speech>

According to the 2021 figures, 51% of our wastewater load met the standards.  That compares to 90% across the EU average.</p><p>As the committee can see, we have a good bit to catch up on in that space.  The big facility in that situation is Ringsend - bringing it into compliance.  Works are progressing at Ringsend.  They did the upgrade of the 400,000 population equivalent additional capacity in 2021.  They are upgrading the other 24 units over the next two to three years.  By 2025, they hope to have all of the works completed on Ringsend, with the aim of being compliant with the directive at that point.</p><p> Our current priority area lists identify 12 sites where Irish Water failed to meet the directive requirements in 2021.  We have to bring those 12 sites into compliance to achieve that.  As I said, Ringsend is the big one in that space.  I suppose one-----</p></speech>

It is important to acknowledge that, while there have been significant problems, in Mr. Byrne's view, has there been significant progress?</p></speech>

We highlighted that from our perspective.  We want work done in this space.  Indeed, Ringsend is going to be a game-changer in that space.  Once we get to 2025 and we see 40% of the load achieving compliance, that will be a very good day for Ireland to achieve that.  Challenges will remain around the collection systems.  There are a number of collection systems involved in that infringement, which will prove to be big challenges, particularly around Cork city and similar places, which will require significant investment.  At the moment, Irish Water are looking at what needs to be done in Cork city under drainage area plans, but once they establish what needs to be done, they will have to see about putting a plan in place to address that.</p></speech>

In fact, in our submission on the draft river basin management plan, we welcomed the call for higher ambition and called for that to be clearly articulated in the final plan.  We did say that the objectives would not be met with the measures in the current plan.  We know there are decades of investment needed on our wastewater systems - several more cycles certainly.  Agriculture is the most widespread significant pressure and a lot of work needs to happen on that.  We need a regime for the hydromorphological pressures.  There is a lot of work happening, but there is a way to go on delivering the water quality improvements still.  We do have the science and evidence is improving all the time.  Knowing what the problem is and being able to identify the measures needed has advanced a lot in recent years.  We know what needs to be done; it is a question of trying to get it done.</p></speech>

I am not being parochial even though I could probably be accused of being so in referencing some areas in my constituency in County Waterford but what I am trying to do is tease out the process that occurs when an issue is identified and what stages are followed to remediate the issue.  It was stated to the HSE that 30 days was a significant time.  An estate in Kilmeaden, County Waterford has been on a boil water notice since February this year.  Another in Touraneena has been on a boil water notice since 7 September.  Will the witnesses talk me through the process from when the alert is sent out?  Of course, everybody gets that.  It is Irish Water's issue to resolve, and I will tease that out with them.  What in the process is done, either from the HSE's or the EPA's perspective, specifically on the boil water notices?</p></speech>

We are never slow in deciding or determining that it is the correct time to lift a boil water notice but it is always done with that consideration of the protection of public health.  We need to be sure that the necessary measures are in place.  You see that through the testing mechanism that has provided the results that come in.  If they are not indicating that supply is "wholesome and safe", we are not in a position to lift that notice.  Protection of public health is paramount across the board.</p></speech>

That boil water notice was in place for a few weeks back in September.  If that inspection determines that further enforcement action is required to identify a problem that could recur and needs to have a solution in place, then we will assess that when the audit report is completed and we have gone through the due process of doing that.  If we need to take further enforcement actions such as placing it on our remedial action list or issuing a direction to Irish Water, we will do so once we get the findings of today's audit back to us.</p> <p>  On the other estate on a long-term boil water notice since February, there is a plan in place to connect it.  That will be in 2023.  That boil water notice is necessary to protect public health because there is poor turbidity removal there and, therefore, it is a necessary measure.  The long-term plan is to rationalise that supply - to do away with it - and connect to Cappoquin.</p></speech>

Ms Levin probably meant Touraneena when she spoke about the two supplies.  I understand that Irish Water have a plan to resolve the F&aacute;n Glas issue.</p> <p>  Is it a recommendation from the HSE in general that tankers should be provided?  Is that something the HSE would have an opinion on?</p></speech>

Another issue has arisen in Bonmahon, County Waterford.  I have a report open in front of me from one of the EPA inspectors from April of this year.  It was prepared by Dr. John Feehan, on the agglomeration in Bonmahon, of which there are three elements.  From the recommendations made in this report, clearly there are ongoing issues in the area.  It is very close to a beach and it affects the streams upriver.  I have been liaising with Irish Water on this with the intention of getting it onto the small towns and villages growth programme and-or another development.  How does something go from a report in April, which clearly identifies serious deficiencies in the area, to getting actioned, from the agency's perspective?</p></speech>

When a report is done, the EPA will complete that report and identify the actions that are needed.  That gets sent to Irish Water.  What we request from Irish Water then is that it puts a plan in place to address the issues at that particular wastewater treatment plant to achieve compliance with the licence.  Irish Water will be given the report, it gets specific actions to do and then the agency will follow up with Irish Water on how they progress those actions.</p></speech>

I too believe significant work is being done by the agriculture sector to try to minimise the problems, but I am not so certain about the impact of forestry.  Maybe that is an omission by me in not knowing the issue in as much detail as I perhaps should.  Will the witnesses briefly outline how they see the impact of forestry?  Is it the machinery required to fell trees or is it perhaps something else?</p></speech>

I am just checking my notes.  Forestry is now the second most significant pressure on water quality.  Some 223 water bodies are impacted by forestry.  A legacy issue exists in that forestry was historically planted on the wrong sites, for example, on upland sites that were considered bad land and maybe fit for nothing else.  These are sensitive locations, however, as they tend to be where our highest quality water bodies are also located.   They get impacted by sediment run-off, nutrients, pesticides, changes in the flow and hydromorphology, as we call it, from drainage associated with forestry, which tends to impact on these more sensitive waters.  That legacy issue needs to managed.  The particular activities also tend to have an impact.  When a forest is stable it tends to be lower risk but when activities such as felling and road building take place, that is when they need the most management.  Proper management and oversight are needed at that stage to make sure issues do not arise.</p></speech>

I have a construction background, having worked in the sector all my life.  I also have a farming background as I grew up on a farm.  Dr. Ryan highlighted four main issues.  He may have heard from my previous contributions, including in the D&aacute;il, that I go into the local authorities when it comes to pollution.  Before I was elected a Deputy, I sat on the council representing the Adare-Rathkeale district for six years.  The EPA was mentioned with reference to the number of times it has visited the water treatment plant at Askeaton, on which no action has been taken.  People have been waiting for an upgrade of the sewerage system for 33 years.  It is a three-bed system which has not been used in a number of years.  Irish Water fixed man-holes and pipeworks at the site last year but the problem is that the sewerage goes directly to the Shannon.</p> <p>  In Dromcolliher, the biggest polluter in the River Deel is the local authority.  If I jump across to the River Loobagh, the biggest polluter there is the local authority.  When I went around County Limerick, I saw that Oola was operating at capacity.  Irish Water has stated it will upgrade the existing systems but will not allow for any extra capacity.  That has been going on for years.</p> <p>  In Hospital, where 26 new houses were built, there was capacity for only 21 houses so five were connected to a treatment system on a site, while the others were connected to a system that came up directly through the streets.</p> <p>  In Kilbehenny, Irish Water took over a system that only had three houses connected to it.  However, it did not even know that 27 houses were connected directly to a system that was going into the rivers.  </p> <p>  I am disappointed treatment systems are last on the EPA's list because local authorities and the treatment systems in the area are number one for us in Limerick.  They have not received investment for many years.  It is going on for decades and it is causing a problem for the EPA.  Irish Water has taken responsibility for water and sewerage in Limerick but 70 people employed by the county council are looking after this for Irish Water.  Many of these treatment and water systems do not have caretakers.  The information the EPA gets is from someone taking a sample now and then, but there is no proper caretaker.  I am in favour of what needs to be done and I see the vision the EPA has set out, but unless we tackle the biggest polluter in this country, our local authorities, we are not going anywhere.</p> <p>  The first sectors Dr. Ryan mentioned were farming and forestry.  I have a big problem with that.  Yes, problems may exist within farming but the sector is doing its bit.  The local authorities and Departments are not doing their bit and they are last on the EPA's list.  </p> <p>  The HSE has to issue boil water notices for public safety.  There is no doubt about it.  Luckily, after being lobbied here, Irish Water lifted a boil water notice after two years in Fedamore.  The water notice was needed for water safety but it was in place for two years.  People had to buy bottled water so they could have a cup of tea, give the children dilute orange or whatever.</p> <p>  While I understand the process, I do not understand the process for coming up with the four issues.  I have been on the road since I was 15 years old and I have been self-employed since I was 21.  I am in the construction industry so I understand this.  I understand the treatment systems but I also understand what happens if the existing treatment systems are not maintained.  They are not being maintained at the moment because the council has stopped maintaining them because it is waiting for Irish Water to take over the running of them.  By leaving them for years, it is creating a problem for the EPA to try to fix.  Making the council fix these issues is a big problem.  How many treatment systems in Limerick are not properly functional and how many systems in Limerick city and county are causing serious problems?  Massive investment is needed now for the protection of people in this area.  I ask Dr. Ryan to respond.</p></speech>

We will provide it, however, as it is something we track carefully.  Our brief for this meeting was water, water quality and water services.  We took the view beforehand that the focus of interest would be on drinking water.  That is how my opening statement was calibrated, but we have been here in the past talking only about wastewater.  We have a team in the EPA that only deals with wastewater treatment plants.  It charts Irish Water's progress and holds Irish Water to account to its plans.  That is a significant part of our activity-----</p></speech>

Limerick City and County Council has 70 water specialists who have been asked to change over to Irish Water under a section A or section B contract.  If none of them transfer to Irish Water and they remain within the remit of the council, as they can under their contracts, will Irish Water not be in big trouble?  The reason these staff do not want to go to Irish Water is that they will lose their public status and the number of years they have worked with the local authority.  The contracts of 70 people who run the water system delivering fresh water for people to drink in Limerick state they will stay within the local authority if they do not transfer to Irish Water.  This applies to 70 engineers and other qualified staff employed to look after the quality of water in Limerick city and county.  Does the EPA consider that a big problem?</p></speech>

The EPA issues the authorisation so regardless of whether Irish Water or the local authorities are responsible, we deal with the licensee, the holder of the authorisation, and hold it to compliance.  Regardless of who the holder is, we will regulate it.</p></speech>

I will focus on the issue of trihalomethane, THM, failures.  The EPA's opening statement notes that the number of people exposed to persistent THM failures has increased this year by 133,750.</p><p>That is a very significant figure.  Dr. Minihan suggested earlier that in most of the cases of the 560,000 people whose water supply requires remedial action, it can be attributed to exposure to THMs.  Does she have numbers to indicate in how many of those 560,000 cases that is the issue?  Can she give us an idea of what percentage of the overall number of people in the country have a water supply that is affected in this way?  I would welcome any indications in that regard.</p></speech>

Given that between 4 million and 4.2 million people are on public water supplies, it is probable that less than 10% of people are affected.  Nonetheless, it is a significant issue.  Unfortunately, we have seen a increase in the number of water supplies where we are detecting THMs.  Some 58 public water supplies failed to meet the standard in 2021, which was an increase on 35 public water supplies in 2020.  The good progress we had seen was reversed in 2021.  For THMs, the problem is persistence.  Irish Water needs to install treatment to remove the THMs and prevent them from forming, or optimise the plant to ensure they cannot form as water moves through the network to get to consumer's taps because that is where the point of compliance is.  Water does not just need to be compliant leaving the plant; it also needs to be compliant at consumer's taps in their homes.</p></speech>

In order for a supply to be assessed to go on the remedial action list, RAL, we will assess all the exceedances that have been reported to us.  Some of those are at the plant itself.  We will have non-compliance at the plant and in some cases we will have non-compliance at people's taps.  That is how the sampling programme is operated.  There is ongoing monitoring of how the plant is performing to ensure it is meeting the regulatory standards.  In the directive, however, the point of compliance is the consumer's taps.  If you are getting it in the plant, inevitably you will get it in consumer's taps.</p></speech>

They are moving forward in July of this year.  The European Commission has written to Ireland to tell us that we need to provide a response and that we will be going to the European Court of Justice on that.  As regards our results, we seem to be an outlier.  If we look at our nearest neighbour, we will see from the Drinking Water Inspectorate in England and Wales that they had two THM failures last year across 12,000 samples.  This means they had one failure each across two water supplies.  We had 58 public water supplies with THM exceedances last year.  We seem to be out of kilter with our nearest comparator on that.</p></speech>

We saw Vartry, which serves approximately 127,000 people, removed from the RAL at the end of last year.  A large upgrade there has resulted in approximately eight water supplies across north Wicklow and Dublin now being compliant for THMs.  That is really significant.  Some supplies with persistent THMs will be on our RAL through to 2026, which is far too long.  Action, which involves identifying a solution and putting it in place, has been delayed in those cases.  We have also seen supplies that had treatment installed for THMs, but that treatment has been unsuccessful and has not worked.  We added six supplies to our RAL for persistent THMs over the last 18 months, which means that progress which had been made is being eroded.</p></speech>

We have had two key achievements since many of them were with us this time last year.  I refer to the progress made at Vartry and to the Leixlip upgrade, which serves much of my constituency.  I welcome the significant investment of &euro;59 million in a 100 million l reservoir in Saggart, which will also serve my constituency when it is up and running.  I toured that site at the start of the summer.  I am really excited to hear about the benefits it will provide in terms of long-term water security for the greater Dublin region.  Much of what the witnesses said about public drinking water quality remaining so high is really encouraging.</p> <p>  However, it is disappointing to learn that many of the gains that have been made have already been eroded.  Why has that happened?  Last year Dr. Ryan and Dr. Minihan addressed the committee on a concerning report specific to Ballymore Eustace and to Gorey.  As they might recall, what concerned me, coming from a business background, was the lack of processing, the escalation path breakdowns and the weak business continuity planning.  They presented quite a detailed action plan that they felt would rectify a lot of that.  Is that happening?</p> <p>  I can see from what the HSE has outlined today that it has thorough incident response procedures and processes in train and in action.  They seem to be working quite well.  Does the HSE feel it is getting the necessary buy-in, collaboration and co-operation of the other agencies involved?  I do not know who wants to start.</p></speech>

There was a lot of concerted action after that to remedy the issues at both of those plants and to take the learnings from those incidents.  Irish Water carried out its own inspections of the top 20 plants across its fleet of plants, and we did something similar.  Many lessons were learned around that, particularly around the training of staff.  We are seeing the results of that coming through, almost perversely, with increased boil water notices.  As I said at the beginning, the issuing of such notices-----</p></speech>

The increase we are seeing means that incidents are being responded to, boil water notices are being issued in consultation with the HSE and people are being protected.  We are not there yet, however; there is a way to go.  We continually detect issues of that nature, albeit not as big as in Ballymore Eustace or in Leixlip in 2019.  There are ongoing issues.  We know that there is a transition from one delivery model to another.  That is a matter for the Department and Irish Water.  A great deal has been learned from those incidents and we are seeing it come through.</p> <p>  The increases and the reversals are very disappointing.  We have a report coming out at the end of this week which looks at 2021.  The picture at the end of 2021 was on a very positive trajectory, but we have seen those gains eroded because of five additional plants going on to the remedial action list for various reasons.</p><p>Dr. Minihan can add more detail on this point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.785" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Michelle Minihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022100400002#H00200"><p>It is disappointing to be adding five supplies to the remedial action list for persistent THM exceedances.  By persistent, we mean three or more months where we have seen this occur.  The Clareville treatment plant, because of its size, has caused those numbers to jump to 114,000 people.  We have had persistent THM exceedances there for six months of this year.  It is a persistent and ongoing problem, unfortunately, because of the way THMs form when organic matter reacts with the chlorine in the water that is used to disinfect it.  We cannot compromise disinfection, so we must add the chlorine.  What is key, however, is that the treatment processes at the plant are optimised and the network managed appropriately to ensure there is no additional THM formation as the water moves through the network.  For example, if it takes four days for water to move from the plant to the extremity of the networks, then for all that time there is potential for THMs to form.  It is key therefore to optimise the plant and to install whatever treatment processes are needed to remove THMs.  Equally important, though, is ensuring the distribution network is managed appropriately and that it is compliant as well.  I say this because it is compliance at consumers' taps that is the point of compliance.</p></speech>

It is fair to say, in the main, that we are satisfied we get timely notification of consultations around issues.  We have put in place a process in this regard.  Since Irish Water became an entity, that has made our interaction with water service providers easier.  Irish Water has an obligation to notify us and to consult with us.  Regarding whether that happens in a timely manner all the time, I suppose there are no absolutes in life and we have learned from experiencing some situations that there may have been a breakdown in communication along the way.  I agree with Dr. Ryan that a fair amount of learning has been derived from that experience.  Equally, though, from a health authority perspective, it behoves us all to be vigilant and cautious and to keep an eye on things as they progress.  Therefore, I would say there is still probably some room for improvement in this regard.</p></speech>

To be honest, I am concerned by some of the comments made.  On the 58 additional failures we had in 2021, and I am aware of the comment regarding finishing the year strongly, these were serious failures.  As Irish people, we have pride in how green the grass is and how clean the water is.  This is one of the reasons we are so famous around the world.  In this context, we are looking at how we compare with other European countries and what I am hearing is that we are at the bottom of the table and that we are not performing.  Is this an accurate assessment of where we are?</p></speech>

From a microbiological and chemical perspective, it is in compliance greater than 99.7%.  Therefore, it is very important to emphasise that drinking water is safe.  What we are primarily talking about here is resilience in this regard, the future performance of plants and their ability to keep performing like this.  There are particular issues around THMs and other issues that we continually call out in our reports that require action and investment.</p></speech>

I am a Deputy from Cork North-Central and we are losing 50% of our water every day.  We take water from the Lee and we are pumping it up into the Lee waterworks.  I remember one time in Cork when we had no water for nearly ten days because of flooding issues, which is unbelievable.  Are decades of underinvestment the reason we have these constant problems?  Would it be fair to say that is one of the reasons?</p></speech>

As Irish Water will point out, however, there have been significant improvements if we look back over the last decade.  Yet, we still have a long way to go and we are talking about another couple of decades of consistent investment to get the standard of drinking water services and wastewater services up to where they need to be.</p></speech>

I refer to a situation where we are looking at decades to achieve them.  We have a case against us now in this regard.  Will we be looking at multiple cases being taken against us for failure to hit our targets in this regard?</p></speech>

I respect the work they do and I thank them for being here.  To have an acknowledgement now, however, that it looks like we will have multiple cases taken against for breaches in respect of not reaching targets is an indictment in this regard.  Irish Water is now carrying the can for decades of underinvestment.  The point, however, is that we have targets that the Government has committed to and it has a duty of care then to ensure that Irish Water has the resources to tackle this undertaking.  I believe that water services should be in public ownership, that there should be a referendum on water to enshrine that right in the Constitution and that we should have a non-commercial semi-State entity.  We brought people onto the streets years ago to ensure this was the case.  People who fought to stop the privatisation of the water services might be listening now.  We are looking at how Irish Water is performing and we have the witnesses from the EPA and the HSE with us.  We are talking about the quality of drinking water and when we look at the figures, some 565,000 people have been impacted and 243,000 have ongoing problems.  As a percentage of the 4 million people who use the water services, these are huge figures.  Am I wrong in saying that?</p></speech>

We have clearly identified them and they have not changed in the years since Irish Water was formed and began operating.  These are around prioritising supplies on the remedial action list so they can be upgraded and safeguarded for the future.  Our remedial action list now has 57 supplies on it.  If we take it that there are 750 water treatment plants, then we are trying to focus on where the greatest risks are to ensure that drinking water quality is protected.  We recognise that we cannot invest in everything right now.  We must prioritise the risks and where we are investing to address such risks, and this is where the remedial action list came from.  These are the places where we needed to prioritise the risks because of the cryptosporidium outbreak in Galway almost 15 years ago.  This is what we have tried to do.</p> <p>   We have communicated these priorities to Irish Water.  We have also tracked them to ensure the company delivers against the dates it has communicated to us regarding when improvements will be delivered.  I am trying to contextualise how we prioritise, how we communicate our priorities to Irish Water concerning drinking water quality and how we safeguard our water supplies for the future and ensure their resilience.  I refer to ensuring our supplies are not just safe today but in future as well.  Dr. Ryan spoke about the current high levels of bacterial and microbiological compliance and it must be ensured this is safeguarded for the decades to come.</p></speech>

I have two points.  I am not sure if Mr. Byrne made the point earlier in relation to Cork.  My ears pricked up when he spoke.  I have huge concerns about the amount of lead piping in Cork city.  Cork is a very old city, especially the city centre.  We are losing 50% of our water.  How much of the old pipe system is lead?  Will the HSE or the EPA comment on the implications in relation to the health concerns.  I think of my daughters and making their bottles at night.  Did we realise the water we were giving our kids was coming through lead pipes?  I think Mr. Byrne said that there was no plan yet for Cork?  Can he clarify this?  A lot has been done by Irish Water in Cork but Mr. Byrne spoke about the plan.</p></speech>

It is the sewerage network that Irish Water is doing an assessment on.  It is doing a drainage area plan on the network to see where the issues are and what works need to be done to address it.  That is currently happening and then Irish Water will be putting investment behind that to deal with the issues found.  It is dealing with the sewerage I was speaking to earlier.</p></speech>

We have not covered it in depth.  In 2019 there was a series of meetings between Dublin city councillors, the HSE, Irish Water and the EPA, regarding some concerns around bathing water quality.  It was very unfortunate that on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Liffey swim, there was an incident involving Fingal County Council with the release of infected - if that is the right word - water into the Liffey.  I want to talk about the learnings from that process, from water quality in general, bathing water quality, and then to talk about the overlap between the EPA and the HSE on bathing water as opposed to drinking water.</p></speech>

The local authorities are the main managers for bathing water quality.  They manage the beaches, designate certain areas identified as beaches and bathing water areas and these are monitored throughout the bathing water season.  The EPA's role is to gather up the information and the data, act in an oversight role of the process and to classify the bathing waters.  We publish an annual report on that.  Overall, bathing water has been improving last year and this is probably a reflection of some of the investment in wastewater over the years and maybe some improvements in agriculture.  Some 97% of our bathing waters meet the minimum standard required but we have problems in some locations with agricultural run-off.  After heavy rainfall events there can be a flush of bacteria off the land.  There can be wastewater overflows or problems with a wastewater plant.  We also have problems with dog fouling in some locations which is causing an impact.  What happens on the land and in our wastewater treatment plants impacts directly on our bathing water quality and it needs to be managed.  We speak about a catchment management approach.  The whole catchment needs to be managed in order to maintain good quality bathing water.</p></speech>

Again, like a boil water notice, nobody wants to disrupt anybody's swimming fun, particularly during the summer.  It is done purely to protect public health, particularly because one of the parameters tested for is for E.coli which can make people very sick.  It is done on that basis.  We are cognisant of the fact that community and social activity are being disrupted so it is not done lightly and only until such time as clear test results are back.  Then it is reviewed again straight away and the ban lifted as soon as possible.</p></speech>

Is Dr. Mulholland aware of any liaison with those organisations at local authority level to ensure any concerns are well-addressed?  The organisation of this event is really complex yet in the case of 2019, the local authority only informed the HSE the night before the event.  This puts an almost impossible pressure on the people organising an open water swimming event.</p></speech>

It was obvious it was going to take testing before an event purposely to try to avoid a situation arising where there would be a large number of people using a watercourse at a time when there was high incidence of a pathogen or bacteria.  Sometimes that is what happens at the last minute.</p></speech>

My memory of it was that an alarm sounded but there was not the appropriate human intervention at that time.  That comes down to the training and the capacity of local authority staff or what would be Irish Water staff.  Has the HSE engaged with Irish Water in that area? </p></speech>

There were a lot of learnings from that but more importantly there has been a lot of investment in Leixlip to the point that it has been taken off a remedial action list.  We have seen the kind of incidents that occurred there replicated in Ballymore Eustace and in Gorey last year and again, we have learned from that.  We are not there yet.  A lot of work is being done but there are still issues around training, responsiveness to alarms, and what we really want to do is mitigate-----</p></speech>

While there is fantastic work being done there by the staff, it has to be said that it is a very low-security environment.  From a risk management perspective, has there been any assessment in terms of a terrorist attack?  A person could essentially pollute 40% of Dublin's water supply by walking onto a site that has low level security.  Is that something the EPA or the HSE has a role or involvement in or are they aware of anything at a more strategic level?</p></speech>

The locations of drinking water treatment plants are not advertised.  We do not give their locations, nor does Irish Water.  They are not widely publicised.  That is to protect security of supply.  Then there is a whole raft of measures in place to ensure protection against things like cybersecurity threats.  Measures are taken to ensure that the locations of plants are not widely advertised or widely known.  There are sign-in and sign-out procedures, as there are on most sites.  Adequate measures are in place on the sites to protect-----</p></speech>

Perhaps this is not a question for now, and maybe the witnesses did not prepare for it, but if they had any information on this that they could share with the committee, I think it would be useful.  We talk about water quality but, in respect of national security, one could take out the water supply with probably a very low-level intervention at any one of those facilities.  We see what happens when something breaks, so imagine the impact an intentional intervention could have.</p></speech>

I am sorry.  I was in the Seanad so I could not get here earlier.  I direct this question to the HSE.  I sit on not only the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage but also the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There is a double connection in all this.  It is the simple question about the alarming level of pesticides found in our water.  There has been recent media coverage of this, on which I have commented.  The level is very high in parts of the UK.  We have it here.  I know that Irish Water is touching on this because I have read its written statement.  Its representatives will be here later and I will put to them the same question about enforcement and the alarming effect of pesticides, which are found in the urine of children.  This is quite well documented.  The witnesses may not have come equipped with too much information on it, but if they had a particular view on it I would be interested to hear it.  If not, I would like them to supply, with their agreement and that of the committee, some more information on facts, data and samples, who is ultimately responsible and the co-ordination of this between Irish Water, which does a certain amount of work on this.  There is some talk that there is clearly evidence of a reduction in pesticides in certain areas in respect of enforcement and that enforcement levels and sampling have gone down.  These are carcinogens.  They pose very serious challenges to all human health.  In particular, evidence of pesticides has been found in young children.  How is that coming into the system?  Is it coming through the food chain, the water or the water used in respect of agriculture and crops?  It is a challenge, it is disturbing and the witnesses might be able to share some thoughts or some data or information here or furnish the committee with it subsequently.</p></speech>

That is down slightly on 33 water supplies at the end of 2020.  The main herbicide found was 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, MCPA, which continues to dominate the exceedances we see for pesticides.  There are six water supplies on our immediate action list for pesticides at the end of 2021, and five of those have catchment focus groups in place to undertake measures in the catchment, raising awareness, educating and advising as to the correct use of pesticides in those catchments and bringing together the relevant stakeholders to inform responsible pesticide use and action.  We saw a small reduction in pesticide exceedances last year, which is certainly welcome.</p></speech>

Bells should be ringing.  We now have pesticides in our water systems.  I look forward to that report, and I think we as a committee look forward to it.  I thank Dr. Minihan for the indication that it is coming this week.  This is alarming, however.  We talk to oncologists and researchers about this.  In our country, our food chain and our human health are impacted by pesticides in our water systems, and that is really scary.  It would be great if the witnesses could share as much information as possible because we need transparency on this issue.  This is the most alarming thing about the consumption of water in the State, and we need possibly to revisit this on some future date.</p></speech>

None of those exceedances has been deemed to pose a risk to public health on the basis of the levels found.  Notwithstanding that, I take the Senator's point, but each of those exceedances is consulted on with the HSE.  There have been no water restrictions put in place for supplies where pesticides have been found.  I wanted just to give the Senator that context.</p></speech>

We are joined by Mr. Niall Gleeson, Ms Angela Ryan, Mr. Tom Cuddy and Mr. Se&aacute;n Laffey.  Their statement has been circulated to members, so I ask them to stay within five minutes for their opening remarks.</p> <p>  As the witnesses were not here for the previous session, I will repeat my remarks on privilege.  Witnesses attending in the committee room are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their contribution to the meeting.  This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting.  Members and witnesses are expected not to abuse the privilege they enjoy and it is my duty, as Chair, to ensure this privilege is not abused.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with such a direction.  Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Gleeson to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am CEO of Irish Water and I am joined by Ms Ryan, head of asset strategy, Mr. Cuddy, head of asset operations, and Mr. Laffey, director of asset management and sustainability.  Our written statement is lengthy, so I will summarise it to leave more time for questions and answers.</p> <p>  Under our strategic funding and capital investment plan, Irish Water has delivered significant improvements.  We will invest &euro;5.3 billion in water services between 2020 and 2024.  We have delivered significant drinking water and wastewater infrastructure, including the Vartry plant to which reference was made in the previous meeting.  We sat in on that session and are aware of the issues raised.  I foresee wide-ranging questions from members.  Reference was made to the Vartry plant and upgrades to Leixlip.  We have also done work on Lee Road in Cork and other significant upgrades in wastewater infrastructure.</p> <p>  Over 99% of our drinking water is compliant with regulations.  We have reduced untreated sewage discharges nationally by over 60% by volume.  That is a significant improvement and relates to many of the untreated agglomerations that have been discussed.  We still have a significant amount of work to do but, by 2025, we will have 95% of those treated.  Those that are outstanding involve planning issues that we are working through.  Our leakage rate is now 38%.  It was approximately 50% when we took over.  Our target is to be at 25% nationally by 2030, while the target for the greater Dublin area, GDA, which is particularly stressed on the water side, is 20% by 2030.  We expect to achieve both those targets.</p> <p>  On the housing side, in 2021 we issued 32,000 offers for connections for new housing units.  We are now halfway through 2022 and approximately 18,000 offers have been made so far this year, so we will overtake the figure for 2021.  We are delivering significant connections and offers for housing. </p> <p>  We welcome and highlight the critical ongoing work by the Government to secure planning reform. Obviously, we agree that, on the planning side, people need to be able to object and have a say in what happens.  However, I refer to the greater Dublin drainage, GDD, project, which is a critical project to complement the work the Ringsend project is doing.  We originally got planning for that project in 2019 but have been challenged in the courts.  We think the process will take eight years overall on the planning side alone, before we even get started on construction.  That level of planning delay cannot continue.</p> <p>  On drinking water quality and supply in the long term, in 2021 Irish Water adopted the framework for its first national water resources plan.  This is a 25-year strategic plan that follows a three-pillar approach of use less, lose less and supply smarter.  Two of our regional plans have been published, that is, the plans for the eastern midlands and south-west regions, while two further plans for the south east and north west will be published in the coming months.  We have had public consultations on these plans and the public and various authorities, including the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, the HSE and Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, have had the opportunity to comment on them.  This is research on all the water resources in the country and the examination involves their longevity, the current challenges and the challenges we predict will come with climate change.  We have identified the water supply in the eastern midlands region project as being of critical national importance.  It is in the national development plan.  Currently, 85% of the greater Dublin area is reliant on the Liffey to supply water.  Such reliance on a single source creates risk, particularly as the population is expected to increase by 24% by 2044.  This project will provide alternative water supplies using water from the River Shannon, but it will also secure supplies along the route, in the midlands, and allow some of the Dublin plants to release water north and south.  The project is not just about supply for the GDA.</p> <p>  In the first river basin management plan, prior to the establishment of Irish Water, urban wastewater was listed as the second most dominant pressure on catchment water quality.  By the end of the third cycle, we expect it to be the seventh most dominant pressure.  It is currently in fourth position in the context of the pressure on water bodies.  This reflects significant investment by Irish Water in upgrading infrastructure and optimising operations at wastewater treatment plants.  We know we still have challenges, but we are working through them.  There are currently 217 significant urban wastewater pressures impacting on 208 water bodies.  This equates to 4% of water bodies nationally requiring urban wastewater improvement measures to achieve water framework directive objectives.  Works are complete to address urban wastewater problems on 12 water bodies and projects are progressing on a further 61.  Another 63 water bodies are due to be completed by 2027 and the remaining 72 assessments are initiated in a rolling program.  All current wastewater treatment pressures should be addressed by 2030.  Network pressures, particularly in cities, will take considerably longer to address due to scale and complexity.</p> <p>  There has been significant improvement in water quality since 2015.  Irish Water performed almost 180,000 individual tests on public supplies last year.  The amount of time boil water notices remain in place has reduced significantly.  In 2014, notices that were in place for 200 days were considered to be long term, whereas 30 days is now the measure.  Last year, Irish Water removed 250,000 customers from boil water notices and 211,000 of those customers had their notices lifted within 30 days.  Again, we have challenges but we are making improvements.</p> <p>  Irish Water has built new wastewater infrastructure for 21 towns and villages where no such infrastructure existed, ending the discharge of raw sewage into the environment.  We remain on track to achieve the 95% target by 2025.</p> <p>  Irish Water makes every effort to go beyond our regulatory requirements to ensure people are made aware of issues.  On water quality issues, we have a reactive and robust system for reporting and dealing with the HSE and the EPA when we are notified of issues.  Mr. Cuddy will get into this in more detail.  We last appeared before the committee after the incidents at Gorey and Ballymore Eustace.  We are trying to remove from the chain the potential for individual mistakes to cause a public health issue.  We have introduced our project connect programme.  As part of that programme, the top 51 plants in the country are now covered by our 24-7 operation centre, accounting for 2.7 million of the population.  We continue to roll that out.  We hope to cover the top 70 by the end of the year and the top 100 plants next year.  Notably, the top 100 plants cover approximately 86% of the population.</p><p>The remaining 14% of the population are covered by about 650 plants so one can imagine the challenge of trying to run oversight over all of those much smaller plants that cover anywhere from 150 to 1,000 people.  They are a big challenge, including logistically.  </p></speech>

We welcome our budget this year, which is &euro;1.5 billion.  We expect to spend &euro;1.1 billion on capital this year and &euro;1.2 billion next year.  We are investing considerable amounts of money in capital around the country.  It is difficult to address everything at the same time and it is difficult for our supply chain to keep up because we keep increasing our spend.  We started off at &euro;400 million and we are now at &euro;1.2 billion.  It is incremental.  We are trying to address as many issues as we can in as short a time as possible but the challenges are enormous.</p></speech>

We will now move on to questions.  Each member has seven minutes for both questions and answers.  I will take the first slot myself.</p> <p>  Mr. Gleeson has outlined some of the improvements that Irish Water has made, but having heard previous speakers from the EPA and the HSE, there is no doubt that there is a significant challenge remaining, with more than 500,000 people having what can be described as an "unsatisfactory" level of water quality.  We have an indication that Ireland may be the only EU country facing court proceedings, which is not an ideal situation for Irish Water to be in.  Are these issues being taken seriously and can Mr. Gleeson outline to us a sense of urgency, given the really stark facts that were given to us in the previous session?</p></speech>

The predominant issue is around trihalomethanes or THMs.  We are trying to address it.  I will ask Mr. Laffey to come in on this.  It is a tricky issue to deal with and it is not for lack of trying.  We have put systems into plants that have worked for a period and then stopped working.  Mr. Laffey will give a bit of background to the THMs and how we deal with them.  I want the committee to understand that we are trying to deal with this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.844" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Laffey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022100400002#M00600"><p>As Dr. Minihan said, THMs are a class of organic compounds that are formed when dissolved organics in the water interact with the chlorine that we use to disinfect the water.  That is how we get THMs.  Research has shown that exposure to trihalomethanes over a very long period of time can be carcinogenic so we take them very seriously.  The issue with THMs is that they will form immediately they come in contact with chlorine but the longer they are in contact with the chlorine, the more formations of THMs we get, so as Dr. Minihan said, we have issues with the extremities of our networks because water out at the extremities could have left the plant five to seven days previously.  Historically, we have had a problem with THMs in Ireland because a lot of our water sources are impacted by a lot of dissolved organic matter from bogs and so on, and the plants that were put in simply were not up to the highly technical challenge of removing that dissolved organic matter.  We are moving on the issue.  We have a case against us and we have a THM programme in place.  We are spending millions of euro every year on the issue of THMs.  It is not the case that our water supplies are getting worse.  What is actually happening is that Irish Water has looked across all of our water treatment plants in terms of their trihalomethane risk profile and has initiated additional testing above what is required in the regulations.  We are doing that in the plants and out on the network and we are finding THMs.  This is bad news in the short term because ultimately, the remediation action list, RAL, goes up, that is, the numbers go up, but in the long term it is good news because it means we have identified a problem and we can put a plan in place to fix it.</p></speech>

Scotland has similar typography to us, as does Wales.  A lot of the plants that were put in, from a technical point of view, will perform fine during the summer when the water is quite clear but during heavy rainfall events, a lot of organic matter is washed in and the plants are not technically capable of removing those organics.  In Irish Water, we have the expertise to make sure the plants we invest in are capable of removing the organics and therefore the THMs.</p></speech>

The EPA and the HSE outlined their role in the overall process in terms of issuing boil water notices and so on.  How does Irish Water escalate reports that come into its call centre?  In recent weeks, for example, across Clontarf, some parts of the northside of Dublin, D&uacute;n Laoghaire and some parts of north Wicklow there have been reports of an earthy or mouldy taste and smell from the water.  Is Irish Water aware of that?  If Irish Water gets several phone calls into its call centre, how does that get escalated up and what level of investigation is carried out following the first, second and subsequent calls?</p></speech>

We have not had that effect at the treatment plant at Vartry for about ten years.  When we get any taste, odour, discolouration or other complaint, we immediately raise an investigative work order and our site staff go out and investigate on the site locally.  Quite often, as in this case, we get clusters of calls and that immediately warrants closer investigation, sampling and testing.  We consult very rapidly with the HSE where there is any health concern.  In the case of the incident that we have noted in the last few weeks, we see now that it is diminishing.  It is very similar to the situation we found with other sources in recent years and in fact, it is associated with no health effects.  It is also very subjective.  I spoke to some of my colleagues today who live in the area and even in the same household, some people got the musty smell while others did not.  In this instance, it is relatively benign although unpleasant for some people.  It has worked its way through and we can see that things have gone.  After we do the investigation, we do immediate resolution measures.  For example, we will flush the local mains, flush the taps, sample again and so on.  In the event-----</p></speech>

Plants are built with a certain headroom and additional capacity, and when they are new they can take shock events a lot easier than when they are slightly older and working more towards the upper end of their capacity.</p></speech>

I am not sure if any of the witnesses were involved but I had a number of meetings with Irish Water as a Deputy and when I was a councillor on Cork City Council about the plan in place to reduce the use of lead piping.  Unfortunately, I have never had enough time to get the HSE to comment on this from a health point of view but where are we with the lead piping extraction?</p></speech>

There are no lead water mains within the distribution network.  Lead occurs between the distribution network that supplies water and the customers' properties, namely, the customer service pipe.  An element of that customer service pipe is within Irish Water's control, a section of it is privately owned by the customer, and then there can be lead in the plumbing systems within a property.  Irish Water must work with other stakeholders to reduce lead exceedances at the customer's tap.  We have an implementation plan in place and to date we have removed 50,000 lead services of an estimated 180,000 lead services nationally within the public supply.</p></speech>

It is the small pipe that connects each individual household's supply.  To have overall coverage, Irish Water is looking at processes within our water treatment plants.  By 2026, we will have pH optimisation and orthophosphate dosing covering 90% of the population that is at risk from lead exceedance.  Through orthophosphate dosing and pH correction we reduce plumbosolvency and using that measure we should be able to become about 92% to 93% compliant with the parameters set out in the drinking water regulations.</p></speech>

That was an education on lead pipes.  I congratulate Irish Water on the two significant achievements we have seen in the past year in Vartry and the significant upgrades in Leixlip, which serves many of my constituents in Lucan.  It is great to get that update on the eastern and midlands regional project, which is coming down the tracks.  I spoke earlier about the Saggart project and the 100 million l reservoir that is being installed there.  I had the opportunity to go on site with Irish Water's partners that are building that.  It is great to see they are more than halfway through that project, which will provide better stability and security for the greater Dublin region when it comes to water.  I welcome all that investment.</p> <p>  My first question is on water quality, although not really on the minimum quality standards.  I accept we need to ensure the water that comes out of everybody's taps is safe to drink.  That is a requirement but we should be aiming for a higher bar than that and to deliver high-quality water that tastes good to encourage people, in particular children, to drink it.  In some areas of Lucan that are served by a particular pump, we do not have that.  We have extremely hard water which damages expensive appliances like dishwashers and washing machines, which is a complaint I hear repeatedly.  Will it be possible to merge water supplies to dilute hard water as part of the eastern and midlands regional project?  Will the pipes allow for that?</p> <p>  My second question is on leaks.  It is soul-destroying to talk about leaks and to see the wastage.  I congratulate Irish Water on all it is doing to reduce that.  Reducing it from 50% to 38% has been an achievement and to get it to 25% and 20% in Dublin will be great.  How much is that costing?  How much money are we pumping into leaks?</p> <p>  This is the Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and all of us are committed to making sure we deliver new homes, houses and housing estates as quickly as possible.</p><p>Water is a key service when it comes to that.  I have had a situation in my constituency, and have seen and know of similar situations in Dublin South-West and Cork, where estates have been built but there have been delays in getting people into homes, or people went into homes but did not get water, because the connections were not happening when they should have been.  Is that still happening?  Are there estates that people are or should be in that are not connected to water supplies at present?  My three questions relate to the wider quality issue, whether we could merge water supplies and leaks from a funding perspective, and housing commencements.</p></speech>

Hard water can be beneficial for public health, which is one of those paradigms in life.  People do not like hard water but it can actually be quite good for them.  On the water supply in the greater Dublin area, two of the main water treatment plants, one of them Ballymore Eustace, has relatively soft water.  Leixlip water is harder.  It is an integrated supply, which means some of the district metered areas, DMAs, within the city are mixed DMAs so they are blending, but the supplies along the north fringe close by, and the Leixlip water treatment plant, are predominantly harder water.  It is not the hardest water on our networks but it is hard water.  When the water supply project, eastern and midlands region, comes in, it will sit somewhere between the two.  We have a blended supply.  For some DMAs that are predominantly served by Leixlip, it is unlikely that will change over time.</p> <p>  As a number of Deputies mentioned, there are many priorities across our public water supplies and wastewater supplies.  We are looking at addressing some of the risk elements within our supplies, such as leakage and wastewater discharges.  When we have resolved many of those issues, we may come back to look at the more cosmetic issues over time.  The priority, however, has to be public health at present.</p></speech>

It is an incredibly significant expense.  There is a theory out there that Irish Water just wants to build new plants and does not care about leaks but we will put almost the equivalent investment into fixing leaks as new plants.</p> <p>  On supplies, I am aware of a few individual houses that are waiting for connections but I am not aware of any estates at present.  Typically, when we drill into those issues a lot of it is due to late applications by developers or an infrastructure issue because of the direction of a pipe, a wastewater pipe more predominantly, where we thought we could run it but something else was in the way and more remedial work was needed.  We investigate all of those issues and try to resolve them as quickly as possible.  We do not sit on our hands regarding them.</p></speech>

We are dealing with the matters of fresh water and wastewater; both are pertinent to the question I will pursue.  I sit on this committee and, as I said, on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  The HSE confirmed to us this afternoon the presence of toxins, particularly pesticides, in our water stream.  This has been well documented by medics and there has been a lot of media coverage of it in the past 12 months.  The most alarming aspect of all this is the percentage of pesticides in the urine of children in the UK and Northern Ireland, but also in this jurisdiction.</p> <p>  One could ask what the cumulative effect of this will be, especially if it is coming from a water stream.  I recognise much of this is coming from agricultural leakage, potentially, through the water streams to aquifers etc. but we need to reassure the public.  This is an alarming situation that has been confirmed by the HSE today.  Irish Water referenced on page 4 of its statement - it has not numbered its pages but I have - that there is evidence of a reduction in pesticides and "pesticide enforcement files across public water supplies...".  It has identified, admitted and accepted this.  That is good because we now know we have a problem but we have to reassure the public.</p> <p>  This is now primarily a public health issue and we have to give reassurance.  I do not think I would be happy if I were to read in tomorrow's newspapers that there were pesticides in our water system.  How will we address that?  That is one question.  It is about accountability, transparency and, as I said, public health.  The high levels of pesticides found in children are alarming.  We need to identify whether that is coming through water for crops or through drinking water.  Somehow it is water that is getting into the systems of our people.  The association with carcinogenics and cancer is there, which is the most alarming matter to be raised in this committee today.  It is certainly the thing I will take away with me.  I ask Irish Water to touch on that issue and how it is addressing it.  As I said, there are two issues, including that of wastewater.</p> <p>  Irish Water states in the top paragraph on page 4 of its statement: "There are currently 217 significant urban wastewater pressures impacting on 208 water bodies."  Are the representatives in a position to furnish that schedule or list to the committee?  I ask them to map, or if not map include an index, on the local authorities those particular plants relate to.  It is important we get a greater understanding.  The representatives have come today and told this committee that there are "significant urban wastewater pressures".  That is important.  It would be very helpful, from our point of view, if we knew where they are and what local authorities they involve.  We could then look into that in greater detail.  Irish Water sought to reassure the committee that it will resolve most of these issues by 2030.  This is 2022.  I put it to the representatives that 2030 is just too far away.  They know the ins and outs of it and I do not, but this is the first I have heard and read about it.  I am somewhat concerned that we will have to wait until 2030 on this issue.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that I received the Irish Water press statement on the River Vartry.  The rationale was very well set down.  I read its press release - these press releases are issued to the Houses of the Oireachtas anyway - and I thank it for that.  I thank Irish Water for it engagement in respect of its communications strategy with Oireachtas Members.  There is a lot of work to be done on how it engages and communicates beyond that.  I spoke to a woman today, who lives just outside Loughrea, who was on a boil water notice for three months.  She did not get too much communication and did not know who she should communicate with.  Most people tend to go their local authority.  We have a lot of work to do on how we can address that.</p> <p>  The representatives have confirmed Irish Water has &euro;1.5 billion in its budget this year, which is an enormous amount of money.  I ask them to address the issue of carcinogenics, pesticides and water.  I would have thought, and I suggest and put this to Irish Water, that one of the topmost priorities in drawing down some of this &euro;1.5 billion is how we address the issue of herbicides and pesticides in our drinking water.</p></speech>

The Senator is quite correct.  It is not just pesticides; it is pesticides and herbicides.  We have looked at international best practice regarding these types of chemical compounds.  They are very useful for agriculture.  In fact, a lot of agricultural yield relies on the use of these particular compounds.  We have found that catchment management, and Dr. Minihan referred to it directly, is the best way of controlling the use of pesticides and herbicides.  The Senator is quite correct in calling out that they are a health issue, but in excess amounts pesticides and herbicides also have an impact on, and are very detrimental to, aquatic life and the environment.</p> <p>  Ultimately, we have to look after the environment because it looks after us.  We are working with a number of bodies, including the EPA, Teagasc, local authorities, the local authority waters programme, LAWPRO, etc.  We are running catchment management programmes with local farmers to try to come up with new methods of applying herbicides and pesticides, keeping them away from streams, and making sure they are employed at the right time of year during the right weather conditions etc.  We are part of a project jointly funded by ourselves, Northern Ireland and the European Union, Project SWELL, which is a cross-Border initiative looking at the use of pesticides and herbicides around Lough Erne.</p><p>There was a 65% reduction through working with and educating farmers and making sure herbicides were applied in the correct way.  Ultimately, if they cannot be got to a level that is consistent with best practice and public health guidelines &ndash; we are not there yet &ndash; we will have to consider what we call an end-of-pipe solution, which means taking the chemicals out at the treatment plant.  However, we believe that catchment management is the best approach overall at the moment.</p></speech>

Therefore, catchment management is certainly the best place to focus in the meantime.  Ms Ryan will refer to the water bodies.</p></speech>

We have reduced that to 208, so we were one of the success stories of the second-cycle river basin management plan.  We comprise one of the pressures on the water bodies.  At some water bodies, there may be other pressures also.  We have prioritised the areas where Irish Water comprises the most significant pressure on the water bodies.  Even since the start of the third-cycle river basin management plan, we have taken a further 12 water bodies off the list of 208.  We have plans and projects under construction or going to construction to address a further 63.  Therefore, it is a key focus of Irish Water.  We anticipate that by the end of the period of the third-cycle river basin management plan, we will have reduced the pressure we exert, bringing the figure from 4% of water bodies to 2% of water bodies.  Therefore, we are showing a consistent downward trend.</p> <p>  On the remaining water bodies, we will not be the predominant pressure.  However, we will seek to address our role as a pressure at those water bodies.  We are currently progressing feasibility studies on 73 water bodies.  I am referring to the early stages where we go out, do initial feasibility studies and examine options.  That is a precursor to developing projects to address the areas in question.  We should have all the studies completed by 2029.  In the remaining 61 areas, we will be progressing the investigative studies and feasibility reports.  We hope to have all the feasibility studies on the remaining sites under way by 2029, but it is likely to be the end of the 2030s before we have removed ourselves as a pressure at all water bodies.</p> <p>  The initial focus of Irish Water was investments in our wastewater treatment plants.  Over the last investment cycle, we upgraded 129 wastewater treatment plants and 96 collection systems.  We spent &euro;2.3 billion doing that.  We are seeing the return on investment now.  We will tee up additional investment in our supplies, but also our wastewater collection networks.  However, it will take more time to resolve those issues.  We are considering developing integrated wastewater and drainage plans for the large urban centres.  We hope to have six of them under way by 2027.  That is a commitment we will be making as part of the third-cycle river basin management plan.</p></speech>

I will take that.</p> <p>  Senator Boyhan referred to Irish Water's engagement with us as Oireachtas Members.  It is important to put on the record the positive and proactive engagement we have with Irish Water staff.  I can speak from my experience of trying to resolve several issues in Waterford.  I thank the representatives for that.  There are particular issues concerning Waterford that I referred to in my engagement with the EPA and HSE.  I raise them not to be parochial but to give an example of what happens when a complaint is registered when a boil water notice is in existence and to explore how we get to the point of rectifying the problem.</p> <p>  Could I go back to the first point, on the boil water notice?  Mr. Gleeson referred to 30 days.  The community of F&aacute;n Glas, Kilmeadan, has been subject to a boil water notice since February of this year.  I understand Irish Water is engaged in procurement for works to rectify the problem; however, it will be an awfully long time from February to Christmas, which is when I hope the problem will be resolved.  Brown water is coming out of the taps.  I argue that tankers should be provided by Irish Water.  They are not.  The community has been left in this position since February.  Can the delegates explain why it has taken so long?  What are the impediments that have meant brown water is still in the taps in October although a boil water notice was put in place with the HSE regarding a problem that was identified in February?</p></speech>

The one just raised is one.  Maybe Mr. Cuddy could elaborate on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.892" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Cuddy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022100400002#P00600"><p>Quite a number of our sources are challenged.  The basic raw water is not treatable fully, certainly by the older treatment plants.  In many cases, the resolution is either to find a new source or extend a neighbouring network to connect up.  When we do apply a boil water notice, it is for very good reasons.  It may be because there are concerns about the risk to public health.  It is not necessarily that there are pathogens.  The difficulty of cloudiness means treatment with ultraviolet and chlorine cannot be fully effective.  In fact, over-chlorination, which results in trihalomethanes, can be detrimental.</p> <p>  Let me address the question on tankering water.  Unfortunately, when we tanker water to an area, that water also has to be boiled.  Therefore, people would still have the same issue.  The tankers themselves would need to be flushed out, cleaned and so on.</p></speech>

An EPA report shows significant deficiencies.  I have been engaging with Irish Water on putting a scheme together through the small towns and villages growth programme.  The difficulty obviously is the timelines.  Mr. Gleeson referred to this in his initial remarks.  If we are starting a process in 2023, which I hope will be the case, how can we expedite delivery on the ground in terms of agglomerations such as Bunmahon?  We all accept the process takes time but is it possible to front-load to speed up at the back end?  With regard to procurement for a site, for example, should we carry out negotiations to acquire land at the front end so we do not have to start a process at the back end?  Are there planning steps that Irish Water could be taking, independent of the possible planning delays, that could speed up the delivery of the much-needed networks?</p></speech>

Consider the example of the Arklow site, a wastewater treatment plant.  It represents a very significant investment in the town.  We consulted the local population quite significantly over a period of probably two years to get the right site, get buy-in from the local people and avoid objections.  That got through the planning process quite well.  Again, we welcome the support of Oireachtas Members on that kind of issue so we can get planning permission more quickly and avoid objections in the first place.</p><p>As to procuring land in advance, we can try it on the smaller projects, where it is probably practical.  Our Department gets very nervous when we put money down with the risk of not getting that site followed through.  We have our friends in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General coming in to us next year and they would be very interested in that kind of stuff.  We have to be cautious.  We will certainly look at every opportunity.</p></speech>

The hope would be that that engagement piece would reduce the issue.  Could other measures, such as those suggested by Mr. Gleeson, be front-loaded?</p> <p>  I want to raise a point that is not particularly within Irish Water&rsquo;s remit but I did not get the opportunity to ask the EPA earlier.  There is a grants scheme in place for domestic septic tanks, which had to be registered before February 2013.  I know of a couple of cases where there is a difficulty, although this is more for our report and I am just asking for an opinion.  Where somebody bought a house in 2018 or 2019, they were not responsible for registering that septic tank in 2013.  However, because the tank was not registered in 2013, they are not eligible for the grants.  As a result, it is a particular issue the local authorities have in terms of enforcement and the person having the ability to carry out those works.  For the purposes of our report, would Irish Water support the adjustment of such a measure to regularise that so a new homeowner who bought a property subsequently is not penalised for the inaction of somebody else back in February 2013?</p></speech>

We have heard plenty so I will try to be as succinct as possible.  I have a couple of questions and the witnesses can come back to me when I have gone through them, if that is okay.</p><p>In regard to the new connections, it is great to see we are at 18,000 and, on that basis, we will exceed expectations and will have 36,000 new connections, which cuts to the chase and proves that houses are being built in the country.  However, there is an issue with connections.  We have a new local authority estate in Longford where there was an issue with a connection, although it has since been resolved.  I know of one constituent who cannot move into her new house because she has an air-to-water heating system.  The clue is in the name of the heating system and she urgently needs to get a connection.  I will follow up with Irish Water with the details after the meeting and we will try to resolve it rather than labouring it here.  What is the average time for a new connection?  Irish Water can come back to me at the end with that information.  I believe the ballpark figure for a new connection fee is about &euro;1,600 and there seems to be no discretion for an applicant.  For example, I know of an applicant who has been told there is an additional charge because where he should be connecting, Irish Water cannot guarantee a good water supply.  He would say that is not his issue and that it is Irish Water's issue.  I would like an answer on that point as well.</p><p>I have a question for Mr. Cuddy on the Lough Forbes upgrade in Longford town, which seems to be going on an inordinate length of time and there was a boil water notice there.  Will Mr. Cuddy update us on what has been spent on that to date and whether there is a finish line in sight?</p><p>I want to raise a couple of issues in regard to wastewater, which we may not get through fully today due to time constraints, so I will follow up with Irish Water after the meeting.  Edgeworthstown and Ballymahon are among the four principal towns outside Longford town and both are at maximum capacity for wastewater at the moment.  I am well aware of the eight-workshop process in regard to trying to get a new plant in place.  I understand Ballymahon has completed the second workshop but, although I am not sure of this, the work at Edgeworthstown appears to have been stalled.  There has to be some degree of foresight within Uisce &Eacute;ireann so that, when towns are at maximum capacity, the process is expedited.  This is especially the case at Ballymahon, where we have seen Center Parcs announce an ambitious expansion of 96 new units last week.  I would be interested to hear the response on that.</p><p>With regard to small issues, for Lisbrack Downs in Longford town we were advised early last year that a consultant was being appointed to look at a new pumping station for that estate to connect it to the nearby treatment plant on the basis there was an admission that the pumping station was not working.  It seems to have gone off the boil.  I know of a couple of exasperated residents who are besieged with waste matter in their gardens every time it rains.  Radharc na Coille and Woodlands are two small housing estates and I do not expect the witnesses to know them off the top of their heads, or they will shock me with their knowledge of Longford.  To cut a long story short, Radharc na Coille is a new development of six houses that were all purchased post the arrival of Irish Water.  There was a developer plant <i>in situ</i>so, obviously, Irish Water has not taken that in charge.  Down the road, Woodlands was completed before Irish Water's time so the council took it in charge, but Irish Water is sending a tanker at least once every two weeks to empty out that plant because it is not working.  The population there is not big enough to come under the new scheme, but surely some degree of credence must be given to the fact it is simply not working.</p><p>On the group water schemes that were anticipated to be taken in charge, can we see a ramping up on that, specifically the Forgney group water scheme in Longford town?</p></speech>

A lot of the more complicated ones go through, but we have had very good prior engagement.  On new connections, what we always say is that we need early engagement.  Let us get into the room together and let us work out the issues so that when the time comes to connect, it is there.</p> <p>  In terms of group water schemes and DPI, or developer provided infrastructure, there is a memorandum of understanding between ourselves, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and local authorities around a methodology of taking in group water schemes and how DPI is dealt with.  The DPI and the group water schemes need to come through the local authorities first, but if they are brought to our attention, we certainly look at them.  We have a section in Irish Water that deals with the taking in of those particular group water schemes and the resolution of issues with DPI.  We have a mechanism in place for that.</p> <p>  We will get the Deputy an update on the Edgeworthstown and Ballymahon wastewater treatment plant.  I would not like to say anything here which might be inaccurate or wrong.  We can also get the Deputy an update on Lough Forbes.</p> <p>  With regard to the connection fee, the CRU has given us a connection policy which has been in force for roughly three and a half to four years.  It did go out to consultation and we submitted a view on it, as did a lot of other third parties.  We have to abide by the connection policy of the CRU.  What I would say is that when the time comes for a review of that policy, and I do not believe it is too far away, all of these unforeseen issues should be brought into the mix.  We have quite a number of them lined up to discuss with the CRU.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of someone living right beside the network who could connect just for the connection fee but they are told they have to go 2 km down the road because there is not enough water pressure.  That is something we can raise with the CRU and it can take a view on it.  Whatever view it takes, that is the view that Irish Water abides by.</p></speech>

Water quality has been a huge issue in Dundalk for a considerable amount of time and in the mid- to north-Louth area in particular.  It is fair to say that people have even to a degree gotten used to having brown water.  I was in a chip shop the other day and somebody asked me if I wanted tap water or bottled water.  I said tap water, and everybody laughed and assumed that I was not being serious.  They just did not consider how mean I am.  It is a considerable issue.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Gleeson for his opinion on the CRU investigation specifically on Cavanhill treatment plant.  In 2020, there were breaches in manganese levels, but there was a huge issue in communications and in making the information public.  This also happened later in June 2021, but the fact is that every year for the last number of years, Irish Water has spoken about flushing programmes and has said that the problem would be dealt with.  It went from iron oxide to manganese.  I accept from my engagement with Irish Water that the flushing was not being done as comprehensively as it is being done now.  I want to check that we are now having more comprehensive flushing for those hard-to-get areas that it had not been possible to access.  I have seen a number of teams that have been out in order to do this work.  </p> <p>  Over the summer I, along with various elected representatives, tried to make contact with Irish Water, as, even, did LMFM, the local radio station.  We were given the date of 14 September as the end of this flushing process.  I did not believe it to be the case that that would be the end of it.  Irish Water&rsquo;s own press releases had listed Blackrock initially, parts of Dromiskin and later Dundalk.  In Dundalk, Irish Water named the number of the estates, such as the estate I live in myself, Bay Estate, as well as St. Alphonsus Road, Muirhevanmore, and the areas around me.  I was also constantly and consistently getting pictures and videos of brown water from other areas of Dundalk.  I am speaking about the likes of O&rsquo;Hanlon Park, Marian Park and the north end of Dundalk.  I never saw any of those places on the list.  I accept that when there is a plan that other things can get in the way.  The date of 14 September could have been pushed back anyway.  However, I find it hard to believe that the date of 14 September could have ever been the end date.  I am still getting photographs and videos of brown water.  The situation has not been completely resolved.</p> <p>  I am looking for a timeline.  I accept that there will be a short-term fix for some of this, but can we get a timeline on when that will be done?  I was told, and I want to get clarity on this, that a flushing team is now dealing with this piece of work and that it will continually be doing this.  Some of this will not be resolved until the pipe work is completed as regards the iron oxide.  I understand that there is a specific problem with manganese.  Could Irish Water answer all that? </p></speech>

Dundalk is one of the specific locations.  The treatment chemicals that we use are only in a few plants, but we now have to add them to other plants-----</p></speech>

Manganese is a naturally occurring mineral and the amount of it in the raw water is far greater than it has been.  It is much more widespread across the country.  It also tends to be seasonal, so it comes to the fore in the summer time and late summer.  That adds to the issue.  Of course, manganese is not captured by our normal treatment.  What happens is that it comes out of solution when it is in the network.  It then causes cloudy and speckled water.  The only resolution, once it gets that far, is for us to flush the network.  Initially, when this came to our attention a couple of years ago, simple local flushing was sufficient.  Now it has progressed to the stage where it needs, as the Deputy also mentioned, pretty much a dedicated a flushing team and we have had to make changes within the network.</p> <p>  To go back to address the fundamental issue, this is really a treatment issue.  It is a matter of improving the treatment process and adding to it.  It is a new process within the overall treatment plant.  To go back further to the issue of raw water in the catchment area, a study is now being undertaken by the EPA and we are participating in that.  It seems to be a phenomenon not just in Ireland, but across northern Europe.  It is a matter that we will have to deal with more and more.</p> <p>  The comments from the CRU are related to the fielding of calls and their categorisation as complaints.  Be that as it may, once these calls and issues are raised with us, they are still investigated thoroughly at site level.  The reaction on the ground at an operational level is exactly the same, however.  The communications were not to the standard that was required.  Many lessons were learned from that and that has been corrected at this stage.</p> <p>  I think Mr. Laffey might want to touch on the overall manganese treatment issue across the country, which I know-----</p></speech>

We have been looking at that source and it is a good source for water availability.  However, we have found in a number of instances over the past few years that we have had some dry weather events and the levels in Lough Muckno have dropped two levels.  That, on a historical timeline, is a very low level.</p> <p>  We are having a look at the causes of the manganese within our raw water supplies.  Again, this requires us to look not just at this water treatment plant but at many others where we are seeing greater manganese issues.  We are looking at process optimisation within our plants, but we will have to have further investigations and jar testing in order to understand the chemistry of the water and how we can improve the processes across those water supplies.  It will probably require us, because it is a recurring issue across our supplies, to set up a programme to address that specific topic.  </p></speech>

Communications is a difficulty, and it is an area in which I think there is still much improvement to be made.  This flushing process is not yet over, and the date of 14 September was not met.  That is fine, but people need to know that and then they will accept that.  The last correspondence I have relates to 14 September, which includes, as I said, an incomplete list of areas in Dundalk.  I want to know the end date for the comprehensive flush, accepting that further flushing will have to happen at different times.</p></speech>

Samples and testing that are being done at the moment show that manganese levels in the Dundalk supply are below the compliance limit of 50 mcg per l.  Nevertheless, as the Deputy mentions, there may be some areas where flushing is still needed.  It may be needed for other reasons, because we do get sedimentation in dead ends, etc.</p><p>That is a phenomenon we find everywhere.  As far as manganese is concerned, which Ms Ryan touched on, the seasonal peak seems to have passed.  Flushing seems to have done the job from the point of view of bringing the water within compliance levels for manganese, but there is an underlying fundamental problem that we will have to address.</p></speech>

I will focus on Ms Ryan as she responded to my question about page 4.  We talked about the 217 pressure impacts and she outlined how that figure was being eaten into.  I suggest we should be provided with some sort of a breakdown on that.  The committee continues to monitor Irish Water.  We do not just consider it at today's meeting; it is part of our constant engagement throughout the Oireachtas.  Can Irish Water commit to that, if possible?  I am conscious of the sensitivities of Irish Water's work and programmes, but it would give the committee a greater understanding of the issue.  Also, how does it fit in with the timeline?  It is clear that Irish Water has prioritised them and there are financial considerations and capital issues, as well as a whole load of other issues.  Is there any chance of pulling back on the 2030 target?  I am sure Irish Water wants to be realistic and honest with us, but that target is a long way off.  It would be great and helpful if Irish Water could commit to that, if possible.</p></speech>

This is a real danger to public health, our ever-fragile environment, on which Mr. Laffey touched, and the food chain.  It raises the question of what best international practice is.  I know much work has been done on this in Canada, the US, Germany and Austria.  It is time to look at best practice to see how we can address this issue.  It touches on agriculture, food production, the environment and public health, which is the most important.  There should be some sort of collaboration.  The EPA has come before the committee as well as the HSE and the Department of Health.  This issue is multifaceted and needs a collaborative response.  Has there been any collaboration between the Department of Health and the EPA in addressing this issue?  I am committed to continuing to raise this issue in the coming weeks because it needs to be raised.  I believe other members will do so as well.  Has there been any collaboration or does Irish Water plan on having greater collaboration to address this concern?</p></speech>

There is a national pesticides action group of which Irish Water is a member.  From memory, there are representatives from the EPA; the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; the HSE; Teagasc; the local authority waters programme, LAWPRO; and the environmental sections of some local authorities.  The group takes a combined catchment-based approach to managing pesticides.  Best international practice has been around the fact that while pesticides and herbicides are used for agriculture, they are a useful tool and will be used going into the future.  The best way to minimise the impact they have on water bodies is through catchment management and we are focused on that.</p> <p>  The actions we are taking are up there with the best international practices.  The farmers with whom we have engaged and discussed this have been very receptive in trying out new methods.  They get the impact - for good or for bad - they can have on the environment and they want to be a force for good.  We have gone from spraying herbicides to setting up weed lickers, which means that rather than spraying crops, a wet cloth is used to touch various plants and kill them.  We are making progress in that space.  There will always be some level of those chemicals in the environment because we are putting them into the environment, but the solution will be to work with the manufacturers of these compounds to make sure they also look at the long-term impact of what they are manufacturing on the environment and they produce herbicides and pesticides that do a job but break down nearly immediately once they hit the soil.</p></speech>

In framing my question, I am conscious that Irish Water would not want to deny itself a revenue stream.  The difficulty I have is not with connection charges for greenfield sites or the infrastructure that has to be put in place, but more with the charges for brownfield sites and urban renewal spaces.  Thankfully, in my county of Waterford, we have been proactive in using schemes like the repair and lease scheme to bring derelict units back into productive use for housing.  There are a number of examples of former pubs that people are now living in because they have been renovated into high-quality apartment units.  The difficulty is with the connection policy as it stands in terms of wastewater and water connections.  They are levied as though they are greenfield sites.  The policy does not take account of the fact that the infrastructure is already in place in many cases.  By way of example, one of the former pubs had a wastewater connection going from the pub and the seven bedsits and two water connections.  The new configuration is for seven apartments.  The developer applied to use the existing wastewater connection and to add five new water connections but was, unfortunately, levied for seven new wastewater connections and five water connections.  That seems totally unjust not on the basis that it costs the developer more but in terms of fairness in respect of what is being provided there.  It is reusing existing infrastructure that is already in place.  I am conscious that Irish Water will not want to deny itself a revenue stream.  However, following feedback from the CRU, does Irish Water believe greenfield sites and city-centre sites for which the infrastructure is already present should be treated differently?</p></speech>

The vast majority of the cases we deal with will fall into a couple of categories and that is it, and they are very well covered by the connection policy.  We do get cases from time to time that do not fit any particular category and we have to take a view on them.  The policy states where an existing wastewater or water connection is altered or upgraded, the connection fee shall apply, and that is the view we are taking at present.  If the policy stated that for seven bedsits, seven apartments and now seven connections there would be no additional charge, we would be fine with that.  It is not about a revenue stream for Irish Water.  It has to have a certain kind of logic and natural justice to it as well.</p></speech>

As Irish Water takes over next year, we have a framework in place to take over local authority control, or control of plants and that.  Getting that message out to constituents would help us to communicate that Irish Water is now and should be the main point of contact for communicating water issues.  The other thing we are trying do is to use more technology such as text messaging.</p><p>People are still reluctant or, as we have yet to test the water on this, it may be that people are reluctant to give personal data to Irish Water.  We would certainly be keen to set up a system where, based on a person's Eircode, they would get a text if there was an issue in their area.  That is something we are going to pilot next year on a voluntary basis.  Again, it is something this committee could help us to promote.  It would certainly help with many of these communications issues that we raised, where we are trying to update people on boil water notices.  Right now, it is very cumbersome and, for example, we are doing hand drops and deliveries.  We do not even know who is in what house now because we have lost a lot of the billing data and we do not have that.  If people move house, they will change their electricity or gas, but they do not tell the water company that they have moved.  The committee could help us there.</p><p> We are getting the funding, which is good and I think we are in a good place.  Over the next few years, we just need to keep up that level of funding.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to engage with stakeholders about the examination of enforcement of road traffic offences.  Various representatives are coming in.  Before we get to that, I want to deal with some incidents that arose over the last fortnight.  We had a sequence of events here over the past couple of weeks.  A meeting was organised and cancelled a couple of days later, as members will be aware.  We then had commentary on those events in the media, including by me, unfortunately.  We reflected on that.  None of that was ideal or conducive to good management or running of the committee.  For my part, I regret the way events unfurled.  It was not good practice.  We have worked well and collaboratively as a committee.  As Chair, I have tried to accommodate members' interests and views and I try to put my own positions forward.  I try to work with and for all.  We have one of the greatest workloads of any committee in the Houses.  We have had significant activity over the past year since we convened.  I hope we can keep that team spirit.  For my part, I regret the way events unfolded.  I hope we can all move into the future with renewed vigour and spirit.</p></speech>

I think the Chairman named me directly in comments to a media outlet.  I found that disappointing, not just as a member of the committee but as Vice Chair.  It makes it difficult.  I know the Chairman regrets the comments.  I do not think it was necessary.  Will the Chairman make his regret public or are we going-----</p></speech>

We are still getting used to having physical meetings again.  As we have had hybrid and Zoom meetings for a long time, it is something of a novelty to have a full house on both sides of the room with witnesses and members.  It is a pleasure to be able to do so and it makes for a much better meeting.  Forgive me that I am hoarse.  I have a little bit of a dose but it is not Covid so I will endure.</p> <p>  Some of the witnesses will have given evidence in Oireachtas committees and some perhaps have not.  I remind them to switch their mobile phones to flight mode.  Even though they may appear to be turned off they can interfere with the sound recording if they are still active and I remind members to take note of that as well.</p> <p>  We are here to discuss the topic of an examination of enforcement of road traffic offences.  The witnesses might identify themselves as they are called.  I welcome Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Ferrie, spokesperson, and Mr. Peter Collins, of I BIKE Dublin; Ms Andrea Keane, CEO and Mr. Gareth Quinn, central operations manager, of Dublin Bus; four representatives from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, namely, Assistant Commissioner Paula Hilman, Superintendent Thomas Murphy, Superintendent Se&aacute;n Fallon and Superintendent Se&aacute;n O'Reardon; and Dr. Madeleine Lyes, chair, and Mr. Eoin Buckley, committee member, of the Limerick Pedestrian Network.</p> <p>  Most of the witnesses will be familiar with the housekeeping on privilege and would expect this in any event but there is a long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make that person or entity identifiable, or otherwise engage in any speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed by me to discontinue their remarks.</p> <p>  We may have some members participating remotely but we do not have any witnesses participating remotely.  I take it at this stage that members are familiar with the housekeeping requirements.</p> <p>  We will invite each organisation to make an opening statement, to a maximum of three minutes.  Some of the groups have four witnesses and others have two.  The opening statements are per organisation, not per witness.  You can share that or have one lead speaker at the outset.  You can divide it up whatever way you want.  Once the opening statements have been delivered I will call on members of the committee to put their questions in the order they indicate to me.  One or two members have already indicated to me the order in which they wish to come in and we have a rota system so we will go around the committee and members have a seven-minute slot, which is used to direct questions and for responses from witnesses.  A member can choose to push hard with questions for seven minutes or to start with a wide question and allow witnesses to talk back.  Each member has a mandate and each one is entitled to use the time as he or she sees fit.  The only thing I will do is if the conversation goes out of bounds or if the time is up I will move it on to the next speaker.  If we have time there is a second round of four minutes each and there is potentially even a third round but we usually cover it within that formula.  If any members are particularly interested in getting in ahead of others they can indicate, which one member has already done.  Deputy Cannon gets first dibs because he is effectively a member of the committee for the purposes of today as the Vice Chairman has substituted with him.  If any other members want to come in, I ask them to put their hands up and I will keep a note as they indicate.</p> <p>  I call Mr. Ferrie to deliver his opening statement.</p></speech>

Our written submission focuses primarily on the enforcement of illegal parking in cycle lanes but it also considers other illegal driver behaviour that endangers the safety of people who walk, wheel and cycle.</p> <p>  Parking in cycle lanes is not a victimless crime.  In June of this year, a three year-old girl, travelling in a child seat on her mother&rsquo;s bike, was killed in Chicago when her mother tried to overtake a vehicle parked in the cycle lane and was hit by a passing truck.  A similar incident in Strasbourg some years ago resulted in the death of a 25 year-old woman.  The driver of the parked vehicle was later convicted of manslaughter in recognition of the part his illegal parking had caused in the woman&rsquo;s death.  In Ireland, there have been at least two fatalities in the past six years where a person cycling has collided with a dangerously parked vehicle and there has been at least one other instance where illegally parked cars were found to be a contributory factor in the death of a person cycling.  It is our view that this illegal and dangerous behaviour is not treated with the seriousness it deserves.</p> <p>  It is not just the danger to people who currently cycle that is at issue; illegal parking on cycle lanes creates a safety concern, which deters people from cycling.  We know from the National Transport Authority, NTA&rsquo;s, walking and cycling index 2021 that 22% of Dublin residents do not cycle but would like to.  This figure is even higher for women and for people from ethnic minorities and illustrates the barriers to people taking up cycling.  Section 55 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 describes the offence of parking a vehicle in a dangerous position and states &ldquo;A person shall not park in a public place a vehicle" if, when so parked, the vehicle would be "likely to cause danger to other persons using the place".  It is our view that parking on a cycle lane, in a bus lane or on a footpath meets the test for parking a vehicle in a dangerous position and that it should therefore incur a fine and three penalty points.</p> <p>  A significant issue with enforcement in Dublin is the fractured nature of its operation.  The four local authorities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, to a degree, the National Transport Authority, all have responsibility for enforcement of driver behaviour and it is often unclear where the lines of responsibility lie.  The result is that many offences fall between the cracks, especially those that may be perceived as being of a less serious nature.  This has led to a culture of impunity where people have little fear of enforcement and the law is routinely ignored.  The Government is investing millions of euro in active travel infrastructure to provide people with safe and sustainable alternatives to the private car.  Without proper enforcement, there will be a very poor return on that investment.  Our written submission presents several examples of evidence of a chronic lack of enforcement of illegal parking in cycle lanes, which I invite the committee members to read.  All of the evidence shows a level of enforcement that is negligible compared with the scale of the problem.  We have also presented evidence on various other offences which are poorly enforced at present and which impact on the perceived safety of cycling as a mode of transport.</p> <p>  We have made a series of recommendations, some of which are included in the Government&rsquo;s road safety strategy but which have yet to be implemented.  Again, we invite the committee to review those recommendations and are happy to take questions on them here.  We note that fines for road traffic offences are regularly reviewed and that there have been increases in some fines in recent months but these increases will only be effective if enforcement improves.  I BIKE Dublin recommends that the above requests be delivered to ensure the safety of all road users and to create a safer and more attractive urban environment where people of all ages and abilities can choose to walk, wheel or cycle without fear of injury or worse.</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. Gareth Quinn, central area planning manager.  I have submitted a longer opening statement but in the interest of time, I will read a shorter version.  However I am happy to take questions on any of the other issues.</p><p>We welcome the opportunity to set out the company&rsquo;s views on the enforcement of road traffic offences.  Given the nature of our operations, this submission will focus on bus lane enforcement and potential deterrents and solutions to this issue.  Dublin Bus is the largest public transport provider in the State.  Our services reflect the full spectrum of public transport connectivity in the capital, ranging from orbital and radial routes to 24-hour services and Nitelink services.  This gives Dublin Bus a keen insight into the needs of the city, its businesses and the wider community.  My opening statement will focus on the importance of bus lanes in maintaining frequency, reliability and consistency of journey times; the importance of bus lanes to the overall customer experience; and how bus lanes have helped and continue to help make the bus a more attractive option.  It will also highlight technological solutions that could aid enforcement and some examples of cities which have utilised same; practical solutions which could be implemented almost immediately; and how Dublin Bus would like to facilitate the implementation of these items.</p><p>Of the many causes of delays to bus services, few seem more inherently unjust than drivers who illegally park or drive in a dedicated bus lane, triggering a slowdown for the dozens of customers stuck behind.  While improved bus lane enforcement is only one piece of the puzzle, it is nevertheless an important one.  Dublin Bus is a solutions provider and it is in this spirit that we put forward these options.  The four options I would like to mention are renewing the focus on bus lane enforcement; simplifying bus lane designation by moving all bus lanes to 24-hour; examining the technological solutions that could potentially assist both the National Transport Authority, NTA, and customers; and increasing fines for driving or parking in bus lanes.</p><p> On the importance of bus lane enforcement, buses can help reduce traffic congestion and air pollution as they provide a more efficient way of moving people from one point to another.  However, private vehicles travelling and parking in bus lanes reduces the efficiency of buses and creates unnecessary congestion.  Pre-Covid-19, our network speed at peak times was in the region of 14 km/h, with substantial variations across all transport corridors.  While some gains have been made due to priority and changes to travel patterns, private transport remains extremely competitive in terms of journey times to the city.</p></speech>

You may make a 30-second closing remark.  I know your statement has quite a bit left in it.  You can come in with the other comments later in the session.</p></speech>

The other points I was going to refer to, which are included in the opening statement, were the importance of automatic number plate recognition and the role that Dublin Bus would like to play in a pilot scheme that could be introduced.  On the point we referenced around the 24-hour bus lane designation, it is now timely to review this designation, particularly with changes in travel patterns and peak hours, which now start as early as 5 a.m.  On fixed charge notices, it is now timely to look at increasing the fines for illegally parking or driving in a bus lane.  We would be happy to provide further information on any of these points to the committee.</p></speech>

You will have the opportunity, in the course of engaging with members, to make the other points as we go through.  We will now move to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I call Superintendent Hilman.</p></speech>

I am the assistant commissioner with responsibility for roads policing and community engagement in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am accompanied today by acting chief superintendent, Mr. Thomas Murphy, superintendents Se&aacute;n O&rsquo;Reardon and Se&aacute;n Fallon, who co-ordinate and monitor the operations and activities of the Garda National Roads Policing Bureau.  Under my leadership, the bureau is responsible for policy formulation, communications and media relations, inter-agency co-ordination and traffic enforcement strategies.  Road safety and roads policing remain a strategic priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and are included in our policing plan for 2022.  The plan gives effect to our strategy statement to continue to promote and enforce responsible behaviours on our roads, reduce risk to vulnerable users through targeted prevention and intervention activities, work in partnership with the Road Safety Authority and others to strengthen collaboration to achieve our collective vision and deliver road safety objectives through high-visibility operations, education, engineering and co-operation.</p> <p>  We are committed to ensuring that our roadways, cycle lanes and footpaths are safe for all users, with particular focus on vulnerable road users, given the risks caused by vehicles parked on footpaths and cycle lanes.  While the enforcement of road traffic legislation is part of the everyday work of all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we also work in tandem with local authority partners who share responsibilities in this area.  This allows us, especially our roads policing members, to focus on lifesaver enforcement, education and influencing road user behaviours.  Additionally, we periodically mount specific operations to target illegal parking, which has a detrimental effect on the most vulnerable in society.</p> <p>  I will now briefly outline the structures and governance within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the areas of roads policing.  We have four regional assistant commissioners who are responsible for governance and oversight of roads policing performance in their respective regions, utilising the dedicated divisional roads policing units and inspectors in each division.  In addition, a chief superintendent has been assigned a portfolio.  That chief superintendent works with us in the national bureau for targeted co-ordination and tasking of roads policing personnel across their region.  This ensures an agile process that takes into account current national and regional trends.  This is very much evidence-based and data-led and represents what our data is showing us annually.  It supports our vision of fostering a culture of continuous improvement, enhancing innovation and responsiveness to change by ensuring that roads policing activities are information-led.  The plan is aligned to our national communication strategy and also incorporates inter-agency enforcement.</p> <p>  I have covered our internal roads policing structures, one of a number of strands that have governance and oversight over roads policing nationally.  Externally, I am a member of the road safety transformation board, which has governance over the governmental road safety strategy.  I also report to the Policing Authority on roads policing matters.  I thank the committee members for their time.  I know there are many other areas which we can cover in the questions.</p></speech>

We advocate on behalf of pedestrians in Limerick city and county.  We work to develop awareness of pedestrian needs and solutions, to foster links with other community and active travel groups and to be a source of information around best practice relating to pedestrian infrastructure and amenities.  Through our voluntary activity, we consult with local and national government bodies, host public walking assessment events and are actively involved in our local public participation network.  We are grateful for the opportunity to speak to the committee today on issues relating to illegal parking and can confirm the assertion of the committee that there appears to be a disregard in relation to parking on footpaths and in cycle lanes.</p> <p>  We are in a strange position in Ireland, where parking on footpaths is illegal under road traffic regulations, but little awareness, understanding or enforcement of this law is evident.  In the context of the climate transition and in particular the enormous investment this Government is making in supporting a transformative modal shift towards active travel, the money being spent to upgrade footpaths and make walking safer and more attractive is in danger of being wasted if we continue to allow widespread pavement parking to destroy footpath surfaces and block access to pedestrian means of travel.  We hope this committee will find a means of addressing this situation in a meaningful way. </p> <p>  We attest to the damage done by the practice of pavement parking.  Pedestrians rely on footpaths to be safe and free of obstacles that could force them into the road.  Parking on footpaths directly affects those with mobility difficulties, those who are blind or visually impaired, anyone walking with pushchairs, children, guide dogs or using mobility aids.  Pavement parking deprives people of their liberty, significantly reducing their options for freedom of movement.  It is an injustice that has a real effect on people.  It particularly affects the people to whom we should want to afford the most protection and it deprives them of some very basic rights to lead fulfilled lives and participate in public life.  We are regularly contacted by people highlighting examples of illegal parking and how it negatively affects their everyday lives, from parents of children attending and residents living near busy schools and multiple business owners in the city centre, to those in villages in the county who cannot safely walk or cross the road due to the presence of illegally parked cars.</p><p>These examples are so widespread and constant that they indicate a general disrespect for the law and a lack of concern at enforcement.  Laws which fail to protect the vulnerable and are routinely ignored undermine public confidence in our justice system.</p><p> The Limerick Pedestrian Network accepts that no one solution to the problem of dangerous and illegal parking on footpaths and in cycle lanes exists but that a multifaceted approach involving education, enforcement and improved street design is required.  We welcome the opportunity to present a few proposed solutions and urge the members of the committee to consider them for action.  </p><p> Some of the things we are talking about include a continuation and upgrading of the ongoing Road Safety Authority, RSA, campaign against dangerous parking; increased enforcement and resources including community policing and online reporting; increased level of fines including ring-fencing revenue; increased use of penalty points for dangerous parking; improved street design and public realm; and following on from examples in the UK, a valuable first intervention may be to highlight particular zones for a zero-tolerance approach to pavement parking.</p><p>We would be happy to talk about any of those at this session.</p></speech>

As I said at the outset, we will have seven minutes per member in the first round to include both questions and responses.  Deputy Cannon is a guest of the committee but as he is substituting for the Vice-Chair of the committee, he gets to move up the ranks and he has also indicated early.  The order will be Deputy Cannon, Deputy Costello and Senator Ruane.  Deputy Leddin has also indicated, as has Deputy Pringle.  Deputy Leddin will follow Deputy Pringle as committee members take precedence.  Others can catch my eye as it goes on.  Deputy Cannon has seven minutes and that includes both questions and answers.</p></speech>

We are in a situation, and have been for many years, where Dublin Bus drivers, cyclists and other road users have to share bus lanes.  Hopefully that will become a thing of the past to a certain extent as we roll out the BusConnects network, not only across Dublin but across our other major cities.  Could Ms Keane outline the training drivers undergo before they take to the road on how they interact with and ensure the safety of cyclists as they engage with them on our bus lanes, primarily in Dublin?  How often do they receive refresher training on that aspect of their driving?  When a cyclist or other vulnerable road user reports an incident that causes them serious concern or in some cases injury, what are the reporting mechanisms within Dublin Bus?   I ask because my experience of engaging with Dublin Bus is that I send an email, receive an acknowledgement of the email but no further account of what transpired as a result of that email.  It would be helpful for cyclists and other road users to receive some sort of information as to what transpired after the event.  It would serve to build more confidence in Dublin Bus and its drivers, in the knowledge that they are aware of the vulnerability of the people they encounter on bus lanes every day.</p> <p>  I thank the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the extraordinary work they do in ensuring the safety of all road users on a daily basis.  It is a challenging job at the best of times.  A cultural issue exists where the vast majority of road users do not consider illegal parking to be a major problem or that there are any victims of it.  Equally, I would argue that the tendency at times of some members of the force to park illegally lends to that cultural belief.  Could the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na outline when and where it is acceptable for a member in a Garda vehicle to park in a bus lane, in a cycle lane or on a footpath?  What are the circumstances when that can happen?  </p> <p>  The Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) (Amendment) Regulations 2019, SI 495 of 2019, provides that a "driver shall not overtake or attempt to overtake if to do so would endanger or cause inconvenience to a pedal cyclist".  Do members of the force receive any specific training on how to enforce that element of our road traffic legislation?  If so, how often do they receive refresher courses on or reminders of that legislation?  My experience and that of other road users is of a significant inconsistency of approach across the force in various parts of the country as to how that legislation is enforced.  In some cases, I argue there is little or no knowledge of that legislation in some Garda stations.  I know that from engaging directly with road users who have reported instances of close passing and close overtaking and have found that the member they are reporting it to is not aware of this legislation.</p> <p>  Does An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na see any value in the creation of an online portal where members of the public, including motorists, cyclists or other road users, could quickly and efficiently upload dashcam evidence of dangerous driving to aid the Garda to enforce road safety legislation?  This has been successfully implemented in parts of the UK.  A couple of years ago senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na met with those who worked to introduce this provision in the UK, whereby dashcam footage can be uploaded to an online portal.  An expert group or unit within the force can immediately assess whether an offence has taken place and take subsequent action.  Does it see a value in implementing something similar here?  Whenever a serious road traffic incident occurs on our roads-----</p></speech>

The answers to these questions are quite short.</p> <p>  Does it see a value in doing that?  The Garda quite rightly asks other road users to submit dashcam footage when a serious road traffic incident happens.  Many successful prosecutions have been brought as a result of that aforementioned legislation over the past two to three years.  Cyclists have submitted footage and had successful prosecutions brought against other road users who endangered their lives or their safety.  They are the questions.</p></speech>

Dublin Bus is always aware that we share the road space with a number of vulnerable road users, including cyclists.  Cyclist safety is of paramount importance to us.  It forms a crucial part of our driver training process.  The drivers receive comprehensive classroom and on-bus training as part of their initial induction programme with Dublin Bus.  This includes a strong focus on all vulnerable road users.  We have also responded to new technology as it becomes available and have introduced an integrated innovative virtual reality technology that simulates the cycling experience for our drivers.  This was intended to deliver a better understanding of the challenges facing cyclists.  It was very well received within our training programme and is an important part of the course.</p><p>The issue of cyclist safety is also dealt with comprehensively as part of mandatory refresher training for all drivers, which takes place every two years, and drivers receive an annual certificate in professional competence, CPC, every year.</p><p> There are a number of training programmes we go through, and I would stress that the practical element includes an on-the-road assessment of driving style, where drivers are assessed against a standard set of core skills using the company's vigil vanguard driver training system.  The core skills reflect a variety of important messages in relation to cyclist safety.  This is a crucial part of the driver training programme.  Drivers also receive updated handbooks, and information posters are displayed where there are legislative or other changes during periods between training.  We also have a training video, which further increases driver awareness around cyclist safety, awareness around other road users and other sorts of changed conditions.  They are just some of the measures on the training side that I would like to outline.</p><p> I would like to address the second part of the question, if I have time, relating to the complaints system.  We take any complaints very seriously.  They are thoroughly investigated within Dublin Bus and corrective action is introduced.  That might include refresher training if something has come up in relation to a particular driver or if road conditions have changed at a particular junction.  That is introduced into the programme.</p><p> To give some context, which may be useful, we operate around 7,000 trips per day.  We carry 120 million journeys every year post Covid and we monitor the incidence of cyclist issues very carefully.  Sixty-eight incidents have taken place so far in 2022, but I would stress that they include both collisions and incidents involving a cyclist.  They could range from an altercation to a cyclist falling off and causing a driver to brake harshly.  There may not necessarily have been any interaction.  All of these issues are recorded regardless of blame or culpability with the intention of learning and improving from all of them.</p><p> I also make the point that under our direct award contract with the National Transport Authority, NTA, we are required to report all of these issues to the NTA.  We also have our own safety board subcommittee within Dublin Bus which takes all of these issues very seriously.  It is a formal subcommittee of the board and we report not only internally but also to the board on these issues.</p></speech>

The online portal in many ways dovetails with stuff those from Dublin Bus have talked about, such as automatic number plate recognition, ANPR, and some of the stuff the Garda representatives mentioned in their submission about section 81 of the Road Traffic Act.  We have lots of cameras.  We have 14 cameras on Dublin Bus.  I will admit, given my constant talking about data protection and the general data protection regulation, GDPR, I would prefer a system where a driver has to trigger it instead of constant passive surveillance by Dublin Bus, which is slightly off-putting.  Certainly, an online portal for reporting these things and providing evidence has worked well in our neighbouring jurisdiction, and I would love to know why it cannot happen here.  Again, as cycling advocates such as Deputy Cannon have said, we see it for road traffic offences so why not for cycling offences?</p> <p>  The witnesses make the point in terms of section 81 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 that it is not possible to use CCTV to enforce parking or driving in bus lanes or cycle lanes.  There is a list of offences for which CCTV can be used.  These include careless driving, parking in a dangerous position and dangerous driving.  Surely, given the evidence we have heard from other witnesses that parking or driving in a bus lane or cycle lane is careless driving at the very least, or in some cases dangerous driving, and would certainly meet the category of parking a vehicle in a dangerous position, can we not use section 81 of the Road Traffic Act to enforce those behaviours through those bits of legislation which are allowed, which then brings us back to the portal?  One of the frustrations is that, any time we talk about these kinds of issues, for example, with a local authority, we are told it is an enforcement issue.  Here we have tools for enforcement that we see work, whether it is ANPR, a photograph taken by a bus driver, or an online portal, and we even seem to have a nice bit of legislation, so I would love to more about why that is not working.</p> <p>  I have one more question.  There has been talk in some of the submissions about the culture of impunity in relation to this.  I would love to hear how that looks on the ground in practical terms.  Perhaps An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could answer that and the pedestrian network could answer the second part.</p></speech>

We will take them in that order. If those from An Garda would also like to use the time to respond briefly to the question from Deputy Cannon, they may do so.</p></speech>

It is part of our digital strategy and part of our digital evidence management system, DEMS, which we are currently rolling out.  It links with other pieces of work and it will be reliant on both funding and confirmation of the legislation - the digital devices Bill - currently being developed and it will be subject to procurement and a better understanding of the product that we require.  We have looked at other jurisdictions as well so we are not sitting waiting for this and are preparing to have an online portal.  In many other jurisdictions it is not solely a matter of people uploading.  People need to make a report, they will get a link and they will upload that.  Being realistic, it will in all likelihood be 2024 before that will be going live for us.  I was speaking to our chief information officer just to get an update in anticipation of that question being asked.  However, we are totally committed to it.  More life is online and video technology is used.</p> <p>  In the interim to try to do what we can with what we have currently, we are going to relaunch our traffic watch system.  That means we are going to do some internal work where those reports will go straight into our CAD centres, our control centres.  Currently, they go into our telephone system.  Moving them to control centres that operate 24-7 will allow those to be considered in a much more timely manner.  Again, we are looking at the first or second quarter at the start of next year, so we will do that in the interim but with our full commitment to that because we recognise and hear, and that is what they have in other jurisdictions.</p> <p>  Second, I agree very much with what Deputy Costello said about enhanced powers, and as we have heard today with all this and the safety issue, it is a collaborative approach with other partners but using technology where we can.</p><p>Many other jurisdictions have a clear use of technology and enforceable powers where people park in bus or cycle lanes.  I hear what Deputy Costello is saying about dangerous parking and other potential road traffic offences.  They would each need to be looked at individually to show how they would constitute those offences.  I know that Chief Superintendent Murphy did some research a couple of years ago in terms of other jurisdictions and enforcement of bus lanes, and how that is done totally by technology and in many areas by local authorities.  Any enabling powers that assist us in traffic management are to be welcomed.</p></speech>

The question was around the culture of impunity and examples of it on the ground.  Unfortunately I am aware of this from first-hand experience.  I am from the Dooradoyle estate on the south side of Limerick City.  It is a small housing estate of about 160 houses.  Most of the residents, including my own parents, are living there for 50 plus years.  Unfortunately it suffers from rampant illegal parking and footpath parking.  This is primarily due to traffic accessing St. Paul's National School and University Hospital Limerick which are both in close proximity.  Effectively what happens is that for an hour in the morning and for an hour in the evening the residents of that estate are largely under house arrest, or that is how they feel.  This has led to a serious decrease in the quality of life for those people.  They cannot access any of the amenities they need to access by car during those hours.  If they choose to walk they must run a gauntlet of cars parked on the footpath and blocking driveways, and it is hugely disruptive.  They have petitioned An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on numerous occasions to ticket the offenders and that has been done.   Unfortunately it gets watered down over time and the offenders return.  The residents acknowledge the resource limitations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  They have also tried to engage themselves with some of the offenders only to be met with apathy, false promises and occasionally aggressive behaviour.  It is a problem that seems to be worsening.</p> <p>  One of the solutions that we have come here today to propose seems very appropriate for Dooradoyle estate, which is a zero-tolerance zone where periodically a member of the community policing unit would go in and issue tickets and penalty points.  This would prevent recurrence as people would not be able to build up penalty points over time.  The safety and well-being benefits for the residents of Dooradoyle estate would be huge.  If this proves successful it could be a model that could be rolled out to many other affected communities in the country.    </p></speech>

I must admit this is not a topic I discuss or have engaged in much so I am very much in a listening role here today.   What comes to mind for me is whether fixed penalty fines and ticketing curb behaviour in the long term.  I know witnesses mentioned educational campaigns and I think of the road traffic campaigns which I would imagine have a big impact on people.  I remember first learning many years ago about how I was blocking a wheelchair user in on a path.  I could not believe that I actually doing that in such a self-centred, selfish way without ever thinking about how my parking was impacting other users of the path or of the road.  Thankfully that awareness gave me the wherewithal to think twice about where and how I was parking.  I am wondering about the impact of educational campaigns on a national scale versus enforcement of fines.  I am sure there has to be a two-pronged approach in some way, but is there research that shows that penalties work?  Human behaviour will often measure risk in a moment so there would have to be someone policing that all day long in a community.  We have heard about one estate but if we multiply that all over the country how do we enforce that?  I would also be apprehensive about the technology piece, even if that could be the answer.  I am wondering what is needed as regards an educational campaign to begin to curb people's actual behaviour.  I know there will still be some people that will break the law regardless of having that awareness and that is where penalties will probably come in for those type of users but how do we get to a point where people's behaviour changes, as with seat belts, drink driving, all of those things?  I am sure that people's awareness probably impacts those more so than penalties.  It is a vague comment really but I am just trying to understand what will curb behaviour.  </p> <p>  City planning representatives are not here today in terms of outlining the responsibility they must have in making roads safe for everyone.  When I go abroad I generally rent a bike.  I spent the summer in Portland and I was in a new city that I had never been in before yet I cycled around it at ease, without fear.  I also spent time in Washington.  The bike lanes are in the middle of the roads so nobody can ever park on them and there are kerbs blocking any cars being able to come into them.  It seemed so much safer than my own city, where I will not cycle.  If I can go to a foreign country that I have never visited before and feel fine about it and be happy on the roads, a conversation is obviously needed about responsibility for road safety and safe environments rather than those where a road user thinks "I will take the risk of parking my car here while I run in to collect the kids from school because I have no other option".  What is the other option for those parents?   They can be fined all we want but where do we push the problem to in terms of who is responsible for ensuring schools and shop fronts and couriers and delivery drivers have somewhere safe to pull in, in the first place?  It is probably not a direct question but if I could have comments from Ms Hilman and then potentially from Mr. Buckley, Dr. Lyes or Mr. Ferrie.</p></speech>

We start off with design and engineering from the outset where we can.  When we do come in with enforcement, even like the example in Limerick, we can bring our community policing team in but what does the design look like outside that school?  If one is going to design something where people cannot park, is there a car park where parents can park to have a longer term solution to that?</p> <p>  Superintendent Fallon has some research from the University of Limerick, UL, and I will pass over to him shortly.  From the perspective of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and how we approach things, I did outline at the outset how we operate.  We are the national unit and we set operations and we communicate those.  Everything is still left to the discretion of the individual garda who goes to the call.  If we look at how we policed Covid-19, the four Es it is very much the same in this space - engagement, explaining, education and then the move on to enforcement.  With enforcement Chief Superintendent Murphy is working with the Department on the introduction of the increased fines.  There are increased fines introduced by the Minister but it is important to have the tools and toolkits that are right for the individual circumstances garda&iacute; find themselves in when they go out to those calls.  Undoubtedly it is also about, as Senator Ruane referenced, engineering and partnership, working with local authorities and how areas are designed.  There are also the opportunities offered by technology.   The Senator mentioned research and I know Superintendent Fallon has some. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.990" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Fallon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022100400002#G00700"><p>Senator Ruane touched on education and that is a hugely important piece for us, certainly in terms of the engagement we have had recently with our roads policing personnel.  We have proactively examined in the past six to nine months how we would engage with those target demographics of people who may be at risk.  During that we came upon a really interesting piece.  I want to reassure the committee that there are really passionate people in the roads policing community; their professionalism comes across the table when they speak with great passion about going to those scenes and dealing with the horrific aftermaths that they face on a fairly frequent basis.  One of the sergeants in Limerick developed the Lifesaver educational project.  Last week we agreed that would be rolled out nationally as part of our education programme where we will have a standardised presentation that can be adapted.  Its initial concept was to target transition year students across Limerick but that can be tailored and adapted to industry and Tony has given this presentation to various large companies in the Limerick area.</p><p>We did some feedback touching on the impact that is having.  The data we received were a very positive endorsement of that, particularly around getting the voice into those young people, as it were, because they are probably not watching TV.  In my own house nobody watches TV and we are not reading mainstream newspaper media.  How are we going to target that?  It is tailor made and the advantage for us that we are really excited about is that it will be standardised and we will have lifesaver project ambassadors.  For all the pain points we are seeing, there is the opportunity to raise awareness of that.  There is a reality, as was alluded to, that at certain times you do not realise the damage you are causing.  There is an onus on us not just in terms of the enforcement piece but the education piece and bringing people with us because, as the Commissioner has alluded to, this is very much a shared responsibility.  It will not all be done by garda&iacute; alone.  Likewise, everyone has a social responsibility.  Certainly in terms of the education piece, we are quite excited by it and think it will have a real impact.  It has had so far and it has been delivered the project to something in the region of 50,000 people.  We are quite enthused by that.</p></speech>

Not being from Dublin, maybe I have a different attitude to a lot of this stuff.  I do drive around the city, however, and I see what is happening.  I do not see much evidence of people driving in bus lanes, which is quite good, but I agree they should be made 24 hour.  I use bus lanes outside of the times they are in operation, but it makes a lot of sense for them to be 24 hour and that should be rolled out.  It would make a lot of sense in terms of safety.</p> <p>  I take what the Garda witnesses say about education and stuff.  That is vitally important.  What you do see an awful lot of is people parking in bus lanes and cycle lanes.  Before I came to the meeting, I saw on Twitter that somebody had pointed out to garda&iacute; that there was a car parked blocking the path where they were pushing a pram, and the garda just said it was illegal and drove off without doing anything about it.  That kind of stuff does not work and defeats the whole purpose, now that that tweet has gone out and hundreds of thousands of people have seen it.  There is a need for an enforcement role to take place in the meantime, because if we wait for the Government and the local authorities to roll out proper educational programmes, we will be waiting a long time, unfortunately.  There is a need for that enforcement role to take place actively, because I know from personal experience that if you know you are likely to get done on a certain section of road or you have got done before for something, that is going to make a difference as to whether you do it again.  That is the reality of the situation.  Even if you hear that somebody else has got done or something like that, that makes a difference and it gets out there.  That is vitally important, and while we wait for the rollout of the education courses, that has to happen in terms of building people's respect for the law and for pedestrian safety.  I would probably be guilty of it myself at times too, so it is very important we do that as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.993" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022100400002#H00500"><p>I want to respond to Senator Ruane and Deputy Pringle on the enforcement and education pieces.  The education piece through the RSA, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and everyone else has been going on a long time and we are all aware of it.  Some of us with young kids see a lot of it as well.  Parallel to the education, however, there are many people, as the Deputy said, who will remember receiving a ticket for speeding or otherwise on a section of road and will slow down.  Enforcement is very important.  It hammers things home and supports the education.  It shows we are educating people on this but that there are consequences.  If there are no consequences, people do not care.  They will run the gauntlet, take the risk and park in the cycle lane for two minutes.  They will speed down the road because they are late or in a hurry, and if there are no consequences, they will continue to do that.</p> <p>  Somebody mentioned impunity.  One good example of evidence of enforcement is the average speed cameras on the new M7, which are also in the Dublin Port tunnel with 99% compliance.  Before speed cameras were introduced on the M7, speeding compliance was about 60%, so about 40% were consistently breaking the speed limits.  That improved once they were installed.  It improved from 60% to 89% before they were active, and once they were activated, that compliance increased beyond 90%.  It is very clear that, along with the education and telling people to behave and how to behave, enforcement is very important to get the message across.  If there is no penalty, there is no crime, there are no consequences, and people will continue to do it until they get caught and there are consequences.  Both points were well made and I think enforcement should follow hand in hand with the education piece.</p></speech>

The vast majority comply.  Technology is one of the four areas, and I know Dublin Bus told the committee about this earlier, where, as well as enforcement, either by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or by local authority parking wardens, it can play a role if people know they are going to be detected doing something.  We will not have a garda in every street, on every road 24 hours a day, but we know the high-risk areas where we can target operations, and we do that.  That is where there is a good opportunity for the use of technology.  If we had technology on buses, it would be able to record where a car is parked and a process introduced where it can be used for enforcement against that type of offending.</p></speech>

Is that not enough?</p></speech>

The Deputy has given us an example.  There is that as well, and if we are seeing the offence ourselves.  Again, it is back to what was said earlier about it being at the discretion of each individual member as to how he or she deals with the offence that has been reported to him or her.  It is also about being able to have that type of non-intercept detection, where it is recorded, there does not have to be that engagement, and the technology can be used in addition to the Garda and local authorities, as happens in other jurisdictions as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.997" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1488" speakername="Pa Daly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022100400002#H01100"><p>Coming from a County Kerry perspective, there has been a complete change in attitude towards cycling.  When I went to school in the 1980s, there were bike sheds.  I spoke to a teacher in one school recently and he told me five out of 500 pupils in this Kerry school cycle.  In another school, three out of 300 cycle.  None of those were teenage girls.  In 2016, 70% of Kerry children went to primary school by car, which is 10% more than the previous census.  There has been an 87% decrease between 1996 and 2011 in people cycling to secondary school.  In the whole of the State, I think 700 teenage girls cycle to school compared with 19,000 in 1986.  I remember bringing one of my children to school on the bike and one of the parents at the school gate saying to me she did not know I was off the road, which I was not by the way, for the record - not yet anyway.</p> <p>  A total of 90% of the cyclists going to school seem to be male and consequently there is a big traffic problem outside many schools, in Killarney and Tralee in particular.  I spoke to a garda recently and asked him to send someone to monitor what was going on, because I do not think you can go straight into schools and start handing out fines.  Parents would have to be given fair warning.  The Garda put down cones at one school and one person came along and started parking her car there.  When someone pointed what she was doing, she said she thought she was being guided into the spot as opposed to not being allowed park there.</p> <p>  The assistant commissioner mentioned an interagency response, and it might have been mentioned by a few people.  That is important, because none of the cycle lanes in Kerry seem to be a different colour, which is important.</p><p>Most of the greenways currently being built in Kerry are guided towards tourism in rural rather than urban areas where people actually use them.  It is really only an accident that some of them, at the beginning or the end of the routes, have become very successful urban greenways or cycleways.</p><p> I think Mr. Collins mentioned the planning situation and the inclusion of drop-offs.  One school in Tralee was recently refurbished but no provision was made for people to drop off their children in a good way.  I welcome the comments by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on enforcement.  When the garda&iacute; came to the school that day, they had to go away because the unit staffing was down from 13 garda&iacute; a couple of years ago to nine now.  Seven of the garda&iacute; in that unit were required in court on a District Court day on a Wednesday in Tralee, so the garda&iacute; had to leave before parents came to the school at that time.  No more than during Covid, it is important to engage with people and, as Commissioner Harris always says, police by consent rather than going straight in because that would not go down well.</p><p> I am not so sure about the 24-hour bus lanes as someone who drives in and out of Dublin every other day, sometimes at 11 p.m or 12 midnight.  I am not sure if bus lanes are necessary at those times but every day is a school day, as they say, so I am open to ideas on that.  I thank the representatives for their time.  I ask them to see what they can do down the line about more garda&iacute; in Kerry.  I am sure that will be echoed by many members of the police service there.  Some people say "the force" all the time but I am not comfortable with that phrase.</p></speech>

It is a problem-solving approach that very much includes community policing teams.  In Kerry, we are using the See Something, Say Something app in Tralee, and it is now going to launch in Killarney, through which things can also be reported.  We will launch that nationally; it started in Kerry.  It is where members of the public can also report things to us through that app.  We are about to launch that in Drogheda and Longford.</p> <p>  I have not yet mentioned the joint policing committees and the three new community safety partnerships of Longford, Waterford and north inner city Dublin.  It is very much about how we can work in partnership with them - Longford launched its community safety plan just two weeks ago - and especially with the community policing teams.  We are working with our roads policing members in the longer term, and the Deputy gave a good example of no drop-off points at a school, to see how they can work with local authorities to facilitate something.  That is very much what our approach has been and will continue to be.</p></speech>

If people drop their children off and park illegally, what is the alternative?  What do we do?  It is important to realise this a bit of a vicious cycle.  People are driving their children to school because it is unsafe for them for them to walk or cycle, but by driving their children to school they are adding to the safety issues on the roads.  The issues of enforcement and infrastructure have to be tackled.  We have to provide children with the option of cycling to school.</p> <p>  A very good measure of how safe our roads are is the number of children cycling to school.  We often hear about the number of fatalities and that is an important measure of road safety but when we compare Ireland with somewhere like the Netherlands, for example, 75% of secondary school students there cycle to school.  In Ireland, as members will know, that number is approximately 5%.  It is very low, although it may have increased in the past few years.  From our perspective, that tells its own story about the perception of safety on the roads.  As a result of that perception, more people are driving because they believe that is the safest way to get their children to school.  That is the issue that has to be tackled.</p></speech>

As they know, it is something in which I take a particular interest and pushed with members of the committee.  I am very happy to see that it is happening today.  As I said, it is critically important.  I get the sense that many people in this room do not understand just how critically important it is.</p> <p>  We have a chronic situation with respect to illegal parking on bus lanes, cycle lanes and footpaths.  Mr. Ferrie's point about the impact of this is that it ultimately deters people from walking, cycling or using the bus.  One of the greatest challenges we have is to get people to use those modes of transport.  Unless we take it very seriously when other road users impinge on people's ability to use those modes, we will not succeed in this great challenge we face.  By the way, I do not want to say that this failure is simply down to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It would be wrong of me to say that.  The failure is that of the Government and local authorities.  We have to accept that this is failure.  It is total failure and we need to sort it out.</p> <p>  I am very happy to hear from Mr. Buckley and I welcome my county compatriots to today's meeting.  What Mr. Buckley described in Dooradoyle is repeated everywhere on practically every street in the country.  I would like to see a trial in Dooradoyle but I would also like to see us get beyond trials very quickly because we are in this chronic situation.  We can talk about the four Es of engagement, explaining, education and enforcement but the latter really has to happen now because it has not been happening.  I welcome the earlier comments about the launch of the portal in 2024.  It will be very interesting to hear how that is shaped.  We have to get it right.  Is there any legislative barrier to implementing that portal system?  The road traffic Bill is going through the Oireachtas at present.  We have to get that right.  I want the representatives to tell us what is needed in that Bill, so we can help them get that portal.</p> <p>  On the discussion of the ANPR technology by Dublin Bus, I am very encouraged by the strong suggestion that we need this technology and we need to roll it out quickly to get the buses moving.  I heard similar from Dublin Bus's colleagues in Bus &Eacute;ireann at a private meeting I had with its representatives.  I want to see us roll out this technology.  It will make the jobs of garda&iacute; easier if we do so.  I want to know if there are barriers to it.</p> <p>  Fundamentally, I want everybody to understand that this is a chronic situation and we are at a point of total failure.  We need to sort that out very quickly.  I will use the remainder of my time, three and a half minutes, to give an opportunity to I Bike Dublin and Limerick Pedestrian Network to say anything else they need to say because their members have not had a chance to come in so much.  I also want to allow a minute or 90 seconds for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to respond.</p></speech>

We have a situation where local authorities throughout the country have very different approaches to this.  Some of them have traffic wardens and some contract private organisations to carry this out.</p><p>There is a need to consider the scope of the offences they can enforce.  There is also the role of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in enforcing road traffic offences.  The NTA has a role as regulator for the taxi industry and, to a certain extent, in respect of the detail and design of roads.  This creates a real issue, certainly in Dublin, where there are four local authorities, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the NTA and there are offences that fall through the cracks.  Dublin Street Parking Services is responsible for enforcing parking in Dublin city centre but it often says it cannot enforce a particular matter and one needs to get in touch with the Garda on it.  Obviously, the Garda has to make decisions in respect of its resources and the issues on which it focuses, and it may consider the matter is not high on its list of priorities.  A simplification of that system such that is a clear definition of responsibilities in terms of who enforces the law and how they do so is needed, as well as an increase in the resources to do that.  I wanted to make sure that point was made at this meeting.</p></speech>

I will hand over to Mr. Murphy, who will address the legislation.  To answer specifically on the portal, we have been fully engaged with the Department on the development of the portal and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Recording Devices) Bill.  We have been involved in that but there is other legislation in which Mr. Murphy was involved previously with regard to specific offences.</p></speech>

As part of the overall Government road safety strategy, the NTA and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will later this year consider the development of technology in that regard and the legislation that would allow the likes of the NTA to take prosecutions in lieu of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That could be done in a manner similar to the enforcement of bus lanes in Belfast, where a local government agency undertakes that role.  I am aware that a Bill was brought forward in 2019 to expand the role of section 81 of the Road Traffic Act to allow for bus lane and footpath enforcement by digital technology.  We are working towards that and would welcome the support of the committee in that regard.</p></speech>

If the committee can help in that regard, that is what we are here to do.  The Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021 is on Second Stage in the Seanad at the moment.  It may be the appropriate legislation in this regard.  If it is, we would like to hear from the witnesses on that so that we can get it through.</p></speech>

I thank all the expert contributors to this important discussion.  I was going to make a point in respect of automatic number plate recognition technology but it has more or less been made already by Deputy Leddin.  I understand why people adversely impacted by this issue have questions regarding the technology having been rolled out for quite some time in respect of speeding but not in respect of bus lanes.  Ms Keane outlined clearly in her submission what it entails and that is in use in other jurisdictions, yet it appears we are pushing an open door today and there are no budgetary restraints or obstacles in the way.  Is my understanding correct?  I do not wish to ask the witnesses to trespass on the political arena, but where do they see that issue?  Ms Keane was very enthusiastic about it and the trials that have happened.  It would make a difference.  I detect a harmonious approach from all the contributors today but I ask them to drill down among the harmony.  People impacted by the illegal use of bus lanes do not have the extra vigilance and enforcement that others enjoy, yet we all seem to be on the same page in respect of that issue.  How long will it take before it is brought to fruition?  I ask Ms Keane to elaborate further as I know she is an advocate on this matter.</p></speech>

I will provide detail on the position of Dublin Bus and then pass to our colleagues from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  To reiterate the points made earlier, we are now at a time when technology and the transport industry are significantly integrating.  This creates an opportunity.  In particular, we are talking about automatic number plate recognition.  Dublin City Council trialled fixed artificial intelligence, AI, pole cameras in 2020 and 2021, although we understand that was not for the purposes of enforcement.  If there was consensus for a pilot exercise for 12 months, that would serve as a proof of concept and a learning opportunity for all parties.  Dublin Bus vehicles are now equipped with up to 14 high-tech cameras, with extremely advanced CCTV quality and recognition features, even compared with the technology five years ago.  That could play a vital role in utilising the technology that is in place to improve the journey for all our customers.  If the trial were to take place on a designated spine, that would ensure alignment with the BusConnects project that is coming in and would allow operators, the authorities and the law enforcement agencies to learn from this.  We do not believe budget would be a constraint on the pilot.  The ability this would bring to improve the average speeds in bus lane timings would more than outweigh any cost of implementing it.  I will pass to my colleagues from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with the legislation aspect.</p></speech>

The cloning and fraudulent use of number plates is a problem for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Although my Bill is aimed at combatting crime or making crime more difficult, it would come into play in this regard as well.  It would be complementary in the sense that there would be fewer cloned plates on roads, I hope.</p></speech>

We are fully engaged with them and will be working alongside the NTA to come up with a plan for it.  At the bottom of it is the issue of the prosecuting authority.  It is about getting over that aspect of enforcement.</p></speech>

We are under time pressure as the select committee will be meeting after this session to discuss legislation.  I call Deputy Alan Farrell.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.1025" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1562" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022100400002#K01300"><p>Our guests are very welcome.  I thank them for coming in.  I do not wish to be repetitive but I want to touch on the points made by the witnesses from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of social responsibility.  I do not want what I am about to say to be taken as a dismissal of that because, of course, garda&iacute; do not put private cars on bicycle lanes or across driveways, among other things.  There is a little bit of a hierarchy, however, in terms of the approach taken by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as I know will be admitted.</p><p>At certain times, certain things are just not a priority for good reasons.  However, these are big issues.  I have always said, as a parliamentarian for 11 years, that it is the little things that make people happy.  Getting the council to fix a pothole - to be blunt - often makes them a lot happier than a &euro;600 energy credit over the next six months.  There is a need for social responsibility but, in equal measure, there is a need to take these matters seriously when it is possible to do so.</p><p> I want to stress the point about enforcement outside of schools.  I am fortunate to live in Malahide where we had one of the first school street projects in the country, which is well over two years old.  It was met with quite a bit of resistance along the way but it is up and running and is very successful.  There has been being a massive increase in the number of children walking and cycling to school in Malahide, which I am thrilled to see.  However, parking across driveways for 15 or ten minutes still causes issues on certain streets around schools.  The core of Malahide is a couple of hundred years old, therefore, the houses are not young, which invariably means the age profile of the occupants of the houses is a little bit older.  These issues are a big deal to them.  It means they cannot get out of their homes.  In general terms, not specifically Malahide, that hierarchy of approach needs to be looked at.  If there are things we need to do in these Houses to support An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we should do them.  Everything we do in these Houses should support safer road usage and safer facilities for pedestrians and cyclists alike.  We are getting to the point where we will be able to improve that across the board but, unfortunately, we are coming at it ten, 20 or even 30 years too late in certain instances.  It is a cultural thing which we need to change.  Covid lockdown was a great help in that process.  While it was a tragic set of circumstances for thousands of families, it also gave us an opportunity to take stock again of certain things and that is something which we will all benefit from in the end.</p><p> I do not have specific questions for the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na other than to note that if we are going to do this together at Government, Oireachtas and local authority level, then when it is pointed out, it is like the nose on one's face.  All members have mentioned reporting matters to the Garda when it is in front of them and one member mentioned that the garda drove off.  While the garda may have been on an important job, the fact is we must acknowledge that these little matters are meaningful.</p></speech>

I have responsibility for roads policing but I am also the strategic lead for community engagement and the framework for community policing that is being rolled out.  They work in tandem.  Many people say roads policing and community policing are very different but they are not.  They have much in common and are about working on a local level.  We spoke about policing in the capital city, Dublin, but for local towns throughout the country, those local issues are impactive.  That is at the heart of what our community policing garda&iacute; do.</p> <p>  In terms of support, we have a separate project of work.  We have just rolled out mobility devices to our roads policing garda&iacute; over recent years.  More than 600 mobility devices have been provided to our community garda&iacute;.  We have branded community Garda cars; white cars with our badge on it.  We are very much involved in community policing, problem solving, taking a partnership approach with local communities and joint policing committees, and working on those local issues.  It is those local issues that impact on quality of life.  We have heard about examples from Limerick and Kerry.  It is very much our responsibility.  Having listened to what local communities are telling us, those are the issues they want us to work in partnership to resolve.</p></speech>

As a person who cycles and walks around the city, you get frustrated reporting sometimes, as reports fall on deaf ears, you feel like you are wasting your time or things takes a long time to happen.  Dublin Bus said there were 68 recorded incidents involving cyclists in 2022.  If cyclists reported some of the incidents, that number would increase tenfold or a hundredfold.</p></speech>

They do not bother reporting and it is frustrating for them.  I am delighted to see steps being taken to rejuvenate Traffic Watch.  I have used this service before and I know people who have used it.  You might get passed step A very quickly but then move on to step B and it falls flat on its face.  You do not hear from anyone.  You get frustrated with the follow-up and so on and so forth.  If people see action and activity in response to the reports, unfortunately, it will increase the workload tenfold or a hundredfold but that is where it is at.  If people see actions, they will follow through and it will help guide the Garda and everyone else in respect of resources.</p></speech>

It is an interesting point.  It was said earlier that if people were given a warning, they would not do it again.  I believe we are way beyond that.  We know people pull in to clearways for a couple of minutes.  How many warnings must we give society?  We are way past that.  I understand why that approach is taken but one gets to a point when one has to say that people have enough warnings.  There are enough signs.  How many more signs do people need telling them not to pull in?</p></speech>

These initiatives, such as number plate recognition, have been tried and tested in other jurisdictions.  Nothing is stopping us from doing the same here.  Yes, it involves granular detail, but we should not be debating these things because they should already be here.</p> <p>  Finally, if people report incidents, they should get responses.  Dublin Bus was asked what happens to a complaint.  If that information was available and people saw it being followed through, the Traffic Watch complaints desk and phones might light up, but that would be the result of having good resources.  It will show that there is a problem and where the resources can be put.  This will help the Garda to get funding and so on and so forth.</p></speech>

Senator Ward is next, followed by Senator Gallagher.  We will then have to adjourn the meeting because at 5 o'clock we move to a select committee meeting on a separate topic.  Therefore, we must keep proceedings moving.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.1034" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1685" speakername="Barry Ward" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022100400002#L00900"><p>I am sorry as I will have to leave to attend the Seanad.  First, I endorse what has been said about reporting.  It is true of any crime that if people do not feel reports are being taken seriously, they will stop making reports as they will feel they are wasting their time.  I endorse what has been said.</p> <p>  As a cyclist, I probably do not report enough when I have had close calls.  A number of my friends who have GoPro cameras have shown me footage of close calls and negative experiences they have had with all types of motorists and even other cyclists.  In that regard, the portal is tremendously interesting but it comes with evidential challenges, of which the Garda will have to take stock.  Extra instructions may need to be given to members of the Garda on how quickly they must act on this information, how they will preserve it and make it ready for presentation in court if and when that becomes necessary.  It is a positive opportunity to ramp up enforcement and send out a clear message that people who are cavalier with other people's lives, which is what it comes down to, will not be able to walk away from it.</p> <p>  I accept the bona fides of what has been said about the Garda attitude to these things.  I confess it has not been my experience.  Comments have been made about Garda driving.  I work in the criminal courts.  I am aware there is huge demand for Garda parking in the surrounds of courts and Garda stations.  Sometimes, some members of the Garda do not live up to what we expect of them in terms of driving and parking.  It is not a general criticism of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but there are some members who could be reminded of the situation.</p> <p>  I acknowledge what was said about the number of cameras on buses.  I have a difficulty with the idea that the Garda was using bus footage as an enforcement mechanism.  The Garda can use bus footage in the same way it can use footage from an individual cyclist, pedestrian or bystander.  Bus footage does not have any superior evidential status.</p><p>It appears that there is a wealth of bus footage that could be used and co-operation between Dublin Bus and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na might be hugely beneficial.</p><p> There are parts of my area where we have extremely high-quality cycling facilities.  I am thinking of Frascati Road, for example, where there is a bypass to Blackrock up to a point but unfortunately, it is patchy.  As one goes along Rock Road, cyclists and buses share the same space and I am not sure that all Dublin Bus drivers understand that.  Cyclists come in different categories and along that route there are some very fast commuter cyclists who just want to get there but there are also more vulnerable people who are slow.  There are also people going to school, both children and parents, and I am not sure that all bus drivers understand that driving close to those people is not on, either behind them or next to them.  I appreciate what has been said about the education provided for bus drivers but I have felt under pressure sometimes when there has been a very big bus right behind me.  I am not a fast cyclist.  I have a Dutch bike and it takes its time, unfortunately.  When a bus is right up behind people it can really put them under pressure.  The witnesses have said that there is experiential training for bus drivers, which I welcome, but it would be good to repeat the message to them that they have a role to play when they are sharing road space with cyclists.  </p><p> I also want to endorse what Mr. Ferrie said about school transport and encouraging children to cycle to school.  There are few enough children in my area who cannot cycle to school except for the lack of proper safe facilities.  I was delighted to be involved as a councillor in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown with moving a wall on Convent Road, off Carysfort Avenue, to facilitate children going to Carysfort National School.  That hugely increased the number of children who could cycle along that stretch.  We know that if the infrastructure is put in place, it increases the numbers who cycle to school.  Some schools are doing their best and on the whole, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown has shown itself to have a very good track record in putting infrastructure in place but it is still patchy.  In the same way that the Rock Road, Frascati Road corridor is patchy, the same is true around some schools.  Local authorities need to step up to the mark and central Government needs to support them financially to do so.</p><p> Finally, I am not in favour of 24-hour bus lanes because we do not have 24-hour bus services.  There are places in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown with bus lanes, for example, Rowanbyrn along the Monkstown link road, where there is no bus service to speak of at all.  If the bus service matches the bus lanes in terms of frequency and the time during which it operates, that is fine but at the moment we do not have 24-hour bus services so I do not see the merit in having 24-hour bus lanes.  </p><p> I thank all of our contributors for their time.</p></speech>

We were all walking and cycling more and became aware, as we had to avoid people on paths, just how narrow many of our footpaths are and how little space there is on them.  This led to Limerick Pedestrian Network launching a We Need Space campaign in Limerick, with limited success.  I agree that there has been much more emphasis since lockdown on the need for pedestrian and cyclist space.</p></speech>

This is an issue that also arises with cycle lanes.  When cycle lanes are not 24-hour, it increases the instances of people parking in them outside of the set times.  In surveys we have done, there are higher levels of people parking in cycle lanes either side of the cut-off times.  People over-stay the time on the lanes and if, for example, it is nearly 12 o'clock, they just park in the lanes.  We believe that 24-hour cycle lanes and bus lanes would remove any ambiguity about whether drivers can park in them and would lead to better compliance.</p></speech>

At the outset I thank all of the stakeholders for coming here this afternoon and participating in this very worthwhile discussion.  It has been a very interesting meeting.  As a culchie and someone who comes from the country, I would take cognisance of what my learned friends from the city have to say on these issues but I was in Amsterdam recently and found the infrastructure there for cyclists and pedestrians very relaxing.  It felt very safe to be there.  As someone who comes from the country and drives into the city of Dublin two or three days a week, I find it can be quite challenging because it is so busy and there is so much going on.  Drivers have to be very alert at all times and to be cognisant of the fact that there are cyclists using the roadway as well.  Mention was made earlier of a public information campaign which would not be a bad thing.</p> <p>  I was interested in the points made about the use of technology.  We can talk about education and information campaigns and the altering or retrofitting of existing road infrastructure to accommodate pedestrians and cyclists but that is a slow burner.  When it comes to the use of technology, reference was made to the port tunnel, where the compliance rate with the speed limits is in the high 90s.  I use the port tunnel regularly and it is amazing to see the impact of the technology there on road users.  One knows that the technology is there and that if one goes beyond the speed limit, one will end up with a fine and penalty points.  It is amazing how that message hits home and perhaps there is a wider role for technology in terms of getting a quick hit on these other issues.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Are offences in these areas on the increase?  What is the trend there, year on year?  Where does technology fit into this in the context of GDPR?  Is there an obstacle there or is it a cause of delays?  Is satisfying GDPR requirements an issue in the context of the use of technology to detect road offenders? </p></speech>

The GDPR issue has been teased out between all of the parties involved in the creation of the new Bill that is currently going through Committee Stage.  I am satisfied that we have covered all of the angles on GDPR.  That would be the foundation stone for the use of future technology in any enforcement action for road traffic offences, including the uploading of evidence on the portal.</p></speech>

Are they on the increase?  What is the general trend?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.1045" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Paula Hilman" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022100400002#M01100"><p>I can talk about An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na figures.  We heard from some of today's contributors about the different approaches of local authorities but I do not have any local authority figures on this.  Since 2018, the number of tickets that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issued for various parking offences has been on an upward trajectory.  Last year, there were over 6,500 tickets issued and this year, to date, over 5,500 have been issued for various parking offences.  We are seeing an increase right across the country.  The majority of tickets are issued in Dublin, particularly in the city environment, followed by our southern region, including Cork.  We are seeing an increase.</p><p>If the Senator is asking whether it is increasing, I am not sure if that figure is totally evidence-based or gives a complete picture of what is happening.  As we have heard, some of the interactions may involve giving somebody advice and letting them move on and some may be issued by local authorities.  It is a more holistic picture than solely the tickets we are issuing in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

Therefore, we will need to embrace technology in order to bring detection rates much higher than what that they are currently.  Would that be a fair comment?</p></speech>

That is what we have been saying about working with partners to maximise that use of technology.  We can see it.  The example was given of the Port Tunnel and the M7, where we have seen that it changes behaviour when people know there is a consequence to what they do.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-10-04a.1050" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Collins" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2022100400002#N00500"><p>Regarding the Port Tunnel, there is 99% compliance.  It is like Ms Hilman said; if people know there is a penalty, they will behave.  With some of the fixed-charge notices or tickets from Dublin City Council's parking department, the numbers are very low.  There is one ticket given per day for parking in a clearway.  Between June 2021 and January 2022, there were 13 fines given for parking in a cycle lane.  The violations are huge in comparison with the detections or fines that are given out.  In the same period of June 2021 to January 2022, 14 fines were given by DSPS for parking on a double-yellow line.  While there are detections, they are minimal.  We are not even scratching the surface of the number of violations we see every day when walking, cycling or travelling on a bus.  It is rampant.  That is where the problem is.  We can only expect to see numbers go up if the violations are actually detected and closed in on.</p></speech>

There is so much more we could say.  I have questions of my own but we are not going to get to them, unfortunately.  It is the nature of these things that time runs out.  We had some very useful engagements.  We will revisit this matter another day and at the end of our deliberations we will produce a report.  That report will be published and everyone will have an opportunity to see it and review it.  All the points made today will be captured and the committee will make a series of recommendations, which hopefully will reflect the discussion we have had.  Then it is over to the Government to implement that report.  We can shine a light on the issues we have discussed today.  I thank all the witnesses for their contributions today.</p></speech>
