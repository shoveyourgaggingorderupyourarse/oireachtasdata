Specifically, we have not got from any of them the additional measures they are considering putting into a draft plan, measures that go beyond what would be either included in the national development plan or the previous national mitigation plan.  We know that neither of those brings us anywhere near the sorts of targets we have to reach.  I suggest we write to various Secretaries General requesting them to write to us in a timely fashion - it would have to be in the next week or two at the latest - outlining, in specific detail, the additional options they are examining in order that we can consider them as part of our work in drafting our report and to assist us in our contribution to this process.  It is important the committee would write seeking such specific details from each of the Secretaries General who has appeared before the committee in order that we have tangible material with which to work in the drafting of our report.</p></speech>

I will keep my opening comments brief.</p> <p>  The recent report published by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, highlighted the magnitude of the global challenge.  Addressing the threat of climate change is a priority for Government as is reflected in the programme for Government.  It is a whole-of-government issue that requires joined-up effort. </p> <p>  In her introduction to the Citizens' Assembly's third report, the chairperson acknowledged the topic of climate change is "incredibly broad, wide-ranging and affects us all in one way or another".  There is no single solution to addressing the challenge of climate change and a collaborative effort is required across Government involving a range of inter-related actions and actors.  A targeted balance between Exchequer-supported expenditure, taxation policies and regulation are necessary to deliver upon our climate change objectives. </p> <p>  Tax policy has an important role to play in contributing to our decarbonisation objective but the complexity and need for balance in policy actions was recognised in the assembly&rsquo;s recommendations.  The qualification of recommendation No. 3 on taxes on carbon intensive activities referred to the need to protect the poorest households and a recognition, in ancillary recommendation No. 3, that the impact of the agriculture sector on the economy, particularly the rural economy, has to be taken account of in transitioning that sector towards models of production. </p> <p>  Taxation and pricing is a significant aspect of the contribution the Department can make in this regard.  Other issues include our ongoing work with our agencies such as the launch of Ireland&rsquo;s sovereign green bond, Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, investment supporting green technology and the promotion of the sustainable and green finance sector as part of the work under IFS 2020. </p> <p>  Our existing taxation system is positively contributing to climate change.  The extent to which it can, and should, do more is a matter of ongoing policy discussion.  Recommendation No. 3 highlights an acceptance of paying higher taxes on carbon intensive activities, subject to the qualifications such as the spending of the increased revenue on measures to support the low-carbon transition.  The Government is committed, in the national mitigation plan, to carbon pricing as a part of the suite of policy measures to address and reduce greenhouse gas emissions over time. However, we also need to understand its impact on low-income households, on households for whom at present there is no realistic substitute to the consumption of carbon commodities for home heat and transport.  The assembly recognised this challenge for poorer households in its qualifications to the recommendation. </p> <p>  Understanding the impact of carbon pricing on emissions is imperative.  In this regard, the Department has worked with the ESRI and published a report in October 2018 that provides a better understanding of the environmental, social and economic impacts of increasing carbon tax rates.  It found that a doubling in carbon tax to &euro;40 per tonne would result in less than a 5% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, which is a positive impact from just one measure.  While this would be a positive contribution to our objective, it also underlines the importance of pursuing complementary policy levers in conjunction with taxation policy to support our transition to a low-carbon economy.</p> <p>  To build on this work, the ESRI is currently developing a multi-annual model to better inform our decision-making into the future which will be capable of modelling a carbon tax pathway which captures behavioural change on the part of producers and households alike in response to policy initiatives such as a phased increase in carbon tax rates over time.  On budget day the Government reaffirmed the intention to put in place a long-term trajectory for carbon tax increases out to 2030 in line with the recommendations of the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC, and this committee.  This is an explicit acknowledgement that carbon pricing and carbon tax, in particular, has a key role to play in the transition to a low-carbon economy. </p> <p>  In recommendation No. 9 of the report, the vast majority of members of the assembly recommended the State should immediately take steps to support the transition to electric vehicles.  To support the achievement of this goal, a number of tax incentives are in place to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles, EVs, and more carbon-efficient vehicles.  For example, in addition to the vehicle registration tax, VRT, relief of up to &euro;5,000 and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, purchase grant of up to &euro;5,000, which are in place, a 0% rate of benefit-in-kind, BIK, on EVs was introduced this year.  A new accelerated capital allowances scheme for gas-propelled vehicles and refuelling equipment is being provided for in Finance Bill 2018, designed to encourage the uptake of gas-propelled commercial vehicles as an economic and environmentally friendly alternative to diesel.  Ireland's CO2 based VRT and motor tax have been redesigned towards incentivising the uptake of lower emissions technology, whereby the higher the emissions, the higher the tax.  This charging system was introduced in 2008.  In January 2013, a revised banding structure was also introduced for both motor tax and VRT to take account of technological differences.  A zero emissions band for electric vehicles was also introduced for motor tax purposes.  The introduction of these measures has been effective in influencing purchasing decisions in favour of more fuel efficient vehicles, with a significant increase in new vehicle purchases in the lower band categories.  In 2009, only 13% of vehicles registered were in the 0g to 120g band; it has not increased to 77%.  From virtually none, there are now approximately 4,000 electric vehicles on Irish roads.</p> <p>  The launch of Ireland&rsquo;s first sovereign green bond for &euro;3 billion by the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, on 10 October is a significant development, as it will assist in funding the Exchequer investment committed.  While the proceeds of the bond are remitted like all other issues to the central fund, the yields will be channelled to projects with environmental benefits.  Eligible green project categories for the first Irish green bond issue include sustainable water and waste management, clean transportation, environmentally sustainable management of living natural resources and land use, renewable energy, energy efficiency and climate change adaptation projects.  The issuance of the bond was met with strong demand with a total order book of more than &euro;11 billion. </p> <p>  With regard to the imperative of mobilising private sector capital, I note the important work of IFS2020, which has included green and sustainable finance as a strategic priority in the 2018 action plan.  Last week, Sustainable Nation Ireland, which has a role under the IFS2020 strategy to support and promote Ireland as a green and sustainable finance hub, co-hosted this year&rsquo;s EU annual climate innovation summit.  The summit was held on 6 to 8 November and attended by more than 600 decision-makers from Ireland and Europe. </p> <p>  Officials from the Department have also worked closely with Deputy Pringle on the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill 2016, which was passed by the D&aacute;il in July and which I believe is before the Seanad this week.  The Bill requires the NTMA, as custodian of the ISIF, to endeavour to ensure it does not directly invest in a fossil fuel undertaking and to divest from an investment which is or becomes a fossil fuel undertaking.</p><p>At a micro level but in keeping with recommendation No. 2 of the report on retrofitting and regeneration of public buildings, the recent renovation of the Department's offices in Government Buildings has resulted in annual electricity bill savings in the region of &euro;60,000 per annum.  In this redevelopment we were aware of the need to significantly reduce our energy footprint. </p><p> I again thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss the report and recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, which is an important aspect of the national dialogue on climate action.  Progress is being made, but we still have a long way to go with significant challenges ahead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="13:59:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018111400002#CC00200"><p>It is a pleasure to be here.  As the committee will be aware, we have a significant challenge in respect of climate policy.  I will set out why we think this is, what we can do about it and the specific actions that are relevant to our Department.  The climate is a public good.  The story of modern humanity is one of its ability to conquer the elements but it is hard for us to conceive of a world radically altered by rising temperatures.  This perception gap collides with our well-known bias towards the immediate.  In general, we are bad at sacrificing now to benefit later.  This effect is compounded when it comes to climate change because we have never previously had to deal with a situation where the consequences of a problem are so far removed from the actions we must take to deal with it.  The price that will be paid for the emissions we release into the atmosphere today will be borne by our children and their children.  Naturally, Departments focus on the interests of the public and society.  The determination of the public interest is filtered through the views expressed by their stakeholders and, ultimately, the political system.  Due to our biases, we underestimate the impact of our current behaviour on the climate, and continue doing business as usual.  This <i>status quo</i>bias is reflected in our approach to climate policies.<br/><br/>The actions we have been pursuing to date have evolved to be compatible with existing policy priorities in a variety of areas rather than specifically aimed at delivering the change we need at the scale required.  We have pushed open doors in respect of certain policies where the evidence suggests that reductions in emissions on the scale required will involve significant winners and losses and have significant consequences for society.  I have described a well-recognised problem.  The adverse effects of emissions fall on society collectively rather than on those individually responsible for their emission.  They are external to the market or externalities.  There is not enough incentive for individuals, whether businesses or consumers, to reduce emissions.  The best way to address these externalities is to place a price on them.  The Europe-wide emissions trading scheme, ETS, is an attempt to do this for emissions in sectors, such as electricity generation and other high emitting sectors.  Given that every installation has to pay a price for every tonne of emissions it releases, it bears a direct cost for its emissions and is incentivised to find new and creative ways of reducing them.  Even with the flaws of the ETS, the impact of pricing carbon in power generation has seen emissions from that sector consistently decline across Europe.<br/><br/>With an effective mechanism in place for the ETS, the primary focus of policy is to reduce emissions in the non-ETS sectors where the liability for not compliance rests with the State.  Do we have enough least cost abatement options in the policy system?  The biases I have outlined translate into a basic principal-agent problem, which is significant in this area because responsibility for climate action rests with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, but responsibility for policies to reduce non-ETS emissions fall across many Departments and agencies.  Like other countries, we have structures in place to try to address this problem but we should consider whether these structures are likely to be sufficient or if they need to be complemented by more stringent central mandates or perhaps, even replaced by mechanisms such as making individual Departments or Ministers more directly responsible for specific emission reductions targets in their sectors.<br/><br/>Irrespective of the type of structures we have in place, we need to develop new climate policies and measures and we need methodologies to assess options across sectors.  There is no easy way of deciding whether we should prioritise actions in any one given sector.  That is why the first question that we should ask of any proposal is how does this initiative help us meet our climate targets and at what cost does it do so.  We need to know the marginal cost of abatement for potential options.  The committee has been discussing this in recent months.  Once we know where the economic opportunities are, we can have a proper discussion about the policy trade-offs and make progress in respect of the options we face.  As Mr. Moran outlined, carbon pricing through the ETS or taxation allows market discovery.  This mechanism allows market agents to establish least cost opportunities and provides them with the incentives to take appropriate action.  These market mechanisms may need to be supported by expenditure measures to encourage, for example, early adopters.  It may also be underpinned by regulations that can provide investment certainty to private consumers and businesses.  A tangible example in this area is Government policy on EVs.  There are generous supports available for such vehicles at the moment, both expenditure and taxation.  As the technology advances and the cost of an electric vehicle becomes competitive with that of a fossil fuel vehicle, it will no longer be appropriate to reward early adopters.  Instead, the role of Government will be to ensure that the regulatory environment supports EV drivers, ensuring that there is a sufficient supply of charging points available for example and there is competition in the supply of electricity through these charging.  In the interim, until there is a critical mass sufficient that the market can provide this EV infrastructure, its development will be funded by Government.<br/><br/>Regarding investments funded by the taxpayers, decision-makers need to reflect a realistic estimated shadow price of carbon to ensure decisions reflect the future costs of emissions and, of course, the benefits of abatement.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is contributing to this policy work with the levers at our disposal.  The mission of the Department is to serve the public interest by supporting the delivery of well-managed, well-targeted and sustainable public spending.  When it comes to climate change, this means public spending that supports the achievement of Ireland's low carbon transition in the most cost effective manner.  It means targeted expenditure while allowing market mechanisms to deliver carbon reductions in the most efficient manner.  With regard to project appraisal, we have published some significant proposed reforms to the public spending code.  In a major departure, we will now require all Government investment projects to price any future greenhouse gas emissions at the estimated cost that society will have to bear in reaching our climate targets.  In effect, this triples the cost of greenhouse gas emissions that applies today, with the price reaching &euro;32 a tonne by 2020, &euro;100 a tonne by 2030 and &euro;265 a tonne by 2050.  This responds to a criticism that has been made of the public sector code for some time, which is it is underpricing the future cost of carbon and needs to reflect a much higher price in decision-making, and we have taken steps to address that concern.  These moves will reduce the economic viability of certain projects that produce emissions and critically place a high value on projects that cut or abate emissions.  We are also lowering the discount rate that applies to Government investment appraisal from 5% to 4% and for long-term projects, this discount rate will decline over time.  These reforms mean that investment decisions must fully reflect the climate consequences.  Finally, the Irish Government Economic Evaluation Service, IGEES, was created to enhance the role of economics and value for money analysis in public policymaking.  IGEES has conducted reviews of areas of climate-related expenditure and will continue to do so in the future.  This is a major task for the system in our Department and others to assemble the evidence required to inform Government of the decisions taken.  Significant work is required to consider options, how much they cost and what will be the emissions reductions from these options.  <br/><br/>In summary, we are supporting policies to price carbon.  We believe incentives matter and the best way of encouraging behavioural change is to place a price on the behaviour that we want to change and encourage people towards the alternatives.  Applying a trivial charge per plastic bag, for example, lowered plastic bag use by 95%.  I know in that case there was a clear significant alternative so the elasticity of demand was high in terms of the response to any price change and that is not exactly analogous or comparable to climate, depending on the type of change we are considering.  It shows, however, how price changes can affect behaviour depending on the availability of substitutes and alternatives.  On a larger scale, in the UK as recently as 2012, 40% of electricity came from coal.  This year, up to the middle of the year at least, just 6% of their electricity came from coal.  That is a significant change in fuel mix in the electricity sector.<br/><br/>The second action is having a shadow price for carbon for Government decisions that properly reflects the cost of emissions.  Just as prices matter to the individual, so too they matter for Government decision-makers.  We are now pricing the carbon emissions of any new Government investment at the price it will cost us to eliminate those emissions at a later date.  This raises the bar and will help to avoid investments which may lock us in to high carbon patterns of living.  Third, developing least cost options by estimating the marginal abatement cost of options and making effective climate policies will involve hard choices and trade-offs.  To enable these choices to be made, we must provide Government with the evidence that allows it to compare and contrast climate measures from across a wide variety of sectors.  This means examining the progress each measure will make towards our targets and the potential cost associated with them.  We are working with other Departments to ensure that when the Government is considering climate policy, it has the necessary information to make decisions.  Fourth, we are examining structures to ensure that we address the principal-agent problem and the Department is working through the existing climate structures established at Government level.  We need to ensure that we have the necessary structures to drive this change across Government, reflecting the scale and urgency of this challenge.</p><p> Our Department leads in a number of areas on climate change.  The Office of Government Procurement is actively working with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to update our procurement guidelines to ensure that we can source goods, services or works within the public sector, with a reduced environmental impact.</p><p> Project Ireland 2040 contains a commitment to the effect that every building in the public stock will achieve an energy efficiency rating of at least B by 2030.  To realise this commitment, the OPW is working with the Department and the SEAI on a pilot scheme.  In 2012, 12 buildings, including our building on Merrion Street, underwent significant energy efficiency upgrades.  A further 50 buildings were upgraded this year and it is planned to upgrade another 40 in 2019.  The evidence from the pilot is that this will allow us to develop a programme sufficient to reach the target set out in Project Ireland 2040.  These initiatives are primarily financed by the Exchequer.</p><p> Ireland cannot solve this problem on its own, particularly in view of our scale and our contribution to global emissions.  However, we must show that as a developed country we are capable of making the necessary changes.</p><p> Overcoming the various biases that relate to our society and the other societies to which I referred earlier will require the kind of commitment that cross-party committees can deliver.  I do not believe this committee should underplay the challenges we face.  Addressing our emissions will mean short-term challenges and pain for individuals and groups but it will benefit us in the long term.  I have a concern that if we promise a society, people or individual groups that this will be easy or cheap, we will not build the kind of support necessary to deal with the difficult decisions ahead.</p></speech>

Some &euro;22 billion is earmarked for climate action measures and &euro;8.6 billion for sustainable mobility in the next ten years.  I understand Mr. Watt is chairperson of the Ireland 2040 Delivery Board.  Will he speak to us about the board's work?  There are many groups and boards at departmental level.  What is the work plan for the delivery of the climate action side of the national development plan?  Has the carbon impact of that been assessed?</p></speech>

As the Chairman is aware, Project Ireland 2040 brought together the NDP - the traditional capital plan for Governments - along with the national spatial planning framework that we devised.  We believe this is a very important change.  For the first time, we have a spatial plan for the country which sets out where we hope new homes will be built and where people will live in the future, along with a capital plan.  They reinforce each other so that the decision-making relating to the spatial dimensions of our planning are reflected in capital spending and <i>vice versa</i>.  I set up this group, which in effect has the main Departments and delivery bodies that are responsible for delivering the plan.  We have met four or five times so far where we discussed the challenges relating to delivering the plan.  We have had presentations from each of the Departments and agencies setting out what they are doing and the challenges and timeframes involved.  Currently, we are focusing on issues such as those relating to value for money, construction inflation, planning and how to ensure that we can deliver on the targets set out for Government.<br/><br/>That is separate from specific issues relating to climate.  There are separate structures within Government in terms of climate.  Our focus is on delivering the overall plan of &euro;116 billion.  Within that, there are issues relating to climate.  There is the energy efficiency measures in terms of the retrofitting scheme.  We receive updates on that from the Department and the SEAI.  There are other investments relating to public transport, the metro, buses and other matters which fall within that remit.  The board is focused on delivering on the plan.<br/><br/>When it comes to all the dimensions of climate action, there is a separate committee which is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, at assistant secretary level.  It is a senior officials group that is charged with co-ordination and delivery of climate action across the main Departments of Government.  They feed into each other in that progress with Project Ireland 2040 has an impact on our various targets.  Their view on the evolution of climate policy will have an impact on the way we deliver Project Ireland 2040 in the years ahead.</p></speech>

The Department has to come forward with its plans in terms of how it will ramp up the various schemes and initiatives to retrofit homes and meet our commitments within the plan.  In the first instance, it is for the Departments to prioritise.  We have set out an envelope of spending for the first five years of the plan which is quite detailed in terms of where we will spend in different areas.  The Department is charged with delivering on that.  However, that might change.  If, for example, there is a delay in some initiative or project, another project might take its place in terms of the queue.  Ultimately, however, the Department's programme is based on the allocation it has been given.</p></speech>

The technical research and modelling group, TRAM, is looking at that in detail.  It is fair to say that a good deal of work needs to be done to establish across the system the initiative that will give the greatest bang for our buck, which will reduce emissions and at what cost?  A good deal of work needs to be done within individual Departments.  For example, within the retrofitting space, what types of initiatives will move us forward in terms of improving the energy efficiency of the housing stock?  It is not a straightforward issue.  It is a question of financing and whether households have the ability to raise the money required.  Are they motivated?  Do they see the benefit of retrofitting?  Are they willing to overcome the hassle of retrofitting their homes?  There is a variety of financial and other barriers that would impact, so it is up to the Department to establish the best options and then debate the case for funding.  Within the envelopes we have set out there is significant funding, for example in respect of retrofitting.</p></speech>

That assessment needs to take place.  Every Department fights for its own amount of money.  What is the oversight in respect of climate?  Who is adjudicating in terms of the long-term effects that will have on the environment, be it transport, education or whatever Department?</p></speech>

We had a price which was under &euro;10 per tonne of carbon.  In the revised public spending code, we have very significant increases in the price per tonne of carbon.  That will discourage investment and will lead to an increase in emissions or lock us into a particular pattern of living that is carbon intensive.  However, it will also provide clear incentives to prioritise projects that will lead to abatement.  That will have a material impact over time on the choice of projects.  Ultimately, it depends on whether the system has done the work to establish those right policies and whether we have the right structures to ensure they are fed in appropriately and are prioritised.  That comes down to the priorities of individual Departments as well as to political leadership across the system.</p></speech>

My first question is for Mr. Moran.  What is his view of the taxation system?  Does he believe there are environmental goals attached to it?  Do we have the vision to move to a low-carbon economy?  In other words, what major changes are required in current policy to ensure we can make it more proactive?  Do we have that vision in the Department and Government to work towards those issues?</p> <p>  Carbon will be one of the main issues we will discuss at these hearings in the coming weeks and months.  The Climate Change Advisory Council made a submission on the price of carbon per tonne.</p><p>It was hoped it would come in at approximately &euro;30 per tonne in the budget.  It did not change, unfortunately.  What will be the trend for carbon pricing in the next decade?  There is talk of an increase to &euro;80 per tonne by 2030.  Will there be a yearly increase in the price or will it occur only on the final day?  Do people believe it will increase to &euro;80 per tonne by 2030?  How do our guests envisage the gradual increases in the carbon price being made?  How will we deal with fuel poverty and meet the concerns of people of economic need who, unfortunately, require fossil fuels at present?  There are two elements to be balanced.  This will be important so we can take society with us.  I am concerned about how we can move to a low-carbon economy while offering support to those who need it.  In the context of the price of carbon increasing to &euro;80 per tonne by 2030, what timeline is the Department considering with a view to having a vision to drive forward?  These are questions on which the Department needs to give us guidance.</p><p> Procurement is a major issue in the context of public expenditure.  It has been a major issue across all Departments for a long time.  The lowest-price principle is one we have discussed at several committees with a view to determining how to achieve the best value for money.  Where will the environmental factors come into the schedule?  The Chairman mentioned schools.  The schools we built in the past decade all had oil burners, reflecting the lowest-cost syndrome we promoted in our economy.  What will be the guidelines on this?  Renewables are more expensive on the first day but there will be a long-term benefit for everyone.  Even turning to a gas boiler rather than an oil boiler is significant.  This all falls under Government procurement.  From where will the vision come?  From where will the review and changes come?  The Chairman mentioned oil boilers being installed in schools in the past seven or eight years.  Do we lack vision in this regard?  Do we need to move to a different model of procurement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.41" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Moran" time="13:59:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018111400002#EE00200"><p>Going back as far as 2008 and 2009, we have taxed motor vehicles on the basis of carbon emissions.  We introduced a carbon tax in 2010 and 2011.  We saw progression in both of these areas until approximately 2012.  The carbon tax increased from &euro;15 initially to &euro;20, but it has been flat ever since.  With regard to motor vehicles, excise duty and so on, the rates increased but they have been unchanged since 2012.  With regard to using fiscal instruments and taxation for the purpose in question, there has not been any change over time.<br/><br/>The speed at which the carbon price will rise over the next ten years will ultimately be a policy matter for the Government.  There are examples of where governments have set out a trajectory for a carbon tax.  In France, for example, there is to be a rise from approximately &euro;30 to &euro;85 over a period of five or six years.  The fuel poverty implications for the French are quite different because it does not affect households as much.  This is because 75% of French energy is derived from nuclear power.  It is much less fossil-fuel intense.  The reality is that if one increases the carbon tax, one generates revenue.  By generating revenue, there is revenue to recycle to mitigate some parts of the problem.  One cannot mitigate all parts but where there are fuel poverty issues one can address the points where the pressure is greatest, including through the winter fuel scheme, for example.<br/><br/>Some of the important work we have done is reflected in the report.  I would recommend it.  We worked jointly with the ESRI and we published the report in October.  For the first time, for any given increase in carbon tax, we can calculate the likely impact on emissions.  For a &euro;20 impact, a doubling of the carbon tax, there would be a reduction in emissions of about 4.7% in emissions.  That is very significant in light of the overall target of a 30% reduction over the next decade or so.  The Climate Change Advisory Council talks about achieving a figure three times that.  The likelihood is that it will not be linear.  We are doing some work over the next 12 months as a priority considering the multi-annual impact and how it will be phased.  Even if it is not linear, and if it is not a case of three times 4.7% but somewhere between 10% and 15%, it would be a very significant contribution to meeting the decarbonisation goals.  I view those points as important.  The work will inform how we map out the trajectory over the coming period.  Mapping out a set of steps over the next ten years will be important.  If if is not done, the chances are that if one picks off issues on an annual basis, with an annual budgetary cycle, one will not make a huge amount of progress.<br/><br/>On vehicle taxation, there are fairly fundamental changes happening over the next 12 months.  The emissions measurement for new vehicles is changing.  According to the EU Commission, if we move to the<font color="#4F4F4F"> worldwide harmonised light vehicle test procedure</font>, on which Mr. Kenny can provide detail, a much more realistic measurement of the actual emissions from vehicles would be given.  One would see the emissions measurement going up by 20%, on average.  That will result in a significant behavioural change.  We already saw that with the changes we made in 2008.<br/><br/>It is a question of having a plan and marking it over time and of the recycling of revenue to the pressure points.  The interesting piece concerning the work done with the ESRI concerns a 20% increase.  Its overall impact on the economy was not that significant, it is fair to say.</p></speech>

It is important because it creates certainty.  It means economic agents do not lock into expensive systems right now.  It creates certainty regarding what the future price will be, which will help reduce emissions directly, but it will also signal to economic agents that it will be increasingly profitable to invest in low-carbon and zero-carbon alternatives, and that it will be profitable to invest in carbon capture, carbon storage and so forth.  By creating certainty now and setting out a medium-term trajectory, one can overcome some of the issues associated with the cliff-edge effect.</p></speech>

We have in the public expenditure code new estimates for the future costs that will incentivise renewables and more efficient forms by comparison with those of the past.  That will send a price signal to decision makers.</p> <p>  The use of heating oil in schools raises an issue.  If ten years ago a school decided on a much more expensive option, based on a given view on energy costs, another committee of this House would have criticised the Secretary General in the Department of Education and Skills for allowing schools to misspend public funds.  Heat pumps and the renewable alternatives would have been much more expensive.  If, however, one has a different view on emissions and energy costs, one does not just calculate the cost of heating for the first few years but also for the next 20.  That requires the wider system, not just ours, to reflect upon the cost of each choice.</p><p>We might be saying that in the short run, we will have school buildings that are more expensive but will lead to more efficient use over their life cycle.  That comes down to difficult choices.  In the short run, other measures will have to be foregone in the education system to afford such buildings.  We have to face the policy decisions and choices that are raised in that context.  Our approach involves the accommodation of regulations.  All public buildings will have to adhere to the standards of the near-zero emissions directive from 1 January next.  We have to ensure we look at the overall cost over time in the hope that it reflects what the true cost of carbon will be in the future.</p></speech>

The evaluation should, and does, reflect that the lowest cost is not just about the build costs.  It is a question of ensuring the inputs are appropriate.  A judgment call has to be made regarding future energy bills and the price of carbon into the future.  We have put forward a view on the price of emissions.  We are waiting to hear back from those involved in the system about their views.  This is not cost free or risk free for the public sector when it makes decisions.</p></speech>

I will begin by asking Mr. Watt about the potential for the State to be fined if it does not reach its targets by 2020 and the impact of that if it happens.  We have heard about different costs.  This is something that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is good at.  It is not about spending money.  The Department is good at planning and estimating what certain costs will be.  I hope it can identify its best guesstimate at this stage.  If we recognise that the cost is X, we have to move along from there by accepting that we have slipped in the areas of heat and transport.  We have had our own interactions with various Departments.  Perhaps some Departments are better than others at addressing the climate change element of their work.  What role does the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform play in encouraging other Departments to assist it in saving the State from having to pay these fines?  I appreciate that the Department's overall role from a budgetary point of view involves making the most of loaves and fishes and identifying the projects that will give the best bang for their buck.  In the absence of such projects coming forward, can Mr. Watt give us an insight into the role played by the Department in trying to get the Government as a whole to try to move this agenda forward?</p> <p>  My questions for Mr. Moran relate to taxation.  He has covered the carbon tax, which is well recognised.  At the time of last year's budget, I was vocal about the one-year benefit-in-kind exemption.  The Minister indicated in his Budget Statement that it was more than likely that there would be a review, that everything would be fine on the night and that the exemption would probably be extended for two years.  That happened and was accounted for this year.  When measures like that are not sufficiently concrete at an initial stage, it does not instil confidence in the sector to invest.  People will not change from petrol or diesel vehicles to EVs unless there is certainty.  If there is one thing the officials before us know about, it is the importance of certainty.  I thought at the time that it was remiss of the Government not to nail it down clearly in the Finance Bill that this would be a five-year project.  I do not know how companies do it, but most people try to see what value their cars have after three years, or perhaps five or seven years if they are not doing a great deal of mileage.  We need to be upfront about measures that are important signals.  Does Mr. Moran have any other ideas about how we can use taxation to improve the uptake of EVs?  It has been mentioned that we now have more than 4,000 vehicles, having come from a relatively low base.  When Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party were in government, it was projected that the figure would reach 50,000.  I accept that many things have happened since then.  We are a long way short of the critical point where second-hand cars are coming on the market.  Cars need to be rolling over in the marketplace.  There is no way we could suggest that 4,000 or 5,000 vehicles make much of a difference in the marketplace.  If the witnesses have any other ideas, I would be interested to hear them.</p></speech>

It is a compliance cost.  I do not want to contradict my colleagues in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment because they are the experts.  There is a shortfall of 17 million tonnes for 2020.  We have bought approximately 5 million credits.  The market price per tonne up to 2020 is negligible.  The price has fallen through the floor.  The compliance costs for this period are negligible.  They are neither here nor there.  Based on the projections we are looking at, there will be a shortfall of approximately 100 million tonnes for 2030.  We do not know what the final figure will be, but that is not a bad estimate based on business as usual and where we are.  We need to work through the full impact of some of the measures being taken by the Government to see what level of abatement they will deliver.  We are looking at a shortfall of 100 million tonnes.  One's estimate of the compliance cost depends on one's view of what the price will be.</p></speech>

If Deputy Ryan is correct when he says that the cost is &euro;32, we should pursue all options that have a marginal abatement cost of less than &euro;30.  Somebody might come into this committee, say it will cost &euro;25 to abate a tonne of carbon and claim that is expensive.  That might look expensive, but it is cheaper than the compliance.  That is the decision we have to take.  That is the metric.  This cannot be planned centrally within our system.</p></speech>

That is what we are trying to do with the spending code.  We are trying to say what the likely price is and remind Departments that they need to reflect it in their decision-making.  If a project has a positive cost-benefit analysis based on a price of &euro;30 a tonne in 2030, it is worth pursuing.  However, the price might not be &euro;30.  Deputy Ryan might be wrong.  If it transpires in 2030 that the price is &euro;10, we might have done a lot of things that we would have been better off not doing.  In such circumstances, we would have been better off buying compliance rather than taking expensive action.  If the price goes the other way - perhaps to &euro;50 - there will be a variety of other things we should have done which would have been expensive but would still have been cheaper than &euro;50 a tonne.  That is the policy choice.</p></speech>

The figure for 2030 is &euro;100, rising to &euro;265 by 2050.  We have an entire range of figures and put an estimate for each year into the public spending code now based on the new mechanism for calculating the cost of carbon, which as Mr. Watt said will be based on the estimated cost of reaching our climate targets.  We have come up with those figures, based on the modelling work that was done for the national mitigation plan by the technical research and modelling group.</p></speech>

The cost of compliance is borne by all the taxpayers in the country.  We collectively have to pay for this.  The impact of a given decision in any sector will have an impact on particular groups.  It is not uniform across the taxpayer base and that is a major policy challenge as well because the cost of compliance will be borne by all of us as a society but the cost of actions will be more concentrated in particular groups in society.</p></speech>

The benefit-in-kind has been extended for three years.  Normally we put tax expenditures on a three year review cycle, but when one is trying to change behaviours it may well be necessary to give it a longer lead in time.  The point is well made.</p> <p>  In terms of the number of electric vehicles on the roads, I agree it is a start but it has a long way to go.  In terms of the incentives, the carrot, there is a list of seven or eight subsidies or supports that are there from the purchase grant of up to &euro;5,000, the VRT reduction of up to &euro;5,000 and the grant for putting in the charger.  That is probably as much as one can do on that side; the stick element is to rebalance and discourage the use of other heavy carbon using vehicles by making it more costly to use them and the changes that will come in during the next 12 to 18 months will help to tilt that balance.  It is a carrot and stick approach.</p></speech>

When one sees the fluctuation in the price of fossil fuel at the pumps at present, it does not seem to be enough of a deterrent.  In Ireland we are quite used to massive fluctuations in oil prices.

I will address my first question on governance to Mr. Watt.  It has been good to read Mr. Watt's presentation to see how he identifies and addresses the attitudes that have led Ireland to be known as the climate laggard.  That is where we are at present.  The Oireachtas considered the best legislative approach to ensuring the Government and Civil Service gave the necessary priority to climate change and so enacted the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.  However, the legislation has not put us on the path of transition in line with the national transition objective and the Taoiseach has acknowledged this.  NGOs have said that we are second worst in Europe and the Climate Change Advisory Council states we are going completely in the wrong direction and the State is facing legal action because we are not meeting our obligations.  Some 97% of the members of the Citizens' Assembly recommended that there would be some kind of governance body set up and that we would look at specific functions, including the setting of a body of five year targets and a function of pursuing the State in legal proceedings to ensure legal obligations would be met.  In the course of his opening address Mr. Watt referred to some of these issues and I would like him to go into more detail on governance and how he sees a governance mechanism as supporting Ireland in this regard.</p> <p>  The Climate Change Advisory Council has been modelled in part on the UK climate change committee and in part it was modelled on the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and both of these bodies have been far more successful in getting the British Government to take advice.  Has Mr. Watt any insight as to why they are making more progress than we in Ireland are making?</p> <p>  On Project Ireland 2040, Mr. Watt's statement emphasises the importance of public spending that supports the achievement of Ireland's low carbon transition.  Did the Department produce an analysis of the climate impact of Project Ireland 2040 in order to enable the Government to ensure its decisions in that major plan will support the achievement of the low carbon transition?  None of us has seen an analysis and we have been told that 20% of the plan will support low carbon transition but, of course, if much of the remaining 80% of the plan is undermining transition, it will not work.  Does Mr. Watt have an analysis of the greenhouse gas emissions which will result from the implementation of project Ireland 2040?  If not, is the Department prepared to do a retrospective review so that we can see what the impact of Project 2040 will be?</p></speech>

I do not know if we are allowed to say that, but I do not agree with the proposal for an independent body.  That is a bit of a cop out.  It is for the Government and the Oireachtas to decide what decisions will be taken because the decisions have significant implications for society and citizens.  The notion of an independent body that will suggest that to an official such as Mr. Derek Moran or to the Minister for Finance that a carbon tax will be &euro;200 by 2030, or whatever, will not work.  These involve political decisions that have to be decided by the Oireachtas and the Government in the normal course.  This comes to the essence of public policy and politics.  I do not agree with the recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly.  We already have an independent body the Climate Change Advisory Council which has many good things to say, but this involves having to make difficult decisions.  Whether we can change the structures in the system to help us make difficult decisions is something we can do and it comes down to the issue of how we are organised in the system and the relationship between the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the other Departments.  I mentioned the difficulty that whereas the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is responsible for the targets, it is not responsible for the levers.  How does one have proper structures in Government, Cabinet committees or the structures to ensure that the genuine responsibility is taken here?  I think it is about different options.  In my statement I set out some options about ascribing target savings to sectors that are responsible for them, for example that one says to the agricultural sector that it must deliver "X" and that transport needs to deliver "Y".  The challenge with that approach is that flat rate reductions across each sector, reflecting their contribution does not necessarily reflect the marginal cost of different options.  That might be an inefficient way of doing it and might lead to higher costs than we have to incur.  We need to look at different ways to ensure the system is galvanised to deliver on this.</p><p>It is within the Government and not externally that we need to look at the governance.  I do not think an independent body will help.  What was the Senator's second question?</p></speech>

This reflects the fact we have an agricultural sector that takes a significant share of the non-ETS.  We have homes that are bigger than in other countries and per home they produce 58% higher emissions than other countries.  We have a spatial structure that is different from other countries where we have more reliance on private cars.  It is a function of the nature of our economy, society and emissions.  It is not because other countries are doing more; it is because it is easier for them to do more relative to us because of the particular challenges we face.  Agriculture accounts for two thirds of the non-ETS.  The herd has increased by 22% over the past three years and milk production has increased by 27%.  There are very clear decisions and consequences.  The fact that the UK or another country is doing better than us reflects the different structure we have compared to them.  It is not because they are being braver, doing more or taking more action; I have not seen this in any event but I am happy to be contradicted.  I do not necessarily believe it is because they have an independent body that is forcing their system to act in a different way.  Our performance reflects the difficult structures and emissions nature of how agriculture has evolved.</p> <p>  With regard to Project Ireland 2040 I stated it has not been gone through in detail with all of the options being examined.  This work must be done.  We need to go through all of the options.  Project Ireland 2040 includes spending that would have an impact on emissions.  The challenge is to ensure this spending reflects the cost of future emissions.  There will be a lot of school building and renovation of the school stock.  None of this is earmarked as related to climate but how we build schools in the future will be very important in terms of ensuring they are energy efficient and minimise the impact on emissions.  There is a lot of work to be done in all of these policy areas to ensure we take decisions that will not make the problem any worse and will reduce emissions.  The Government has committed to producing another mitigation plan in the coming years and that will have more detail on what the precise impact will be of a variety of issues that are floating around.</p></speech>

This will feed into the development of the national climate and energy plan.  It is important to remember the national development plan is a financial plan.  It supports the national planning framework.  This is why, as Mr. Watt said, the Project Ireland 2040 board is an oversight group that is bringing the two strands together.  When it comes to public investment under the plan, every element of spend will be assessed using the public spending code and the appraisal.  The new provisions on the price of carbon will be captured.  We will get a better understanding of the climate impact of investment and the cost of carbon will be priced accurately.</p></speech>

There is a technical challenge in how much more intermittent power we can put on the grid.  Deputy Ryan was involved in these debates when he was the Minister a few years ago.  It is not entirely clear or straightforward in terms of what the share of renewables in the network can be.  It is a difficult issue.  As well as the further decarbonisation of the electricity sector we also have the electrification of heat and transport.  Transport will involve electric vehicles becoming more widespread.  I presume when it comes to heating residential buildings that the price of heat pumps will have to reduce with a combination of renewables.  It will be done through technology over the coming years if we have the right structures in place and the right pricing.  I do not know about heat pumps but certainly the price of batteries is falling quite dramatically.  If we can store all of this cheap electricity in batteries it will have a transformative effect when it comes to climate and society.  The big change will be falls in the price of batteries and the extent to which devolved electricity networks can ensure we decarbonise.  Then we will have the electrification of the heat and transport systems.  It will look very different in the coming 20 or 30 years.</p></speech>

Other policies are still being treated as conundrums to be solved or works in progress.  Two decades ago, Feasta, the Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability, developed its proposal for cap and share and has repeatedly brought it to the attention of policy makers ever since.  In essence, it proposes that the revenue from carbon be returned to people on an individual basis.  As low-income households use far fewer fossil fuels they would be net beneficiaries of cap and share.  In 2008, Comhar Sustainable Development Council commissioned a study on cap and share proposals.  Similar initiatives, such as cap and dividend, are prominent in policy discussions in the US.  All of this is in a situation where the carbon price needs to go well beyond the &euro;40 per tonne to which the Department referred.  Mr. Watt referred &euro;100 per tonne in 2030.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions for each group.  Mr. Moran mentioned the incentives already in place and stated there are enough incentives at present.  There has to be behavioural change in the climate discussion and debate and for this to happen we must have more incentives.  Has the Department looked at other incentives such as tax credits?  We have tax credits in a number of areas throughout the system.</p><p>Has the idea of a tax credit for doing X, Y or Z been looked at as an incentive in that regard?  There has been a lot of talk in different areas of late about low-cost loans.  The cost of refurbishing a house to bring it up to whatever standard is required is going to cost a lot of money.  If an analysis on the figures was done, it might cost &euro;50 billion over a period of time to bring the entire housing stock in the country up to a standard that would be required to be carbon-efficient, which is a lot of money.  The State is never going to be in a position to do this for everybody.  We have had low-cost loans from a Brexit point of view and in different sectors in recent times.  Has that been looked at?</p><p> In general, there must be more carrot than stick in the whole debate.  That has to be the whole selling point.  The communications strategy in both Departments is crucial.  In terms of selling the message of what is coming down the line, the consequences and implications of it and what it is going to cost - Mr. Watt referenced earlier the costs, differences and so on - this has to be done in a language that everybody understands.  If we do not do that, we are losing the battle straight away.  It would seem that most of the time, we are playing catch-up and it is a fire-fighting process.  A very straightforward communications strategy needs to be developed.  What communications strategy do both Departments have in place?</p><p> In his opening statement Mr. Watt stated that the evidence suggests that reductions in emissions on the scale required will involve winners and losses and have distributional consequences for society.  This is obvious.  Has an analysis been done in Mr. Watt's Department of the winners and losers and the potential costs involved?</p></speech>

It has to be remembered that there are incentives and grants on the expenditure side and not just on the tax side and it about getting the best value out of both.</p> <p>  On low-cost loans, that is certainly worth looking at.  On tax support for renovation, we have had the home renovation incentive for a number of years.  This essentially refunds the VAT content on the changes carried out.  It is a model that could be developed further, if that is what is wanted.  It is a refund of income tax but it is just the additional VAT component of it.  There are a number of aspects.</p> <p>  On communications strategy, every summer we publish a paper on environmental taxation through the tax strategy group.  It receives a fair amount of attention and it is right that we keep these things to the fore in terms of what we are doing and can potentially do.  Each July we publish and this in addition to the work Mr. McCarthy is doing with the ESRI on the research and the analysis.</p></speech>

If one thinks about the retrofitting challenge for a moment, one needs a combination of policies.  On average it costs about &euro;1,000 per year to heat a home with gas.  With larger homes, the cost is obviously greater.  In terms of retrofitting, heat pumps cost &euro;8,000 to &euro;9,000.  Significant retrofitting can cost &euro;10,000, &euro;15,000 or &euro;20,000, which can be significant.  There is a variety of different elements.  One has to have the incentive.  If it is more expensive, ultimately, people will look over time about making savings.  If there is an incentive, they will not have to endure the hassle.  Can they access the finance?  There might be an issue then for low-cost loans.  Who is subsidising the loans?  Ultimately, we are talking about the State doing this, which is a cost to the generality of taxpayers.</p> <p>  There are distributional issues as well.  If one is talking about providing subsidies for better off households to insulate larger homes, that has a negative redistribution effect since the rest of are paying for higher income groups.  There has been a lot of work done in the UK on why people do not retrofit.  When it comes to attics, for example, this work suggests that the major challenge is people could not be bothered cleaning out their attics.  They decided to give grants to declutter attics.  This is what the nudge unit came up with.  Rather than giving very elaborate grants to retrofit, they gave a grant for someone to declutter one's attic, which was much more effective.  There are a variety of different instruments here, including nudges, regulations, taxes and financing instruments.  The State, as the Deputy said, through general taxation or Exchequer funding cannot do this job.  It is just not possible.  It is too expensive and it would also be wrong from a distributional aspect to try to do so.</p> <p>  On a communications strategy, if any society is going to engage in this type of enormous change, it requires a wider political consensus, which has other implications which are not my business.  I do not think it makes sense to think about a particular part of a State talking about a communications strategy because the changes that are required are so enormous that there has to be consensus among political groupings and other civic society groupings, like trades unions, about how we do this.  This change can take place incrementally without that wider support.</p> <p>  On winners and losers, we do not know all of the policy instruments.

Mr. Moran and Mr. McCarthy mentioned taxation.  We have work done by the Department of Finance and the ESRI on the distribution impacts of carbon tax.  We know from the Living in Ireland Survey how much people spend in different types of households as per different income deciles so we can work out the distributional impact of a carbon tax without changes to the fuel allowance, which has been mentioned.</p> <p>  It depends on the nature of the policy.  If one was to say to us here are five or ten policies and go off and figure out what the effects would be, we would have a reasonable stab at working out what the distributional effects would be.  That is the ongoing work.</p></speech>

Has there been any analysis done on the consequences and the potential consequences of that?  I believe Mr. Watt is wrong on the 22% increase in livestock numbers in the past period of time.  That figure is exaggerated.  There has been an increase in the dairy sector and a reduction by the same amount in the beef sector to compensate.  The figure is more in single figures than 22% that Mr. Watt referenced.</p></speech>

Has there been analysis done on the potential implications of that for the whole sector?  We hear on a daily basis about rural Ireland.  The agricultural sector, as Mr. Watt referenced earlier, is crucially important to the rural economy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.130" nospeaker="true" time="13:59:00" ><p>It looked at different sectors of the economy in granular detail.  The ESRI does not look at the agriculture sector per se.  However, it concludes that at an aggregate level there is a very limited impact.  It has considered a &euro;5 and a &euro;20 increase in carbon tax.  While the aggregate impact is minor, the most exposed sectors are the transport and the natural gas supply sector.  The sectors that drive Irish exports, including the high-technology multinational sector, would not be affected greatly.  As such, the overall competitiveness of the economy is unaffected.  To come back to the Deputy's earlier point and something Mr. Watt was discussing, the ESRI looks at the impact on not only the productive sectors of the economy but on households in the ten different deciles from poorest to second poorest and on to the richest.  It concludes that a carbon tax would be regressive and recommends flanking policies, as Mr. Moran says, to address those distributional issues.  That is just the first stage in the research we have commissioned from the ESRI.  We will work with the institute as it looks at how things evolve over time.  In other words, it will not just look at a static impact, but at what the behavioural impacts will be if one has a carbon tax pathway from now to 2030 and how different sectors would be affected.  It is probably possible to have a more in-depth look at the agriculture sector within that analysis.  This time next year, I will probably be in a better position to quantify certain things for the Deputy.</p></speech>

There is already negative taxation and activities which subsidise the production of greenhouse gas emissions in the agricultural sector, which I am sure the Deputy is aware of.  I am happy to check the numbers I have.  I am not that close to herd numbers.  However, in the five year period, the number of dairy cows, which I acknowledge is not the totality, increased by 22%.</p></speech>

I address my first question to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is emerging that a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society approach must be adopted to address this as a matter of urgency.  I heard the officials mention the Citizens' Assembly recommendation and their views on whether there should be a separate body.  Does the Department have a view on the type of leadership required?  Has it examined that question with reference to what other states are doing around governance?  There has been plenty of discussion here about whether it should be led by the Taoiseach's office or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p> On the national mitigation plan, there is a proposal for a review of public expenditure.  It is an appraisal and evaluation.  Does the Department have plans for when that will take place?  Climate action is a strategic investment priority in the national investment plan.  I was wondering how the Department intended to prioritise climate action expenditure.  Funding is provided for climate action through the disruptive technologies innovation fund and the &euro;1 billion rural development fund.  What type of evaluation framework will be put in place around this type of expenditure?</p> <p>  My next question is directed to the Department of Finance and it is on hypothecation, that dreaded word which is not in the dictionary of finance officials.  There has been some discussion around whether funding raised through the carbon tax should be ring-fenced.  Does the Department have a view on that?  What is the Department doing to invest the money it is collecting from the carbon tax?  Is it being used to transition to a low-carbon economy in some shape or form?  Should there be further incentives to encourage the public to move to low-emission vehicles and electric cars?  There seems to be a view that we must do a lot more there.  I acknowledge Deputy Pringle's excellent Bill which has been accepted.  What is the Department going to do with the divested proceeds?  Is it going to be invested in green and low carbon investments in order to accelerate to a more sustainable economy?</p></speech>

Having a Department responsible for climate action is important but I would be interested to hear from the political side what the view is.  It is a good change to bring together within one Department.  Of course, that Department does not have responsibility for agriculture, transport, housing stock and other issues we are talking about.  It is about a combination of making that work effectively.  There are different options in the UK, including centrally-mandated targets from the Prime Minister's office.  Other countries have that too.  There might be a combination of a climate Department plus more centrally-mandated targets from central Government.  The UK allocates sectoral targets to different sectors and Ministers and their departments are responsible for delivering them.  There is merit in looking at all of those options and we have an open mind in doing so.  While I do not know what the best approach is, we have an open mind about the structures we have and need to be honest about whether they are working and whether they can deliver on a challenge of this scale.  Ultimately, it is a political question of the interaction between Departments.  That is a matter for the Taoiseach.</p> <p>  I have already spoken about the appraisal.  We published the revised appraisal of public expenditure setting out the revised price of carbon, increasing that price into the future compared to where we are.  That will feed into the final issue raised on assessing priorities and strategic investments.  An appropriate carbon price will ensure Departments face the right incentives and costs when they evaluate a variety of potential projects.  A lot of work has to be done to look at the best options for the future.  A more realistic price of carbon will help us get to the right decisions.  The two questions are interlinked.  It is about having that code and adopting it, which we hope to do in the new year, and then ensuring it is reflected in decisions taken across Government.  A whole variety of issues relates to that.</p></speech>

However, I said at the outset that we have a multi-annual trajectory for carbon taxation and recycling some of the revenues to mitigate some of the distributional issues would be worth doing.  It has better links to ensure some of the money is going back.  The &euro;430 million or so which we collect in carbon tax now goes into the general taxation pot.  However, it is part funding a lot of stuff in the national development plan in that area.  Whether some or all of the carbon taxes collected go back to mitigation will ultimately be a decision for the Government of the day.  We have touched on further incentives on and off.  There will always be an argument for incentives.  However, there has to be a balance between the carrot and the stick to incentivise changing behaviours.</p> <p>  On Deputy Pringle's Bill, the ISIF investment mandate will change in line with the legislation.  It is an amendment to the NTMA Act.  That is the material effect.  The NTMA's investment strategy changes in line with the legislation.  If I am right, the Bill goes to the Seanad this week and, with a change to the Title, it will be done.</p></speech>

I remind everybody that we are talking about climate change.  Has the Department studied the recent IPCC report?  This conversation does nothing to deal with the urgency of the situation we are facing.  That report warned us that within the next dozen years or so, we are in danger of overheating the planet to a degree where we will put species and human life in danger.  We have done enough damage.  My first question is on the carbon tax because Mr. Moran said that the ESRI study demonstrates that even if we double the tax to &euro;40 per tonne, it would only result in a 5% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, which, while welcome, goes nowhere near dealing with the challenges we face.</p> <p>  Later he said that he does not agree with the Citizens' Assembly's recommendation regarding an independent body.  Yet there is a joke around this building that this is the committee on climate inaction.  That is often said to me.  This committee is getting that name because the Government's inaction on dealing with climate change is apparent.  If I was Mr. Watt in his Department, I would seriously examine what I do to double or treble public transport provision to get cars off the road and to end that culture that he talked about of us driving everywhere and to get rid of the idea that fuel poverty is acceptable.  MABS conducted a study recently on the constituency I live in, and one quarter of households live in fuel poverty.  They spend more money trying to keep themselves warm than they do on food.  In doing so, they are burning more gas and coal.  These are the issues that his Department should be tackling.  He uses the unfortunate example - given what has happened recently in education - of the choices we make about the types of school buildings that we decide to spend money on.  Given the disaster that those choices have proven to be in the recent past, it was an unfortunate choice.  Nevertheless it does not go near-----</p></speech>

I know schools where the kids are trying to get money from the Government to invest in solar power and they are knocking on doors and nobody is listening to them.  I would welcome the establishment of an independent overarching body that would listen to communities and put pressure on officials such as Mr. Watt and Mr. Moran to say that their spending decisions are wrong.  They are not doing enough to address the urgency of the situation and we have to start tackling climate change in a different way.  Mr. Watt quoted the Stern Review: The Economics of Climate Change, which states, "Climate change is the greatest market failure the world has ever seen".  Yet at no stage does his briefing document move outside the parameters of the free market and market mechanisms.  He referred to cost abatement, carbon pricing, market discovery but presents no idea about how to tackle this except within the parameters of the market that has failed us, in the first instance.  The fact that their submissions arrived late made it difficult for me and my staff to challenge them in a more comprehensive way.  It is an impediment to the work of this committee that we continue to receive submissions at the last hour.  Nevertheless, they are hollow, shallow and do nothing to deal with the urgency of the situation.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Watt to answer that whether he has he read the IPCC report and whether he is aware of the urgency of the situation we are facing.</p></speech>

I recognise the urgency.  On carbon tax, the 4.7% reduction for a &euro;20 increase is an illustration of the potential of this as a measure for decarbonisation.  The climate action commission is talking about &euro;80.  I spoke about mapping that type of change over a period and bringing certainty and focus to the fact that this will increase over time.  While the net impact on emissions may not be linear, as in three times 4.7%, in terms of what we are trying to achieve over the next decade or so, it will solve not all of it but it could go a long way.  That is why having a multi-annual trajectory for this becomes important.</p></speech>

If, on the one hand, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and farming organisations are encouraging farmers to rear more cows and herds for dairy and for export, at no stage would the Department of Finance step in to say this will cost a significant amount in the long run because of carbon emissions.  Where is the joined-up thinking?  I do not believe there is joined-up thinking in the Government or in the State.  That is why I agree with the Citizens' Assembly recommendation that we need an outside independent body that keeps an eye on all these Departments and tries to force through that joined-up thinking about the size, challenge, seriousness and urgency of the situation we are facing.</p></speech>

I have been involved in climate issues for 20 years.  I worked for the European Commission a good many years ago on the ETS and carbon tax and on other initiatives.  I am well aware of the issue.  Nobody should downplay or trivialise the challenge we face.  I have seriously engaged with this committee for the past two hours, as has Secretary General Moran.  I am happy to do it another time and provide a briefing.  We have been fairly upfront and honest about our views.  We have set out where we think we need to go on policy.  It involves difficult decisions and policy choices, and that is for political leadership.  It is nor for myself and Mr. Moran.  We are here to provide advice and to implement policy and that is what we do.  There is a wider political challenge that has to be addressed.</p></speech>

I have a wee bit of sympathy for the witnesses because the impression one would get is that they are the decision-makers.  Perhaps they are but if the Ministers were before us, they would tell us that the Secretaries General were telling them that they cannot do a particular thing.  I want to get to who makes the decisions and how they are informed.  Perhaps I am naive and I will be put right on this but I presume the Minister says he or she wants to introduce a carbon tax of &euro;100 a tonne and departmental officials will say this will do "X", "Y" and "Z", these are the options.  The Minister is asked what he or she wants to do and then goes along with what the officials want.  Is that how it works?  For example, the former Minister for Communications, Climate Change and the Environment who resigned said that he had recommended that the national development plan co-ordination group and the technical research and modelling group, TRAM, considered a form of carbon-budgeting as a climate policy management tool to aid in decision-making and that went nowhere.

I thank the witnesses for their time and for the documents they provided for us.</p> <p>  Mr. Watt stated that we should not underplay the challenges that we face.  We require changes to society on a scale not seen since the Industrial Revolution.  We need buy-in across all sectors - political, departmental and throughout the country.  The committee has previously raised concerns that there is a patchwork approach to climate actions across many groups and bodies working away in their area.  A more unified and co-operative approach is obviously required to deal with these issues.  Is this an issue that the Departments are looking at and have they looked at examples from other states that are meeting their climate change targets to see what improvements we could make?</p> <p>  We had the ESRI in here at previous meetings.  They informed us that 88% of houses were constructed before energy efficiency measures were put in place.  We spent a lot of time teasing out the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, better energy home grants and we learned from the statistics provided that the cavity insulation grant is the most popular grant, followed by the grants for the boiler, the heating control and finally solar panels.  Dealing with constituents week on week, I put that down to the cost associated with solar panels or heating controls whereas most people can make up the difference when it comes to cavity insulation, or even if they have to change their boiler.  The other heating measures are a step too far for many people.  I ask the witnesses to discuss that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.181" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="13:59:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018111400002#MM03300"><p>We have discussed some of these issues already so I apologise if I go over old ground again.</p> <p>  On insulation, there is a big question over whether people have the right incentives to insulate.  There is also a lot of hassle involved in doing it and then there is the financial issue.  A household might think it has a strong incentive to retrofit but it might not have access to the financing.  SEAI could play a role there and we mentioned the potential for low cost loans earlier.  The incentives, the hassle factor and the funding are different issues which might prevent people from insulating.</p> <p>  As the Deputy is aware, it is an enormous challenge and it will take a generation to retrofit homes.  It is interesting to see the different types of options that people go with.  I know that SEAI is doing a lot of work to try to figure out what is working and what is not, why is there a variability in take-up among different income groups and what is causing that.  There is much work to be done there which will feed into policy in the future.</p> <p>  On climate change, we set out that there are governance challenges and a principal agent problem that we face and that other countries face.  The problem is that the Minister is responsible for delivering the targets but the levers are with a whole variety of other Departments and agencies.  Trying to have that co-ordinated approach is the job of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment but there is an issue over which mechanism that should happen through.  There is a Cabinet committee on climate change and there is a senior officials' group but are they operating to the best of their capabilities and there is the question of whether it could be done differently.  We have an open mind on that.  I mentioned in my remarks that some countries have mandated targets.  For example, sector X would be mandated to deliver on a certain target and that would then be driven from the centre.  This is something that we must look at and there are certainly ways that we can improve the co-ordination challenge that exists.</p></speech>

Mr. Watt has used language here today of considering what structures might be necessary.  Is there an articulation of that vision across Government about what type of structure could be created or would it continue to be housed in a particular Department looking across other departmental silos?  Do we need an overarching structure that would benchmark the actions of individual Departments because I take some solace from the two interventions that we have had here today and the fact that there is a clear outlining of a vision in respect of what needs to be done and the urgency of the problem?</p> <p>  Frankly, it is the first articulation that I have heard from Departments on the urgency of this.  I am trying to deconstruct some of the language that was used.  I do not mean this in a pejorative sense but some of the language can be coded such as: "more stringent central mandates" and "least cost abatement options".  This language needs to be simplified if we are to produce a report that is fit for purpose and reflects the Citizens' Assembly's report.</p> <p>  The Citizens' Assembly made a recommendation on the establishment of a central, independent body.  Are we moving towards a similar structure across Government that would kick the tyres on what individual Departments are doing?</p></speech>

However, it is not the most important thing on which to focus.  I would concentrate on getting the right measures and then on getting the structures to ensure that these are brought forward and implemented.  I am not really sure about a carbon budget.  I am always sceptical about saying a budget is a housing budget or a health budget because I do not know what it means in reality.  Does it make sense for us to collate the measures each year to see if they help?  The answer is "Yes", and we do a bit of that.  We can look at the spending and tax measures that affect climate but I would not spend too much time worrying about such things as it is the policies, the structures, the mandate and the implementation that matter.  It is a question of how we get things done.</p></speech>

The next question concerns which of the sectors has to do it and how we share the burden?  It can be done on a <i>pro rata</i>basis or relative to the cost of abatement, which is the more efficient way.  We could also say that, because agriculture is responsible for 40% of emissions, that sector should reduce by 400,000 units.  That, however, is just to set the top-down target.  The next question is how we are going to get there.  We need to consider what options there are and how we would enforce them.</p></speech>

Are they looking at stabilisation within the system, such as by using tax to enable the transition to a low-carbon economy?  Currently, we tax fossil fuels heavily and do not tax EVs.  What is the timeframe for taxing EVs as revenues from fossil fuels decrease?  The revenue from fuel is significant.  Has the Department considered a carbon price floor for electricity, as has been done in the UK?</p></speech>

I referred to the research which suggests that there is a potential return from carbon tax increases in the shape of the reduction of emissions.  It is important that we have a good trajectory as we move forward.  We have published stuff on what the pathway may look like and its implications.</p></speech>

Given the fact that the target is so difficult to reach and that we are going to see significant reductions in emissions and, therefore, allowances in the ETS, a credible price will be sustained during the period.  Given that a lot of the cheaper abatement options have been pursued, we will see a higher price ETS.</p></speech>

The price of carbon fell by approximately &euro;5 per tonne within the ETS.  An argument was made by some economists that a floor should be introduced but, in the past 12 months or so, there has been a move by the European authorities to mop up some of the excess supply of credits, as a result of which the price has moved from &euro;5 per tonne to over &euro;20.</p> <p>  In the context of the carbon tax, there is an OECD hierarchy of taxes.  The OECD and the IMF tend to suggest taxing bad things and outcomes, and not taxing good ones.  This mean taxing negative externalities but we have models which show that, if one increases carbon tax and uses the proceeds to reduce labour tax, it is a win-win situation, because reducing the tax burden on labour is positive for labour supply and creates growth.  We are conscious of this sort of thing when we provide our analysis, although, as Mr. Watt said, we do not make decisions.</p></speech>

How do we ensure that Departments climate-proof major actions and investment projects?  I am mindful of Project Ireland 2040, the delivery board of which is co-chaired by Mr. Watt.  How much is the carbon impact of the plan factored in?  Being in control of the purse strings, the Department has a lot of influence in determining if other Departments are not giving enough consideration to it.  Are there plans for a cross-departmental spending programme on climate action?  It would make a great deal of sense.</p></speech>

Our draft consultation paper is out there for discussion and we have set out the price we think it should be in the future.</p><p>It will incentivise projects that have significant abatement potential and discourage investments that lead to higher emissions.  That is the main way by means of which we will influence decisions over time.  When Departments are making decisions about investment, they will reflect a higher price for carbon.</p><p> In terms of cross-departmental spending, a variety of spending initiatives are assigned to different Departments.  Some Departments work together in a collaborative sense but individual Departments have responsibility for their programmes and within that there are elements that are related to climate.  In the context of the carbon budget, we pull together the different strands of spending related to carbon as we set out the measures.  It is about public transport, energy efficiency and retrofitting and all the standard type of options and measures relating to the ETS scheme with regard to supports for renewables and so on.  There are a variety of initiatives.</p></speech>

The general approach we need to take is that the country turns and changes when we are all working in a certain direction.  We need to triple the level of ambition for climate action in the same way we have just tripled the price for carbon in our public procurement assessment in the political system.  We need to triple our level of investment on this issue in our public administrative system.  If we do that collectively, we can turn things around.  We are showing that we are good at it.</p> <p>  What is the role of Mr. Watt's Department in the assessment or drafting of the new energy and climate action plan that we have to do under EU governance?</p></speech>

We will be involved with helping the latter assess the options, based on the public spending code, which we believe will deliver abatement at the lowest cost.  We will engage in conversations and discussions.  One of the challenges we have is to beef up the capacity.  The Deputy is aware of the IGEES work we have been doing and the papers we have been publishing, which try to improve our analytical capacity.  That is what it comes down to.  There are lots of options.  People talk about a specific option leading to emissions reductions but when it is investigated, it does not deliver or is too expensive.  We have to consider what will actually work and make an impact.  Our role is to work with the Department in assessing options that come from it and the other options and engaging in a constructive discussion about the options that should be put to Government for decision.</p></speech>

The potential cost of not closing that gap is at least &euro;3.2 billion.  It could be between &euro;6 billion and &euro;10 billion, depending on the price of carbon.  With regard to his responsibility to assess the options of how to close the gap, has Mr. Watt received from the other Department details of what those options might be?</p></speech>

The Deputy has got this from discussions with Secretaries General.  We have not worked through all the options that establish which decisions we will have to take in this area.  We have some ideas.

I am not trying to be smart.  Before Mr. Watt came in, the committee made a decision to write to all the Secretaries General in order to get them to assist our work and to acknowledge that the Government has to have the first draft of its answer to that question ready by Christmas.  To assist us in that work, we were going to write to all the Secretaries General to ask if they could provide us with an outline of what options are on the table, how much carbon abatement they would achieve and what the timelines would be by 30 November.  It would assist us.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is due to come before the committee on 5 December.  As Mr. Watt has that central co-ordinating role, could he ensure that the other Departments and his own provide the committee with a detailed options paper by 30 November?</p></speech>

The European package was agreed by the Government in October 2014.  I have seen up close the Departments' work up in providing analysis ,in a really heroic way, within short timelines.  We need that level of ambition and heroic endeavour here so that by 30 November - in advance of Christmas because it is not that far away - we can look at some of the options.  Could we commit to that?</p> <p>  We know from the modelling that has been done that the national development plan does not close the gap.  Much of what it does takes us in the wrong direction or does not take us far enough.  I will provide a number of examples.  We have heard here about the importance of retrofitting.  It is a brilliant investment.  It is the lowest cost abatement curve.  I can say that in advance.  There is an endless number of reports that I could wheel out to show that retrofitting of energy efficiency buildings is the lowest cost carbon.  We have &euro;4 billion in the budget for that.  Andrew McDowell, the head of the EIB, was in Dublin last week and stated that we need a budget of &euro;50 billion.  John FitzGerald stated that for social housing alone we need a budget of &euro;5 billion.  The OPW has stated that we are nowhere near meeting our energy efficiency targets in respect of public buildings.  The numbers that were mentioned in Mr. Watt's presentation are a minute percentage of what we should be doing.  That &euro;4 billion will not be enough.  We will have to change the national development plan.</p> <p>  I am speaking as a Dublin person but what is going on in transport is an absolute crime.  It is a continuation of what Mr. Watt said about our sprawl because in Dublin we are widening the N11, the N7, the N6, the N4, the N3 and the N2.  Mr. Watt correctly stated that the big problem is the sprawl model.  The national planning framework said the right thing, which is that we were going to move away from it.  The national development plan forgot that and threw it out.  The only thing we are building this year is roads.  We have no public transport projects in train.  There is not a single cycling project under construction.  It is the same again next year.  That has to change.  There is nothing about forestry or the new circular economy in the national development plan.  Does Mr. Watt agree if we are going to be serious about our climate task that the national development plan will have to change?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.227" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Watt" time="13:59:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018111400002#OO02100"><p>I do not agree with the characterisation of the plan in the context of public transport.  There are significant investments planned in BusConnects, the cycleways and the metro.  As the Deputy knows, in Dublin it is about the future planning of the city.  We have a model of development of unplanned urban sprawl which is not sustainable.  It is not sustainable from a congestion or climate perspective.  That needs to change.  A significant development in recent months is the Land Development Agency whereby the Government sets out its plans to enable much more compact development.  A key part of Project Ireland 2040 is that there is alignment between a spatial view, which is a land view, of the country and the capital plan.  They are aligned.  We can do more and we will see as the plan is being implemented how we can support the objectives of having a much more compact city.</p> <p>  On retrofitting, the plan sets out a significant investment programme, which is a start.  It is on its way.  We will see.  Nobody would underestimate or downplay the enormous challenge we have in retrofitting because 88% of our houses were built before we had the energy rating system in place.  We have significant challenges.  We have discussed the costs already today of different insulations and options.  We will fund it through a mix of tax incentives, tax increases to incentivise people to take the retrofitting, direct Exchequer grants, loan guarantees, low-cost funding and a variety of different options.  There is no doubt that as we start the retrofitting programme and see how we are going that we will have to look at other instruments and mechanisms to accelerate the programme.</p> <p>  My view is that Project Ireland 2040 is the right plan in terms of the ambition and types of initiatives.  There is a strong focus on compact cities and it is a question of us delivering on that.  It is a big change from where we were before.</p></speech>

I would also commission Bord na M&oacute;na to buy 10,000 heat pumps - in order that we might get a better price - and to introduce apprenticeships for young people in the midlands to start retrofitting houses.</p> <p>  I will ask two other questions.</p><p> I agree with what has been said about the governance issue.  It has to belong to the centre of the State and the Government cannot be told what to do.  The wording in the Citizens' Assembly's recommendation called for us to improve or resource the existing independent bodies.  I would, therefore, resource the climate advisory committee more.  I would have a commission to deal with transition and a green investment bank.  There are loads of ways to do this.  I agree that the centre has to be where this responsibility lies. </p><p> Last Monday, we made our submission on the consultation paper.  Should we change the delivery board to be a climate action delivery board?  Should we get Mr. Mark Griffin to co-chair with Mr. Watt and put climate at the centre of our decision-making process?  That body has a responsibility because that is where the power lies, working with other Departments.  Would Mr. Watt make that change in the governance structure?</p></speech>

I ask him to come back to the committee by 30 November, in the same way that I have asked Mr. Watt, with an analysis of how we could introduce a cap and dividend scheme on the additional carbon tax that we raise.  It should be assumed that we add another &euro;20 in carbon tax under the current charging regime but return the revenue to the citizens in the way that Senator Grace O'Sullivan has set out.  It is fine if Mr. Moran has to get the ESRI to assist him with the analysis.  I ask him to supply a paper that will assist the committee in writing its paper on the implications, costs, opportunities and obstacles in that process.</p></speech>

Interestingly, he cited the former Ministers of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputies Howlin and Noonan, and the current Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, as examples.  Everyone who has been in government knows that the power lies with the Minister for Finance and whether one is a Minister with responsibility for energy, agriculture or transport, one must overcome that obstacle.  It has been an obstacle in getting to decarbonisation.  There was always a sense that the officials in the Department of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform did not understand that decarbonisation is an economic opportunity for this country, that we can and will be good at it, that this is where the new economy is going and that retrofitting is not a burden or high risk.  That attitude must change.  We must give power to line Ministers, local authorities and mayors in order that everyone in this country has the opportunity to experiment and show off how we can make this shift.  That is one of the changes that has to happen.</p></speech>

That is why I suggested that Deputies Howlin and Noonan should be invited here to give their views on the matter.</p> <p>  I do not disagree with what has been said about opportunities.  I am sure that the Deputy gets a sense from our contributions that we made this afternoon that we believe the urgency and scale of this challenge.  It will involve enormous societal change which, in turn, will provide enormous opportunities.  It will involve difficult decisions.  Some sectors will go into the decline while others will grow and prosper.  I do not look on this negatively; on the contrary, there will be great opportunities.  However, it will involve the pain of transition.  We should be upfront about some of those issues and not try to duck them.  I believe that this is an opportunity for sectors to grow, prosper and provide employment.</p></speech>

However, we need to know the cost.  He emphasised in his presentation that we need to know whether we will achieve the objective, which is a reduction in carbon emissions, and the cost of same.  At every stage that is what we need to do here.  The boat must be able to float in the end as well as us building it so when compiling a report, we must aim for something that will work.</p> <p>  Aside from the pain of transition, hitting targets and reducing carbon emissions, what will the economy and our lifestyles look like?  I refer to economic forecasting and growth areas in general..  For instance, will consumers have access to cheaper electricity?  Will we embark on a crusade of innovation, research and intellectual property for new technology solutions to displace fossil fuels?  Will we be leaders in this area?  Does the Department of Finance consider this an area where we can glean economic benefits in the long term?  We can encourage businesses and innovators.  We must let them know that we will prioritise our spending on innovative ideas and that we will have a new economy.</p></speech>

There is a work stream at a European level in Eurostat looking at some of these issues.  Every two years we get together with the OECD to compile a report on the economy and consider sustainability as being more widely defined than just simply GDP.  It is an area that a lot of work is being done on both in the Department and internationally.</p></speech>

How we heat our homes, transport ourselves and what we eat will be very different in the future.  Earlier I mentioned big system changes.  We will have a decarbonised electricity system.  We will also have heat and transport electrified to a significant extent.</p> <p>  In terms of changes in the cost of batteries and power, the battery will change our society in fundamental ways.  In ten or 15 years, there will be plenty of electric cars.  Mr. Moran mentioned that there are 4,000 electric cars now.  I firmly believe that the number will dramatically increase as the cost of batteries falls and we are seeing that.  Some studies suggest, even in the absence of subsidies, that electric cars could be cheaper than fossil fuel combustion engines in four or five years.  There will be dramatic changes but no one knows exactly.</p></speech>

The issue of electric cars and the range anxiety - which is about a distance of 320 km without being recharged depending on the latest Tesla which go far - is that they are expensive.  The issue is about the price of batteries which is coming down even in the absence of the subsidy the Department of Finance provides.  There are very significant falls in the cost of batteries and significant improvements in their power.  That is the big issue that drives the change.  It only works if the electricity system is fundamentally different and is more decarbonised.  That is another challenge which the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment can talk to the committee about.</p></speech>

The ESB has been providing these points free of charge.  That will not go on for ever.  Progress on that needs to move ahead of the take-up of EVs, because if the charging infrastructure is not there, this take-up will not happen.  While we do have some at the moment, they are thin on the ground.  In places there may be one in a major town of probably 20,000 people, at a railway station or some such point.  There would be a need for five, six or seven such points.  What is the view of the Department of Finance in that regard?  We tried already to get the views of the Minister on this.</p> <p>  On renewable energy, we have huge potential here with wind and wave energy and even solar and other forms, such as biomass and biogas and indeed hydro.  The climate action fund of &euro;500 million over ten years does not reflect that we are making a major priority of this issue.  I note that the national development plan has a &euro;116 billion programme underpinning that.  There is &euro;7.6  million Exchequer and &euro;14.2 billion non-Exchequer funding.  Can Mr. Watt tell me where the &euro;14.2 billion non-Exchequer is coming from?</p> <p>  While the &euro;50 million a year is welcome as a starting point, the fact that it does not escalate from &euro;50 million as we move on from 2020 and 2030, would not give hope that there will be any significant change as a result of that fund.</p> <p>  What is pertinent here is to look at the case of Bord na M&oacute;na and its transition from brown to green.  We had that discussion again yesterday with Bord na M&oacute;na.  In the constituency where I live and which I represent this is of huge concern to us.   To move from brown to green, there is a huge area there for investment.  Does the Department see that Bord na M&oacute;na would need a significant piece of that investment to help it with that transition?</p> <p>  The other question on funding for transition relates to the approximately &euro;105 million that comprises the public service obligation, PSO, subsidy for peat.   Is it possible within the rules of the Department and European Union for that or part of that to be used to help assist with that transition?  The climate action fund of &euro;50 million does not appear to escalate as we move on over the next decade to decade and a half.  Could part of the PSO levy be brought into play?</p> <p>  My other question is on the disruptive technology fund of &euro;500 million.  What is that; where is it coming from and what can it be used for?  If it is disruptive technology does that mean moving from one technology to another?  Could Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB, for example, use that type of funding?</p></speech>

A person was in contact with me today about solar power.  LEADER seems to be handling some funding for it.  SEAI has some elements of grants as well.  The public find it very hard to get plugged in - pardon the pun - to all of this as to what is available.  As a public representative who follows this, which I do, I want to know what is available and how to access it.</p></speech>

Most of the issues on SEAI schemes are for the Department and the authority.  Our remit does not extend to publicising the benefit of schemes.  That is for the different agencies.</p> <p>  On the question of funds, the Minister and the Government decided than it would be very useful, rather than allocating money to the Departments, to allocate instead to a fund and encourage different players inside and outside the system to come up with ideas.</p> <p>  There is a fund on sub-technology, which could be climate-related or outside the climate field.  There is a direct fund for climate initiatives.  We have received lots of submissions and those ideas are being looked through, evaluated and assessed.  The Government will make announcements on those in the coming period.  We will see how we get on with these funds.  It is an area we are interested in because it creates that competitive tension and it encourages innovation across the system.  What they will fund at this stage, we do not know, but we will make an announcement shortly.</p> <p>  On renewables, I could be mistaken - Mr. Cleary might be able to confirm this - but they now make up 40% of peak demand for electricity depending on which time of the day or year it is.  That is fairly significant.  When the former Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was there it was only 15% or 20%.  That is not too long ago.</p></speech>

A lot of the time when it is very windy there is not the demand for it.  There are times, however, when the renewables can contribute a lot to the grid.  Most of that is onshore wind.  There is an issue about other sources of renewables and the extent to which they will compete.  Onshore is the cheapest.  Offshore is much more expensive.  The last numbers I saw never really convinced me of the significant impact that solar was going to make in Ireland but then again I am not the expert here.  There are others who are experts-----</p></speech>

Solar works in hotter climates where the solar panels generate electricity for the air conditioning systems.  When it is nice and sunny here it is not too cold or there is not that same demand for electricity.  It depends.</p> <p>  Renewables are a positive story.  When one thinks about how renewables penetration in the electricity system has evolved over the past five or ten years, it is a very significant change.  If does show, as Deputy Ryan has mentioned earlier, that when the system becomes galvanised it can deliver very significantly.  There are big issues on peat extraction which Deputy Stanley would know more about than I would I suspect.  Then there is the issue of Moneypoint and what happens there.</p></speech>

I believe that would require the European Commission to consider how that would operate in the future in the absence of peat extraction.  It is a charge that is currently charged on household bills and everything else being equal these would be lower in the future as we move to a different form of fuel mix without peat.  There is a potential saving there.</p> <p>  On the final question, the first point I made about charging points is an interesting one.  That is part of the public infrastructure that we are going to have to improve.  If we are going to have a significant increase in the number of electric vehicles then there are going to have to be more charging points around the country.</p></speech>

One is for car manufacturers to extend the distance that can be travelled without needing to recharge the battery.  There is obviously considerable research to be carried out on that.  The only thing we can do in the interim is to have more charging points.  Even if it is extended, we will need a significant number of them, with one in every parish and every village.</p></speech>

I feel there is insufficient buy-in from people.  I take the officials' point that the infrastructure is being developed further.  In my constituency of Laois-Offaly there are very few charging points and the same is true in the wider midlands region.  Are there any projected targets?  What would the projected target for increasing the number of points in the midlands by 2030 be?  Has the Department prepared a target plan?</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the presence of Mr. Jim Breslin, the Secretary General.  I also welcome Mr. John Connaghan, the acting director general of the HSE, and the accompanying HSE officials.  We have been invited here to provide an update on issues affecting the Department of Health and the HSE, including expenditure to date on Vote 38.  I am happy to do so and I will also outline priorities, significant developments and progress in the area of health.</p> <p>  I will begin with an update on the position of the Vote for 2018.  As the committee is aware, the Government approved gross expenditure of just over &euro;15.3 billion for the health services for 2018.  The announcement by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, that he intends to allocate an additional &euro;700 million to the health service in 2018 by way of a Supplementary Estimate is most welcome, as is the fact it has been possible to carry this additionality into the base for 2019.  Consideration of the Supplementary Estimate will be before the committee very shortly so there will be an opportunity to go into further detail.  The gross current budget for the health sector for 2019 is &euro;16.36 billion.  This is equivalent to an increase of &euro;1.521 billion or 10.2% compared to the 2018 original allocation of &euro;14.839 billion.  I am also pleased to announce a capital budget of &euro;667 million, which is an increase of &euro;174 million on last year's capital budget.  This brings the total gross health budget for 2019 to more than &euro;17 billion.</p> <p>  For the immediate future, the next significant step is the agreement of the national service plan.  The service plan for 2019 will set out the type and volume of services the HSE will provide in respect of the significant budget of more than &euro;16 billion it has received for next year.  The HSE must ensure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of resources is made when planning the services to be provided in 2019.  On budget day the Minister stated we are now firmly in the era of Sl&aacute;intecare and, for the first time, 2019 will see the HSE's national service plan based and developed on the framework of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation strategy, which sets out the Government's plan for delivering a high quality, sustainable and equitable health and social care service over the next decade.  The national service plan will set out the details on how the totality of health service resources will be made to advance Sl&aacute;intecare objectives.</p> <p>  The HSE is now in discussion with the Department on developing the service plan for 2019 with the goal of delivering a plan that makes progress on meeting priority health and social care needs and clearly allows the executive to operate within its notified resources.  The Minister expects to receive a draft service plan submitted for his approval from the HSE in the coming weeks.  The focus on Sl&aacute;intecare in this process is an important element of the strategic transformation of our health service but, of course, we must also focus on the here and now and the immediate challenges we face.</p> <p>  As we head into a period of pressure in our health service, I acknowledge the ongoing commitment, dedication and co-operation of people working in our health services.  This is something of which the Minister and we in Ireland can be very proud.  I know that on a daily basis our doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals make personal sacrifices in the interests of putting patients first.  However, we have learned lessons from previous winter seasons.  Consideration of staff management issues is just one element of a planning process to ensure that we prepare for the winter period in the best way we can.  The Department is working closely with the HSE to ensure the most effective response to this winter within current capacity and resources.  A total of &euro;10 million in additional funding has been allocated in 2018, primarily for provision of supports to get patients home from hospital, where appropriate, before the end of the year, with a focus on supporting patients in the over-75 age group.  The core objective of this measure is to ease congestion in hospitals as far as possible before the end of the year, to prepare for the expected peak in demand in the new year.  In addition, the Minister has requested, in the context of the national service plan, that the HSE plans activity in 2019 to manage critical demand pressures, most particularly in respect of increased attendance at emergency departments.  This planning will include activity in hospitals, primary care and community care to ensure the system is working at full capacity throughout busy periods.  This request provides clarity to the HSE on the level of funding available in 2019 to meet winter pressures.</p> <p>  The challenges evident in hospital emergency departments are a symptom of broader challenges within the hospital itself and across the wider health service.  Increasing capacity and efficiency throughout the hospital, improving services in the community to provide care for patients outside of the emergency departments and supporting the discharge of patients home or into other community services are all part of the solution.  The national development plan provides for a major increase of 2,600 in bed capacity, as identified in the health service capacity review, and this will remain a priority in 2019.  Over the past 12 months, an additional 240 beds have been opened and a further 79 additional beds are planned for the fourth quarter of 2018 and early 2019.  Next year, a further &euro;10 million will be invested to enable additional beds to be opened to alleviate pressure on emergency departments for this winter and the years ahead, on foot of the recommendations in the health service capacity review.  The Department is in discussion with the HSE, in the context of the national service plan for 2019, to identify sites for investment and the associated number of beds, as part of an agreed capacity programme for 2019.</p> <p>  Increasing capacity and access go hand in hand with reducing waiting lists.  A significant investment of &euro;55 million was made in the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, this year and ambitious targets were set to reduce the number of patients waiting for a hospital procedure to below 70,000.  I am pleased to report that as a result of the activity of the HSE and the NTPF we are on track to meet this target, with the number of patients at the end of October at 72,000, down from a peak of just over 86,000 in July 2017.  The improvement has been delivered against a backdrop of increased demand for services and a very challenging start to the year that saw elective activity curtailed as a result of emergency department pressures and severe weather events.  Building on this progress, in budget 2019 the Government further increased investment in this area, with funding to the NTPF rising to &euro;75 million in 2019.  The NTPF plans to reduce further the number of patients waiting to below 59,000 by year end.  While significant progress has been made on inpatient and day case procedures, the number of patients waiting for their first outpatient appointment continues to be a challenge.  The Minister has asked the HSE and the NTPF to bring a renewed focus to outpatient activity in 2019.  Arising from the increased investment, the NTPF plans to arrange at least 40,000 first outpatient appointments in 2019.</p> <p>  Earlier this year, the Minister approved the establishment of a central waiting list validation function within the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  Validation has many benefits, including the identification of patients on waiting lists who are ready, willing and available to proceed with hospital care, a reduction in the rate of those who do not attend and an improvement in information for managing waiting lists.  It is worth noting that each year more than 500,000 patients do not attend their appointments.  Validation has been under way for a number of years at a local level and the NTPF estimates that next year more than 30,000 patients who no longer require an outpatient appointment will come off the outpatient waiting list as a result of this activity.</p> <p>  I will now update members on matters related to CervicalCheck.  In September, as committee members know, Dr. Gabriel Scally provided the final report of his scoping inquiry into issues relating to CervicalCheck.  His report provided welcome reassurance about the laboratories currently contracted by CervicalCheck.</p><p>He is satisfied with the quality management processes in these labs.  It is very important to say that Dr. Scally confirmed that he found no reason the existing contracts for laboratory services should not continue until the new human papillomavirus, HPV, regime is introduced.</p><p> He also stated that continuation of screening in the coming months is of crucial importance.</p><p> The Government fully agrees with this as screening saves lives.  CervicalCheck has been successful in reducing cervical cancer rates in Ireland.  As stated in the Scally report, the lifetime risk of a woman getting cervical cancer was one in 135 in 2015, significantly lower than the lifetime risk in 2007 of one in 96.  This represents a substantial improvement.  The Government has accepted all 50 of Dr. Scally's recommendations.  The Minister has committed to returning to Government within three months, as recommended by Dr. Scally, with a full plan for the implementation of these recommendations.</p><p> In June 2018, the Minister established a national cervical steering committee, that is co-chaired by the chief medical officer and the assistant secretary for acute hospitals in the Department and includes senior management of the Department, the HSE, clinicians and patient advocates.</p><p> It provides oversight and assurance on managing the response to the CervicalCheck issues, and ensuring the implementation of the key decisions taken by Government.  The minutes and agenda for each meeting are published on the Department&rsquo;s website, to allow for full transparency and for members of the public to be updated on the committee&rsquo;s activities.  The Minister is updated weekly, receiving updates on the progress of the steering committee and these are also published.</p><p> The committee has had 12 meetings to date since it was established on 21 June last.  The most recent meeting was on 8 November.  The committee will meet twice more before the end of the year.</p><p> Separate to the work carried out by Dr. Scally, the independent clinical expert panel review, which is being led by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, is under way.  This review is examining the results of screening tests of all women who have developed cervical cancer who participated in the screening programme since it was established.</p><p> The review will provide independent clinical assurances to women about the timing of their diagnosis, and any issues relating to their treatment and outcome.  The Minister would also like to take this opportunity to thank the committee for its time and engagement in recent days as they discussed the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Bill 2018.  In addition, preparations are ongoing for the implementation of the service as soon as possible.  The Department and the HSE are at an advanced stage of drafting contractual proposals for the provision of termination of pregnancy services in the community setting.</p><p> In parallel with service planning and expansion, clinical guidelines for medical practitioners are in preparation by the medical colleges and the Department has provided a grant to support their development.</p><p> The Minister is conscious that women are continuing to travel every day to access services abroad and in some cases to order medication over the Internet.</p><p> He wants to stress again that it is this Government&rsquo;s priority to have a medically delivered, safe and regulated service for the termination of pregnancy for all those who require it, based on the huge mandate that the Irish people have given for this work.</p><p> There is also significant work being done to implement the national maternity strategy.  Ireland&rsquo;s national maternity strategy was published in 2016.  The national women and infant&rsquo;s health programme, NWIHP, has been established within the HSE and is driving the strategy&rsquo;s implementation.  A key aim of the strategy is to ensure that appropriate care pathways are in place so that mothers, babies and families get the right care, at the right time, by the right team and in the right place.  The strategy&rsquo;s three care pathways &ndash; supported, assisted and specialised &ndash; will deliver maternity care in a manner that is both appropriate and woman-centred.</p><p> A detailed implementation plan for the strategy was published in October 2017, providing a clear roadmap for the development of maternity services into the future and, in 2018, the Government provided additional development funding of &euro;4.55 million to progress the strategy and to improve waiting times for gynaecology services.</p><p> The national women and infants health programme highlighted a number of priorities which this funding has continued to address over the course of 2018.  These include the development of community midwifery teams, the development of quality and safety frameworks and the improvement of access to anomaly scanning services.  This year, 2018, has seen the continued expansion of anomaly scanning services in maternity hospitals and units across the country and the development of critical quality and safety initiatives.  The development of the supported care pathway and of community midwifery teams to deliver care in line with the recommendations of the strategy is also ongoing and a multidisciplinary steering group has been established by the NWIHP to oversee the implementation of the strategy&rsquo;s model of care.  This year has also seen the continued roll-out of the very successful maternal and newborn clinical management system, with phase 1 completed and implemented across 4 sites: Cork University Maternity Hospital, University Hospital Kerry, the Rotunda Hospital and the National Maternity Hospital.</p><p> Looking ahead, it is important to ensure that we build on developments to date and the Department will be engaging closely with the programme to ensure this progress continues into the coming year.</p><p> To conclude, planning for the weeks and months ahead now that we are in the winter period is of course the top priority.  Yes, we face challenges.  However, we now have a long-term plan for healthcare and as I have just outlined, we are making progress this year, and we will each and every year.  I thank the committee again for the opportunity to brief it on developments.  I am interested in hearing members' views and look forward to their questions.</p></speech>

In preparation for the meeting, committee members requested information and replies to a number of specific questions and they will by now have received the written response to them.  I will therefore confine my opening remarks to the following issues.</p> <p>  First, I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, that it is intended to allocate an additional &euro;700 million to the health service in 2018 by way of Supplementary Estimate, which now brings the 2018 net revenue budget of the HSE to &euro;15.2 billion.  I know that this was the subject of the Joint Committee on Health meeting of 24 October so I will confine my remarks to welcoming the fact that this will be included in the base funding of 2019.</p> <p>  The HSE is currently finalising an implementation delivery plan in response to the Scally review recommendations.  This is a considerable piece of work ranging from procurement to open disclosure and from governance to risk management.  While our focus will be on early implementation, our concern will be to ensure that plans are solid and sustainable in the future.</p> <p>  We are continuing to support the international expert panel RCOG review, which was commissioned by the Minister for women who were diagnosed with cervical cancer.  This work will continue through 2018 and into 2019.</p> <p>  A key risk to enable cervical screening to continue in Ireland was the extension of the laboratory contracts.  We have secured agreements to enable continuity of the service and are currently finalising contracts with service providers.  The new model will ultimately see a more balanced model of public and private provision in Ireland.  We are also carrying out an extensive worldwide exercise to secure additional capacity, given current demands leading to extended reporting time for women.</p> <p>  We are progressing plans to introduce primary HPV screening, with a focus on international best practice to ensure we have a successful deployment.  At the present moment, until we complete our planning work and finalise on current laboratory provision, we are not in a position to provide a critical path or timetable for the introduction of HPV testing.</p> <p>  We are continuing to provide supports to the women and their families impacted by the crisis.  We are also strengthening the role of patients in the CervicalCheck programme with the establishment of a public patient involvement panel and patient representation on key groups.</p> <p>  Turning to other matters , I advise the committee that planning for winter 2018-19 is well advanced in respect of planning and escalation, the operational management of patient flow and maintaining public health in place at hospital group and community healthcare organisation, CHO, level.  There are five priorities for this winter in the following broad categories: ensuring integrated working between acute hospitals and the community; ensuring robust preparedness plans that optimise our existing resource; ensuring de-escalation pre-Christmas, maintaining demand and capacity balance between Christmas and the new year and ensuring the provision of enhanced measures for the new year surge; a focus on ambulatory patients and on older persons with emphasis on admission avoidance, enablement and community supports; and strengthened working arrangements with GPs, nursing homes and the HSE.  We can provide more detail on this as we carry out this engagement with the committee.</p> <p>  We are grateful for the &euro;10 million once-off funding allocated by the Department of Health for winter.  It is intended to utilise this additional funding to increase the provision of community supports pre-Christmas and open additional capacity in January.</p> <p>  Since the last Joint Committee on Health update, we have made some progress on key performance indicators such as trolley count, with each month since the end of quarter one 2018 recording a decrease over the same period in 2017.  Inpatient and day case waiting lists have decreased by over 5,000, from 78,000 in June to 72,700 in September 2018.  That is down from a peak a year ago of 86,000.</p> <p>  In the national ambulance service, incidents responded to by patient-carrying vehicles in 18 minutes and 59 seconds or less is above target at 81%, noting a performance improvement month on month in the last quarter.</p> <p>  On our community services, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, has advised the HSE that all 1,149 disability centres are now registered as of 31 October 2018 under the national standards for residential services for children and adults with disabilities.  This has been a substantial achievement for the sector.  It is a very positive indication regarding our investment in quality improvement through dedicated professional programmes and additional financial resources for providers.</p> <p>  However, notwithstanding all of the above, we still have significant pressure on acute, community and social care services.  There are too many people waiting on outpatient waiting lists and there is also a significant increase in the numbers of people attending emergency departments and increasing unmet demand for home care support with over 6,000 people now awaiting home support across the nine community healthcare organisations.  All of these are the subject of detailed planning in our national service plan for 2019.</p> <p>  As we move into 2019 we also need to prepare for the introduction of a board to the HSE.  This is a welcome and necessary step for the appropriate governance of the largest organisation in Ireland.  I would particularly like to welcome Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Devane to the post of chairman.  I know from my early discussions with Mr. Devane that a focus on patient safety and quality and culture and values will be early agenda items for the board.</p><p>Consideration of how the HSE responds to recommendations on audit, risk, governance and accountability arising from the Scally report will also be an important aspect of the early work of the board.</p><p> I take this opportunity to look forward into 2019 and highlight some of the HSE's other key strategic objectives.  Sl&aacute;intecare has provided a framework within which the HSE will focus on transforming healthcare services over the coming decades.  New services will be progressed in line with Government policy and care closer to home will be improved through further investments in primary care services, including GP services, the extension of eligibility and reductions in prescription charges and drug payment scheme limits.  The HSE will also focus on a number of key organisational objectives in 2019, including a designation of the major trauma centre and trauma units in Dublin, commencement of the nine learning sites focused on a new networked operating model for community health networks, which will lead to a full-scale national implementation, further development of maternity services and continued investment in ehealth with a specific focus on electronic health records.  My colleagues and I will endeavour to answer any questions members have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.305" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018111400002#H00500"><p>I thank the Minister of State and the officials for their time today and for the statements made.  I start with performance and accountability.  In Ireland, we spend more on healthcare than almost any other country on earth.  Budgets over the last number of years have been the highest in our history.  Commensurately, the overruns have been the most extensive we have ever had.  At the same time, we have more people waiting on trolleys than ever and while there have been improvements in some areas, the total number of men, women and children on waiting lists is higher than it has ever been.  Children with special needs are waiting three years to get help, which deprives them of the future they could have.  There are chronic waiting lists on multiple surgical lists and surgeries will have been cancelled across the country this morning because our hospitals are overcrowded.  It is accepted that a safe and good level for hospitals is approximately 85% whereas ours are between 97% and 104%.</p> <p>  Certain specialties have particular problems.  Children with scoliosis, for example, are waiting more than three years for operations in Crumlin and, as a result, are having their internal organs crushed by their rib cages as their spines curve to over 100%.  Routine appointments for urology at St. James's involve waiting lists of over six years.  As the Minister knows well, many of our mental health services have become so fractured that people are terrified of children and young persons being referred from early intervention to CAMHS where services basically do not exist.  Government figures released in reply to a parliamentary question recently indicate that we have only one tenth of the staff we need in mental health.  Diagnostics are being cut off for GPs.  I had a letter this week from Navan Hospital to say that due to a shortage of radiographers, GPs can no longer refer for DEXA scanning.  The list goes on and on.</p> <p>  In spite of the best efforts of many doctors, nurses and, I am sure, officials, and in spite of the spending of more money than ever before over many years in a row, many parts of the system are in crisis.  There is a level of suffering and a lack of access that we have never seen before.  Given all of that, my question goes to accountability.  Has anyone lost his or her job at a political level, within the Department or anywhere across the HSE?  Has anyone been fired for the catastrophic failures we are seeing across the system notwithstanding the vast amounts of money being spent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.306" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018111400002#H00600"><p>The Deputy's diagnosis, for want of a better term, is one with which I could not agree more.  Everybody in the room accepts that there are difficulties, challenges, waiting lists and unacceptable delays in front-line services and it is a case of what we are going to do about it and how we are going to approach it.  There is no quick-fix answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.307" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018111400002#H00700"><p>I am sorry to cut across the Minister of State.  My question is not about the solutions.  It is whether, given what we both agree is happening, anyone has been fired.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.308" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018111400002#H00800"><p>I might finish addressing the point the Deputy made about all of those difficulties and challenges.  While it is probably too late, there is at least a direction, focus and investment under the overall Sl&aacute;intecare framework.  This year, more than ever, one can see the alignment with Sl&aacute;intecare.  Into 2019, as the service plan is developed, there will be more emphasis on lowering the intervention and bringing services closer to home.  The Deputy referred to scoliosis and so on in that context.  His question about accountability is one I will refer to the HSE in a minute as it is not in the Minister's gift to fire anyone.  That is a point made to one of my predecessors previously by the head of the HSE.  It is not a hiring and firing role and a matter for any Minister to comment on.  Accountability within the HSE is one I can pass to the Director General to answer directly, unless there is a specific question for me.</p></speech>

The question referred to the best of the Minister of State's knowledge, in light of the fact that he is standing in for the Cabinet Minister here.  To the best of his knowledge, has anyone been fired over the catastrophic failures we have seen right across the system?</p></speech>

Does the Deputy mean in the past year?</p></speech>

I can provide the Deputy with an answer on whether people have been dismissed from the service in the past 12 months and the reasons for those dismissals will be manifold, individual and unique.  We cannot say these people were dismissed because of catastrophic failures.  I can certainly ask the director general to answer the question on the number of people who have been dismissed from the service in the past 12 months, or whatever it was.</p></speech>

Has anyone been fired due to the catastrophic failures and the pain and suffering felt across the system?  It is a straight question.</p></speech>

I am not aware at corporate level of anyone being through the disciplinary process for poor performance in that respect.  We have people leaving the service through our disciplinary procedures and that is a matter for local managers and staff and I do not consider that I am at liberty to reveal any of that today.  I recognise the situation the Deputy paints.  As we go forward, we need to build into the HSE something better around personal accountability.  If I can take a minute, I will say a little around what the plans for that might be in 2019.</p></speech>

It is not to cut Mr. Connaghan off, it is just that we have very little time.  I will be very happy to go into that later, but for now the answer to my question is "No".  Is that fair?  I do not want to put words in Mr. Connaghan's mouth, but the answer is "No".  I ask the Minister of State to reflect on that at a political level.  Given what is happening in the system, it does not surprise me that the answer is "No" but that is something that must be reflected on.  Has any formal sanction of any kind been taken against anyone for the catastrophic failures we are seeing across the system?</p></speech>

I do not mean to be disrespectful to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly.  I thank him for coming before the committee.  It is regrettable that the Minister is not present.  It is a long time since we have had a quarterly meeting and we are hoping to be able to rectify that.  I fully understand the reason that he is not here this morning, but it is regrettable.</p><p>The Taoiseach recently made a statement on annual leave in the hospital service and the difficulties he alleges it creates particularly around Christmas time.  This statement was grossly offensive to men and women, many of whom will work hard right over the Christmas period.  I wonder where that assertion came from.  Does Mr. Connaghan know of a particular problem in January?  How is it accounted for<font color="#0000FF"> </font>and will he shed some light as to why the Taoiseach said that?  I heard a radio DJ say that he went into a hospital at Christmas and he formed the opinion that there was not much going on.  I do not think that is the truth.  I think a lot goes on over Christmas but perhaps Mr. Connaghan can enlighten us on that.</p><p>With regard to recruitment and retention, it is my understanding that we now have 259 fewer staff nurses than we had in December 2017.  I have spoken to nurses and they are telling me that the manner in which the recruitment is taking place is acting as an effective moratorium because it takes so long from the decision to recruit to actually finding oneself in employment on the wards.  Is that being analysed?  Is anyone looking at that and can we get an estimation of where they think the blockages are and how they are manifesting themselves and if there are any plans to tackle them will the witnesses share those plans with us?</p><p>If the allocation of &euro;10 million for the winter plan is not spent by the end of the year is it rolled over into next year?  I know it is additional funding but I wonder how it works.  Winter will not be confined to 2018 and it will continue into 2019, is there a plan?  We know that the NHS publishes its winter initiative in September, but we have not seen the winter initiative.  I note what Mr. Connaghan has said but he is listing services that should be happening anyway.  The idea that this is an extraordinary intervention because of winter is a bit much.  What is on the list is the normal day to day activity that should be really happening in our health service.  It would be extraordinary that it does not happen every day of the week.  Will he comment on whether the money will be spent in 2019, and on the funded workforce plan?  Mr. Mulvany and I have spoken about that previously.  As I understand it, there is no funded workforce plan and the matter was referred to a third party for negotiations; will he share with us what stage it is at?</p><p>I have more questions, which I will save until afterward, but my final question in this round relates to CervicalCheck.  We were all touched and saddened to read about the case of Ms Julie O'Reilly in <i>The Irish Times</i>at the weekend.  She was tested four times and the diagnosis was not given to her each time.  There were pre-cancerous cells present but four times they were missed.  I know that Cian O'Carroll has written in the newspaper that there still has not been an on-site audit of the testing laboratories in the US.  Perhaps the witnesses can comment on that and give us an update as to whether all of the laboratories - I am referring to the laboratories in Honolulu from which initially the referral was made to Texas and there was a further outsourcing of the outsourcing.  I do not want to get into a debate on outsourcing because everybody knows my views on that.  Has there been any on-site testing of every laboratory to which the samples were sent for testing?  Has there been any on-site testing because from my read of what was reported in the newspaper there has been no on-site testing of the laboratories where the tests were analysed?  Will the witness confirm whether there has been on-site testing of laboratories engaged in the analysis of test, and share the results with members?  During the course of one committee hearing we asked officials if they could give us a breakdown of the results between each laboratory, including the outsourced and re-outsourced and we were told months ago that it would be no bother to get the information to the committee, but we still have not got it.  It appears every time we ask a question and it becomes more and more complex.  </p></speech>

I cast my mind back over the course of the past year and I think we owe a debt of gratitude to staff.  Let us think of what happened over the course of the last winter, in terms of snow and storms.  Many staff slept overnight and did not go home, they stayed to fill the next shift.  I think we owe all the staff in the Irish health service a debt of gratitude for all that service.  Staff go beyond what is in their normal day to day job description when it is needed.  </p> <p>  I am not sure where the Taoiseach got the impression he did; one of the things we do - and perhaps it is a matter that we need to explain better - during the course of the last part of December and the early part of January, is suppress electives.  That is sensible because operations rescheduled into the back end of January or into February allow for some extra capacity.  Rostering in that sense takes place and that is where we need to explain things a little bit better.  We also need to consider that many of the Departments we have are singlehanded, particularly in rural locations and we also need to think about how we actually roster around those staff.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Connaghan's sentiment about healthcare workers which we share.  There is no difficulty with the members in this room acknowledging the hard work that is done.  We were not the people pointing fingers, but there were no additional staff on leave when the trolley numbers went over 700.  The question was in the context of the numbers waiting on trolleys and specifically with regard to the acute hospital setting and the accident and emergency departments.</p></speech>

The plan we are putting in place will run from 1 December to the end of March.  Within it, we are looking at a number of options.  Much of the activity that has been referenced should be normal activity but we are also taking exceptional measures.  There are three key components to how we are addressing it.  Our winter preparedness includes the introduction of winter-ready clinics in order to target particularly vulnerable groups such as the over 75s.  One of the things we know from the data is that some people who need ambulatory care can be seen in other locations.  We have known that for a few winters and we are enhancing our efforts on that front, looking at extended hours outside the-----</p></speech>

As part of that we will make enhanced hours available within community services because there is often a perception that at that time of year hospitals are in dire straits and some community services are not open.  We plan to make more services available within the community, offer enhanced supports to GPs, enhance diagnostics and, working with private providers, consider a different approach to how we bring people into hospital.  A specific set of measures for that four-week period will be set out in the overall winter plan.</p></speech>

As Members are aware, on the two current laboratories he concluded that we could continue to use those laboratories and extend their contracts.</p> <p>  He also made recommendations.  There are four specific recommendations in his report regarding quality assurance, which includes quality assurance of laboratories.  One of his key observations, rather than recommendations, regarded the lack of a cytopathologist in the programme being a deficit.  We advertised for candidates for that position.  We advertised it before Dr Scally's report as we knew there was a gap.  We have been unsuccessful in that recruitment and have extended the date.  We are now in discussions with a person overseas on a particular contract in an attempt to recruit a candidate to the position, which is critical.</p> <p>  We have appointed a quality and risk manager to the programme who is addressing three of Dr. Scally's four recommendations on the quality assurance structures.  We expect that work to be completed before the end of the year, which would mean that visits to the laboratories could begin in the new year.  Under the new model, such visits would take place on an annual basis.  Previously, there was a significant gap between visits.  Dr. Scally made a recommendation or observation in that regard on which we have acted.  Dr. Scally visited all of the laboratories.  He is also carrying out follow-up work commissioned by the Department relating to one of the historical laboratories in the United States which may be the laboratory to which the Deputy referred.</p></speech>

I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, who is a friend of mine, but I am very disappointed that the senior Minister, Deputy Harris, is unable to attend this morning.  Obviously, Brexit and the Cabinet meeting in that regard are very important but I note that the committee's quarterly meeting with him has been postponed once already.  It is important that he appear before the year is out.</p> <p>  In his opening statement the Minister of State acknowledged the dedication of the health service workers.  I was very disappointed by the very unhelpful comments of the Taoiseach regarding health service workers and the Christmas period. </p> <p>  I wish to stress the importance of winter planning.  It amazes me that every year it seems to be a surprise that more people need to go to hospital during the winter.  It seems to be an emergency or a surprise every year, but it is quite obvious that it is going to happen.  Ms O'Connor outlined the detail in that regard.  </p> <p>  The increase in beds proposed in the national development plan seems very aspirational.  I hope it happens but I do not see how the HSE thinks it can increase bed capacity by 2,600 when there is a maximum potential increase of 319 beds this year and early next year.  The target seems somewhat aspirational.</p> <p>  On the first outpatient appointments, it is great that they will try to put a dent in the backlog but what about those who will be coming on stream seeking first-time appointments?</p><p>Are people and GPs still being written to, texted or phoned to ask if they want to attend their first appointment?  This puts undue pressure on GPs and patients.<br/><br/>I would also like the Minister of State's view on the Ombudsman's comments this morning regarding his disappointment that the HSE has not fully implemented the recommendations in his 2015 report, Learning to Get Better.  At the time, the HSE accepted the 36 of the recommendations in the report but only ten have been fully implemented, 17 have been partially implemented and nine have either not been implemented or are still being considered.  After the Ombudsman went to the trouble of compiling the report, I wonder why all of the 36 recommendations have not been implemented.<br/><br/>As this is the Minister of State's quarterly visit to the committee, I have just a few questions for him.  The first concerns the mental health services - which come under the remit of the Minister for Health - at Bantry General Hospital, which is in the constituency the Minister of State and I represent.  I have submitted numerous parliamentary questions and I cannot get answers.  Perhaps the Minister of State can provide answers now or else get back to me.  Is there a dietician <i>in situ</i>to speak to people who present with eating disorders? What consultation facilities are available to those presenting with mental health issues?  What are the staffing levels?  As late as yesterday, I received a reply to a simple question on the staffing levels but I did not get an answer.  There are either ten or 20 staff or none.  I would like an answer please.  Lisheens House is a facility in our constituency that does not receive any section 39 funding.  Why is that?  Why did the facility have to wait until October for a decision that was due in March and which turned out to be a refusal?  I asked this of the Taoiseach yesterday, but he said to ask the Minister of State.  I am doing so now.<br/><br/>I have a few more questions for the Minister because as I could not expect the Minister of State to know the answers.  I will wait for our meeting with the Minister to ask those questions.</p></speech>

Not every Minister has quarterly meetings with their corresponding committee.  The Minister has always prioritised and tried to attend these meetings as a priority.  I know that I catch the flak more often than not when he cannot make it, but it is certainly not due to lack on interest on his part.  I am aware the members are not suggesting that but I just wanted to make the point that he has always tried to prioritise his attendance at these quarterly meetings.</p> <p>  I wish to correct what the Deputy said.  The Taoiseach did not criticise front-line workers.  There is a political attraction for all of us in interpreting what the Taoiseach said.  To be fair, he referred to workforce planning and the availability of staff.  Deputy O'Reilly touched on that issue in the context of diagnostic staff.  I am not speaking for the Taoiseach; he is a very articulate man and well able to outline his views.  I do not wish to interpret what he said.  There is a point to be made, however, which a lot of people accept - regardless of whether we like it  - that some steps can be taken to improve workflow and patient flow at different times.  I refer, for example, to circumstances where a lot of people might come into an acute hospital and diagnostic services might not be available because they only operate between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.  If diagnostic services were available for longer, more procedures could be performed.  There is merit to that and a bit of focus on it would be welcome.  The Taoiseach was certainly not criticising front-line staff.</p> <p>  The Deputy inquired about bed capacity.  The bed capacity is to be achieved over ten years.  The figure of 319 is for one year.  The question that arises relates to how to get to 3,200 beds over a period of ten years.</p> <p>  Reference was made to outpatient appointments and new people coming in.  The do-not-shows constitute only one part of that.  We hope that 30,000 will be eliminated from that list when it is tidied up.  We are working towards the Sl&aacute;intecare plan to bring the care to the lower level whereby people can be treated at primary care centres.  That is probably the answer to the Deputy's question on how we intend to deal with the new clients who will come onto the list, as well as those who have been waiting a long time.</p></speech>

That is part of the central validation process whereby it is necessary to write to people to ask if they are still waiting for appointments, if they are still want them or if they no longer need them.  The letters to the GPs have to be issued.  This is because, having been informed of initial dates for appointments, they must be apprised of the up-to-date position.</p></speech>

Essentially, it is trying to get to the bottom of the matter as regards those who do not attend appointments.  There is a little inconvenience for everybody involved because people and their GPs are receiving additional letters.  If we want to be fair, improve accessibility and get more people into the system, then we must do this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1262" speakername="Margaret Murphy O'Mahony" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018111400002#L01200"><p>Could the letters state that it is important the person attends his or her appointment?  The letter could ask the person to refer back if he or she does not wish to attend on the date appointed.  The wording currently used in the letters puts people under pressure.  People are saying "Maybe I am not too bad, I will give someone else a chance."  The wording could be better.</p></speech>

I am aware that it may be an administrative pain for the GPs but it is a pain that I believe may be worthwhile.  If we could bear with it to get the do-not-attends removed, we could get those lists down.  If we have 500,000 people not showing up for appointments and then a number of people who are on the list who do not need to be there, we could tidy up our figures.  The overall objective is approved.  I appreciate what the Deputy has said about the language, and we can see that, but it is certainly not to put pressure on people; it is just to ascertain the fact that a person had looked for an appointment 18 months and if he or she is still looking for that appointment.</p></speech>

I am very familiar with Lisheens House and I am aware that the Deputy had raised the matter in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  I had just left the D&aacute;il and I was not aware that the Deputy was about to raise the matter.  I thought that Questions on Promised Legislation had concluded.</p><p>Last Friday, I met with the people of Lisheens House.  I am well aware of and appreciative of that facility.  Contrary to popular belief locally, section 39 funding is administered by the HSE, not by me.  The people at Lisheens House were certainly of that view.  I allocate to the HSE and it allocates to organisations.  When I looked at the number of organisations that are availing of funding for mental health, the heading under which Lisheens House comes, there are 1,050 different organisations in receipt of funding from the HSE.  Ultimately, that funding comes from the Department's budget.  There is no question about the number of organisations - 1,050 in total - that are in receipt of this money.  We have to have corporate governance and clinical governance.  I have explained this to the people at Lisheens House.  In order to avail of funding from the HSE, it is not just a case of simply requesting it.  Organisations must comply with certain responsibilities <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>-----</p></speech>

They began an engagement with the mental health side, which they did not see through.  They then went over to the primary care side to seek funding in respect of counselling.  Again, there was an issue regarding the amount and availability of information they were supplying to the HSE.  I stand over the HSE's right to obtain a clinical evaluation of any service that is provided, be it in mental, physical or any other health area.  Lisheens House accepts that in full and is now going to have its service's evaluated.  It will also have the clinical side evaluated.  We cannot just distribute money, regardless of whether it is in my constituency or any other.  There is no facility whereby we can just distribute money to an organisation based on someone saying it is a great organisation and doing well.</p></speech>

Before I go to Deputy Durkan, I have a number of questions, the first of which is directed to Mr. Breslin and Mr. Connaghan.</p><p>Invariably, the HSE service plan, which will be produced in the next several weeks, will not deliver because of budget overruns of up to &euro;700 million like this year.  What guarantee can be given that the service plan will come in on target next year?  Several weeks ago, Mr. Stephen Mulvany explained to the committee the various components of the overrun, such as demographics, unforeseen events, etc.  Surely these events are factored into the service plan.</p><p> I understand the planning for the winter initiative is well under way.  Surely, the plan should be well advanced by, if not delivered prior to, 1 December.  I take it the HSE anticipates the winter coming and the plan should be developed long before the period it will cover.  Why has it taken so long this year to develop the winter initiative, as opposed to other years?</p><p> Mr. John Connaghan said the trolley numbers have been decreasing from the first quarter of this year compared to those for last year.  That is not the case with the figures I have been calculating.  The trolley count has gone up month on month, year on year.  There is no reduction in the number of people on trolleys month on month since the beginning of this year.  Is the HSE using different figures to those produced by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, in its trolley watch?</p><p> The number of people waiting for inpatient treatment has fallen from 86,000 to 72,000.  How many of those have been actual treatments as opposed to validating people who no longer require treatment?</p><p> We have discussed Sl&aacute;intecare time out of number here.  There seems to be a significant lack of urgency with the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  One aspect specifically is the 2,600 beds which are to come on stream over the next ten years through the national development plan.  Those beds are also identified in Sl&aacute;intecare.  It will be 2021 before there is any move in building new beds.  There are 240 beds, plus 79 more, coming on stream in the next number of months.  These will be so far down the line that it seems inconceivable that our demographics will be able to be accommodated within the current bed structure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.415" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Breslin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018111400002#M00200"><p>It is regrettable the Supplementary Estimate is the size it is this year.  I would not accept, however, that it is &euro;700 million every year.  We were here last year with a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;195 million.  In fairness to the HSE, significant parts of that were due to centrally made decisions.  For example, &euro;75 million of the figure from last year's Supplementary Estimate involved bringing forward the national pay agreement.  There will be times the Government makes a decision to take a policy initiative or on pay which imposes costs on the HSE.  The Government then proposes to the Oireachtas that such decisions must be funded.</p> <p>  A Supplementary Estimate is not unique to the HSE.  It happens across the public service.  The HSE is the largest funded organisation in the State.  When it has those issues, it involves hundreds of millions of euro when for other Departments it may involve tens of millions of euro.</p> <p>  That does not take away from the regret that I have about the &euro;700 million this year.  That is substantially beyond any type of margin around the Government making decisions over and above what is in the service plan.  Some of that is due to subsequent decisions made by the Government.  The slippage this year is beyond what we had planned for and what we expected.  We are advanced in the process with the HSE of developing the service plan for next year.  The objective is that we develop a service plan that is fully funded, not one that is partially funded.</p> <p>  I have spoken to the Chairman before about Sl&aacute;intecare.  From where he is sitting, it might look like a lack of urgency.  From where I sit, I see people running to get Sl&aacute;intecare implemented.  I see the executive director for Sl&aacute;intecare putting a significant focus on it.  I see the teams across the Department and the HSE putting a significant focus into getting Sl&aacute;intecare done.  The implementation plan for next year, which will be developed next month, will show in a practical way what the milestones are.  I am confident that we will have significant milestones delivered next year.  One of the areas we will be able to show form on is one that the Chair has always raised when we have been before the committee, namely putting a framework in place for general practice which will start to modernise it, make it more sustainable and attract people to work in that area.  I am confident that this will start to bear fruit.</p> <p>  The Chairman referred to the 240 and the other 79 beds.  We will make decisions with the HSE on further bed capacity to be introduced in 2019-2020 over and above that.  There will be further beds to be introduced.  It is worth reflecting on the fact that the bed capacity report stated that without reform, we will need more than 7,000 beds.  It is not a bed capacity report which is about 260 beds.  It is a bed capacity report which references 2,600 beds but with significant reform as to how we are currently organised and how resources are distributed to clients.</p> <p>  Coming back to what Deputy Donnelly asked earlier, this is not the most effective and efficient way to organise a health service.  Sl&aacute;intecare shows us how we not only right-size the health service but how we change how it is organised.  Significant change is required.  We will have to shift our health service away from acute-focused and episodic service into one that is preventive and works with people on diseases to avoid acute presentations.  If we do not get that right, we will not be able to tackle the demographic challenges we face.  We will have plans for further bed capacity.  Like the GP framework, we also have to strongly support and plan the shift in resources that we will need to ensure more integrated care with less focus on beds as the only part of the solution.</p></speech>

There is more than just one plan here.  There is as much of a constraint in attracting and retaining workforce inside Ireland to be able to crew up for those additional beds and the capacity we need as there is in terms of finding the capital to actually make all of this happen.  It is important we understand that it accounts for whole system planning around this.</p> <p>  As regards trolley counts, the INMO calculates things differently.  I have the HSE figures for July, August and September to hand.  In July, the HSE figures were down 2.7%, in August, down 4.6%, and in September, down 4.6%.  I know the October figures are likely to be down around the same percentage but have not yet been released.</p></speech>

Due to the fact there was a surge at the start of the year, performance also disimproved at the start of the year.</p><p>Mr. Connaghan is correct that, once we reached the summer, we could see that we were below last year's trends.  If one looks at the year to date, we are still behind last year.</p></speech>

Patient experience time is the number of people on trolleys for more than six hours, or in an emergency department for more than four hours or 24 hours.  That is a better measure.  Most other jurisdictions use the patient experience time to mark what they are doing regarding the provision of emergency care.</p></speech>

The numbers have reduced from 86,000 to 72,000.  What proportion of that reduction has been validation and not treatment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.428" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Connaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018111400002#N00500"><p>It is my impression that most of those are treatments.  We are at a 16% reduction overall since July 2017 with a 32% reduction in the number of those waiting for the longer periods.  The purpose of the NTPF and the HSE strategy in that time period was to target those who were waiting the longest.  I do not have the figures here, but my impression is that most of those were treatments rather than removals and that probably stands up because the validation exercises took place after that time.</p></speech>

I am conscious of other members offering, and they may ask the same question but I will come back to it, if they do not.</p></speech>

I worry about the deployment of personnel, an issue I have raised on many occasions in the past.  </p> <p>  To what extent does the deployment of staff, resources and equipment within the health services in general and in public hospitals have an impact on the delivery of services?  Second, the structures for the delivery of services are wrong.  I have also raised this issue on numerous occasions.  This has not been addressed and I hope it will be.  For example, if there are 20,000 on the waiting lists, what do we do about it?  Do we start by doing a calculation of how long it will take to clear the waiting list?  How many more people will have joined the waiting list in the intervening period?  Do we decide on a strategy to clear the 20,000 independently of whatever else is happening and deal with the cohort of patients as they arrive on the scene?  I have said many times previously that there is no need for waiting listing at all, other than minimum waiting lists.  There is no basis for having a two, three, four, five or six-month waiting list.  We rely on the long list and how it will take to deal with it.  One can do a calculation at any time and say it will take five years before that patient will be dealt with or six years, depending on the emergency cases that come through in the meantime.  That is the problem.  Has an audit been done to identify the deficiencies in the system that slow down the throughflow of patients?  I know the answer because I received a reply to a parliamentary question yesterday as promised.  There were 102,000 staff employed in the HSE, and that has increased to 135,000.</p></speech>

Where have the increased number of staff been deployed?  Have they been deployed in the areas most in need of additional staff?</p> <p>  From my time in public life, there have been long periods where we have been told by experts that we needed less hospital beds.  That was a mantra up to seven or eight years ago.  I do not know why that was the case, but it was.  The needs of people would be addressed in a different way so fewer beds were required.  That did not work.  In the case of crowded corridors and patients on trolleys in the reception areas of hospitals, can we be assured that there is no vacant space in decommissioned wards in the same hospitals and-or can we ascertain at this stage the extent to which plans are afoot to provide accommodation adjacent to those hospitals, having regard to the experience in the past number of years, particularly in regard to the winter initiative?  There is no sense in moaning about it if we do not do something about it and there are ways and means of providing emergency accommodation if it has to be done in the vicinity of hospitals.  If there are facilities that can be used, then that should be done.</p> <p>  The Chairman referred to the INMO and the HSE calculations of trolley waiting times.  We should be let into the secret of who is telling the truth.  Somebody is not accurate and we need to know about it, otherwise the entire health services are being damaged as a result of the inability to deal with a simple issue.</p></speech>

We are not confusing the Deputy because the first question from Senator Colm Burke sets out both figures.  If somebody is working half time, two people are employed to cover the week.  If those two people leave and one person is employed to work full time, that is still one whole-time equivalent.  That is the number used to express whole-time equivalents.  There is also a figure for how many people have employment in the health service and that is the figure the Deputy has, which stands at 135,000.</p></speech>

I would like to be clear.  I am trying to find out exactly how many people were employed in the health services in 2014 or 2015 and to compare the number with how many people are employed now.  There has been a considerable increase, ranging from 25% to 28%.  That has to make a difference.  That should be reflected in the delivery of the services to the public.</p> <p>  I went down through the list supplied in response to my parliamentary question carefully.  I was much more careful than people might think.  There was a good number of consultants at various levels, some to a greater extent than others.  There are blanks in the system where there has been no major improvement, and we are not progressing in the way we should.</p><p>Although some deny it is the case, we pay top dollar for health services in this country.  That is not a reflection on those who deliver the health services but, rather, the methodology of delivery.  Unless we find what is wrong and slowing down the system, we will be doing the same thing here in five years time and this situation will never be resolved.</p></speech>

As stated, 103,000 whole-time equivalents were employed in 2014 and 116,000 in September 2018.  The Deputy referred to the number of personnel employed, which was 121,000 in 2014 and is now 135,000.

Obviously, lifestyle is an issue and some staff choose to work half-time or part-time such that it takes two or three people to fill a whole-time equivalent post.  That is the difference we are trying to highlight.  We must keep control of the narrative: the figure has not increased from 103,000 to 135,000.  We must ensure that there is clarity on the number of full-time weekly salaries being paid, which is 116,000.  That is probably the best figure to use because people are entitled to job share and it is an option which is being increasingly availed of by staff and accommodated by the HSE.  However, we do not want that to be used to distort the change.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked where the positions are being filled.  Many of the positions must be filled in the front line where we are constantly struggling.  Obviously, there is also an administrative aspect.  We should note the very significant annual increases in the number of procedures being carried out by the HSE and the number of people going through the system.  Those are probably the measures at which we should be looking rather than the number of people employed in the healthcare system.</p></speech>

Of our total pay cost, only approximately 4.5% to 5% goes on agency staff.  It varies depending on the section of the health sector involved.  That is not to diminish the fact that in many cases we would like to lower our reliance on agency staff.  Approximately 95% of the overall pay bill does not go on agency staff.</p></speech>

In the case of some medical staff it depends on where in the country the vacancy is and what the market is like.  The premium can be from 20% and it can be significantly higher.  It is in our interest and something we should pursue constantly, which is trying to limit the number of agency staff we use, get the best price for agency workers.  It is not just for financial reasons.  Obviously there are continuity of care reasons we would prefer to have a lower reliance on agency staff.  There is always a case where agency staff may make sense for the short term.  It is when we become reliant on it in the long term that it becomes problematic.  It is a problem in certain areas of the service.  We have been upfront about that.</p></speech>

These plans are based on the concept of additionality or what extra we can feasibly put into the system.  That is where NTPF comes in because it is funded to create that additionality over and above what the Irish healthcare system can provide.</p> <p>  On the audits of the flow of patients through the system, several initiatives are under way in various parts of the country.  Such work is very well clinically supported, particularly in places such as Galway, Cork and some Dublin hospitals.  It might be of interest to the Deputy that in several past committees Deputies asked about how to spread best practice throughout the system, which underlies much of Deputy Durkan's question.  We very recently compiled a best practice guide which takes the best of what we do in the Irish healthcare system.  It is now available to all.  If something is working well in Clonmel, for example, the rest of the country should be able to learn from that.  We have published a directory of best practice for the first time.  It contains more than 300 current examples.  It surprised me that we were able to gather so many in such a short space of time.  It is available on our website for all staff.  In 2019 we will be considering what we can do to support the spread of such good practices using some of the additional funds we have been allocated as part of the national service plan.</p></speech>

I have some questions for Mr. Connaghan and others relating to the CervicalCheck issue which could be answered by Mr. McCallion or Mr. Connaghan.  This will be a quick-fire round because we only have a certain amount of time for questions.</p> <p>  Is Mr. Connaghan considering any structural changes of the directorates under him in the HSE?  If so, what are they?  My question on winter planning has been addressed so I do not wish to spend time on it except to say that the fact we do not have a plan is crazy.  What is the timeline for the development of the new rapid-build units in Limerick and Clonmel?</p> <p>  When will the agreement be signed with the relevant drug company in regard to Respreeza?  This matter has been going on for over a year.  I have spoken publicly about a neighbour of mine named Marian Kelly - no relation - who died after being taken off the drug.   Last week her daughter met the Minister, Deputy Harris, in Nenagh when he was opening a facility there.  I understand a deal is very close.  Her children wish to honour their mother by ensuring that every person who needs this drug will receive it.  When will the agreement be signed?  The response from the HSE on this issue has not been very good in terms of communication.</p> <p>  Will the HSE consider decentralising recruitment for 2019?  The centralisation of recruitment up to a certain level is taking too long and is not a good idea.  I have been contacted by qualified people seeking nursing jobs who want to work and stay in Ireland but cannot work for the HSE because the process takes too long.  In one case of which I am aware a person who wishes to work in a region has been waiting six months for a post.  I have also had this verified in other ways.  Could recruitment up to a certain level be decentralised in the regions?  It would work better and I ask the witnesses to consider it.</p> <p>  I asked Mr. McCallion some brief questions on cervical screening in another forum last week.  On the 20-week wait for screening, It was confirmed to me that women triaged as requiring screening possibly within six months are in the same boat as women seeking a triennial check-up and the HSE cannot distinguish between the two groups.  That could have a negative medical impact on women's lives.  A person for whom a check-up within six months has been recommended and another who is seeking a three-yearly smear test will both experience a 20-week delay.  The different categories should be distinguished and prioritised according to need.  I raised this issue last week and received a very honest response which was one of the best I have received at a committee.  However, the issue must be dealt with and I ask Mr. Connaghan to confirm that the HSE is doing so.</p> <p>  I seek some basic facts regarding the 221 women.  How many are, unfortunately, deceased; how many are in the middle of treatment; and how many are post-cancer?  I am seeking a breakdown of the total number of smears those women had and the labs in which those smears were read.  The fact that we have been waiting over six months for this information is unacceptable and does not breed confidence.  When will the audit recommence?  It is not good enough that it has stopped.  All the variables have stayed the same.</p><p>From 1 January onwards, with all the variables staying the same and with no audit, it means that <i>pro rata</i>, more women are being affected in some way.  When will it commence again and how will the HSE deal with that?<br/><br/>I appreciate that Mr. McCallion gave me information last week and he may have an update this week on why it is taking so long.  I do not want to misquote him and am open to correction but I believe he said it was 22 days on average.  It turns out that many women are waiting three to four months to get their slides.  There is a breakdown here somewhere.  What is it and why are women waiting so long?<br/><br/>With regard to the impact of the Scally report, what action has Mr. Connaghan taken outside of the recommendations made by Dr. Scally?  I understand the HSE will implement all the recommendations.  I refer to issues concerning the burden of duty in the laboratories and note that cases are being settled by the laboratories because there was a burden of duty.  I asked the State Claims Agency a question last week about how many cases involved negligence.  In cases where we are aware of an issue with the laboratory, why are the laboratories not being inspected by the HSE?  Under any other normal contractual relationship, in cases where there was a known issue with a laboratory, it would be inspected.  Those are my questions and I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

I will also fling in the importance of making sure that clinicians are involved in decision making around the clinical director development programme.</p> <p>  Respreeza has passed our leadership team meeting yesterday.  We have one more meeting to go, which will take place next Tuesday, and without prejudging what that meeting's decision might be, I will give the Deputy a positive vibe that we will be coming to the right decision at that point in time.  The Respreeza decision will be made next Tuesday.</p> <p>  Structural changes need to be considered, as with any change, by the new board and the new director general.  It would not be right for me to think about any structural changes in the interim.  When they are in post, they need to be comfortable with the future structure of the HSE.</p></speech>

The outermost delay was 76 days and the average was 22 days.  That is not acceptable.  We had subsequent requests for slides on Friday, Monday and Tuesday of this week, which comprise a further 30 or so requests.  We have written to the laboratories stating we expect them to be able to turn these around in less than ten working days at a maximum.  They must take the image and they must get all the logistics sorted out, including adhering to the protocol.  A number of requests came in on Friday, Monday and Tuesday and that may have related to concerns of a number of individual women or families.  Our objective now it to ensure the laboratories achieve that within the target.</p> <p>  On some of the members' other points, last week we discussed how we might triage and prioritise given the backlog.  We have managed to prioritise the colposcopies because of the nature of the way the cases are identified.  As I said to the committee last week, it is much more complex and is proving difficult to differentiate between out-of-cycle and in-cycle tests.  If we could do that within the in-cycle, it would be a much better way to do it.</p></speech>

At that point a woman is in diagnosis or potentially in treatment.</p> <p>  With regard to the 221 women and their families and next of kin who are impacted by the original audit, the audit by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, RCOG, was intended to audit the clinical status of those cases.

Overall the consent rate is quite good at this stage and is close to 60%.  It is 57% at the moment and this will continue.  We still have to contact the next of kin, and there are people who will come in later and who are still contacting us.  Overall the rate of consent is good, but within the 221 cases of women who were affected, it is just 31%.  All of this information is being pulled together because patients are interested in it and it also has a general public interest.  Primarily, however, it is patients and patient representatives who are interested in terms of planning the supports for those people.  We have spoken to them and we intend to get one of our healthcare audit team members to undertake the clinical status and the factual position.  The RCOG audit is a much more comprehensive audit and will look at the smear tests, the colposcopies and the treatment options.  It is a much further clinical review.  We will do that and we intend to have it done this side of Christmas.  It will take a number of weeks to do it.  The original intention, and the reason we were not doing it was because that was the purpose of the RCOG audit.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.483" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Damien McCallion" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018111400002#P02100"><p>Yes.  We can perhaps recap on all the questions in respect of specifics but our intention is to confirm the clinical position of each of the women who were part of the original audit, so we are clear.  If there are particular pieces within that perhaps we can make sure but our priority is to link with the patients and with the hospitals and make sure we have a comprehensive picture.  Obviously it will anonymised when feeding it back.</p> <p>  The Deputy's last point was about the breakdown of the figures in respect of the 221 women.  I had mentioned this previously in response to an earlier question.  One of the challenges for us is we have not had a cytopathologist in the programme.  This issue was recognised by Dr. Scally as a deficit.  We saw this ourselves and the HSE tried to recruit for that position even prior to Dr. Scally's report.  We have been unsuccessful in that and we have gone twice to recruit.  I am now in discussions with a person overseas about coming to Ireland and taking up a contract here.  That is crucial in getting the breakdown because, for example, within the 221 women who have been impacted, many had multiple smear tests that went to multiple laboratories over different time periods.  The laboratories that were used in Ireland in the earlier stages would have detected higher rates of abnormalities because they were detecting more cervical cancers in the early stage of the programme.  We need a cytopathologist to do that work.  While I am trying to conclude recruiting a person on a full-time basis this is an ongoing need and not just for the audit issue.  I have also managed to source a person, again from outside the State, who will undertake that specific piece of work over the next four or five weeks.  We intend to conclude that work separately over the next four to five weeks.  We will also have that done on this side of Christmas.</p> <p>  I flag for the committee the fact that the recruitment around that core resource has been very challenging.  This cytopathology need is crucial for a programme such as cervical screening.</p></speech>

Audits of interval cancers of all three cancer screening programmes are just one component of a broad quality assurance programme.  We note Dr. Scally's endorsement and his encouragement to people to partake in the programmes.  They are population based and it is very important that people continue to attend in order that the programmes can reach their stated purpose of detecting cancer earlier and reducing cancer morbidity.</p> <p>  We also note that Dr. Scally stated the audit where this all began was flawed in its design and implementation.  It is very important for us that when we restart the process of audit, we get the design absolutely right from the outset for all three cancer screening programmes and not just for cervical screening.  We have secured a chairperson and a group.  The chairperson is a prominent cancer specialist who has worked in Canada and in Ireland.  I expect that she will start her work in the near future.  Our aim is to establish principles for audit in all three cancer screening programmes that are robust and patient-centred and which address the flaws that were shown by the cervical screening controversy and through the Scally report.</p></speech>

One aspect concerns process.  In many ways, that is arguably the easier step.  When the implementation plan in response to the recommendations is shown, one will see how it is broken down.  We have gone well beyond the basic recommendations because it involves the wider actions we need to take to support better processes in the HSE.  The hardest bits concern cultures, values and behavioural change.  I would be happy sometime in the future to give the committee a short paper on what we are doing around values and action, as well as how we intend to spread that to clinical staff.  I am happy that we have several doctors on board with a clinical aspect to values and action.  We need to work on this and it is harder than process actions.</p></speech>

I also thank the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, for attending to deal with our questions.</p> <p>  A new acute hospital for Cork is proposed in the national development plan.  A committee was set up to help identify a site but my understanding is that it has not yet met.  Even to identify a site is going to take some time.  I am concerned about the growth of population in Cork.  It has gone up by over 130,000 people in a short time.  Even if we start a new hospital in the morning, the population increase in Cork will be between 160,000 and 170,000 people.  This will put significant pressure on Cork's existing hospitals.  Can we be provided with a timeline for the hospital's construction?  From the initial identifying of a suitable site to the planning process thereafter could take up to two to three years.  I want this to be moved on.  Nothing seems to have happened on this issue so far.</p> <p>  On staffing numbers in the HSE, the number of nurses in real terms from December 2014 to December 2018 will have increased by 629.  At the same time, the number of nurse managers has increased by 1,093, going from 6,602 to 7,695.  The number of whole-time equivalent consultants has increased by 397.  Is there a detailed plan as regards recruitment in the HSE and strategy?  I am concerned that management and administration has gone from 15,112 to 18,131, an increase of 3,019.  This is now higher than it ever was prior to the cutbacks.  We do not seem to be able to get people on the front line, however.</p> <p>  Agency doctors have cost &euro;110 million in the past 12 months.  We could actually recruit 500 additional consultants at a higher pay than what is being offered at the moment.  Using &euro;110 million to pay 500 consultants would mean a salary of &euro;220,000 per consultant.  We have a figure where it is not attractive for people to come back, in particular to Dublin with the cost of housing.  Will we review this?  If so, when?  When will a package be provided that will have a far better return as regards having permanent people employed rather than agency staff members who we do not know from one month to the next if they will be there or not?</p> <p>  Mr. Jim Breslin said we need to move away from an over-reliance on the hospital system.  Part of the solution to that relates to GP services.  Where are we with the GP contracts issue?  It is a concern among general practitioners, particularly regarding how they do not know how to plan the development of their practice over the next three to four years.  These contract negotiations have been going on for quite a long time.  I pulled out one of my press releases recently, dated August 2016, in which I was looking for the contract negotiations to be fast-tracked.  Two years later, we do not seem to have made progress.  I am concerned that, on the one hand, we do not burden the hospitals but, on the other, when we need people on the front line, we do not encourage them to provide the service we require.</p></speech>

The population of Cork, as Senator Colm Burke outlined, has grown significantly but the health service has not grown in the region to meet its needs, most certainly from an acute hospital bed point of view.  We have secured funding in the national development plan to develop to deliver a new acute hospital for Cork but also elective-only hospitals for Cork, Galway and Dublin.  This will have a significant transformational effect on the delivery of scheduled care and improvements to our waiting lists.  The director general of the HSE recently brought me to Scotland  where we looked at how its elective-only model has transformed its waiting lists.  This was part of the process for developing our elective-only models here.</p> <p>  Once we have finalised the capital plan with the HSE in the coming weeks, I will work with the Department to put a structure in place to advance the preparatory work that the Senator identified needs to be done.  I hope by year end that we could have a clear outline as to what that preparatory work looks like, who will do it, as well as what responsibility lies with the Department in terms of policy formation and with the HSE and the hospital groups in terms of delivering it on the ground.</p> <p>  On the issue of the GP contract, we are not talking about this in an abstract concept.  Negotiations are going on every week.  There are GP contract negotiations taking place in my Department with the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO.  Both sides have said publicly that they want these talks to conclude by the end of this year.  I expect that they will.  We have a sizeable sum of money to invest in general practice on a multi-annual basis, agreed with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, myself and the Taoiseach.  This is a level of investment which will enable us to make general practice sustainable.  General practice has rightly said that it has suffered cuts, FEMPI cuts and so forth, through successive Governments during the economic recession.  We need to move beyond that and address it in terms of sustainability.  Second, we must examine how general practitioners, if resourced to do so, can do more procedures which are currently done in hospital settings, specifically around the whole area of chronic disease management.  Third, there is the whole area of access.  The Oireachtas signed off on the Sl&aacute;intecare plan, which wants to see many more people access GP care either for free or at low cost.</p><p>How can we do more to improve on access, chronic disease management and sustainability?  I hear people misrepresent my position on this regularly, suggesting that my officials and I are only talking to general practitioners about doing more and giving them more resources to do more.  People who make that argument intentionally ignore what I have just said, that a very important part of that conversation is about the sustainability of the existing services and the resources that are required to do fulfil the role.  I expect those discussions to conclude by the end of the year.  It is a very exciting piece of work and has taken far longer anybody than would have wanted, particularly far longer than GPs would have wanted.  This significant piece of work is potentially transformational for the health service and is very much in line with Sl&aacute;intecare and I look forward to it concluding.</p><p> I will ask Mr. Connaghan to deal with the staff recruitment measures.  Senator Colm Burke and I engage on issues regularly enough at this committee, but I need to make this point.  Sometimes when our discussions on managers and administrators are reported there is a suggestion that such staff bring no added value to the health service.  Of course, that is not the case.  Many of the questions, such as parliamentary questions, and the issues raised in Topical Issue and Commencement matter debates are about how we manage our outpatient clinic appointment.  When we put more staff into outpatient clinics, they might be counted as administrative staff but they are very much helping to play a front-line role.  We should do further work on explaining the value individuals who work very hard add to our health service.  I will now pass over to Mr. Connaghan.</p></speech>

The Senator is correct that we should be prudent about spending any money that takes away from front-line services.  Let me make members aware that we have a business case process for the appointment of any senior executive or manager and such appointments are the subject of a very vigorous business case and the approval process is shared with the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform.  Members have commented on the growth in staff numbers in recent years.  We have created delegated units in community healthcare organisations, CHOs, and in hospital groups and it is important that we staff these appropriately in terms of governance.</p> <p>  It is useful to refer to other countries in terms of a comparison with where we are.  The experience in the NHS in England is that the senior management cohort is about 5% of senior and middle management and that compares exactly with the current Irish figure.  The percentage of very senior managers in the HSE is less than 1%.</p> <p>  I will take up the point the Minister just raised about where administrative and clerical staff take on tasks that used to be done by clinicians.  There is a scarcity in some clinical specialties and it makes sense to try to divert some of the non-direct clinical services task to the administrative and clerical function.  That is a good thing because it allows clinicians to run at the top of their licence.</p> <p>  Let us look into the future.  We have just been allocated &euro;250 million from the European Investment Bank to bring forward our plans to create more in the way of electronic healthcare records.  In order to bring that forward, we will have to add some of the specialists, the programmers, the system developers and the support staff.  That might be for a transitory period but as I look into 2019 and through to 2021, I anticipate some growth in the management posts to enable that to happen.</p> <p>  I will ask Dr. Colm Henry to say a brief word on recruitment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.495" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018111400002#R00300"><p>Like many other European countries, we face significant challenges with medical recruitment.  The European Commission has predicted that in the entire European Union, there will be a shortfall of 1 million healthcare staff by 2020.  We are not alone in facing medical recruitment difficulties.  One of the difficulties we face is that we have to recruit for unscheduled care in 29 sites.  There can be no break in unscheduled care once we have announced we have unscheduled care, be it in obstetrics, paediatrics, medicine, surgery or anaesthetics, and there has to be staff ready to see and care for patients.  That explains to some degree our dependency on agency and locums because such a service by definition is unbroken.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan made a point earlier about the way people work.  Sl&aacute;intecare is a critical enabler.  We are changing the way people work now.  The deputy director general of operations and I attended a meeting earlier this week, a conference of health and social care professionals who demonstrated how innovative staff are.  They are not just hard working but they brought in initiatives in Beaumont Hospital, in Kilkenny and in the community where they are working, outside their traditional boundaries and bringing Sl&aacute;intecare into practice before it is being implemented.  That is happening through the innovation of our staff on the ground.</p></speech>

I want to discuss the recruitment and retention crisis and his views on what is happening.  Let me start with consultants.  We know one in five consultant posts is currently vacant and that a very small number of consultants are applying for vacant posts relative to ten years ago.  We know that in many hospitals it is becoming impossible to hire-in consultants particularly when more experienced consultants are needed.  We know there has been an increased use of locums, which has risen by one third between May and October of this year.  There are allegations that some of these locums are not as well qualified as consultants would be and obviously they can cost more money.  We know that several areas are now losing specialist services.  Let me give examples.  Kerry University Hospital is about to lose its only histopathologist, which puts cancer screening services, including CervicalCheck and many other surgical services, at risk.  My understanding is that Cork is not hiring additional resource and there is no plan in place yet to deal with this.  Tralee has recently lost its rheumatologist.  Patients are now being referred to Cork but at present there is a two year waiting list with 1,500 patients already waiting to be seen.  I am told that unless somebody has an extremely urgent case, there is no realistic plan to ever see them.  This week the hospital in Tralee lost its urologist and we are told that in Kerry, they are now struggling to get the locums for these posts.</p><p>We have discussed the situation in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children.  Children with scoliosis are waiting more than three years for operations.  In the urology department in St James's Hospital,  the waiting list for a routine appointment is now more than six years.  The list goes on and on.  We can talk about hospitals all over the country.  The scarcity of qualified consultants has now become so acute that they are beginning to shut down services for patients.  </p><p>There are also serious issues when it comes to nurses and midwives.  The INMO told me recently that it estimates that the services are now short approximately 175 midwives, which is a very large number.  Galway University Hospital has 16 operating theatres, five of which, that is, one third of the region's entire surgical throughput capacity for the only level four hospital in the area, are permanently closed.  The reason given to me for these closed surgical theatres is that they are not able to hire a relatively small number of theatre nurses.  We know agencies are paying nurses on the fifth point on the scale and an additional 20% on top of that.  Agencies are paying nurses 50% more, relative to a new entrant nurse in the public system.  The INMO, as I am sure the witnesses are acutely aware, is balloting for strike action, to include work stoppages, on Monday.  The INMO understands that a <i>de facto</i>moratorium on recruitment is now in place for the rest of this year due to budget constraints.  It told me that 57 nurses were meant to be hired to help support patients on trolleys in the upcoming winter crisis but they are now not being hired.</p><p>Does the Minister accept there is a crisis in recruitment and retention both for consultant posts and for nurses and midwives?  Does he accept that the new entrant pay equality discrepancy is a major driver of that crisis?  Why have talks not started with the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, which represents more than 90% of the consultants in the system?  The Irish Hospital Consultants Association says it has tried to meet the Minister and has been trying to meet officials for a year but cannot get any meaningful engagement.  Nurses and midwives have not gone on strike in nearly 20 years.</p><p>In the context of us spending more money on the health service than ever before, with considerable overruns, how has it been allowed to get so bad for nurses that they have got to the point where they feel they must ballot for strike action?  Will the Minister confirm whether there is a de facto moratorium on hiring for the rest of this year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.499" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018111400002#S00200"><p>I fully accept that the recruitment environment in the health service is challenging, and that we operate within a global labour market for many of these consultancy positions but also for nursing positions.  Highly educated consultants, nurses and midwives from Ireland are sought after in other countries and we operate very much in a global environment.  I do not accept the comments without a degree of context, however, because if I was take them without context it would suggest fewer consultants are working in the health service but that is not true.  An additional 115 consultants are working in the Irish health service compared with 12 months ago.  While I take the Deputy's point about there being much more to do despite the large number of vacant posts, which is a statement of fact beyond dispute, there were 115 more consultants working in the public health service in September 2018 than in September 2017.  Similarly, there are 523 more consultants working in the health service than five years ago.  Nonetheless, I accept there are challenges with the number of doctors working in the health service, as there are with nurses.</p> <p>  The issue of new entrant pay must be examined, just as it was examined within other elements of the public service.  The Public Service Pay Commission, PSPC is a structure we set up to examine the issue of recruitment and retention, and, in fairness, it was supported by the Deputy's party.  It made a number of suggestions, all of which were accepted by Government but it also found a further process should be considered as to how the State and consultants could engage on the issue of new entrant pay.  That decision is not one for me exclusively but rather for me with colleagues across Government, although I would like to see the issue advanced.</p> <p>  On the issue of consultants in Crumlin hospital which the Deputy raised, I would be happy to send some information on the matter to him and the committee.  The information suggests, as the Deputy also did, that pay is an issue but not the sole issue.  I recently met the Children's hospital group, which was able to tell me there has been a significant increase in the number of people who want to work as clinicians in our children's hospitals, which the group explains is partly because there will be &euro;1 billion in infrastructure that will give our clinicians more theatre space and better, modern facilities and research capacity.  When I meet consultants, as I do, they tell me that while pay is an element, being able to see their patients and ensuring their patients have beds and theatres are also elements.  </p> <p>  The issue of non-engagement with the IHCA is not borne out by fact.  My Department was represented at a ministerial level at its conference, at which I know the Deputy was also in attendance.  I am familiar with its issues.</p> <p>  On the INMO, there is ongoing engagement.  I hope we can find a way of resolving what is a brewing industrial relations dispute, but parties to the pay agreement undertook not to submit new pay claims during the duration of that agreement.  I do not mean to speak for Fianna F&aacute;il but I think it holds a similar position to the Government on the matter.  Parties to the public service stability agreement signed up to it and, as a result, are subject to the terms and conditions of it.  The PSPC wants to see additional resources put in the pockets of nurses, whether by allowances, resolving the new entrant pay issue or enabling them to become a senior staff nurse at an earlier point in their careers.  </p> <p>  While much more must be done to support our nurses, such as increased financial remuneration, we asked the PSPC, rather than a bunch of politicians, to examine how recruitment and retention in nursing can be fixed and it reverted with a series of recommendations.  The Government adopted them in full and wants to deliver on them in 2019.  In the budget architecture, the Deputy's party and mine agreed we have funded that.  I would like to engage with the INMO on other issues in the health service that could assist and support nurses in doing their jobs, as well as on many other matters that would be inappropriate for me to raise in this forum because discussions are ongoing.  There are other approaches, aside from pay, that I am sure could assist our nurses working in a challenging environment.</p></speech>

Does the Minister accept there is a crisis in recruitment and retention, either for nurses and midwives or consultants?  He accepted that new entrant pay is a driver of challenges, whether he accepts it is a crisis or not.</p> <p>  On the IHCA, I accept that the Minister intended to speak at its conference although the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, spoke on his behalf, but I am not talking about public events.  I am talking about meaningful engagement.  The Minister may disagree, but the association tells me it cannot get meaningful engagement from the Minister or the Department, and it has not been able to get it for more than a year.  </p> <p>  There is a crisis and people are suffering and dying while waiting to see doctors, but we are running out of doctors.  While the overall number may have risen, it is falling relative to the need, in view of the fact that one in five posts are not filled.  What does the Department propose to do as a result?  It feels as though there is no action, and as though there is a clearly identifiable problem, namely, running out of specialists across a variety of areas in a variety of hospitals, but it does not appear as though those representing consultants are being engaged with in any meaningful way.</p> <p>  On the nurses and midwives, I agree it is about more than pay and there are many issues.  Why has the situation got so bad in comparison with the past 20 years?  Why have they become so frustrated and demoralised that they are balloting for strike action, which they have not considered for decades?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.501" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018111400002#S00400"><p>On the final question, my understanding from INMO press statements and commentary on the matter is that nurses are balloting for industrial action because they would like to lodge a pay claim.  Regardless of the validity of that pay claim, and it is not for me to assess people's motives, the public service stability agreement is clear on pay claims during its duration.  Nurses believe they have a legitimate pay claim, the State has an infrastructure to deal with these matters and I hope everyone uses the processes available to them.  While there are clear mechanisms in place to resolve this, there are also measures that we want to take to help support our nurses.</p> <p>  I fully accept the conclusive and definitive outcome of their ballot, but I also accept that the INMO are members of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and public service pay agreements are in place, to which the Deputy's party and mine are subject.  We are committed to supporting these agreements and we need to operate within that infrastructure.  The nurses decided to take the view that their pay should be increased in a sectoral-specific way without considering the rest of the public service and the knock-on effects thereof.  That is their position and I cannot comment on why the nurses decided to take it, but I accept our nurses work in a challenging environment.  I also accept the recommendations of the PSPC, which would benefit many thousands of nurses, should be advanced as a priority, and that there is much more we need to do to help and support our nurses.  As Minister for Health, I would like to engage on what we can do within the health service separate to the process of public service pay agreements.</p> <p>  Whether I used the word "crisis" or "challenge" is somewhat pedantic because whether I call it a crisis will not help or make a difference.  The former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, used to call things an emergency, but did that help or make a difference?  There is a real challenge in recruiting consultants, as there is in the retention of nurses and midwives, which the PSPC found.  As for what we should do, I suggest we adopt in full the findings of the PSPC, as we have done.  It made findings and recommendations which we should get on with implementing.  We committed to doing that and we are funded to do it in 2019.  We must also explore how we establish the process to look at the new entrant pay issue, which is not an issue exclusively in my remit.  I take an active interest in it, however, and I am partly responsible.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked what we will do to help, and there are other measures we can take.  In addition to what I outlined, we can also increase theatre capacity, build elective-only hospitals and provide more bed capacity, because we have found that when we invest in the physical infrastructure of our health service, and when we provide doctors and nurses with the tools and resources to do their jobs, they respond in kind by wanting jobs in that health service.</p><p>We are very much seeing that now in respect of the children's hospital group and I will send information to the committee illustrating that point.</p><p> I will return to the issue of engagement with consultant representative bodies, although I will not get into a back-and-forth on it here.  More than one body represents consultants.  Some are members of the IMO while others are members of the IHCA, neither of which is a union, as they remind me, as consultants have individual contracts with our health service.  My Department rightly spent a great deal of time in recent months, along with colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, resolving a major issue relating to consultants and the fulfilment of their contracts, which had in their view not been fulfilled or honoured in many years.  Mary Harney was Minister for Health at the time the issue arose and it continued until we resolved it this time.  That resulted in a significant cost to the State but it was the right thing to do.  The notion that there has not been meaningful engagement is not correct.  We took what was probably the most challenging issue being put forward by the IHCA and successfully resolved it in recent months.</p></speech>

I cited the example of a third of GUH's operating theatres being shut because it cannot hire a handful of theatre nurses.  I have other examples across the system of hospitals incurring massive fixed costs, including staffing, with detrimental effects on patients and on doctors, who are getting increasingly frustrated with coming in on a Monday to find the operating theatre  closed.  Patients are brought in the night before, go through pre-op and are ready to go only to be told it is not available.  How is it that people like us can meet hospital staff and find this out, yet the HSE cannot identify the issues and definitively deal with them?</p> <p>  I have one follow-up question for the Minister on Mr. Justice Kelly's findings.  The Minister and I have been going back and forth in correspondence and he has pointed out that the HSE is reviewing its own recruitment and that he would examine the individual case.  I had made an additional request; I apologise if the Minister has come back to me on it but I have not seen a response yet.  Mr. Justice Kelly stated that there are wholly unsuitable persons working as doctors in our system, and that medical practitioners with little knowledge of the basics of medicine have been recruited to Irish hospitals.  Understandably, he is saying they pose a danger to patients.  I ask that the Minister, the Department or the HSE immediately conduct an audit.  If we have doctors, whether there are five or 50 of them, in the healthcare system with little knowledge of the basics of medicine, we need to find out who they are.  It is not about attacking them or anything like that but there is a patient protection issue here.  Given such a senior judge has said this, will the Minister undertake to commission an audit?  As a matter of urgency, he needs to find out not only how it is happening but also where these doctors are, if they currently pose a danger, and if we can help them, for example, through additional training.  We must protect patients if necessary from people who do not understand medicine, and it might be advisable to look back at case history to see if there are clusters of malpractice or patient safety incidents attached to doctors who may have little knowledge of the basics of medicine.</p></speech>

In light of the significant comments of Mr. Justice Peter Kelly and Deputy Donnelly's own correspondence with me, I wrote to the director general asking for an urgent response.  I received a significant volume of information, which I do not feel is appropriate to share in a public forum, about one individual.  I have been provided with information and assurance of a system that is largely - I want to decouple what I am going to say here - a system that took swift action when an issue came to light.  In respect of a doctor who was working in a hospital for a very short number of days under supervision at all times at a very junior level, the proper procedures were followed very quickly and we know where that case ended up in terms of the Medical Council complaint.</p> <p>  I want to say to people watching, to people using our health services and to doctors in our health services that almost 23,000 doctors are registered with the Medical Council.  In 2017, the last year for which figures are available, there were approximately 300 complaints and three doctors were struck off the medical register.  The idea that there is a widespread of issue of doctors, whom I have heard referred to as rogue doctors, wandering around our hospitals is not borne out by evidence.  There is an issue, though, which Mr. Justice Kelly and the Deputy have rightly highlighted, in respect of our recruitment process and making sure there are learnings from this case.  I can assure him that in respect of the composition of the interview board, references and the use of a scoring technique, all the proper procedures were followed.  This doctor was placed on a panel and called to fill a post.  He was supervised at all times and when it became clear that he still lacked the competencies that were required, swift action was taken.</p> <p>  I have taken appropriate action.  I have written to the HSE and received correspondence back, which I will consider in full.  I will also consider the process which the HSE might now outline and which they are undergoing in respect of reforming the recruitment model.  I will also meet the Medical Council specifically on this issue.  I am scheduled to meet council representatives shortly; I will confirm the date with the Deputy.  The Medical Council has also highlighted its concerns to the HSE.  There is an issue we need to fix here in respect of the recruitment process, not just in this matter but also in the general streamlining of our recruitment processes.  I very much accept the Deputy's bona fides and do not believe it is what he wished to suggest, but to announce a widespread audit would cause undue concern and it would be disproportionate.  I very much welcome the IMO's comments in this regard last weekend.  The appropriate thing to do is review the case, which I have done, make sure learnings are applied across the HSE and that the recruitment model is reformed, and meet the Medical Council.  If, after that, I believe further action is required, I will take it.  It might be useful to hear from Dr. Colm Henry as the chief clinical officer of the HSE on this matter.</p></speech>

It is important to assure members of the public who might have concerns arising from this case.  Of our complement of junior doctors in the system, approximately half are in training schemes and they are recruited through training colleges.  There is a solid, robust basis for that and they are generally known to our system, having come through our medical schools and worked in our hospital system, and they have references from people we know.  We have a dependency on non-training doctors arising out of Working Time Directive compliance issues some years ago.  All junior doctors - and I say this from personal experience - undergo mentoring and supervision appropriate not just to their level but to their background.  This case, about which we cannot go into too much detail, highlights how effective the mentoring and supervision can be.  The interview is one part of a process.  We cannot validate everybody's background and entire knowledge and experience based on a half-hour interview, no matter how thorough it might be.  If there are concerns and the candidate has come from a medical school with which the recruitment board members are not familiar and has references from people they do not know, he or she will be monitored closely because no senior doctor or consultant can afford to take risks when it comes to patient safety.  This particular case is unusual but it highlights how effective the mentoring and supervision was, in that concerns were brought to light quickly before there was any contact with patients.</p></speech>

It is a rational and good thing to do.  On a wider level, it is not just that we need to consider whether we have the staff.  We have just had that conversation.  We must also consider whether we have the beds and diagnostics to be able to back that up.  It is not just about taking a look at theatres.  I assure the Deputy that we have excellent oversight on this.  We have a national performance oversight group that goes into the detail of this on a monthly basis.  The Deputy can hear more about that if he wants from Ms O'Connor.  We also have the substructure beneath that of hospital groups and hospital chief executives who know precisely where they are in terms of the facilities they can bring onstream if they have everything put together to do so.</p></speech>

The last nurses' strike in which I was involved was in 2009 in Sligo. There one in Limerick that year and an all-out national strike.  I am sitting across from people who I am sure will fondly remember those times.</p><p>I love how the national wage agreement is selectively quoted, just as I did when I was a union official.  There is a clause in the agreement of which the Minister will be aware because I have told him about it several times.  Others will be aware of it also.  It states that the parties reserve the right to return to renegotiate the agreement in the event that circumstances change.  When circumstances changed several years ago, nurses, midwives, and every other worker in the health service, including those opposite, those agreements were renegotiated to facilitate a cut in pay.  No agreement is immune to renegotiation as I was often told by those who wanted to do so.</p><p>I would like to get some comfort from the witnesses on home care packages.  A lady named Margaret O'Reilly was on the radio yesterday.  She is a double amputee who is waiting on home care and home care support.  She and others, some of whom work in the health service and some who have told us confidentially, assert that the budget has been spent and there is no more money for home care packages between now and the end of the year.  Is this the practice?  People have told us that they not being allocated sufficient hours, and we could argue all day whether we can ever have enough hours.  Some of this information is anecdotal and I have put down parliamentary questions to get to the bottom of the matter but I would like confirmation on whether there has been an effective ban on additional home care packages because the money has run out.</p><p>Pay is central to recruitment and retention.  When INMO general secretary, Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha, appeared before the committee she disputed something Deputy Donnelly said.  She said:</p><blockquote>Irish nurses are not well paid by comparison.  We have international comparisons that are compiled not by us but by the International Council of Nurses, affiliated to the World Health Organization.  They clearly indicate that, out of the nine main countries that are English-speaking with western medical styles, Ireland's pay is the lowest.</blockquote> <p>That is borne out by the numbers of nurses who are graduating and leaving the country.  Pay must be central.  Mr. Mulvany and I have spoken previously about the conversion of agency staff into directly employed staff.  Are there targets for this?  If so, are they being reached?  Is there a money-saving target, or does it relate to personnel, that is, how is it being quantified?  What is the figure for targets that have been allocated for this year?  Have these been reached?  What will be allocated for next year?</p><p>I refer to consultants who are not on the specialist register but are being paid as consultants, which relates to an issue raised earlier.  I asked Ms Rosarii Mannion about this when she appeared before the committee on a previous occasion.  How many are there?  The witnesses must know.  There are a certain number working as consultants who are not on the specialist register and who are getting closer to a contract of indefinite duration by the day.  What is being done to ensure that they get the qualifications that mean they can be added to the specialist register?</p><p>The Taoiseach's comments about holidays were referred to earlier.  There was a specific reference to nurses and doctors which was offensive to them.</p><p>On access to diagnostics, is it the case that it is an issue of staff but rather than an unwillingness of staff to work out of hours?  My understanding is that there is an agreement in place going back to Towards 2016, which was in place from 2006, a section of which referred specifically to the operation of out-of-hours.  That was around 13 years ago.  I do not think there is a problem in getting staff to work, but with the actual staff numbers.  Will the witnesses comment on that?</p><p>I refer to CervicalCheck.  I may have spoken incorrectly earlier.  What Mr. O&rsquo;Carroll said is that no on-site audit was conducted in the outsourced laboratories.  I do not know what the difference is between a visit and an on-sight audit.  Mr. McCallion will know this.  Can he confirm whether that audit took place or not in every place where a woman who availed of the service would have her slide examined?</p></speech>

Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly did not refer to this directly but she reminded of something I would like to raise.  In recent weeks, I have seen an assertion that I, as Minister, should call in HIQA to examine some of the situations in regard to CervicalCheck.  I must remind the Oireachtas that was my initial starting point when the CervicalCheck debacle began.  I proposed a HIQA statutory investigation, where HIQA would have all the powers required to investigate all these matters.  The Oireachtas quite rightly said that considering the circumstances I should bring in someone external, possibly from outside the jurisdiction.  It was an instance of where engagement really works.  That person was Dr. Scally, and he did the work.  Mr. McCallion will respond to Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s question directly but I wanted to take the opportunity to say that.</p> <p>  I will bring the committee up-to-date on the nurses&rsquo; dispute as there have been developments in the last few minutes.  There was engagement with the INMO today, where the employer put forward the view that the pay claim cannot be processed within the terms of the current pay agreement.  Deputy O&rsquo;Reilly, with her current and her former hats on has outlined that the union has a different view on this-----</p></speech>

It says both of the things the Minister and I are saying.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.511" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018111400002#U00400"><p>The next line might be the real closer on this.  When two sides to a dispute have a different view on whether a claim can or cannot be processed, the appropriate thing to do is to refer it to the oversight body that was established to oversee that agreement.  That is what we intend to do.  The oversight body is the appropriate vehicle.  I ask both sides to this dispute to engage fully with that but also that people reflect on the prudence of balloting on industrial action when an oversight body is to consider the matter.  The appropriate thing to do would be to let the oversight body do its job and see what it has to say.</p> <p>  I must also make the point that in recent days the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform commented on the cost of funding the claim put forward by the INMO, which it costed at &euro;300 million annually.  We are talking about a sizable sum.  If politicians wish to deviate from the public sector pay agreement, they ought to suggest how they will fund it because &euro;300 million is a substantial sum.  I hope that engagement can take place.  The oversight body is the appropriate body in which to do that.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked the HSE to comment on home help and I am happy for it to do so.  However, from a policy perspective, the development of a statutory home care scheme is acutely needed on which we are all agreed.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has done significant work with the Department on that.  We are again increasing funding for home help and we are not waiting until budget 2019 delivers a service plan, but will do it as part of our winter plans.  The Deputy is correct that in certain parts of the country there has been an acuity in recent weeks and months.  I hope that we will be in a position to rectify that.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Connaghan to comment on that.</p></speech>

Each one needs a personal development plan to determine what will be done to support the person to get on the register eventually.  That is a good thing.  It recognises the previous good work the person has done in Ireland, while also recognising what we need to do in the context of personal, individually-tailored support.</p></speech>

The reason I say it is because that particular condition did not apply at the time.  There were 50 such people and they are well within the system, as the Deputy points out, and well established as practitioners.  We are, therefore, choosing not to address their issues.  The Deputy's question is really directed at those who came in after 2008.  We have  a figure of approximately 100 who are not on the specialist register, but I will get the exact figure for the Deputy.  We are making site visits.  There are two types of site at which these particular doctors work, namely, acutely hospital sites and community healthcare organisations where they work as psychiatrists.  As the director general has just pointed out, there will be individual needs for each practitioner and individual deficits to address and we are working with the colleges to determine whether we can address those deficits through whatever training is required to allow practitioners to be adopted onto the specialist register, thereby providing the public with the assurance they need that these doctors are working and practising as bona fide consultants.</p></speech>

While it is true to say we only started to engage with personal development plans this autumn, we expect that throughout the course of 2019 we will get there.  However, there will have to be an individually-tailored conversation with each member of staff to achieve that.  It will not happen overnight but during the course of 2019.

It was requested that there would be a site visit every three years for audit purposes and I believe the last one took place in 2014 and that one was scheduled for 2017 but it did not take place.  Dr. Scally has made site visits to all of the laboratories to review things and our intention as part of the revised quality assurance guidelines is to recommence site visits in 2019.</p></speech>

The challenge is particularly prevalent in Dublin and we are prioritising home care to support people to come out of hospitals.  As a result, there are approximately 6,000 people in the community awaiting home care.  Throughout the year, we have seen an unrelenting demand for services like this.  It has not abated in summer as it might have done previously.  As the Minister indicated, we are looking at enhancing home care and will be providing in excess of 300 additional packages in December.  We will also be putting additional packages in place in the early part of next year.  We hope that will make a difference.  The statutory scheme will also be welcome.  When one looks at what Sl&aacute;intecare advocates, home care is a critical part of how we need to deliver our health services.  We are looking at that.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about conversion targets.  In setting the whole-time equivalent limits to year end for each of our national entities, we have set a target or limit for agency conversion across all levels of agency.  If people can convert agency provision or overtime in real net terms based on where they were in June, that is considered to be an acceptable growth in whole-time equivalents.  We are trying to drive down the level of reliance on agency staff, not just for cost purposes but also for service reasons, as we said earlier.  While there is a limit as to how much net additional growth we will accept where someone explains the reason for an increase in whole-time equivalents, if someone goes over that and can demonstrate that they have actually brought in more people and sustainably dropped agency use, we do not see that as an issue.</p></speech>

We have spoken about this before.  While the programme for partnership Government proposes that a new GP contract will be negotiated, this is not happening.  There is a huge manpower shortage in general practice as demonstrated by the fact that GPs are now closing their lists to new patients as the only way to control the amount of work they do.  There is new work coming their way, including new work being transferred from hospital services to general practice.  The many vacant posts in general practice are a further illustration of the manpower crisis.  There are not only vacancies in public GMS post contracts, but GPs are finding it difficult to recruit assistants and partners to their practices.  GPs are emigrating because of the quality of the service they are feeding into.  They cannot get access to services for their patients and have great difficulty getting access to diagnostics.  For all of those reasons, there is a huge manpower crisis.</p> <p>  The Government has chosen not to reverse the FEMPI legislation as it relates to GPs.  It has chosen instead to go down the route outlined this morning by the Minister involving sustainability, expansion of services and expansion of eligibility which might, at some future date, feed into the negotiations on a new GP contract.  I contend that negotiations on a new GP contract should run parallel to what the Government is doing.  I contend also that the Government should reverse the FEMPI legislation.  However, it has set its direction differently.  How can the Minister implement Sl&aacute;intecare, which is founded on the transfer of services from hospitals to primary and community care if the GP manpower required is not available?  The only way to get the necessary GP manpower is to develop a new contract.  Things can be added to the existing contract, which is the Government's current policy in adding new services and expanding eligibility, but it cannot be done without expanding the manpower in general practice.  The only way to do that is a new GP contract.  When is the Minister going to start negotiations on a new GP contract?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.539" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018111400002#V02700"><p>I thank the Chairman.  We have discussed this a great deal.  Every element of what we are engaging on with the IMO on now is pointed towards Sl&aacute;intecare.  Sl&aacute;intecare is the singular test in all of the asks we on the State side have in the engagement with GPs.  I do not wish to negotiate in public.  I would be in awful trouble if I did.  When I talk about sustainability measures, I am talking about making general practice sustainable so that it can deliver Sl&aacute;intecare.  I am talking about ensuring there will be enough GPs who feel theirs is a challenging but rewarding career in which they wish to continue.  Sustainability, which is one of the three elements of the current talks, refers exactly to what the Chairman says.  It is about how we ensure enough people come into and stay in general practice.  It is a key element.  The other elements are access at eligibility and chronic disease management and they are directly focused on delivering Sl&aacute;intecare by taking services which are currently provided in hospitals and providing them in the community through general practice.</p><p>On eligibility, we must recognise that if we do not support general practice they cannot do this, but if we do not do this we will end up in a situation whereby people continue to end up in the hospital setting far too late in the development of their illness because cost might have been a barrier within primary care.  We saw the recent report on primary care, the lack of universal access here and how that compares unfavourably with other countries.</p><p> While we will not have a big-bang new contract - and I accept that assertion that the Chairman is making - we will have a framework that will deliver a number of new and exciting services, but will also invest in general practice, recognising that it needs to be sustainable.  The Chairman did not say this but I hear others say that all of the money that the Government wants to invest in general practice is for new services and that is not right.  As a Government, we recognise that before people are asked to take on new services, which the Chairman and I know that GPs want to take on if they are supported in doing so, we have to make sure that the current service is sustainable.  I accept that after years of FEMPI cuts, we have come to a position where general practice needs support to stabilise it.</p><p> I concede that there will not be a big bang contract moment by the end of the year.  However, there will be significant investment in general practice and a multi-annual framework for that investment and for the roll-out of services.  That framework will help us to continue to develop, evolve and modernise the GP contract.  This is a period of four years that we are discussing.  I cannot go too far on this in public but we are also trying to make sure that we do not conclude these talks at Christmas and say "that is it, we are done, we have delivered a GP contract or reformed it."  It should be part of an evolution and there will be more issues we want to talk about and more changes we want to bring about in the future.  It is about getting a framework in place and when members of the committee see what we are trying to do, subject to us getting agreement, they will see much in it that they will like.</p></speech>

The Minister is putting structures on a contract which is itself unsustainable.</p></speech>

We should remember that by the end of this framework period, that old contract will effectively have been replaced.  This is an evolving period whereby we invest in sustainability and new measures.  The Chairman has educated me on this from the perspective of a GP as well and many new, younger doctors want to provide new and exciting services and work in different ways and we are talking about both of those elements in the discussions.  I hope to be in a position to share this with the Chairman because we have been talking about this at the committee for a long time and it is an urgent issue.  I hope to have this resolved by Christmas.</p></speech>

I have spent more time with him in the last week than I have with my husband so the Minister might get tongues wagging.  I apologise if some of these points have been covered already but I had to go on the plinth earlier.</p> <p>  I ask the Minister to comment on the Ombudsman's comments this morning on the Learning to Get Better report and the recommendations not being implemented.  As the Minister knows, the HSE accepted 36 recommendations, fully implemented ten, partially implemented 17 and the other nine recommendations were either not implemented or are still being considered.</p> <p>  Is there any update on Respreeza?</p> <p>  I know that FreeStyle Libre has come up many times before but I have been contacted by people a lot more in recent times on this issue than previously.  If this was reimbursed it would change these people's lives.  Obviously none of us would like to be pricking our finger every day.  Sometimes people must do it up to ten times per day and it is causing much pain.  It would make a difference to these 20,000 adults and it would not be a huge financial cost so I recommend that they be looked after.  I know that four to 21 year olds are covered but when a person reaches 21 years of age will they continue to be covered into the future?  That would be good because obviously then everybody would eventually be covered but at the moment many people are enduring much pain every day.</p> <p>  While I know this is the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, unfortunately he is not here today.  I highlight the waiting list for the assessment of need and after that there is also still a large waiting list for the therapies that are recommended in the assessment.  For some reason, Cork seems to be particularly badly hit.  We are finding it hard to get to the cause of that but I highlight the seriousness of that to the Minister.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.544" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018111400002#W00500"><p>I will share out the questions but I will take two of them.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right to highlight the issue of the assessment of need waiting lists and I know she has been highlighting it for quite a period of time.  Ms Anne O'Connor might add further detail but from my perspective, the fact that following negotiation and engagement with Fianna F&aacute;il we have allocated funding for 100 additional therapy posts in 2019, along with some of the work the HSE is doing in reforming the assessment of need processes, will make a real and meaningful difference.  We will obviously be cognisant of allocating them to areas of particular and specific need through the service planning process.  I will not carry out the service plan here but it will obviously look at areas where there are particular acute problems and the Deputy has referenced the area of Cork.  That will be factored in as we work out where to allocate those 100 additional therapy posts in 2019.</p> <p>  On Respreeza, I am glad the Deputy brought it up.  Deputy Kelly also brought it up before I arrived and I caught a little bit of what he said.  There are two issues here.  There is the issue of the general reimbursement of the drug, which I will put to one side because it is a matter for the drug company to put in an application and go through the legal reimbursement process for which the HSE has responsibility.  There is another issue that is more acute in my view and is also more of an ethical issue, namely, that there are about 19 patients who are on what was in my view a long-term compassionate access clinical trial-type programme.  That support was pulled from them very quickly.  It was not handled very well by the company and it knows my views on that.  The HSE has been engaging intensively to try to provide a certainty for those 19 people and I am confident that in the next few days the HSE will bring that to a conclusion and I thank the executive for the hard work it has been doing on that.  It has also taken the unusual but appropriate step of providing some of the cost of administering the drug through nurses and the likes in the interim period.  I am hopeful for a resolution for those 19 people in the coming days and I emphasise the word "days."</p> <p>  On FreeStyle Libre, as is a matter for the HSE's reimbursement process, its representatives might wish to comment but as the Deputy rightly says, it is available to children in hospitals at the moment.  It is about six months of the way through a 12-month evaluation process so if we do not have the information here we may come back to the Deputy with a note.  A parliamentary question tabled on it is down to be answered today as well.</p> <p>  On the Ombudsman, it is appropriate that the director general would respond as it was a report to the HSE.  Like the Deputy, I noted that there were a number of areas where the Ombudsman welcomed significant progress and others where there is still work to do.  The HSE may tell the committee where it is in that regard.</p></speech>

Over the past three years we have built up the number of complaints officers to about 500.  That is quite significant and luckily that is progress.  As well as pursuing some of the process issues that have been outlined in this latest report, we should also have an ambition to do something to get more upstream of complaints, that is, to stop a complaint happening before it actually turns into something more serious.  I see that as a general ambition and I have some views on that which I can expand on later.</p></speech>

We have recently completed our national patient experience survey in our acute hospital system for the second year running.  It has been our absolute hope to listen to that carefully and to respond to it.</p> <p>  On the Ombudsman's report, we have done much work on this which needs highlighting.</p><p>The report, Learning to Get Better, is a valuable platform on which to build the review of our current complaints process, Your Service, Your Say, which we carried out in 2017.  The report will also help in developing an advocacy framework with the Department of Health, which we are doing at present, and in showing that we learn.  We have developed a complaints management system online with the State Claims Agency.  The Ombudsman criticised the roll-out of that and we must take that on board.  Working with the Ombudsman, we developed an e-learning framework to help those who are managing complaints in our community healthcare organisations and hospital groups to manage them more effectively, supporting patients as service users and our staff who are supposed to be listening and responding to complaints.  We are working with the Ombudsman and we intend to fully implement the recommendations of his report in 2019 and make our system more responsive to those who use our services wherever they may present.</p></speech>

However, there have been a couple of developments.  This year to date, we have had just under 3,800 applications, which is considerably lower than last year.  We believe this is linked to the new model of resource allocation in schools.  The number of applications is 700 lower than last year and we expect that figure to increase to approximately 900 by the end of the year.  Having said that, we also had to undertake a significant programme of improvement.  That is linked to a couple of key issues.  One has been to approve a standing operating procedure for assessment of need.  That has led us into considerable negotiation with staff groups.  We hope to have that resolved in December and we will have a standardised approach to assessment because it has been variable around the country.</p></speech>

We concluded this process just this week and we have reached agreement through a mediated process.  We will now advertise network manager posts.  We will have 87 children's disability networks and network managers whose sole job will be to focus on the co-ordination of services for children with disabilities.</p> <p>  On CHO 4, the Cork and Kerry area has been the most challenged in terms of numbers.  CHO 4 has undertaken a significant programme of improvement this year and while it is not yet out of the woods, numbers declined from in excess of 1,700 in quarter 1 to just under 1,200 now.

We looked at a couple of key issues.  In terms of capacity and improvement, in the first half of this year we were focused on developing a three-year plan which would look at improving capacity.  As Deputy Murphy O'Mahony stated, we should not be surprised by winter because we know it is coming every year.  We have to look at how we can develop our capacity in line with that and improve our services.  We have an improvement initiative, the Five Fundamentals, that has been peer reviewed and piloted in the south.  That work has been taking place all year and it led us into September.</p> <p>  Another important learning point for us this year was the papal visit.  We examined that in terms of what worked in terms of our response.  That has led us into a slightly different approach this year.  We are working with colleagues around the country who have emergency management experience on national and local co-ordination teams and we are looking at how we can maximise what we have available to us.  As I stated, we have not published the report.  We are in discussions with the Department.  Those discussions have pretty much concluded in terms of our approach and agreement around how we are doing this. However, that has not prevented us from starting the work.  We have been engaging with services since September.  We have integrated plans from all areas and we have agreed a plan.  We are now finalising the areas for investment but many detailed discussions have been going on with services all around the country.</p> <p>  Our challenge and focus has been on ensuring an integrated pathway for people throughout winter that begins in primary care and tries to keep as many people away from emergency departments as possible.  That is not to say that we will not be challenged because the numbers are high and will be higher.  We have to look at maximising all of the supports available.  A great deal of work has been going on since September on that.</p></speech>

I welcome the progress indicated on the carrying out of an audit to find out where the deficiencies are.  Provided it is followed up, that will be bring fairly dramatic results.  There is not much sense identifying where the deficiencies are unless there is something done to address them.  I realise the audit is being done in the context of preparation for Sl&aacute;intecare, which is to be welcomed.</p> <p>  Is it possible to identify emergency space that may be needed in the event of there being unforeseen demand during the winter period, for example, if we have a prolonged winter or prolonged illnesses?  It is possible to do this everywhere, including in hospitals.  Is it possible to provide for such an emergency plan while remaining within budget?</p> <p>  On the question of unqualified doctors who have been reported, surely the Medical Council has as stringent a system as other professions have for dealing with these matters and is at least as well qualified as their counterparts are in other areas.  Why does the system not work?  Nobody should get through.  In other professions of which I am aware, the council governing the professional body does let anyone through unless he or she is fully and properly qualified.  I would like some comment as to why that is not happening.</p> <p>  Home care packages are in considerable demand.  I have stated over the years that home care does not come cheap.  It does not come free either and that was never expected.  An expectation  has been created that it would be much less expensive than other options.  It is not cheap, but it has to be done and is part of the jigsaw.  If this piece is not put in place, some other part of the system will bear the brunt of the problem.</p> <p>  I have two other questions, one of which is parochial.  I am loath to be parochial in these matters but I could not allow the issue to pass since virtually all other hospitals in the country have been mentioned already.</p></speech>

I could mention it a couple of times.  I raised this as a Topical Issue matter last week when I acknowledged the progress made.  I emphasise, however, that the proposed new units in Naas are an urgent necessity for the operation of the hospital.  It is most important for the delivery of services to the catchment area that the programme in the oncology and endoscopy units is accelerated as much as possible.</p> <p>  My last question, which is on the degree to which the health services generally are prepared to cater for a major emergency, has not been answered for some years, as far as I am aware.  I compliment the health services on the manner in which they dealt with the circumstances that arose last winter.  Sacrifices were made and staff in the various hospitals doubled up and stayed over.  Tremendous work was done.  More serious emergencies could occur.  As is clear from international news reports, such emergencies arise daily.  We do not know what kind of emergency might arise.  The question is the extent to which we can now deal with a major natural or national disaster.</p></speech>

On Deputy Durkan's first point on flow and audit results, if he does not mind, I will send him the results of what has been achieved so far in some of the major flow programmes.  These show what was happening last year, what is happening now, whether there has been an improvement and what learning we have got from the programmes.</p> <p>  I will deal with the issues of emergency space and catering for a major emergency in the same answer.</p><p>The experience in Ireland is that, when we have an emergency, whether it is snow or storms, we cope tremendously well and we bounce back relatively quickly.  Much of that is to do with the flexibility on the part of staff in terms of being available at all hours and, as already stated, remaining on site at times to be able to cope with the exigencies of the service.  Overall, the experience is quite good.  In terms of flexing up for major emergencies, members will not be surprised to know that, through the year, we have a number of major emergency exercises to prepare for events, whether a flu pandemic, terrorist attack or otherwise.  Mr. McCallion, who used to be in charge of that section, can provide more colour if necessary.</p><p> During the flu pandemic in the UK some years ago - the UK is no different from Ireland in this regard - we had a contingency plan which looked at the requirement to rapidly increase the number of intensive care beds and respiratory facilities available.  We did that by turning high-dependency unit beds into intensive care unit beds, and we had a backstop which was that, if push came to shove, we could use theatres and that kind of facility. Thankfully, it never came to that, but we have these kinds of plans available and laid out in a series of escalation responses for any issue that might arise.</p><p> I will hand over to Dr. Henry who will deal with the issues raised on the medical side.</p></speech>

I met the Medical Council provisionally yesterday and we will have further engagement with it in the next week or two to address the issues raised by this case.  My understanding is that we have a reciprocal agreement with other EU countries so there are no grounds for refusal of a doctor for registration based on his or her country of training as long as that country is within the EU.  That said, we want to find out not just the learning from this case but any learning the Medical Council has from any other cases that-----</p></speech>

That is a departure from the manner in which new drugs are examined, where, even though we have the EU level for examining and approving new drugs, we also do it ourselves, and we raise questions at that time.  I do not accept that what has been put forward is an adequate answer.  While I not blaming Dr. Henry, it is a fact.</p></speech>

I want to be careful in what I say.  It has no grounds for refusing somebody based just on the country of origin of his or her training as long as that country is in the EU.  That said, if there are any issues pertaining to safety, not just arising from this case but from any other cases that come to the attention of the Medical Council, clearly we have to review what is best for our healthcare system based on putting patients' interests first.</p></speech>

There is an inconsistency.  On the one hand, we are particularly careful and we double-check in respect of drugs, as we should do in most cases, even though the same check has already been done by the European institutions, where we are also represented, incidentally.  On the other hand, we do not seem to apply the same principles regarding staff and their qualifications, which are at least as important as drug verification.</p></speech>

All I am saying is that anyone who applies for registration in Ireland cannot be refused on the basis of the country of origin of registration as long as that country is in the EU - that is, not on that basis alone.</p></speech>

Each hospital has its own escalation plan and there is a point in that plan whereby other space within the hospital would be used if it could not cope with the numbers coming through.  That would result in using space that might otherwise be used for elective care, and so on, so there is obviously a balance to be struck in terms of how much of that activity is stopped.  However, we are also challenged because we sometimes have a significant number of people who require isolation due to infection.  We then have to consider the staffing of additional space.  Given we are at times challenged to staff the space we have open all of the time, if we add more into the mix, it can create challenges.</p> <p>  I note the Deputy's point on home care.  Our waiting lists are considerable.  CHO 7, which is an area relating to Naas and Tallaght, is particularly challenged.  I want to reassure the Deputy that Naas is one of the nine sites of focus for us in the winter period.  It is named specifically in the winter plan, so it will be receiving significant attention as part of that.</p></speech>

I raise this on the basis it affects the general delivery of services and the morale within the hospital.  People can only be so long waiting for something to happen.</p></speech>

I visited Naas General Hospital and met staff.  I also met representatives from the Dublin Midlands hospital group.  I know the capital project is a priority both for the hospital and the hospital group.  It will make a huge difference to endoscopy waiting lists, not just for Naas General Hospital but also for the entire Dublin Midlands hospital group.  This was a project that was ready to proceed when the economic crash happened and it was very unfortunate, as Deputy Durkan and I will remember from visiting there, that the hospital just lost out as capital dried up during the recession.  Now that we are back with a much larger capital budget of &euro;11 billion for the next ten years, compared to just over &euro;4.9 for the last ten, this will be a priority project.  We are currently engaging with the HSE on finalising our capital plans for 2019 and it will be considered in that context.</p></speech>

It wrote a letter on 30 September and received a reply on 31 October from the co-chair of the management team advising that its proposals and engagement would be discussed at the meeting in November.  I understand that meeting is set for 26 November next.  One of the issues Nursing Homes Ireland has raised with me - it says this happens every year - is that from 22 December until approximately the third week in January, it has very little engagement with the HSE as regards working with it and helping to relieve the numbers coming out of the hospitals.  It is concerned that it has not been involved in the engagement to date on the winter plan and it is very anxious to be available and to work with the HSE so any issue in regard to numbers in hospitals can be dealt with in an expeditious manner.  I would appreciate any comment on that.  Nursing Homes Ireland certainly wants to work with the HSE in this regard.</p> <p>  The second issue I want to raise is the consultant contract and, in particular, trying to make it attractive for people to return to Ireland.  I accept that we have discussed the consultant contract a few times today.  We put in a new salary scale system in recent years but it is not working in many areas in the sense that people are not attracted to the jobs and the scales being offered.  I raised a point earlier about the &euro;110 million spent on the employment of agency consultants.  Is this being reviewed from a Department point of view or HSE point of view to allow us to move forward?</p> <p>  An issue was raised earlier about the number who are going to retire from the health service right across Europe.  My understanding is that something like one third of all medical consultants across Europe are over 60 years of age.  Therefore, we will be facing a challenge.</p><p>In facing that challenge, we also need to be competitive in what we are offering.  How can we deal with the issues?  We have not been serious about dealing with it over the past three or four years.  I accept that there are other demands, but we need something attractive to bring people in.  Is engagement on the matter with the consultant group likely in the next six months?</p></speech>

I have asked the Department and the HSE to engage with Nursing Homes Ireland.  He is correct in stating that nursing homes have a very important role to play in winter planning.  From a patient perspective, we need to keep as many older people as possible in the more comfortable environment of nursing homes rather than in emergency departments during a very busy period.  I look forward to the engagement between Nursing Homes Ireland and the HSE.</p> <p>  There are two parts to the answer to the question on consultants.  The first involves what I outlined to Deputy Donnelly earlier, namely, that the Public Service Pay Commission suggests that a process on the issue of new entrant pay should be considered at a particular point.  My Department will consider how best to advance that matter with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The second point is that we also have the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir's group is carrying out a major examination of decoupling private practice in public hospitals in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  At a certain point, this will require contractual engagement with consultants.  There is the monetary piece from the Public Service Pay Commission.  There is also the issue of dealing with the job specification and how we can ensure that consultants and medics who want to deliver healthcare reform are able to do it under their contracts.  Those are the two big issues we will be working on in the context of consultants.</p></speech>

I know it has been a long morning.  My first question relates to the emerging field in general practice of online consultations.  The Care Quality Commission in the UK has expressed concern about the quality of prescriptions, that opioids and antibiotics are being excessively prescribed and, obviously, that there is no physical examination with an online consultation.  These practices are being heavily advertised in Ireland and there has been considerable growth.  In the UK, it was discovered that four in ten were unsafe or there were fears about their safety.  I raised the issue during Questions on Promised Legislation and received a reply from the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, in the Minister's absence.  What are the Minister's plans for regulation and guidelines to ensure safety?  Is the HSE commencing a process or audit to deal with the matter?  I might get an answer to that and then I will come back.</p></speech>

Nothing can replace direct contact between a medical practitioner, nurse or allied healthcare professional with a patient.  However, there are some examples of how we are putting this to good use.  We have a heart failure virtual clinic operating in the south east.  It has replaced traditional referrals to consultants and has resulted in 80% of people who otherwise would have been sent for specialist consultations being dealt with through online consultation between GPs and consultants.  We have other examples of similar online consultations, admittedly between primary practitioners and secondary care practitioners, which again replaces people who would be referred to waiting lists and to me is a much better investment in care.  The Deputy's question focuses on how it pertains to direct engagement with patients.  My opinion and that of clinical leads in our healthcare system is that we would see this as enhancing traditional consultation, meaning direct patient engagement, rather than replacing it, except in very defined circumstances.</p></speech>

My question is not whether it exists; it is whether the HSE is developing guidelines on an emerging field of general practice.  I was not asking whether it was good or not.  I understand the heart failure virtual clinic.  However, the flip side of that is how they triage someone who has chest pain.  How can that be provided through an online consultation?  Is the HSE teasing that out as this emerges, as has been done in the UK?  It is not a question whether-----</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to chest pain.  In the case of chest pain, there can only be one form of engagement which is directly between the medical practitioner and the patient.

CervicalCheck carried out an audit.  It took early notifications from hospitals of diagnoses of cervical cancer.  We know that two cases ultimately did not involve cancer, which is clearly good for those patients.  We know of at least two other cases whereby the patients involved did not have cervical cancer but had another form of cancer.  The audit took the notification from the hospitals and carried out the comparison in the context of cytology, which is where we ended up with the difference between the original interpretation and the subsequent interpretation of the results.  The process of disclosing to patients fell down later.</p> <p>  The second issue that emerged was that details of some cases were not notified directly to the cervical screening service but were notified to the cancer registry and were not included in the original audit.  The purpose of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists review is to look at all 3,100 women who were diagnosed with cervical cancer.  That is reducing in terms of approximately 1,800 people who would have had a screening history and also had cervical cancer.  They will form part of that review which will give us the answers to some of the outstanding questions on that.</p></speech>

The Deputy probably missed the earlier answer.  The purpose of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists review was to come up with the facts and figures and give patients certainty over whether there was an issue with their audit results.</p><p>The second point is that it would give us facts on the nature of the cancer the individual patients had.  In light of the fact that the consent rate from the group of 221 is relatively low, we are going to establish some of those facts but it will take some time to do so.  We are gathering information from the cancer registry and the hospitals in order to arrive at a definitive number in respect of those who did not have cancer ultimately or had a different form of cancer.  We will close that out.</p><p> The review by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists was set up for that purpose.  It is looking at the 3,100 cases.  Of those, 1,800 would have had screening histories.  It will give them clarity on their cancer and any other issues or not as the case may be.  It should be borne in mind that close to 1,000 of these would have been diagnosed with cervical cancer through the programme.  That is also good thing.  Every two days, one women is diagnosed with cervical cancer through the cervical cancer screening programme.  We need to balance that.</p></speech>

I understand site-to-site visits will be carried out.  Is there an issue regarding the training programme?  Are there consultants who would be perceived to be specialists but who, in terms of their training, are not?  Are they providing supervision to other doctors in training schemes?  Is there an issue in the context of medical ethics whereby a consultant who might not have completed specialist training might be the lead clinician in a team providing the end goal of care and guidance regarding a patient plan?  It is deceptive for patients in that they might believe someone is a consultant but did not know they had not completed training.  There is a mismatch in respect of the perception of skill sets.  For example, one would not have someone flying a plane who had not fully trained as a pilot.  With specialists, however, we have allowed that.</p> <p>  Aside from the personal training plans being put in place, who authorised these appointments?  How did general doctors end up being locum consultants and then permanent consultants?  Who was responsible for that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-11-14a.591" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018111400002#AA00300"><p>As specialist training schemes evolved and came into play in the 1990s and the decade after, by 2008 it was a requirement that somebody would have completed a specialist training scheme in order to be certified as a specialist.  Before 2008, that was not the case.  It was an accrual of experience which was reflected in one's CV and references, along with the interview process which came after.  Since 2008, it has been a requirement for interviewees to be on the specialist register.</p> <p>  As stated earlier, 50 or so of the consultants we are dealing with it are pre-2008.  They would have worked since then as consultants in our healthcare system, accruing experience, knowledge and expertise and not just through training.  Then there are 100 consultants after 2008, divided between psychiatrists and hospital consultants.</p> <p>  In answer to a question earlier, I stated we have 29 emergency departments operating 24-7, with 19 maternity units and paediatric units.  All of those hospitals give unscheduled care services, be they emergency departments, obstetrics, paediatrics, anaesthesia for surgery or medicine, which require somebody available all the time.  This is not an excuse.  I am just stating the fact that there is an obligation for us to continue to provide those services unbroken.  In my assessment, based on what our human resources department has ascertained, these appointments were made because they simply could not find anybody else with the necessary qualifications and training scheme completion to perform in the same post.</p> <p>  We are mapping through this and examining each of those cases, developing personal plans for each individual in order to see if his or her existing qualifications and work experience qualifies them to be on the specialist register.  If it does not, we then can identify the gap to determine what additional training and supervision or mentoring is required.</p></speech>

In light of recent reports, there is a significant mismatch between the pay for new entrants and more senior doctors.  Is the Minister looking at a pathway to bridging that gap or to providing a new contract?</p> <p>  Hospital trusts legislation has been in the ether for a long time.  There are boards of hospital trusts which have no legislative oversight and there are appointments occurring to them without any clarity.  What is the update on that?</p> <p>  What is the process for tendering for work under the NTPF?  Many public hospitals carry out NTPF work on Saturdays.  What are the governance criteria for this?  Does a public consultant get paid in addition to his or her public contract for NTPF work done in a public hospital?  How is that audited?  Could there be a perverse incentive for somebody who has a large waiting list to control those waiting lists around the NTPF process in public hospitals?</p></speech>

The view of the Public Service Pay Commission, as well as mine, is that there is an issue when it comes to recruiting consultants.  It noted in its report that reductions in the pay of new entrants appointed since 2012 were particularly severe.  It also pointed out that the differential had, as the Deputy implied, worsened as a result of negotiating a settlement to the consultant contract cases as we did earlier in the year.  It is my preference that we would enter a process as we have done with others in the public service to look at how one addresses the issue of new entrant pay.  That is a discussion I am having across the Government.  The process, as outlined in the Public Service Pay Commission report, will be welcomed.  I do not see that directly linked to the broader conversations we are going to have about consultants, Sl&aacute;intecare or contractual reform into the future.</p></speech>

We will publish the first Sl&aacute;intecare action plan around Christmas.  I will bring it to the Cabinet in December.  That will obviously outline the actions we are going to take then.</p> <p>  There is a significant body of work which the Sl&aacute;intecare team needs to do working out the contractual implications of the report for many different healthcare professionals, of which consultants will be one group.  We are not yet ready to have that conversation about what the consultant role in the future will look like.</p> <p>  We will depend on the Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir group as well which was established to look at how to decouple private practice in public hospitals.  This is a point about which I feel strongly.  I do not believe it is appropriate that private practice is happening in public hospitals.  I do not have an issue with private practice or an issue with people in private practice.  The choice of playing golf or engaging in private practice is not my business.  It is engaging private practice in public hospitals which irks me.  That is what I am hoping the Donal de Buitl&eacute;ir group will help us with.</p> <p>  I am not sure what the Deputy meant about appointments happening without clarity to the boards of hospital trusts.  Any appointment to a hospital group has gone through the Public Appointments Service.  I populated all of those boards in recent months.  All of the appointments were made via the Public Appointments Service.  The Deputy is correct that they only exist in an administrative capacity and do not have a basis in law.  I took the decision when Sl&aacute;intecare was published not to push ahead with legislating for the hospital groups for two reasons.  First, I am not sure I command a D&aacute;il majority to do it.  Second, Sl&aacute;intecare has moved us to a different space because it rightly talks about these integrated care entities whereby one would have CHOs and groups, effectively over time, aligned and one would legislate for that.</p><p>I will bring forward proposals on geoalignment in the coming months and will then move to legislate for those bodies rather than doing so for hospital groups and having to come back and do it again.</p></speech>

Legislating for hospital groups now would ignore the fact that the Sl&aacute;intecare committee rightly stated that it would be better to legislate for regional structures that include community health organisations in one entity while avoiding silos.  That is the direction I intend to take.</p> <p>  I would be happy to get the Deputy a note from the NTPF on how it ensures it complies with its procurement and governance obligations .  I am satisfied that it concentrates on additionality rather than paying for something that is available elsewhere in the HSE.</p></speech>

All members have first-hand anecdotal information about what happens when those within the system make a complaint on an issue such as an unsafe working environment.  I know of people who were told to accept the way things were done or to leave.  The "Your Service, Your Say" policy and various practices are in place in the HSE but they do not work as required, namely, to encourage people to come forward with complaints in order to make our health system safer.  What can the Minister say to reassure those in the health service who are working in an unsafe environment or perceive practices that threaten the health and safety of patients or staff and are considering making a complaint?</p></speech>

That was vividly depicted in the excellent documentary by Katie Hannon on Maurice and Lorraine McCabe.  I would very simply say to anybody working in the health service that our laws have changed and we have protected disclosure legislation.  As Minister for Health, I receive protected disclosures.  The HSE has a protected disclosure policy and system.  "Your Service, Your Say" is a way for people to make complaints, but whistleblowers who need to bring an issue to attention in a protected space have the law on their side.  The law is working and there have been examples of important information being brought to the attention of the authorities through protected disclosures.  I encourage anyone working in, or using, the health service who wishes to highlight a matter by whistleblowing to avail of the protection offered by the laws passed in recent years.</p></speech>

I had some practical experience of this issue in a former role and note that there may be instances where a delay is caused by the nature of the records or their being moved off site or historical.  In such instances, the hospital should proactively engage with the patient or representative regarding a timeframe for delivery of the records.  If a patient is unhappy regarding access to records, there is an initial escalation within the hospital.</p></speech>

It would be helpful in our engagement and representation of those most impacted on by our questions if we could be provided the answers a couple of days before the committee meets.</p> <p>  On valproate, I thank the HSE representatives for the written answer provided.  However, the study mentioned in its letter to the foetal anti-convulsant syndrome, FACS, Forum Ireland, of which the Organisation for Anti-Convulsant Syndrome, OACS, is a stakeholder, is like a rapid assessment report to estimate the numbers of people in Ireland who have been affected.</p><p>This is based on the Irish data combined with the international statistics.  I am concerned that it will not address any of the historical issues and will just look at the effectiveness of the risk minimisation.  This is why it is very important to have a proper independent inquiry into this.  There are an awful lot of questions still outstanding.  I can see what the Minister is trying to do by looking at the different elements but the fact is that we need to know who knew, and at what time, the impact that valproate would have on pregnant women and on the children they were going to give birth to.  In 1975 the then Minister for Health, and the Irish Medical Board, IMB - which is now the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA - licensed the medication.  Why were they telling us for years that it was licensed in 1983?  There is an awful lot to be cleared up there.  I believe that it cannot be cleared up without an inquiry.</p><p> This issue is not particular to Ireland, as the Minister is aware, but a lot of the people who have been impacted by this are finding that they have to go to Britain to get more information on it.  The Minister will know that a redress scheme was set up in France for this, so the same mistakes were being made in all of these countries.  We owe it to these families who are trying to do their best for the children they are bringing up with disabilities.  Will the Minister please speak to that? </p></speech>

The Senator referred to the written answer.  If anybody is watching these proceedings they do not have the benefit of that.  There are a number of work streams under way on the issue of valproate.  I had an excellent meeting with representatives from the FACS forum where they outlined the very devastating consequences of this on their own lives, on the lives of their children and on the difficulties it posed in rearing children in very difficult circumstances.</p> <p>  With regard to the protection now, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, has done a huge body of work around reviewing the information that is provided-----</p></speech>

The Senator is correct that it took a lot of work.  That information is being shared with representatives of the FACS forum.</p> <p>  We also have the valproate response project that is studying the numbers of those who have been affected by foetal anti-convulsant syndrome, which is the point being made by the Senator.  There is also the development of the existing Irish epilepsy and pregnancy register.  The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, in collaboration with the HPRA, will conduct an impact assessment project on the effectiveness of risk minimisation measures to prevent harms from such medicines, including sodium valproate.  That work is under way.</p> <p>  The HSE is currently gathering information on sodium valproate through the patient support service.  One of the issues I wanted to try to do, and on which I gave a commitment to the FACS forum when I met them, was that they would have a contact point within the health service for the many disparate needs of some of their children.  They had talked to me about how they felt they were bounced from Billy to Jack - to use a colloquial phrase - when trying to identify the services.  I am aware there is work ongoing with the Children's Hospital Group in that respect.  To be clear, I had not ruled out an independent inquiry such as other countries have had but I remain to be convinced that it would be the best way to get some of the information they rightly need and deserve.  I wanted to get all of these work streams to report first and then make that decision.  I ask Dr. Henry to bring us up to date from his perspective.</p></speech>

In recent years there has been a growing awareness, not just of the impact of the drug, but also around the frequency with which children can be affected.  As the information became more available to us though Europe and through other healthcare systems our priority was to address the immediate safety need in ensuring that all women of child bearing age were made aware of the risk of the drug.  Equally, we wanted to be sure that nobody stopped the drug abruptly because that could lead to harm for people who had well controlled epilepsy, for example.  As part of the work we have been doing in the summer, and I pay tribute not just to my own team but also to the patient representatives on the FACS forum who have contributed hugely to this work, we have communicated with 2,500 women of child bearing age who have been on the drug.</p></speech>

We need a redress system in place similar to what is in place in France.  I am aware of the good work that has been done but I am also very conscious of the time because I have a couple of other questions.</p></speech>

I am very much aware of this case.  It is a matter for the HSE to follow its own reimbursement processes legally in this respect.  I met the HSE on a number of issues recently and this was one issue that I raised specifically.  It is important that there is real and meaningful engagement with the drugs company and with the HSE.  The technology review group on rare diseases is currently working its way through the application.  It will go to the HSE leadership shortly for decision also.  I acknowledge it is an issue of significant concern to a number of parents in the State.  It is currently with the technology review group on rare diseases and it will go from there to the HSE leadership team.</p></speech>

That group was established specifically recognising that there are rare diseases that require greater consideration perhaps than a drug that can benefit a larger cohort of the population.  There are more and more rare diseases in Ireland for which new drugs are coming on stream.  I want to make the point, strongly, that it takes two to negotiate.  It is absolutely right and proper that the Senator would apply pressure to me and to the HSE at this forum.  It is the Senator's job to do that.</p><p>I would encourage similar pressure to be applied to drug companies as well, because they have the drug that parents believe can make a big difference to their children's lives.

We would then be trying to make decisions on that cost, which would be crazy.</p> <p>  I wish to question the Minister on the audiology failures in counties Mayo and Roscommon.  I know a number of actions have been taken on that, but again we do not know who was responsible or whether the governance was put in place for it and there are further difficulties.  The Minister has provided a long written reply on what has happened in respect of the Department of Health, medical cards, employment affairs and social protection and education and skills.  There are still shortfalls in the system.  I hope this committee will have hearings in the new year to hear about the impact the audiology failure has had on the families involved.  We need to get to the bottom of the matter.  Why was the governance not in place and is it in place now?  If so, could it ever happen again?  Some 49 children were affected.</p></speech>

I had an excellent meeting recently in Government Buildings with some of the parents whose children had been impacted.  The chief officer of Community Healthcare West, Mr. Tony Canavan, was present from the HSE as was a senior official from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  A number of undertakings were given at that meeting to try to provide support to the children who had been impacted.  I suppose what was clear at that meeting and also in the Senator's outline today is not all of the supports required were health-related and some specifically related to the education sphere.  It seemed to be a particular sticking point at that meeting.  There was a commitment given that officials would meet and that they would then re-engage with the parents' groups.  I hope and expect that this will happen.  If the Senator hears anything to the contrary, please let me know.  Ms O'Connor will now comment.</p></speech>

There is now a national clinical audiology lead, so the governance has changed since that took place.  Let me confirm that the meeting between the different officials happened on 5 November 2018.  There is a robust governance structure in place and the learning from that incident, which happened in other parts of the country as well, has been examined.  We hope that, with this audiology programme, the errors of the past will never happen again.  I will let the secretariat know of the gaps in between.</p></speech>
