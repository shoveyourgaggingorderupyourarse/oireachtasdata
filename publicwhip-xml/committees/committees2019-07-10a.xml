    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Manley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019071000002#B00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation.  As the Chair said, I am joined by Mr. Robert Deegan who is principal officer in the Department's energy efficiency and affordability division.  Energy efficiency has long been a part of Irish energy policy.  It is deemed to be the first fuel.  Energy efficiency measures are among the most cost effective methods for reducing emissions.  The buildings sector accounts for approximately 24% of Ireland&rsquo;s total energy usage and approximately 10% of our overall greenhouse gas emissions.  For that reason, it is very much centre stage in the all-of-Government climate action plan.</p> <p>  To date, the central plank of efforts to drive demand for energy efficiency upgrades has been grant schemes funded by Government and administered by the SEAI.  These include free upgrades for households in energy poverty; fixed grants for a defined list of energy efficiency measures, covering approximately 30% of the total cost; and a pilot scheme offering 50% grants for people who want to upgrade to an A3 deep retrofit.  The total funding allocated for these schemes for 2019 is &euro;85 million.  Overall the funding for energy in the Department's Vote has an increased from about &euro;50 million in 2015 to &euro;140 million in 2019.  </p> <p>  Since 2000, more than 400,000 homes have received direct support under these schemes, mostly for lower intensity measures rather than deep retrofitting.  Despite this investment, more than 80% of homes still have a building energy rating, BER, of C or lower. When compared with other European Union, EU, countries our homes use 7% more energy and emit nearly 60% more emissions.  The Government has accepted in the all-of-Government action plan the need to redouble efforts to improve the efficiency of our homes.  This is central to the plan.  </p> <p>  The plan represents a significant step-up in ambition.  Indeed, it is not just a step up, it is almost a new staircase.  It sets out, for the first time, 2030 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and also puts Ireland on the right trajectory towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.  The plan also sets out new governance arrangements that will be put in place to provide effective oversight of implementation of the plan.  This very much aligns with the relevant recommendations from the Oireachtas and the Citizens' Assembly.  </p> <p>  Regarding targets for retrofitting homes, the climate action plan has identified a target of upgrading 500,000 homes to a BER of B2 or cost optimal equivalent, by 2030 as well as the installation of 400,000 heat pumps, to replace older heating systems.  This is an enormous step up and a real challenge.  The plan identifies a range of actions that will drive achievement of the retrofit target.  A central commitment in that regard is the development of a new retrofitting delivery model, which will group retrofits together to achieve economies of scale, leverage private finance, and ensure easy payback methods.  The savings on energy bills from using less energy can help fund this, while homes will be warmer, produce lower levels of emissions and be better for us all.</p> <p>  Other measures identified include reviewing and redesigning the grant schemes to ensure alignment with Government objectives and value for money and the introduction of improvements to the BER certificate to provide more guidance to homeowners.  In addition, all buildings undergoing a major renovation, greater than 25% of the building envelope, must bring the rest of the building up to minimum BER of B2 or cost optimal equivalent.  Interactive tools and reports for homeowners will also be developed to identify the impact of energy efficiency upgrades.  There will also be development of the supply chain and training and, crucially, strengthened regulatory and fiscal measures.</p> <p>  Achievement of the target will be supported by Project Ireland 2040 with a financial allocation of &euro;3.7 billion to 2027.  This is clearly a significant level of Exchequer investment, but the Government and Ministers have repeatedly acknowledged this will not be enough to meet the level of retrofit required.  That is why it will be important that we move to establish a new retrofitting delivery model, which will support people to make the decision to play their part in addressing climate change by investing their own money in upgrading their homes.  The plan sets out a range of actions to identify additional financing options, including affordable loan schemes that will complement the new delivery model and fill the funding gap.  The plan also commits to the introduction of enhanced delivery models and supports for households with lower incomes.</p> <p>  We are at the start of implementing a climate action plan.  It is an enormous task.  Significant progress has been made but we have more to do.  We must now learn from what has worked in the past as well as the experiences in other jurisdictions to design the additional interventions required to meet the Government&rsquo;s new level of ambition for energy efficiency and carbon emissions.</p> <p>  We are very happy to be here and we will work as best we can with the committee to answer any questions.</p></speech>

Declan Daly and I represent the Tipperary Energy Agency, a non-profit social enterprise with 26 staff supporting the low-carbon energy transition.  Tipperary Energy Agency has been successfully retrofitting homes throughout Ireland since 2005.  SuperHomes Ireland was created by the agency in 2015 with the aim of becoming a one-stop shop for home energy retrofit.</p><p>The European Commission and Parliament have identified the importance of one-stop shop solutions where homeowners can get advice, access to contractors, quality control, grants and finance, all in one place.  By the end of 2019, SuperHomes will have worked on more than 160 deep retrofit projects to BER A3 standard or better, and a further 59 homes to B2 standard.</p><p> The increase in carbon taxation and the target of 500,000 homes to be retrofitted to a minimum B2 standard, as set out in the national climate plan, will have a profound effect on how citizens approach energy in their home.  A high-quality retrofit product, on the scale proposed, will require significant investment in developing skills and standards in the sector.  This can be supported by a predictable long-term funding programme, which will also help with disseminating a clear message to the public and allow people to plan for their retrofit.  Financial packages, with low interest rates, tailored towards deep renovation will be necessary to build significant scale in the market.</p><p> Not only does deep renovation improve the long-term health of occupants, decrease energy costs and reduce carbon emissions, it produces high-quality job opportunities.  The deep renovation of one home supports an average of one job per year in terms of direct, indirect and induced jobs.  The SEAI deep retrofit pilot programme has demonstrated that there is an appetite in the industry.  However, major skills shortages are already restricting delivery of retrofit projects and driving up costs.  Addressing this shortage of skills will be key to maintaining a high-quality retrofit product that produces positive connotations in the public mind, thereby encouraging uptake.  Our model involves working with local engineers and contractors to build capacity in that area and provide technical and funding support to these projects.  We will be working with 29 separate contractors in 2019.  This approach and the approach taken by other independent energy agencies and community programmes will continue to be an important component in capacity development and industry training.  However, a widescale roll-out of deep renovation is fully reliant on an escalation of training programmes and standards, including new standards in training for heat pump installation.</p><p> A year-round, predictable, funding programme offers assurances to contractors, engineers and tradespeople that it is worthwhile to focus their resources towards deep renovation and will encourage businesses to enrol their staff in high standard training programmes.  At present, deep renovation programmes heavily concentrate project delivery in the period from June to October, creating a virtual standstill in delivery during the months between November and March.  A long-term programme will address this resource imbalance faced by contractors and service providers.  A complicated application process and short timelines for delivery create uncertainty and risk, which restrict market development and ultimately make Ireland's targets more difficult to achieve.  In our view, the State should prioritise de-risking renovation rather than increasing financial incentives to unaffordable levels.  A reliable funding model will also make the dissemination of grant supported solutions to the public much more straightforward, with the benefit of greater citizen engagement in the transition.</p><p> Low cost finance tailored towards deep renovation will be a theme that will emerge across the board today.  From our direct engagement with homeowners, it is evident that the finance offer has to make sense to members of the public at an instinctual level.  The question is whether they will be happy to upgrade their homes from a D rating to an A rating, for an additional &euro;2 to &euro;4 per day or &euro;100 per month for ten years, and repay the capital investment by the end of this term.  If we want to scale the market, we need affordable financial packages for homeowners, tailored towards deep renovation.  Successful schemes, such as the German KfW renovation programme, offer finance between 2% and 4%.  A long-term, predictable retrofit programme will undoubtedly create a more favourable lending environment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Gannon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019071000002#C00200"><p>Our insight into the market is based on upgrading approximately 400,000 homes over more than 15 years.  This is of a total stock of 2 million so it is a significant proportion.  This has been at a range of levels, predominantly shallow retrofit.  It is important that we begin to understand these distinctions.</p> <p>  In terms of the challenge to 2030, whereby we speak about 500,000 homes, right now through our programmes and the obligated parties, which are the energy supply companies, we can track upgrades and approximately 50,000 people per annum complete energy upgrades to their homes.  This does not include others who do not approach the grant programmes or the obligated parties and those who perform home improvements but do not seek a grant.  In terms of the scale of activity, we need to bring these people to deeper interventions and facilitate them.</p> <p>  We need to understand what we have in the building stock.  There are approximately 2 million homes in Ireland, with approximately 1.7 million of them occupied according to the most recent census.  Slightly less than 10% of these are in public ownership or funded by the public purse through approved housing bodies.  This becomes very important because if we understand the status of these homes and have a long-term plan for retrofit, we can create an aggregated portfolio that could be easier to finance.  Looking at this portfolio can allow us to think about it as a battery we can access in an economic downturn, retaining skills and jobs distributed throughout the country and taking advantage of lower cost construction during lean years.  Part of the plan should be looking at the opportunity of addressing a downturn.</p> <p>  More than 800,000 homes have building energy ratings, BER.  The key point is to look at where the general spike in ratings is.  Most homes are rated at the lower end of C and the upper end of D.  When we talk about a B2 level of ambition we need to understand where we are coming from and going to.  Interestingly, a spike is developing in A2 and A3 ratings as a result of our highly advanced building regulations.  That spike will continue to grow as we deliver newer houses.  The decline in the number of D and E ratings, which are yellow and orange in the graph, is largely because of the retrofit we have achieved.  Retrofit generally attacks this basket and we can already see the impact of the measures we are taking.</p> <p>  In terms of the performance to 2030, our deep retrofit programme seeks to examine the technical, financial and supply chain challenges to getting our housing stock to where it needs to be by 2050.  It also looks at houses that are poorly performing.  We are looking at a change from an F rating up to an A rating.  If we consider where the housing stock in Ireland is on average, which is somewhere between the ratings of C and D, and we know the ambition in the climate action plan is to reach a B2 rating, it is a different size of step we are talking about.  It has different technical and financial asks.  This is something that is very important for all of us in the climate space to understand and communicate consistently to people.  We are not always asking people to put &euro;50,000 or &euro;70,000 into their home.  We are asking something different.  We need to be clear about this and rational in our economic planning for it.  Interestingly, we have upgraded a home to deep retrofit for &euro;20,000.  We have also upgraded a home for &euro;125,000 because there is no typical Irish home or typical performance.  The average is slightly lower than &euro;50,000, just to give a perspective.</p> <p>  In terms of aggregation and finance models, a one-stop shop is the Holy Grail.  What is absolutely factually correct is that there is a range of one-stop shop models, with various funding methods, financing propositions for the consumer, back end funding, whether a national bank or the European Investment Bank with alternative investment funds, and various people who catalyse this activity.  In certain countries, it is a combination of Danfoss and VELUX - purely private sector entities - bringing something to the market.  In other countries, such as Ireland, there is a mixture of private sector and not-for-profit organisations bringing something to the market.  In other countries again, it is purely delivered by a national or regional local authority as we traditionally understand them.  What is important here is that there is no silver bullet that we can pluck off the shelf and say that is what we need to do.  We need to think carefully about the risks involved, how we communicate to people in such a way that they want to do it and how we create the supply chain and the financial ease with which it can be executed.</p> <p>  I do not want to underplay the role of skills in the supply chain.  Tipperary Energy Agency has already said the skills shortage is a key element that is stifling the delivery of homes in the marketplace.  Separately, it is driving up costs.  We need volume to drive down costs.  We also need more skills in the market to ease delivery and get more volume through the pipeline.  We have been working with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the National Standards Authority of Ireland and Wexford and Waterford Education and Training Board, and supporting others indirectly, to make sure those skills are provided but it is a challenge for us.  If we experience an economic downturn, what will be needed to come through it is the skill set and volume I mentioned.</p></speech>

The climate action plan places a huge responsibility on the construction industry to deliver 500,000 retrofits in our existing housing stock.  Our message today is very simple.  We are saying the industry will step up, expand our capacity, invest in the required technology and develop workers' skills and competencies in this area.  Of course, there is a "but".  This will only be with collaborative engagement with successive Governments over the next decade, perhaps with Deputy Dooley as Minister at some future time.  Obviously, it is a long-term plan.</p></speech>

We are currently stepping up to deliver these ambitious strategies.  We will also do so for the climate action plan.</p> <p>  However, it is important to warn the committee that delivering the climate action plan in addition to these strategies will require innovative programmes to help industry develop its capacity to deliver the deep retrofit programme.  Certainty, in terms of an implementation strategy and grant availability, is essential so that the hundreds of SME construction companies that will deliver the retrofit programme will make the significant upfront investment required. </p> <p>  Achieving this ambitious strategy will require more co-ordination with industry and across Government agencies than heretofore has ever been achieved in this jurisdiction.  For example, in 2016, DKM and Solas identified a potential demand for an additional 100,000 workers in the industry up to 2020.  Since mid-2013, an additional 1,000 people per month have joined the industry and the demand for construction activity in infrastructure and housing continues to increase dramatically.  The deep retrofit will require further expansion of the construction workforce at a time when we are approaching full employment. </p> <p>  Currently, the industry is partnering with Solas, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and through the construction sector group, to increase the numbers of people working in the industry.  However, it will be critical that the Government co-ordinates these actions and allocates resources committed to in the human capital initiative to developing and dispersing deep retrofit competence and other climate change techniques across the 45,000 companies operating in construction.</p> <p>  The climate action plan clearly identifies the significant scale of the challenge and how Ireland will achieve its 2030 targets for carbon emissions and key actions to achieve a net zero carbon emission score by 2050.</p> <p>  The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, worked closely with Engineers Ireland on its recent report, State of Ireland 2019: A Review of Housing Infrastructure in Ireland.  We identified a clear roadmap, including financing skills, that should be put in place.  Co-ordinated public investment in infrastructure is essential in delivering our new housing policy and it will be likewise for this particular programme.</p> <p>  The industry welcomes the ambition over the next 30-year time horizon.  To have any chance of success, we need to start to make a series of concrete actions today.  This will be challenging considering the 183 actions outlined in the plan.  Action 43, for example, outlines the need for an analysis of existing retrofit actions and the identification of the optimal mix of deep and medium home energy efficiency upgrades across the country.  This analysis will only commence in quarter one of 2020.  This means that the delivery window for 500,000 retrofits will be closer to eight and a half years rather than ten. </p> <p>  The CIF also believes that, to be effective, any retrofitting scheme must address houses in their entirety from an energy efficiency perspective.  If the scheme has too narrow a focus on single aspects of improvement, it will not deliver optimum results for the consumer, the industry, the economy and of course the environment. </p> <p>  As I have said this will require a huge amount of co-ordination between industry and several Government Departments, including the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Finance, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  We are suggesting that an advisory group with industry, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is established with a view to implementing and monitoring against specific targets.  I cannot stress enough the importance of giving certainty to construction companies so that they know there is a pipeline of work ahead which will encourage them to make the funding that is necessary for upskilling and so on. </p> <p>  In terms of developing the required certainty, it is worth noting that the existing pilot programme for deep retrofit is due to expire this year.  Ensuring the SEAI is fully resourced to process applications for the current pilot programme is a necessary confidence measure.  Industry responded when the pilot programme was announced with many investing in their capacities to deliver retrofit activity.  </p> <p>  The recent example of the home renovation incentive shows how effective these sorts of measures can be for the industry, Government and citizen.  Irish homeowners have spent more than &euro;2,471 million in total carrying out 147,349 home improvement projects over the past four years.  If the incentive is there, the capacity of the industry to respond is also there.  It shows what can happen with the correct alignment between consumer, Government policy and industry&rsquo;s capacity. </p> <p>  The retrofit scheme has the potential to underpin our efforts to build a stable and sustainable construction industry.  This stream of work, and that included in the national development plan and Project 2040, can be used to give comfort to young people and their parents that there are viable long-term careers in construction.  The Government, with industry, should also examine the potential opportunities for the development of apprenticeships in areas such as deep retrofit and the message that there are stable and sustainable careers arising in the industry should be communicated to young people. </p> <p>  The retrofit scheme could help resolve the growing divide between Dublin and other regions which is a major threat to our economic and societal well-being.  I heard the T&aacute;naiste talking yesterday about concerns over a hard Brexit and the potential loss of 50,000 to 60,000 jobs.  There is certainly scope within the retrofit scheme to provide significant bundles of work for regional construction companies and these companies are dispersed throughout the country and across every community in the country.  Having contractors delivering retrofit in rural and urban areas would provide an economic lifeblood to rural and regional towns and villages.</p></speech>

I thank our guests for their presentations because they are helpful.  From our perspective, we fully appreciate that, if we are going to make a meaningful impact on our carbon emissions, we must deal with the heating sector and home heating in particular so what our guests have talked about is relevant.</p> <p>  My understanding is that much of the retrofit programme is concentrated between May and October.  That has an impact on the skill sets of people who want to do this on a year-round basis.  The activity is only in a relatively short period of time so people cannot concentrate on that work alone.</p> <p>  What is the long-term proposal that will come from the pilot deep retrofit programme?  Will it become a full, national programme, or has the pilot project ended?  Is the Department taking applications this year or has it come to an end?</p> <p>  Will the witnesses try to give us some indication as to what level of support will be in place for homeowners?  This is the big issue.  Mr. Manley talked about the average cost being approximately &euro;50,000.  Constituents glaze over when one talks about &euro;50,000, &euro;40,000 or &euro;30,000.  Many people I speak to are coming to the end of their mortgages, or are at the end of them, so it is an older home, their lives have changed and their kids are in college.  There is not another pot with &euro;30,000 to &euro;50,000 there to spend on this kind of programme.  It is not that people do not want to do it but I certainly get the sense that people, in general terms, cannot and will not be able to afford it. </p> <p>  When Mr. Manley talks about green finance, it is going to require significant backing of the State.  Many people's creditworthiness has been challenged through the past ten years and, if the same rules apply to normal drawdown on finance or normal sourcing of loans, there will be many rejections.  Could Mr. Manley talk to us a little bit about ideas the Department has about that?  We are really trying to encourage the people who are in these homes to do the work and buy into the programme.  That is why we must be helpful in guiding them early.</p></speech>

That is obviously going to involve a grant level support.  It will involve a level of very low cost financing.  We have AIB bringing low financing options to the market.  How can we channel that right through the retail system and get it to the distribution system?  Does that involve a level of State guarantee which would mitigate the issue of risk?  Our own sense is that we will have to bring the cost of financing down to as near to zero as humanly possible.  It also must be long-term financing so people can phase it in over time and see the advantage in it.</p><p>It is not going to be easy to do it but we have to do it.  We have seen examples on the Continent and they have been referenced by the Tipperary Energy Agency in terms of what is on there.</p><p> In terms of the time of works, the allocation of work is around the Estimates cycle.  At the end of the year we know what is coming in the following year and then we notify it to the SEAI and it maps out the programme for the following year.  That is something which we need to take on board, in particular as we scale the programmes and get them to a much larger size.  It was also mentioned by Tipperary Energy Agency.  There is no particular restriction on the time of year he work is done but, practically, if people are going to recoup the grant, they will have to make their claim through the contractor and provide the receipts and invoices to the SEAI and the Department by year end.  Typically, we clear off our accounts in the last week of November and the first week of December.  That all acts back and narrows down the time.  It is a fair point on that one.</p><p> The most difficult question is the long-term position on the pilot programme.  It was made very clear that it was a pilot programme.  The objective was to establish what the supply chain is like; how we can develop it; how we could mobilise people to do it and what works.  As Mr. Gannon said, no two houses are the same so one must look at how one manages that.  The pilot phase should come to a conclusion at the end of this year and then it has to be reviewed and a decision must be made on which bits work and which bits we must improve.</p></speech>

Anyone advising people in their homes or anyone who has gone to the website will know that is the date for the end of this year.  It is traditional that we have a closing date for the programmes.</p> <p>  I will quickly pick up on the other point, which relates to finance.  I will go back to the slide where I showed what deep retrofit means and what is involved in moving from where the average house is to B2.  We are not asking everyone to look at &euro;50,000 or &euro;100,000.  What we are saying to people is we need to collectively understand that a B2 level retrofit is something smaller than that.  Looking at the cost optimal study we completed for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government when it was looking at the renovation regulations, that could be &euro;15,000, &euro;20,000 or &euro;25,000, which is still a lot of money.  We still need to get over that hump.</p> <p>  A key point in someone's decision-making cycle will be the purchase of a house.  It is perhaps the only point in time when one is talking about an even bigger sum.  In Europe, they are now looking at green mortgages where it is being considered whether finance could be facilitated with a lower mortgage rate for a better house.  Domestically, the home renovation incentive has worked and we need to look at tax rebate in the UK.  They are also looking at stamp duty rebate and whether that would incentivise an upgrade at the point of purchase.</p> <p>  In Ireland, we have tested finance for retrofit with the credit unions, some of the high street banks and an employer model with a number of different employers, which operates like the bike-to-work scheme whereby they would finance and work through the salary on their side of the net.  No one has been static on this.  Reflecting on Europe, in no jurisdiction do they have a single offering that works.  It is important for us also to understand that in Ireland a single offering may not work, and that a certain demographic might always need grants.  For some, it might be at the point of mortgage and for others it might be taxation.  We need to think of a blend, but we do not have the answer yet.</p></speech>

The Government's climate action plan refers to 300,000 heat pumps.  We know from our field visit to the Tipperary Energy Agency that it is not just about replacing the heat pumps.  If I was to get a heat pump in my house, because of its age, I would have to replace all the radiators.  Multiple items would have to be replaced; it is not just a case of replacing the boiler with a heat pump.</p> <p>  In other committees the time ticks down in terms of the amount allocated to the questioner rather than the combined question and answer time.  I have limited time.  Could the witnesses comment on the challenges of retrofitting 1970s and 1980s apartment complexes?</p> <p>  One of the most impressive pieces of work we did was the field trip organised by the Tipperary Energy Agency and Tipperary County Council.  As far as I know the agency provides a one-stop-shop, so if I want to retrofit my house I go to the agency, get the BER organised, it finds out what range of retrofit I want and it provides accredited engineers and companies so that we do not get cowboys.  We need to consider a similar model either on a county-by county basis or at national level.  As Deputy Dooley said, one of the greatest challenges that faces us when we decide to retrofit is that we get bamboozled with the volume of information coming at us.  Second, because of the amount it will cost, people are entitled to the best advice and not to have a cowboy or cowgirl come in and fleece us for a low-rate job.  What are the thoughts of the witnesses on that?</p></speech>

It is not okay for a contractor to roll up to a homeowner and promise the sun, moon and stars.  It is a little more complicated than that.  What we would recommend through the one-stop-shop model is what has been outlined in terms of the engineering advice.

There are always going to be costs associated with the work but the value to the homeowner should be evident right from the outset.</p> <p>  In terms of the reference earlier to a costing of &euro;50,000, that is probably an average of what we see, but there is no one particular house; there is a multitude of houses.  The price may go from &euro;30,000 to &euro;70,000 or even beyond that.  That is an eye-watering sum for anyone to consider, so the transition must be explained to the homeowner in a clear way.  People must know what they are going to get and have confidence that what has been recommended will deliver it.  We can see from our analysis of work that we have carried out that 60% to 70% in savings is possible.  When one does it properly, one can see the long-term payback.  One can work it out.  When one blends it with the right type of financial offer and the closer one brings that to ten or 15 years the more sense it will make to the public.  The message must be communicated very clearly by an independent professional that is trusted.  That is our view in terms of how we go forward.</p> <p>  The pilot programme has been very successful in terms of switching contractors and others onto what it means to deep retrofit but it is a pilot and we acknowledge that.  We are looking forward to a scheme that is year 'round.  The timescale for delivery is March-April to November-December, which may be extended, but they are the confines in which we are working.  What we do find with those constraints is that contractors who are trying to dedicate themselves to retrofit in the long term let go staff or take staff on a part-time basis and that will limit their capacity to deliver.  Across the board, we see a difficulty in committing to deep retrofitting without there being a predictable programme for both the contractor and the homeowner.</p></speech>

It is something that other jurisdictions have started to mimic because it has that quality.  We know they are tax compliant and that they have insurance.  If they do not perform under our inspections, they get removed from the register.</p><p>That is a mechanism Ireland is very practised at and one we encourage.</p></speech>

I visited Tipperary Energy Agency and was very impressed by what it does.  As with the roll-out of broadband in local authority areas, it is a question of having teams within the local authorities, or bolted onto them, so the arrangement can work and each idiosyncrasy in each area can be examined.  One could deal with things in smaller packages for the consumer.</p> <p>  With regard to retrofitting, and staying on the subject of smart finance, has the Department considered any innovative approaches related to repaying through energy bills or property tax?  If so, when will they be launched?  Is there any talk of timelines?</p> <p>  My next question is also for the Department.  Could the European Union play a greater role in accelerating the widespread provision of low-cost green finance?  It has been said there are myriad options in Europe.  Let us boil it down to Ireland's current economic position, standard of living and cost of living.  I would be grateful for answers.</p></speech>

One of the first actions of the climate action plan is setting up a task force to consider the delivery model for what we want to do.  Taking the point others have made on how we deal with apartment blocks, bring things together and deal with the issue of quality, on the Continent some of the groups give guarantees of 35 years regarding energy-efficiency projects.  Thus, if someone does energy efficiency work on a house, it is guaranteed for 35 years.  How we do that without locking out the small contractors, who will not be able to get the bonding and insurance related to finance of the level in question for that period, will not be not easy.</p> <p>  With regard to smart finance, the relevant action in the climate action plan is No. 54.  This has been embarked upon.  We have engaged with NewEra and SBCI.  How can we put together a package that combines State support and cheap EU money and can cascade down to the retail level?  There is not much point in doing so unless we get the delivery model right.  If we put too much money into the system too soon, it will simply result in an escalation of price.  We have, therefore,  got to create the delivery model for a very expanded programme so that as the money comes in, it will work.  Otherwise, money will be put into the process with little or no gain.</p></speech>

We are considering that.  It has been tried in the past in a number of pilot projects - Mr. Jim Gannon referred to them already - whereby companies became the conduit.  Credit unions, for example, provide the finance and the company channels it to employees, who then repays it as part of the salary arrangement.  That it is fine when the amount is relatively small.  If I am borrowing only a few thousand euro and walk out on the company, it can be absorbed within the system.</p></speech>

On Monday, we noted that, in the farming sector, SSE Airtricity is doing a deal with Glanbia whereby farmers are funding the installation of solar equipment, whose generated energy can be spilled back into the system.  That kind of tie-up is very much part of the future.  I cannot say it will be effected in six or 12 months.</p></speech>

Let us consider the sale of appliances to those who consumed electricity at a point of time in the past.  That type of system exists.  In a couple of countries right now - links in our submission will send members in the right direction - this method is being tested again.  In Ireland, there was not an appetite and people did not believe it was deliverable in 2013 at 2014 because of a lack of access to back-end finance.  They did not believe they would get finance cheaply.  The energy suppliers are also in a 1% and 2% margin business.  At the time in question, it would have been hard for those concerned to proceed but it is definitely an option that works in other jurisdictions and one that will form part of what has to be considered.</p></speech>

We are proposing to build up to 20,000 new houses every year.  The Government's target for 2030 is to have 500,000 houses or units retrofitted.  There is an insufficient number of tradesmen with the ability to deliver the projects on time.  How does the CIF believe the skills gap could be bridged?  What do we need to do at national level and through policy to ensure we have the tradesmen required to reach the target of 20,000 or 25,000 units per year but also the target of 500,000 in the next 11 years?</p></speech>

Of those who emigrated during our deep recession, those who chose to come home are largely back.  There are still people coming back.  There is still considerable demand because of people coming in from all over Europe.  Just recently, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation extended work permits to workers from outside Europe.  It lifted the restrictions pertaining to those with many of the construction skills to allow them to come here.  It is not an immediate solution.</p> <p>  The challenge we now have is to go into the schools.  That is what we are doing ourselves.  We are planning to enhance the campaign through the construction sector group with the support of the Department of Education and Skills and the industry.  I refer to a 50:50 funded scheme to encourage young people to consider construction again as a sustainable career.  One reason they did not is that it is still sore in people's minds that individuals, including those who had not even finished their apprenticeships, just lost their jobs overnight and were forced to emigrate.  If it is certain that there is to be a lengthy retrofit scheme and that the capital programme will continue, given an economy that remains solid, construction will be a long-term career for the future.</p></speech>

A large number of plumbers and electricians are coming through the system because our mechanical and electrical sector is very strong.  We are building for foreign direct investors and we are building data centres and pharmaceutical plants.  We are not just building them in Ireland but all over the rest of Europe.  That pipeline is very good.  The apprenticeship scheme is being considered in terms of its length but that is certainly a very weak spot.  New technology, off-site production and so on will probably help.  Many are attempting to engineer block laying and bricklaying out of current builds.</p></speech>

There is a lack of qualified engineers and associated training programmes.  One might look to the Austrian model, which has been very successful in reducing carbon emissions by more than 45%.  Austrian plumbers have to train in renewable technologies.  More concerted market intervention is probably needed.  It is worth remembering that we are in a construction boom but we are also in a declared climate emergency.  With carbon tax signals and a likely increase in the price of fuel down the line, the signals are suggesting a diversion from the addition of a sun room or converting the attic to investing in home retrofitting.  There will be a movement of skills and labour to more important things.</p></speech>

They had to wait even longer for payment.</p><p>Where jobs had been allocated to contractors, I understand that it was communicated by the SEAI that a hold was to be put on the completion of these jobs.  Contractors that had built up capacity to deliver the work at the request of the SEAI had to let people go and were put in a very tight cashflow situation while householders, who we are rightly encouraging to avail of these schemes, did not know where they stood.</p></speech>

The growth in demand for those schemes has been far more than we could have anticipated.  People have engaged, which is a positive thing.  It feeds well into going forward.  In terms of financing for the year, about this time every year, we do a mid-year review of what is and is not working.  These things mostly came out of the C4 subhead of the Department.  There are 14 different programmes underneath that.  Some will go quicker while others will go slower so we will rejig that to make sure there is sufficient funding in those programmes for this year.  Mr. Deegan might take us through what we have spent so far.</p></speech>

Again, given the upsurge in activity, we have found that there has been a delay in getting to it with regard to all programmes, so it is not about a single programme.  There has been a bit of delay with all programmes, which is because of the success of the Citizens' Assembly, this committee's report and people's interest in that.  As there is an increased volume, it is simply a matter of us catching through a dramatic increase.  Take the example of electric vehicles, where there was a fourfold increase in the first quarter of the year.  People are far more active in respect of this so we are trying to catch up with that.</p></speech>

There is the shallow one and then there is the deep retrofit.  Could I get a breakdown of the figures for shallow retrofit versus deep retrofit?  Some colleagues have rightly said that when people hear that it might cost &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000, they shy away.  It is almost like breaking it down into chunks and explaining to people that shallow retrofit is the road to it.  Not many people would have the entire amount to do their homes.  Given that the most inefficient houses in this State were built before 1979, which was when the idea of energy saving and insulation first came in, I note that 50% of our housing stock is pre-1979.  Obviously, theses house are the most expensive ones to retrofit.  They involve the deep retrofit about which we are talking.  As 72% of homes in rural areas are detached houses, we are talking about large areas.  Our homes are larger than the European average.  We have more rooms per person.  We seem to live in luxury but in the cold.  It is a bigger area in its entirety to retrofit, not just by unit but by square acreage - whatever measurement is used - so we have more to retrofit.  Given the really prohibitive costs, which most people would say that they cannot afford, the green economy, greening our environment and electric vehicles, those demands are almost coming at us because we are being made to feel guilty about what we are doing.  Sometimes that is contraindicated in terms of people taking responsibility and getting something out of it for themselves because there is a feeling of punishment and dipping into our pockets once again.  We are only shortly out of a massive recession that did a lot of damage to people in this country.  Would it be worthwhile prioritising the interventions, whatever they may be - shallow or deep retrofits - for pre-1979 homes given that they make up 50% of homes in this country?  Another issue is doing it chunk by chunk focusing on attic and roof insulation with the draughtproofing.  We did it previously in the 1980s.  Other issues include low energy lighting, the lagging of water pipes and tanks and the shallow retrofit that is relatively affordable and much more easily grasped by people.</p> <p>  For a while, I have been very curious about the material used for insulation on the exterior - what is known as wrap-around.  We saw the horrific fire hazards shown in the Grenfell Tower fire.  How combustible is that material?  Have we figured that out?  It is not just about homes.  There was a fire at a hospital in Melbourne last week that involved wrap-around insulation.  Parts of some hospitals in Britain have been shut down for a number of months or years to take off all this cladding.  This cladding can be very dangerous for householders, hospitals and schools.  </p></speech>

Yes, the numbers are large.  It could be up to &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000.  I bought my house for less than that when I bought it many years ago.  It is a very large sum of money.  That is why we are looking so hard at the long-term financing option and delivering that at a very low cost of interest over a long-term period in order that things can happen.  The simple reality is that dealing with climate change is not free.  If it was, we would have done it before.  We must make changes now.  We would not have used petrol or diesel if it had always been cheaper to do other things.  An enormous amount of effort is being made to look at the low-cost financing option and finding ways of reducing the cost of delivery.  We are thinking about an area-based approach with aggregation across schemes.</p> <p>  In terms of standards, I remind members that it is the cost-optimal level of performance so it is not an absolute level of performance.  It is what works in a particular building.  There is a formula of work for that over a 30-year period.   Perhaps Mr. Gannon or some other witnesses could answer the question about technical issues relating to fire hazards.  </p></speech>

The climate action plan states:</p><blockquote>For most areas of environmental damage, a key problem is that those inflicting the damage do not pay the cost of the damage they inflict.  This is the rationale for charging a carbon price.</blockquote> <p>To whom is the Department referring as the people who are inflicting the damage?  It sounds decidedly punitive and is directed at people who have little or no choice over their level of emissions because of, for example, issues of poor-quality insulation in council houses across the country, which are rank with damp and so on.  Is the Department referring to them?  Are they the people who are at fault?  Is the Department's policy going to punish them as opposed to people who are wealthy and can afford to insulate their homes?  In addressing this issue, how will the Department ensure the just transition?  I assume that it is not referring to companies that sell petrol on the side of the road or to other companies that produce polluting products, but to householders and, since public transport is not good enough, people who drive cars.</p><p>Is the SEAI concerned that the better energy warmer homes scheme and the warmth and well-being pilot scheme, which provide supports for retrofits, are limited to those who are in receipt of the fuel allowance and that people who are just over the eligibility criteria cannot avail of them?  The Government has set its face against raising the eligibility criteria.  What do the delegates from the SEAI think of this point?  I meet the people affected every week.  Elderly people, people with disabilities and so on tell me that they would like to retrofit their homes but, because their incomes are just over the threshold, they cannot benefit from the schemes and the costs of the other schemes are too punitive for them.  For those over the eligibility criteria, the costs are generally punitive.  Do we not need something that is much more radical in this regard?  I do not know whether my next point has already been discussed, but if the ESB or the State in some shape or form gave people grants upfront, could the difference between their current emissions and the reductions that would result from the retrofitting be the basis of any repayment of grants?  In other words, they would never pay more as a result of getting a loan and the grant would still be repaid because it is only the difference.</p></speech>

For example, the cost I impose if I drive a diesel car and the cost of the diesel itself are not the same.  That applies to us all when we do something that imposes a cost on others that we do not pay for ourselves.  This is not demonising anyone.  Rather, it recognises that the person making the decision is sometimes not the person who bears the cost.  This issue has been examined.</p> <p>  Regarding criteria, there is a finite sum of money available for most of the schemes that we fund and the SEAI operates.  Those criteria seek to prioritise a group of people in that space.  If we expanded eligibility, we would expand the financial demand, but how would that be financed?  We recognise that, if there is a cut-off point and someone is just a tiny bit over it, it can seem very inequitable.  However, that is where it is at.</p> <p>  On the suggestion of the ESB, any of the other energy companies or a different State body having a role, we see that as part of the future whereby part of the savings that a person makes - there is a range of allowances in that regard - could form part of the scheme's financing.  Some people are able to finance changes themselves, while others cannot.  Currently, we provide 100% financing for those in the most difficult circumstances.  The climate action plan makes clear that the scale of investment required across residential and other sectors cannot be done by a Government cheque.  There simply is not enough money to pay for it.  It is a question of finding a balance between that and creating grant supports and other financing mechanisms so that we get done what needs to be done.</p></speech>

The warmer homes programme has qualifying criteria.  If one subtracts or adds to them, there will always be people who have an ability to pay and those who do not.  Generally speaking, it is those who cannot pay whom we try to address through the warmer homes programme.  Although we do not have empirical evidence, we noticed throughout the recession that those with an ability to pay constituted a declining cohort.  They are often referred to as the squeezed middle.  There was a dearth of activity in that area.</p> <p>  Regarding the second question, there is probably no single solution for Ireland.  In light of how other countries intend to approach financing homeowners, it is likely that there will always be a cohort who can only be activated through a grant.  Others will look towards a tax rebate.</p> <p>  The concept of "pay as you save" is gaining traction once again in a couple of regions in America and the UK.  It was examined in Ireland in 2013 and 2014, but conditions did not seem right.  As part of the review in the all-of-Government action plan, though, it must be considered as an option, given that it works.  For example, this approach works in the Irish commercial sector, with the capital being brought to the solution and the savings being shared, meaning that there is no increase or so on.</p></speech>

There is some potential in respect of the 372,000 people who are in receipt of the fuel allowance.</p><p>This is a subsidy of some &euro;234 million in 2019.  Within that there probably exists at least the potential or incentive for lower bills and healthier homes to redirect or look at that payment to see how it can be used to retrofit some of these homes.  For example, we retrofitted three homes through the healthy home scheme in Tipperary.  Those three homes were paying, collectively, &euro;7,100 in fuel costs through a combination of oil and electric bills.  The cost of retrofitting each of those homes was &euro;45,000, but we worked it out to be cost neutral because of the amount of fuel that was used.  It paid for itself.  There are 370,000 people in this situation where there is an obvious incentive to intervene in improving the home at a fairly neutral or low cost.</p></speech>

This is what we are giving them &euro;700 a year to do.  We find that when we go out to the market to retrofit those houses the people are now putting in renewable energy heating source, and now they are paid to use a renewable heating source instead of fossil fuel.  It is not just about simple payback, there are also the health benefits; those people now live in a healthy house and they will not end up in our hospitals costing the State &euro;800 or &euro;900 per day in dealing with respiratory illness and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD.</p></speech>

I am interested to know if ventilation is being put in all deep retrofits in houses that work technically.  Mr. Turmes also said that perhaps a 30 year payback period is needed for a loan financing system, which is longer than I had heard or any of the figures I see here.  Perhaps the Department representatives could respond to that.  I do not know if that is viable.</p> <p>  Has anybody considered the Energiesprong method that has been prioritised by the Dutch for social housing? Are we looking at that kind of all-in-one, wraparound model?</p> <p>  Given the scale of the challenge presented by deep retrofit, should we start switching away from the small-scale grant?  Is there a risk that if we keep going on the smaller jobs it will reduce the demand for the bigger projects that we need?  I am aware this would not be popular but others may feel differently on it.  I believe there is a real case to be made for it.</p> <p>  I am interested to know how many of the 100,000 workers who will be working in the construction sector Mr. Parlon believes would be working in retrofitting.  Does Mr. Parlon have a figure for how many jobs he thinks would be in that area?</p> <p>  With regard to the work that needs to be done in public buildings, where is that in all of this?  If I hear correctly from the Tipperary Energy Agency, it appears to indicate there is a problem because there is summer project work and then a winter valley.  Is there a possibility of balancing that annual work programme with the work needed in the public buildings?</p> <p>  I have two further questions for the Department officials.  Are we considering as a policy measure any mechanism where, if people are renting, landlords would be required over the next ten year period, for example, to deliver some sort of an upgrade?</p> <p>  I know that every house is different but many houses are similar.  Is there any mechanism, perhaps in the pilot scheme, of really aggregating houses with a builder if there is a contract for 100 houses or 500 houses or a whole street?  This would seem to me to be a way to get costs down.  Aggregation could be the key.  What plans do we have for that? </p></speech>

Aggregation is defined in the climate action plan as an area-based approach, which would bring together a standardisation of approach, aggregation of skill sets, aggregation of finance and aggregation of expertise.  This is very much in focus.  Action No. 46 provides for setting up a taskforce on that, which is already being activated.</p> <p>  On the matter of landlords, it is a very difficult issue to manage because the current position of those in the rental sector is very difficult.  It is a very tight market at the moment and increasing the standards in an already tight market is difficult to manage, but it does have to be part of our future.  It is very much in focus and is also identified in the climate action plan.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about Energiesprong method.  It is cited as one of the examples in the programme.  It is a very attractive proposition that provides a total offering to the householder whereby they get a technical assurance as well as the physical work.  It brings finance to the process also.  It is fine to say it is a good model but we need to look at how it might be made to work in Ireland.  Our tenure is very different from that on the Continent.  We do not tend to have corporate bodies with large housing stocks on similar sites where they can actually decant one group and move people through it.  Nonetheless, the system offers the future.</p> <p>  On the issue of ventilation, I am not an expert and I am sure the representatives from Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, can be more accurate on that question with regard to how one looks at managing airflow in a very tightly sealed building.  The sealing of a building in itself will not work, so airflow is important.</p> <p>  On the 30 year period for finance, it would not be set in stone.  When looking at very large sums of money for deep retrofitting of housing spreading that at near zero cost over longer periods can make it a much more attractive proposition.  Again, it is an element that has to be looked at.  Action No. 54 in the climate action plan looks very much at developing a new financing model.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct that if we were to move away from the smaller grants it would not be very attractive, but action No. 52 - the third bullet point - proposes to develop the proposal for the phase-out of grants for shallow energy retrofitting measures by 2022.  It is there in black and white in the plan.  There will be myriad changes across the board.</p></speech>

If one multiplies the 500,000 houses by the &euro;50,000 average for a deep retrofit, I am not too sure of my own maths but I believe that would be &euro;25 billion.  That is 250,000 jobs over a ten year period.  That is a lot of work.  Retrofitting is highly labour intensive.  There is not a great opportunity to automate it or do any of it off site.  There is a lot of work involved in deep retrofitting our housing stock.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.129" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Gannon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019071000002#J00600"><p>With regard to aggregation, in any jurisdiction this is what people are moving towards.  In Ireland accessible public sector and publicly funded stock is quite important and can be a catalyst.  We can turn it up or down in economic downturns and upturns, but we can also understand explicitly the inventory and perhaps engage with contractors on the basis that we can guarantee  X number of homes and they should recruit the rest.</p> <p>  Internationally and across Europe people are puzzling over the issue of the split incentive between landlords and tenants.  It is very difficult and is likely to be a combination of regulation and incentive.</p> <p>  On moving away for the grants for shallow retrofits, it is important that we encourage people to move to deeper and greater investment but not through guilt.  Separately, for those who want to do just what they can it is important that we do not disincentivise them.  We need to look at a blended option for different people who can afford to do different things.  I shall hand over to Ms Coyle to address the query on ventilation, but I also acknowledge that our warmth and well-being programme looks explicitly - with international health experts - at the benefits for people with COPD of retrofitting the home.  That would encompass projects such as the healthy homes project in Tipperary and it is core also to deep retrofit, including the empirical evidence we are generating off the back of it.</p></speech>

Through our deep retrofit pilot programme and the warmth and well-being scheme we have a number of research and development programmes ongoing with a number of institutes in Ireland.  They are monitoring the air quality in the building before and after the deep retrofit.  With the deep retrofit programme we require that mechanical ventilation is installed.  We do pre and post pressure testing on the buildings.  We also install mechanical ventilation associated with it to encourage fresh air in those spaces.</p></speech>

Once that is done it is best practice to put in demand control or heat recovery ventilation.</p> <p>  The Energiesprong system is usually a factory system and all of the panels and the system are made off site and shipped to the site.  Normally one would need to have a whole street to sign up to it .  Perhaps it would suit social housing more than the private market, and there is also the skilled workforce and labour required to do it.</p> <p>  On switching grants from shallow to deep retrofit, we have found that many people pick the low hanging fruit.  They pick the shallow retrofits.  When the difficult conversations come around on switching from fossil fuels or putting on solar panels are the high cost options.  The shallow retrofit costs in the region of &euro;3,000 but once the homeowner does that it makes it difficult for the likes of us at the coalface to go out to the homeowners and convince them to do the difficult things such as the windows, the heat pump or the external cladding, which are the expensive works.  There are contractors who cherrypick the easy or low hanging fruit.</p><p>It is prohibiting the deep retrofit in the future.  It has to be a one-stop shop system with the house done completely and not requiring coming back to it in 20 or 30 years time.</p><p> Our contractors were more than happy to build the skills but the uncertainty of the deep retrofit programme caused an issue.  As it is done in a three or four-month window, they have to let people go or divert them to public buildings which require different skills.  To bring market costs down, we have a SuperHomes approved contractor system.  All of our contractors go through a process.  The first few only do one to five jobs in the first year.  Once they have those done, we approve them for 30 to 50 jobs.  Those contractors have the skills to do a deep retrofit.</p><p> Not all contractors have the skills to do thermal bridging, air tightness or know how to install a heat pump properly.  They are used to oil or gas boiler fitting which means it is a different skill for which they need to train.</p><p> We are the one-stop shop, the point of contact for a homeowner.  We bring them through all the process.  We re-assure them they are spending the money correctly and we avail of the grants through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  Ventilation is important as mould and dampness can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, in older housing stock.</p></speech>

Under the EU energy performance of buildings directive, every five years we do a cost-optimal study.  We look at the lifecycle assessment of a building which includes maintenance, installation and running costs, as well as taking into account carbon costs and inflation through fuel costs, etc.  This all feeds into a cost-optimal study.  That defines where we are in terms of building regulations and what level we are trying to achieve.</p> <p>  We take typical building stock.  However, as Mr. Jim Gannon mentioned, one can get that odd house that will not fall into the typical building stock category.  The cost-optimal study defines certain insulation levels and heating and lighting system performance levels which are available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The cost-optimal study gives the details of the spec and where we should be targeting to get the best energy performance while looking at the macro-costs.  The latter account for the initial capital costs, as well as running, maintenance and carbon costs.  Does that make any sense?</p></speech>

A project in the Picardy region of France provides an example of a possible approach to the mix of finance.  Some 20% of project costs are financed through the European Investment Bank, EIB, and 20% are financed through the regional authorities.  That sort of security allows the homeowner to borrow at a much lower interest rate.  They typically borrow at rates of 2% or 2.5%.  Those rates are a game changer.  We can all identify the problem we are seeing at the moment, which is slow finance that is not tailored towards renovation.  At the same time, a borrower can get 0% interest rates to finance on a car on the forecourt.  We are at typical rates of 6.7% to 7.9%.  That means there is much less incentive for anyone considering it, because any savings will be swallowed up by interest payments.  It is not beyond our ken to come up with a financial package.  We have successfully done that with many other sectors.  We could probably agree on the need for that in order to increase scale.</p></speech>

We achieved good results with those.  Some credit unions are involved in these.  There will always be a premium for high street banks to develop a new product but they realise that a paradigm shift is coming.  The Department has already mentioned ongoing work with the SBCI, NewERA and others to examine options here.  The employer model has been tested successfully.  It is analogous to the cycle to work scheme.  Other options such as tax rebates or green mortgages are being used in other jurisdictions.  Again, no single one of these is likely to be the solution for everybody.  We must package several of these differently for different people with different abilities to pay.</p></speech>

It will offer a reduction on a mortgage in cases where a building achieves certain standards.  The bank is talking about that as a precursor to introducing a retrofit space model.  Not to disparage that but our big focus is on creating a large pool of finance at very low rates of interest.  This will mean that people can undertake the work and pay for it either through a pay-as-you-save scheme or a loan remuneration scheme over time where energy savings make a significant contribution to repayment.</p></speech>

There is more work to be done around financing but at least we can take some empirical models from the SEAI research.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Tom Parlon back to the House, if that has not been done already.  I am sure it has.  I refer to Part L of the building regulations and the skill set needed for retrofitting.  A finite pool of labour is available for construction in Ireland at present but that is going to ramp up.  I have a two-part question.  First, how will the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, and others train the type of people the Tipperary Energy Agency is supplying in order to meet the demand? </p></speech>

We have discussed nearly zero energy buildings.  What is the energy fit in these buildings?  Is it boilers, advanced boilers or heat exchangers?  What is the CIF's interpretation of Part L for new builds?  My fear is that solar and heat exchangers might not be part of it.  Is there any thinking within CIF on that? </p></speech>

We were heavily involved in the consultation on Part L, which concerns conservation of fuel and energy.  It is heavily linked to Part F, which concerns ventilation.  The closing date for initial submissions to the consultation was about this time last year.  We have been heavily involved since.  It was announced on the signing of the statutory instruments that Part L will come into effect on 31 October 2019, with substantial completion required for 31 October 2020.</p> <p>  The requirements for nearly zero energy buildings allow for multiple options.  The calculation is based on averages.  There will definitely be a move towards heat recovery systems.  We will probably see an increase in the number of electrical heat pumps.  That does not negate the option of natural ventilation.  It is more difficult to achieve but that option remains.  We recognise that.  As we touched on earlier in reference to available skill sets, the credibility of apprenticeships and the large numbers entering the mechanical and electrical areas will improve skills in this particular area.  It is important that regulations applied to new stock create high confidence in standards and provide assurance to consumers.  That will complement the retrofit details that will come down the line.  </p></speech>

We have developed a training specification for both new builds and retrofit.  This will create skills relevant to ventilation, the finishes on wall construction etc.  That training specification is in place.  Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board has already started to roll out the training.  The action plan calls for this to be rolled out nationwide.</p> <p>  The issue of nearly zero energy buildings is relevant to the new Part L of the building regulations.  Part L has been available on the website of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government since last week or the week before.  That means we basically set performance targets.  There is a requirement for 20% renewable technology within all new building stock that goes onto the market.  That requirement is technology-neutral, so heat pumps, photovoltaic technology and other technologies can be used. </p></speech>

We are now going to load the grid.  We will effectively use fossil fuels to add more power to the grid to meet the targets from a building perspective.  At the same time, there will be an exponential increase in the amount of fossil fuel we use to keep the grid going.  I am playing devil's advocate now-----</p></speech>

The remaining 30% will partially consist of fossil fuels.  However new emerging technologies, particularly around storage of hydrogen, will bring about a change there.</p> <p>  There are two other points I would like to make.  First I will quote a figure; oil systems used to make up about 36% of our central heating systems.  That has now decreased to 5%.  That is a massive change in a very short period and it is directly related to regulations.  Regarding labour supply, we must realise that about 60,000 people come out of the second level system every year.  Between now and the end of 2030 that will add up to about 650,000 people, to which migration and returning emigrants can be added.  Some of us will leave the labour force in that period.  We need to make it an attractive career proposition and provide training.</p><p>The climate action plan, in both the funding under the NDP and the clear message about the long-term objectives, gives us strength.</p></speech>

Regarding the deep retrofit, we engage in a lot of energy monitoring of the systems.  We work with Electric Ireland, the ESB and Limerick Institute of Technology as a research institute.  Smart systems and programmes are designed to tell heat pumps not to come on at 6 p.m., when everyone is going home to cook his or her dinner.  Because one's house is well insulated, the heat load comes down drastically.  One programmes the system to come on at noon or 2 p.m. when everyone is at work.  One programmes the heating system to tell it not to come on during the peak periods; one preheats one's house by telling the system to come on in the evening.  As a heat pump is designed to be always on, the peak usage will be taken out of the grid once we install more heat pumps in the system.  In addition, research has been carried out into a smart tariff, whereby people are incentivised by being charged a higher rate after 6 p.m., but in the middle of the day it drops to perhaps 8 cent instead of 18 cent.  The research is at a micro level, but such a tariff could be rolled out in the future.</p></speech>

For 15 years, I believe, community based, community-led organisations have been delivering the warmer homes scheme for the SEAI.  It has become apparent that there will be a shortfall of &euro;1.8 million if 13 community based organisations, CBOs, are to continue this work, which would deliver 660 units across the 13 CBOs.  If they have no work to do, it is likely that their boards will have to consider closures, layoffs and staff redundancies.  This would result in significant job losses - approximately 60 to 70 immediately - among a skilled workforce.  It is ironic and contradictory that all this is happening at a time when the Government is planning to have 50,000 homes retrofitted per annum.  To enable the CBOs to continue operating in 2019, we will require the SEAI to allocate approximately &euro;1.8 million.  This always happens at this time of year.  The SEAI allocates funding to ensure homes are retrofitted.  The CBOs, including IRD Duhallow, South Kerry Development Partnership and North &amp;amp; East Kerry Development, have done so much good work for their communities.  What has happened?  Is the Government leaving the Department short of funding?  It is just &euro;1.8 million we are talking about.  These skilled people will be let go.  What is happening with the funding?  Is it being shut down for the rest of the year?  I would be grateful if the delegates could answer and tell me what is happening.</p></speech>

CBOs have been a really important part of the framework for a long time.  One of the issues which has arisen is that as we have provided support for deeper retrofits and people gravitate towards them, the CBOs do not have the capacity to carry them out.  This year there has been a real upsurge in interest in deep retrofit programmes, which, in many ways, represents a success.  The bottom line is that, as happens every year, the Department conducts a mid-term capital review.  We look at what is going well and what is falling behind.  We have been working with the SEAI to reallocate funding across the programme, but my understanding - I think Mr. Gannon may be able to elaborate on this - is that the SEAI will contact the CBOs to ensure they will be okay to year end.</p></speech>

The CBOs are crying out for funding.  If they do not receive it, they will have to let go skilled people who have accumulated experience over 15 years.  This is the first time it has happened.

A couple of themes have been touched on into which I would like to dive a little more.  It is good to hear that the scale is increasing, but we want it to increase even further.  The question of aggregated solutions is important.  In that context, I was particularly interested in the better energy communities scheme within the SEAI.  The scheme seems to be one in which the driver must come from a community.  Is it one in which a much more active role could be played in seeking to encourage, target or co-operate, for example, on incentivised or larger subsidisation offers to communities?  In other words, rather than relying on the push coming from the individual or a collection of individuals, we could look to have a real pull factor and a push in how we build.  Clearly, there is economy of scale in costings in that regard.  If we are looking to move towards large-scale and aggregated actions, might there be something said about financing?</p> <p>  One of the other issues that has been coming up consistently is the core requirement for predictability.  Some of the issues surrounding predictability seem to concern finance flow.  We really cannot afford to have these issues block the flow.  The other issue concerns public buildings, in respect of which a very constructive proposal was made.  Then there is the idea of retrofitting.  Predictability is important, not just for the construction industry but also for employees.  I sit on the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We have dealt with the issue of insecure work in the construction industry, where people are paid as individual contractors, rather than as employees.  Again, longer term contracts could prove to be an incentive in that regard.  Similarly, I expect pressure to be put on companies to reflect the insecurity their employees face.</p></speech>

I will then ask my main question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.192" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Gannon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019071000002#M01700"><p>There are two aspects.  The better energy communities model grew from an area-based model which sought to look at a certain locality, parish or electoral area to get the community involved.  The more successful schemes had that aim in mind.  With a programme such as this, one always sets a bar, whereby there is an evaluation matrix.  Particularly where we have co-ordinators or intermediaries whose businesses are dependent on it, whether it be a social enterprise or a private sector business, they tend to move towards satisfying that matrix.  We have better energy communities projects coming through.  They could consist of three homes on Inishmore, two on Arranmore and three in Sligo and some businesses.  We are trying to bring it back to an area based model over time.  With an area based model we can look at predictability.  A contractor can come into a specific area and mobilise in a much smaller one.  A key component is the sustainable energy communities network.  What we are trying to do is generate awareness and a competency and empower local communities to be confident enough to do some of this work themselves, while providing them with support and experts.  However, we want them to do it, instead of having an organisation coming in as the expert and, because there is expertise, charging a premium.  There are nearly 300 communities to be found in every county in Ireland.  We provide them with support and mentors and there is oversight and funding to deliver their own master plan.  That is the final point.  As it is the community's master plan, we do not prescribe how it should defines its low-carbon future.  The community defines it; we just give it the expertise.  Ownership and locality are, therefore, critical and can provide the predictability because the community's master plan will articulate how in the next three, five, ten or 12 years it will get to that point.</p></speech>

We might deal with between 30 and 40 landlords but there is access to 150,000 homes, and thereby we can examine the inventory, plan how to upgrade it over ten years and access it.  During a downturn, we could turn up the public stock.  If that public stock is a backbone, it is possible to execute the type of contract which guarantees a contractor a particular amount of work in an area in return for which the contractor needs to recruit the additional number of homes.  That could be used as leverage to decrease costs, to get more social activity around it, and to create the economic case through sheer scale.</p></speech>

There is a big push around procurement.  In procurement, one option is the most economically advantageous tender, which is effectively just about cost, and there is price quality ratio.  In the context of procurement, and while I am aware this is drifting into public building, I am very interested in the national development plan, because it will tie in, not necessarily in terms of individual homes but perhaps looking at matters like congregated settings.  What might be done more in terms of a pressure point in procurement and raising the required standards?  I would also be interested in Mr. Parlon's view on this.  This is different from the legal standard required as the base.  This is the desired standard that might be required as a quality measure within a price quality criteria in public procurement.  I am very interested in this in terms of capital expenditure, new public housing that might be built, and how we might press that further.  On financing, which may have been touched on earlier, what are witnesses views on European Investment Bank financing for those front-loaded schemes, public housing and other areas?  On materials, the cement and concrete industries are very major carbon producers.  Is there a review or what is the mechanism of review not just of what materials are basic and safe but also of which are preferable?</p></speech>

As the climate action plan points out, around 12% of Irish GDP comes through public procurement.  There is a very clear mandate for the instruction of green criteria across government, bringing it into the Office of Government Procurement and its regime, engaging with suppliers about what they do, and providing support and guidance to people.  It is a fundamental shift of inserting that climate dimension into all procurement into the future.  This must be done in the overall framework of EU law, competition and so on, but nonetheless there is a very strong message in the climate action plan that a redesigned model of public procurement with green at its centre would be very much part of the future.</p></speech>

The big debate lately has been around quality and price.  As has been the case, unfortunately, in much public tendering, the lowest price wins all and that is at the expense of quality.  As Mr. Manley has said, that is an issue that is being discussed and new proposals are coming forward from the Office of Government Procurement.  It is a tricky area because price is very determinable.  If someone says he or she will do a job for &euro;150,000, the quality can be difficult to ascertain.  We support quality being an important criteria in Government procurement.</p></speech>

Even before the updated standards come into effect in October of this year and a further substantial completion takes place in October of next year, the level of existing standards, such as the conservation of fuel and energy in Part L, which has been in place since 2011, is very high anyway, so the quality will be there in new and recent stock.</p></speech>

I do not want to get too technical, but the cost optimum refers to a certain detail.  It is more a question of why spend &euro;20,000 insulating a wall to a certain standard when it is a stone wall.  When doing that, a certain acceptable construction detail must be met.  Spending that much money might only save the homeowner &euro;300, whereas spending half that sum could save him or her &euro;200.  That is cost optimum.  How much money makes economic sense to put into a house?  We might be chasing a B2 or A3 rating but we have to go back to asking what makes sense to do to the house.  That is what is meant by cost optimum.  It is not related to lowest tenders or price.</p></speech>

I was using it more as a parallel when balancing price and quality.  My last point was around landlords and the tension there which was mentioned.  Many of those living in the lowest income households live in private rented accommodation.  This relates to the security of Part 4 tenancies.  It is a question of how we can encourage retrofitting, for example, expedited or period of time retrofitting, without creating a perverse incentive around evictions.  Does anybody have any thoughts on examples from other European countries, for example, where there might be a three-month suspension of a tenancy, but if it is the equivalent of a Part 4 tenancy, it is effectively protected, even during a period of retrofitting?</p></speech>

There is an energy saving that the tenant will not have to pay any more but the landlord will put the capital in.  It is not something where a solution is apparent in Europe.  There is a lot of work ongoing on this.  The European Commission in particular is involved.  We are understanding of it and it is part of the cross-Government action plan to look at that.  There are two different types, with the commercial proposition very much different from the housing and home definition.  I can provide further detail on this.</p></speech>

They have to meet a technical specification and there is a lot of paperwork and an inspection unit that inspects all the work.  They do it to a higher standard than if a person rang a local contractor about insulating the attic.  It is not comparing like with like when looking at the two prices.  The SEAI grant scheme has a very high standard.  There is no relation between the costs under the SEAI grant scheme and a local contractor who will probably do it for cash.</p></speech>

The years preceding the broadcast and, indeed, the weeks since have been an incredibly difficult journey for me and my family.  I have been unable to work since 30 May 2018.</p> <p>  I would like to take this opportunity to outline my experience of the background behind some of ESB&rsquo;s non-compliance issues.</p> <p>  First, with regard to propane gas, ESB Networks staff use propane gas primarily to heat plastic type insulation.  In April 2015, ESB Networks staff ignited a high-pressure gas main in Knocklyon in Dublin.  The subsequent investigation found serious shortfalls across three broad categories: training; documented safe system of work; and safe tools and equipment.  The risk was so large that the ESB Networks health and safety programme board committed to resolving all the issues by June 2016.  This commitment preceded my appointment to the role of technical development manager.  However, once I came into the role I started receiving ongoing complaints from staff as regards hot works issues.  What brought the issue to a head was that most of the actions from the investigation were not started by December 2017 when a near carbon copy incident occurred in the UCD campus in Belfield.  Thankfully, no one was seriously injured that time.</p> <p>  I raised the propane gas issue as one of 20 risks in February 2017 in what I understood to be a protected disclosure.  However, in the 12 months post February 2017, I received six different instructions from senior management on how to progress the propane gas issue and despite my best endeavours I received no commitment on resources, senior management buy-in or finance in that time.  That led to understandable frustration on my behalf.  I understand a full roll-out has been happening since I submitted protected disclosure No. 4 to the Minister in January 2019.</p> <p>  Second, with regard to fluid-filled cables, ESB Networks has approximately 120 km of high voltage cables which use a mixture of fluids as an insulating medium.  As per the agreed PR3 submission to the regulator, they contain 300,000 l of oil.  The annual leakage rate over the past 20 years averaged 50,000 l per annum.  That is a leakage rate of 17%; in the worst years it ran at 30%.  UK utilities using similar cables have a leakage rate of approximately 2% annually.  ESB is an associate member of the UK based Energy Networks Association, which provides expert guidance on dealing with fluid-filled cable leaks.  The average leakage rate of 50,000 l compares poorly against the ESB Networks policy target of 15,000 l per annum.  In 2017, five cable circuits were shown to have an environmental risk rating of nine and were all non-compliant with both the UK and ESB standards.</p><p>The PR4 submission to the regulator by ESB Networks referred to environmental risk 23 times.  Although the replacement fluid is biodegradable, 90% of the fluid employed by the ESB contains some element of mineral oil, and the internal ESB guidance is quite clear that ESB Networks is obliged by law to design out and manage the environmental risk posed by leakage from fluid-filled cables on its network.  It is my understanding that leakage detection and minimisation performance have improved since I submitted protected disclosure No. 1 in January 2019.</p><p> Third, regarding sulphur hexafluoride or SF6 reporting, in February 2017 I raised an issue concerning maintenance, repair and calibration of SF6 handling equipment.  Due to resource constraints since 2013, these high-cost units were not subjected to any oversight as regards a maintenance regime.  This was causing significant issues for front-line staff as regards complying with the F-gas directive.  The more I looked into the overall SF6 issue, the more concerned I became.  Once again I raised any issues I came across with management along with proposed solutions.  However, SF6 did not seem to be a priority.  I escalated the Moneypoint leakage issue in August 2017 and I understand that the reporting to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, was amended following this.  However, I was instructed after this by a senior manager not to raise any other environmental issues within ESB Networks.  Moneypoint 400 kV substation leaked more SF6 gas in 2017 than the entire of the UK transmission network.  As per the F-gas directive, records are to be kept for five years.  However, there has never been a coherent national approach to SF6 reporting, and our regime will not stand up to external scrutiny across any of the 18 high-voltage supervisor areas.  This is an institutional fault, not any individual's fault.  However, front-line staff may be exposed to draconian personal liability if they knowingly keep topping up a leaking device.  It is my understanding that significant improvements to the SF6 gas handling and reporting regime have been made since I submitted my protected disclosure No. 7 to the Minister in January 2019.</p><p> Fourth, regarding flexible earths, in June 2016 I was asked to go to the UK to carry out an in-depth study of ESB Networks' earthing practices on foot of allegations made by a supplier of earthing material to ESB Networks.  Rather than debunk these allegations, the study validated many of them and also showed other areas where ESB Networks were not aligned with minimum industry standards in the UK.  I expected that this report would be acted on within a reasonable timeframe.  However, it was not until the disaffected supplier contacted the Health and Safety Authority that ESB Networks started allocating proper resources to resolve the issues.  It is my understanding that further improvements have been made since I submitted protected disclosure No. 4 to the Minister in January 2019.</p><p> It is with a profound sense of regret that I find myself before the committee washing the dirty linen of a company for which I have worked all my adult life and to which I owe an awful lot.  I continue to try to operate in the best long-term interests of the ESB, and this has taken a very heavy toll on my personal and professional life.  The ease with which the ESB can choose which parts of its own procedures and policies, and indeed national and European legislation, to comply with and which parts to ignore is not a work practice that is sustainable in the current climate or which aligns with the company's purported values.  I take some succour that the ESB is now a more compliant and safer utility for its workers and the public on foot of my actions.  I do not regret appearing on the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" episode "ESB Leaks".  I am perplexed, however, as to how it ever got this far.  I offer my time to all State agencies and any subsequent investigations which require clarification on any of the issues I have raised.  I also wish to place it on record that I never acted with malicious intent.  I was simply trying to live by the ESB motto, "Never turn a blind eye".  I was also trying to do the right thing for my colleagues' safety at what has turned out to be substantial personal cost.  I thank the committee for its time and would welcome any questions members may have.</p></speech>

My professional life has become increasingly difficult since then.</p></speech>

He had a senior role in the company and had responsibility for health and safety matters.  He has identified clearly how this worked.  He recognised problems, identified solutions and then sought support through the organisation to have those solutions implemented.  Does he believe that the organisation failed to respond adequately to him when he raised those issues, the issues that we are now all aware of?</p></speech>

We were coming to the end of a safety transformation programme.  I understand why the company would do this but it was trying to push the idea that the programme had been a resounding success.  I was appointed to my role in February 2016, near the end of that transformation programme, and I suppose I was raising issues up the line that were inconsistent with what we were telling the workers.</p></speech>

That is certainly a ratcheting up of his position.  Perhaps he could talk to us about how he got to the point that he felt he had to go down the protected disclosure route.</p></speech>

My function had a budget deficit because our financial requirements were not included in the submission to the regulator.  This created tensions, and legitimate requests I was making were not being progressed and were being blocked.  Staff on the ground were coming looking for tools and equipment to comply with legislation and their requests were stopping at my desk.  In addition, we have 108 supervisor areas and there was friction previously about the tools and equipment my function supplies.  I therefore appointed a representative to each of the 108 areas.  I used to contact those people regularly to ask them whether they had any issues with tools and equipment.  I also asked them whether they had any safety or environmental concerns, and information started coming back at me.  I have a broad level of experience across all the major types of work we carry out so I was able to validate or dismiss issues that came back from front-line staff.  I think the people further up the line just got overwhelmed by the number of issues I was bringing to their table.</p></speech>

According to my understanding of EU legislation, the groundwater directive came in 2003, I think, and we should have been reporting the issue to the relevant State agencies back then.  The leakage rates back then were particularly bad.  One year we hit 90,000 l.  That is more than the leakage for the entirety of New York city.</p><p>That was not being reported at that time.  The senior person who came into the organisation after that time could not report that issue as their predecessor did not report it.  If someone inherits a dysfunctional system and a matter has not been reported previously, that person will hang his or her predecessor out to dry if he or she reports it.</p></speech>

I get that in the current climate we have to be paragons of virtue.  We have to fly the sustainability flag.

I imagine a position was taken as regards me at a point in time which was not reflective of my intentions.  Organisations, by their nature, defend themselves and I was seen as a threat.  If the issues I had been raising were embraced, we would have had a totally different outcome.  People within the company who I know and respect are perplexed as to how we have got to this point.  I was not a malcontent roaring and shouting about nothing.  I was bringing forward issues and proposed solutions which were implementable.  We were coming towards the end of the transformation programme and with the budget deficit and the volume of issues I was bringing up the line, it was a perfect storm.  In safety management, they talk about the Swiss cheese model in that one needs seven or eight issues to line up to cause a significant incident.  In our industry one must be fastidious about health and safety and environmental issues.  Bad practices might come in.  We had another issue with fault location vans and the point was made to me that the company had never had an incident with one of the vans.  They had not been maintained, repaired or calibrated in 20 years.  I made the point in response that just because we had got away with it up to now is a bit like someone saying he does not wear a seat belt driving to Dublin and had never had an accident, so why should he wear one now.  People need the safety stuff when they need it.</p></speech>

Where I was allowed act on any of the issues I brought to the table, those actions have been successful.  I suppose I bridged the gap.  I was a front-line staff member.  I have been in a cable joint where a cable exploded.  I have fallen down a pole.  I have walked in the shoes of the front-line staff.  I am good at interpreting what they say, debunking the stuff that is vexatious and bringing legitimate issues up the line.  I want to be part of the cultural change that has to happen in the company.  I said in my opening statement that I do not take any delight in having to come up here today and wash the dirty linen of a company.  The ESB will be an integral part of the climate challenge the country faces, which involves looking at electricity issues.  The more fair-minded people within the company who have reached out to me since the programme have said I have done the country and the company a massive service.  We no longer have to pretend about the fluid-filled cables.  There is far greater rigour with respect to SF6 gas.  My understanding is that all the issues I have raised have been acted on since January in a meaningful manner.  If this matter had been embraced two to three years ago, we would never ended up here.  Representatives of the ESB will appear before the committee after me.  I know the individuals who will be on the other side of the table.  There needs to be some resolution on the interpersonal issues.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Loughlin was right in his fundamental analysis but this was happening and the company was improving.  Were Mr. O'Loughlin's actions necessary to achieving that?  Was that process likely to happen anyway?  How sure is Mr. O'Loughlin that he went the extra mile to establish that the company was not doing the right thing and was not willing to listen?</p></speech>

I will give the committee another example.  I brought the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 to the Minister's attention.  Broadly speaking, that stipulates that an employee cannot work more than 48 hours a week on average.  We had staff members hitting 70 hours a week on average over a period of six to ten months.  Nobody was prepared to grasp that nettle because there was no upside to doing so.  The institution was turning a blind eye to it.  Now it has been raised and resolved.  A friend of mine said to me that I would be the most hated man in ESB because I would cost front-line staff members real money.  However, I understand is the general feeling is that the company feels it got away with this for a long time but now the cat is out of the bag and it must comply.  I did not feel there was an atmosphere in which raising issues like that would be viewed positively.  Doing so would create work for those above one, which was hard to handle.</p></speech>

I had to speak in a debate in the Chamber so I have arrived late, but I have read his statement.  I met Mr. O'Loughlin on this issue last year, and I have had several telephone conversations with him in the meantime.  I have also been in discussions with departmental officials in regard to the mediation process he mentioned.  In any of the discussions or dealings we have had, I found what Mr. O'Loughlin presented to be credible.  Things subsequently have been seen to be exactly as he outlined.</p> <p>  We are in a difficult situation.  It is always about personal circumstances.  It is clear that Mr. O'Loughlin has been through very difficult circumstances because of his willingness to do the right thing and highlight the need for change.  I wish to ask a couple of very general questions without prying into the personal details of any particular manager or other person.  I had not realised that the ESB motto was "Never turn a blind eye".  Where does that tradition come from?</p></speech>

We realised that we could not keep operating the way we were operating.  An awful lot of money, time and expertise was invested in changing our culture.  That is where that motto came from.  I raised a point that there are stickers up all over the place that say "Never turn a blind eye".  Do we really mean that or is it empty rhetoric?  Are we prepared to make decisions which will be unpopular in the short term but which are in the long-term interests of the company?</p></speech>

It was not an old tradition that went way back, but a deliberate and conscious attempt to improve the company's ways after those fatalities.</p></speech>

I have been trying to understand how we got to this point.  We are a very large player in the Irish industry.  The various State agencies should have oversight of us but we have far more technical expertise than somebody who comes in from outside.  We would not get away with some of the things we were getting away with in the UK because the regulators there have the required expertise and experience to ask the real questions and hold suppliers accountable.  For example, oil leakage is published annually in the UK in a public report that anyone can see.  It is listed as a percentage of overall oil usage.  Leakage of sulphur hexaflouride, SF6, is reported annually in the UK.  If a provider leaks it must account to Ofgem - the British equivalent of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU - for why it leaked.  Providers are penalised financially for leaks.</p> <p>  Anecdotally I have heard that Belgium only has leakage equivalent to seven bottles of SF6 gas.  I do not know how true that is but having spoken to the various experts in the company, my best guess is that Ireland leaks somewhere between 2,000 and 5,000 bottles of SF6 gas.  Moneypoint has been leaking for years and we have been putting SF6 gas into it.  We have always viewed SF6 as an &euro;800 bottle of gas, but it is not really.  I viewed it as a potential &euro;50,000 fine.  The guys there are incredibly conflicted.  I have found this throughout the country.  They are expected to keep gassing up breakers that leak on a regular basis.  If the engine of a car was leaking one could just keep topping it up with oil, but that is not sustainable in the long term.  SF6 gas seems like a relatively benign issue, but 1 kg is the equivalent of 24 tonnes of CO2.  The way we handled it was not sustainable in the current climate.  </p></speech>

Given the recession the country was going through we had to pull back on an awful lot of projects.  CRU might allow us &euro;20 million but if we cannot raise the capital on the international bond markets it does not count for anything.  Replacing the fluid filled cables in Dublin does not generate an awful lot of cash and it is very resource heavy from a management perspective.  It is far easier to build a &euro;100 million substation in Kerry because it can be contracted out and put on the regulated asset base, RAB, whereas a cable outside this door is heavy on management resources and it might only add &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million to the RAB at the end of it.</p></speech>

While this may not be glamorous or tough career advancing, it is not insignificant.  There were 90,000 l back in 2003 and we have still had 30,000 l, 40,000 l or 50,000 l in recent years.  For an issue like this to be ongoing for at least 15 or 20 years, what was the response from the company when Mr. O'Loughlin raised it as a concern?</p></speech>

The year I raised it I was told we were under 15,000 l, which is the company policy, and that we were compliant with legislation.  In fairness there was a dip in 2016 and 2017 but that was an aberration more than anything else.  If we applied the UK figures our policy it should be 6,000 l per annum.  That would be a 2% leakage rate.</p></speech>

The genesis of all this is the propane gas.  The highest risk area for propane gas is in Dublin because that is where most of the cable jointing work goes on.  When I met various people and front-line members it was a bit of a joke that we were still getting away with the level of fluid leakage that was going on.  On the one hand the ESB is stating the fluid it is putting in is biodegradable but in the PR4 submission it continually highlights how damaging it is.  It states that several of the programmes are largely justified based on the environmental impact and that fluid leakage presents a challenge to ESB networks that is costly and environmentally damaging.  We just cannot have that level of leakage.  The elephant in the room is the rate of replacement of the cables.  If we do not replace these cables in line with our commitments to the regulator the problem will grow exponentially.  I do not fancy our chances of getting into work on time in the morning if we have to start digging up half of Dublin.</p></speech>

Then I met his nominee.  I understood that he would step back from it.  I met his nominee on a number of occasions.  My wife and I were aware of the psychological toll this would take so I did not actually submit them until January 2019.  We had to be prepared for what would come at us after that.  The ESB was given a period of time to investigate each of the issues I raised and come back with responses.  It has acted on an awful lot of the issues I have raised, which is validating if I am being honest.  Where I am left is wondering where I will be in six months' time.  Will I still have a job?  Will I be able to provide for my wife and family?  This is the difficult situation I find myself in.  As I said earlier, the people whom I contend are the more farsighted in the company reckon I have done it a massive service because we have been compelled to grasp very difficult nettles, such as the SF6 reporting.  Staff are asked to go out and regas breakers that are continually leaking.  That is a clear breach of the F-gas directive.</p><p>Is the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, an oversight or a policing authority?  What role does the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, have in all of this?  All of that must be clearly defined to ensure this does not happen again.</p></speech>

I sent them in and I had to sit on my hands after that.  Financially, it has been a challenge to sustain this process.  I am quoting legislation and UK figures.  There are many clever people in ESB at the other side of the table pushing back on what I am saying but the figures speak for themselves.  In the submission to the regulator we continually say why we need to do this work and that it is environmentally damaging.  On the other hand, we are saying that the cable fluid is biodegradable.  The stuff being displaced is not biodegradable.  Anecdotally, I heard we used C4 until the 1960s or 1970s.  That is particularly damaging if one looks at the safety data sheet.</p> <p>  It would be great if we could report in our sustainability report on the fluid-filled cable leakage and the SF6 gas.  That would represent a real cultural shift.  I have absolutely no doubt that ESB Networks will come out of this a more resilient company.  Our staff will have a better chance of getting home safe and sound.</p></speech>

ESB has always been a company that strives to do the right thing.  For over nine decades we have worked in and with communities enabling development and better standards of living.  Over that time, we have evolved our work practices, adopted new technologies and dealt with the legacy of older technology in a proactive way.  Notwithstanding the fact that in recent years we have made significant progress on the safety and environmental issues raised, we recognise that we can do more.  I would like to address a number of the significant matters raised in the recent programme.  At the outset, I note the Chair's advice.<br/><br/>The 3,000 staff of ESB Networks install, operate and maintain the electricity distribution system and install and maintain the electricity transmission system.  We use our network of over 180,000 km of lines and cables to connect and provide services to 2.3 million customers in homes, farms and businesses throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.  Our role is connecting people and businesses to the electricity they need.  ESB Networks also has a key role supporting the national climate action plan.  We work to create a brighter future for the communities we serve and lead the transition to a low carbon future powered by clean, renewable electricity.  This involves connecting more renewable generation so that 70% of electricity comes from renewables by 2030.  We also distribute that clean electricity to facilitate the decarbonisation of heat, transport and industry.  <br/><br/>The programme raised the issue of fluid filled cables.<b></b>Without wanting to minimise in any way the challenges we face relating to legacy fluid filled underground cables, they were for many years the technology of choice for electricity networks in cities all over the world.  That leaves ESB, along with the many worldwide utilities operating city networks, with the ongoing challenge of managing fluid filled cables for many years to come, although these cables now make up less than 1% of Ireland&rsquo;s underground cable network.  The fluid is an essential component of the electrical insulation of the underground cables in question and the fluid is readily biodegradable.  Notwithstanding this, we know it is important to minimise and eliminate the leakage which can occur, for example, as a result of damage from construction activity or deterioration of the outer casing of the cables.  We have taken many concrete steps to improve, and our current performance in 2019 is comparable with that of our international peers and comparators.  Those concrete steps include replacing almost 20% of underground fluid filled cables so far, thereby removing the source of 40% of the historical leakage, and investing in specialist detection equipment that allows us to track down leaks more quickly.  Our current rate of fluid leakage is in line with international comparators at 10 cu. m per year.  We have reported the rate of fluid usage in underground cables annually to our sectoral regulator, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, since 2007.</p><p>Our records show five occasions over 26 years, since 1993, when cable fluids spilled into water.  In each case we notified the relevant local authority, Waterways Ireland, or both, and immediately mobilised an environmental response.  However, we acknowledge and accept that a greater and more systematic level of liaison with the relevant local and other statutory authorities on cable leaks would be appropriate.  That is happening.  </p><p> SF6 gas is a standard insulating gas used in switchgear all over the world.  It is specified by the international manufacturers of modern switchgear because its properties make it particularly good in providing the insulation and arc suppression required to safely operate high voltage switchgear.  At ESB Networks we comply with the requirements of the EU F-gas directive and have reported our annual usage of SF6 gas to the EPA since 2006.  One of the characteristics of SF6 gas in switchgear is that a certain level of leakage is anticipated.  Until 2019 ESB Network&rsquo;s SF6 gas usage was higher than that of peer comparators.  It was primarily an issue with HV switchgear at our Moneypoint transmission substation.  Now that the switchgear has been de-energised, taken out of service and replaced, our SF6 gas usage will be significantly lower.  This was a major project started some years ago and it has now finished.  The switchgear has been de-energised in the last month or so.</p><p> It is important to address the aspects of safety culture raised in the programme.  For many years the ESB has invested in an open culture to encourage employees to identify and report safety issues or potential safety issues of which they become aware.  We believe they are a leading indicator, increasing people&rsquo;s involvement in safety issues and cumulatively reducing the likelihood of injuries.  ESB Networks has over 3,000 highly trained and very committed employees who, between them, raised over 4,500 good catches in 2018.  We acknowledge and appreciate the commitment of all those who openly raise safety suggestions, believing this to be the key to a continuous safety culture.  For example, the decision to replace the hand-held propane gas blow-torch referenced in the RT&Eacute; television programme came about as a result of our employees identifying issues and reporting incidents in their use.  After a review process, that model of torch was replaced.  We have a well resourced safety organisation which audits, reviews and supports safety performance in dealing with any issue or incident raised in the normal course of daily operations. Our safety and environmental systems are audited annually and accredited to OHSAS 18001 and ISO 14001 standard.</p><p> The ESB has a very clear policy on speaking up.  We provide comprehensive support for employees who feel the need to speak up, including a 24-hour confidential helpline that can be accessed by phone or online and an opportunity to directly contact the ESB&rsquo;s group internal auditor.  ESB Networks is an open organisation.  The issues highlighted in the RT&Eacute; television programme had been identified as part of our safety and environmental reporting systems and many had already been the subject of internal review, investigation and action.  With the disclosures from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, any concern raised that had not been investigated within ESB Networks was assigned for investigation.  The investigations were carried out by people with the appropriate expertise from areas of the ESB outside ESB Networks or using external specialist expertise, where appropriate.  At the request of ESB&lsquo;s chief executive, we are also commissioning an external review of the potential for environmental impact of ESB Networks operations to ensure our internal assessments are comprehensive.</p><p> I would like to address aspects of security and the reliability of the Dublin city network raised in RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s television programme.  The Dublin city electricity network, including the underground fluid filled cables in question, has been designed, configured and operated to provide a high level of security and reliability typical of any modern city.  The high and medium voltage network is monitored 24/7 in real time using a modern operations management system.  Accordingly, customers in Dublin, whether domestic or business, enjoy a reliable, resilient and high quality electricity supply.  The ESB has always been a company that strives to do the right thing.  Throughout our history we have evolved our work practices, adopted new technologies and dealt with the legacy of older technology in a proactive way.  Notwithstanding the fact that in recent years we have made significant progress in safety and environmental performance, including in dealing with the issues raised, we recognise and acknowledge that there are a number of areas where we could and should have done more.  We recognise the opportunities for further improvement into the future.  My colleagues and I will be happy to address questions committee members may have on these or relevant matters.</p></speech>

A document is being circulated to members with pictures of four types of fluid filled cable.  All cables have the same components: copper as a conductor - that is what carries the electrical power; an insulator which stops the power from escaping the conductor; an earth sheath around the outside to ensure the cable operates safely; and another covering which forms a protective outer layer.  In the illustration provided for members in the top left hand diagram the fluid passes through the centre of the conductor and the insulating medium is paper on the outside of the copper, but the fluid seeps into the paper and it is the combination of the fluid and the paper which provides the isolation.  The image on the top right hand side shows a different construction.  It is a three-phase cable.  The fluid passes through the copper pipe on the outside of the cable.  The image on the lower left hand side shows a different construction again.  The fluid is not in separate ducts and the cable is immersed in it.  The diagram on the bottom right hand side is of the modern cable.  Plastic is used.  No fluid is used as an insulating medium.  Our new cable is of this XLPE construction and there is no need for fluid.  Our network has 25,000 km of cable, of which less than 1% is fluid filled.  The cables were installed largely between the 1950s and 1970s.  The last of it was installed in 1989.  It is a technology which has been moved away from across the world, but all large cities have legacy cables that are managed.  There are also leakages which they also must manage.  It is not an issue which is unique to Ireland.</p></speech>

As Mr. Mulvaney said, the ESB has been around for 90 years.  It has equipment that is old and which we manage, as well as equipment that is new.  That is part of what we do.  We have legacy equipment and it is a challenge to manage it.</p></speech>

We have a list of the equipment with which we use it.</p><p>We report on it because we report annually to the EPA how much usage we have.  In addition, it is important to understand that we manage SF6.  We do that through a suite of procedures and those were rolled out in 2015 and 2016.  We also have to manage the usage and we do that through containers.  We have an inventory of those containers as well.</p></speech>

We are constantly improving that.  The old switch gear from Moneypoint can be seen in the first picture provided.  As Mr. Hayes stated, we de-energised that in early June.  The last of the circuits have gone into the new switch gear and the next stage now is to decommission the old switch.  The new switch gear being put into Moneypoint can be seen in one of the other pictures.  To give a sense of scale, the height of the old Moneypoint switch gear is approximately 7.5 m while the new gear is approximately 3.9 m.  Technology evolves all of the time.  The level of information we have relates to what information we got from the suppliers at the time of purchase.  That improves as the technology evolves because the regulations have evolved over those years as well.</p></speech>

If we have old equipment, for example, we may not have originally got the total volume of SF6 gas from the supplier.  The requisite information may not be readily available for that old equipment but we do have an estimate of the SF6 gas contained within that equipment.   The newer equipment is in compliance with the new regulations so that would be very clear.  We are constantly evolving and that is when I go back to the fact that we are dealing with and managing legacy equipment.  That is what we do.</p></speech>

I do not want to hog all of the meeting.  Mr. Hayes mentioned speaking up.  That is important.  He has had the benefit of hearing evidence that we received earlier.  We do not want to talk about specifics in respect of any individuals.  In the context of speaking up, however, in the case of someone leaving the company and having to sign certain declarations, it has been suggested that there was potential for a person to have to give a commitment to not bring up any further areas of concern regarding legal non-compliance on the part of the ESB and that such information not be provided to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Does Mr. Hayes have any comment on that?</p></speech>

I appreciate the opportunity to set the record straight on this matter.  I heard that comment and the interpretation of that clause in the agreement.

The opposite is the case.  This gives me the opportunity to speak to that point.  We encourage all of our staff to speak up.  We really appreciate staff speaking up and we believe that is part of the culture.  We have sought to increase the level of reporting of near misses, good catches and of safety opportunities.  We brought that up to a level of about 4,500 last year.  Every one of those is an opportunity for someone in the organisation to have a dialogue with the business about opportunities for safety improvement.  The situation, therefore, is quite the contrary to any other suggestion in that regard.</p></speech>

Based on what was captured in the programme, we might have some concerns that these issues were only addressed when they were escalated to the level of a protected disclosure.  We would be concerned that an individual would have to go to those lengths in order to get the attention necessary to address these issues.  On the basis of Mr. Hayes's admissions and the discussions in the programme, it seems that much started to happen on this issue when the protected disclosures were made.  Would that be a fair characterisation?</p></speech>

That switch gear replacement cost is of the order of &euro;100 million and so that process did not start today or yesterday.  The capital approval was in-----</p></speech>

At any given point, therefore, we have a range of issues where we are managing the past and investing for the future.  Having said that, however, everyone who brings an issue to us in respect of an opportunity to improve or a concern about safety provides us with an opportunity to make a difference.  To take one example, when we investigated the first protected disclosure to the Minister regarding fluid-filled cables our investigation came up with the finding that there was an opportunity for us to improve our liaison and reporting with the local authorities.  That was despite the fact that we had reported each and every leak to water in the last 26 years.  There was an opportunity to do that better.   We have now put in place a protocol with each of those local authorities for reporting any future leakage.  As a result, it has been an opportunity for us to improve.</p></speech>

I was shocked by the contents of the "RT&Eacute; Investigates" programme.  My sense of the ESB is that it is a big professional organisation.  I was an ESB employee for three years.  Even then its motto was "Never turn a blind eye", though that was a few decades ago.  As the ESB is seen as a reliable company with a huge emphasis on safety and on workers being well treated, there is some concern when an issue like this crops up.  The ESB will need to carry out a number of projects over the coming years because ESB's networks will require a huge upgrade to deal with the electrification of transport and greater electrification of many sectors due to climate change.  New infrastructure will be installed, some of which already has planning permission.  It is important that both the public and members, as public representatives, can defend and stand over the ESB's record as our company, that is, as a State company.  We want it to be a safe pair of hands in constructing networks, installing infrastructure and operating safely and I am sure that is what the ESB also wants.</p> <p>  The revelations in this programme are damaging.  There is a question about whether the leaked material is oil or fluid and whether it is biodegradable.  In the real world, equipment and infrastructure installed up to 60 years ago are now past their best-by dates.  The water network is in the same position and replacing that network also is a challenge.  However, it is better that we know what is wrong and that these issues are brought to the attention of the relevant authorities.  In this case, the relevant local authority, Dublin City Council, knew what was happening and brought it to the attention of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p> <p>  It was said that what leaked from the underground cables is biodegradable.  However, a confidential ESB document shows the ESB had been fully aware of the environmental hazards caused by those leaks since 2009, which is concerning.  The document also states the Inchicore circuit presents the highest environmental risk due to the fact that its route runs parallel to the Grand Canal.  That shows there already was some concern at that point that the environmental impact was severe.  It went on to state that an acid replacement and maintenance report on the Grand Canal in Dublin was conducted in 2014, and that ESB Networks had considerable difficulties accessing that route's cables in order to repair leaks.  The report claimed this was an area where leaks "could present a very high environmental impact".  Between 2012 and 2014, 10,000 l of oil leaked into the waterway alone.  It is hugely concerning that this was not brought into the full light of day at the time.</p> <p>  Representatives from the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, were before this committee yesterday.  The ESB has to make a pitch to the CRU if it wants to do a capital upgrade.  As I recall, the ESB looked for spending of &euro;20 million between 2011 and 2015 for upgrade works of this type but only &euro;6 million was used.  I am trying to balance this in my head, while trying to be fair to the ESB.  I understand that was during the austerity period and that the ESB was subject to austerity like everyone else.  Why, however, was this allowed to go on when it had authorisation to spend &euro;20 million?  Why was there not a more open process in dealing with this?  No matter how bad a situation, it is always better that the relevant authority knows what is happening.</p></speech>

He has raised a number of different issues and I will try to get to all of them.</p> <p>  First, he mentioned a specific leak and said that a certain amount of fluid went into the canal.  However, that fluid did not leak into the canal.  There was a leak from a cable near the canal, but the canal banks are impermeable clay structures for keeping water in, and so the only way for fluid to get into the canal is to go in over the top.  As that particular cable is 1.2 m below the level of the canal, no fluid from that particular leak got into the canal.  Having said that, it was a big leak and it took more time to find than to repair.  The repair itself is a tricky piece of work but finding the leaks in these cables can be quite challenging.  The traditional method for finding a leak in a cable, which might be a number of kilometres long, is to dig a hole halfway along the cable, bring liquid nitrogen down to freeze the cable, and then monitor the pressure on either side of the frozen piece to see which side the leak is in.  That must be done a number of times to find the leak.  We have invested in a newer technology where gas is put into the fluid and a detector essentially sniffs that gas out.  However, that technology did not work in the case of that leak because it was right under the middle of a very busy road and the old method of digging and looking for the leak took a long time. </p> <p>  The Deputy's last point was about the ESB's spend.  We agree work programmes with the regulator on a five-yearly basis when we cover various price reviews and agree a programme of work we are going to get done.  Over the last number of price reviews, we have changed out 44 km of that underground fluid-filled cable, which brings the total length of the cable network down to 177 km.  We did this using a risk-based method, whereby we replaced the cables with the history of most leaks first.  By taking out 20% of the cables, we got rid of 40% of the leaks.</p></speech>

There are many other services underground, where the cables are, such as water, sewage, telephone cables, broadband cables and gas pipe work.  As there must be a certain amount of clearance between electrical and gas networks, finding routes to replace those cables is highly challenging.  This will take a long time but we are working our way through it.  Electrically, as these cables will be sound for another 100 years, they are doing their job and are well designed from that point of view.  We want to take them off the system because of leakage but it is not a simple fix.  Replacing all the cables in Dublin would cause disruption around the city equivalent to building 70 Luas cross-city lines.</p><p>It is something that we have to manage and do in a controlled manner.</p></speech>

Otherwise, we would have reported it immediately.  We do not believe there was any environmental damage but we have put a protocol in place and we have already engaged external environmental specialists to work with us and to look back at any area where we had a significant leak to establish whether there was any environmental damage or if we were correct in saying there was not.</p></speech>

There are pressure gauges and head tanks.  The oil is in head tanks on either end of the cable and there are pressure gauges, so we can monitor the level of the oil.  It fluctuates up and down as the cable heats up and cools down as it is loaded, but we know if there is a leak based on that.  Once we have a leak we then have to find it.  I went through the procedure as to how we find the leak, which can be an arduous procedure.  It is possible to repair the cable.  The cable is not damaged permanently, and it can be repaired.  The troublesome ones, on a risk basis, are being changed out.</p></speech>

The first is that the infrastructure is safe and that the networks are safe but there is a related issue.  I accept that the witnesses have said that it is the ESB's policy to allow for a whistleblower to come forward whereby an issue is brought to the attention of the company internally.  The television programme raised questions about that which I will not go into for legal reasons.  There is only a certain amount we can say.  We cannot deal specifically with an individual case or identify an individual.  The witnesses can understand the concerns of members of the public who saw the programme.  The key issue is that safe practices are employed by the ESB, that the company is professional in the way it carries out its business and that when something is wrong, to paraphrase the witnesses, people do not turn a blind eye.  The ESB depends on its workers to put up their hands and say there is a problem.  The key issue is that they would not be shown the door and the problem would be brushed under the carpet.</p></speech>

We have a lot of safety structures in place in the ESB.  We have local safety committees all around the country which can report up through a national safety committee.  Staff members around the country have the opportunity to bring any areas of concern to the committee through their local safety representatives.  Concerns then go to the national safety committee where the issues can be addressed.  That is one way it may be done.</p> <p>  We have a computer system called Shield and anybody can raise any issue on the system.  The issue will be tracked and actioned.  That is another way of doing it.  In the past year, we started a transformational behavioural safety programme using consultants that we brought over from the UK.  It deals with people's relationship with safety.  As part of that, we have set up 30 local leadership teams.  We also have a business unit leadership team.  The programme addresses people's relationship with safety and the psychological side of safety.  Local safety committees tend to deal with the processes, procedures, rules and regulations, equipment and the physical things and the behavioural and relationship side is dealt with through the safe and sound programme.  We are anxious to engage with the organisation on safety and we do so actively.</p></speech>

Finding the leak can take time.  We have invested in new technology such as sniffer vans.  We put gas into the fluid and if it leaves the cable, a passing van can take a sample of the gas.  We also have a gas concentrator and a chromatograph that studies the gas and can pick up a concentration.  Assuming the gas is penetrating the ground, one can home into the leak within a radius of 3 m.</p></speech>

This is the second last night sitting of the Dail and it is slightly busy with all sorts of things going on.  I apologise in advance if some questions I ask have been asked already.  I will keep my contribution brief.  I will take the example of sulphur hexafluoride, the gas used for insulating in the generation system.  As I am not a technology expert, I am not too sure where this gas is used but I understand Mr. O'Loughlin's concern was that its use was far in excess of international best practice and that the reporting, monitoring and accounting of its use did not give an accurate assessment of what was happening.  What is Mr. Hayes's response to that concern?  What has changed in the ESB with respect to the use and monitoring of the use of SF6 gas, as it is called.</p></speech>

It is used as an insulator and is a very good insulator.  It also has arc suppression qualities.  If one flicks a light switch, one might get a spark which is fine but if the voltage is very high, it is very important to have an arc suppression medium in place when doing that.  SF6 is good for doing that.  That is why it is used around the world in distribution and transmission systems as an insulation.  As a consequence, the equipment can be much smaller than if one was using a different medium.  That is important when we are trying to build stations which are required in urban or other areas where land can be difficult to get.  It is used all over the world for that reason.</p> <p>  SF6 is a greenhouse gas and we are mindful that we have to manage its usage.  The F-gas directive was issued in 2006 and updated in 2014.  We are constantly improving what we do.  Some equipment that has SF6 gas has been on the system and in use for a long time.  Moneypoint power station was built around 1980.  This relates to the fact that we are always trying to get better at what we do.  In 2015, we had a suite of management procedures on how to deal with and manage SF6 procedures.  In addition, we are looking at our inventory.  I spoke about our inventory of equipment and noted that we are keeping a record of the equipment we have.  We are constantly improving in this regard, as I explained.  Under the regulations in place at the time, information on the exact amount of gas in the switchgear was not required.  All of our newer equipment is in compliance with the current regulations and it is clear exactly how much SF6 gas is in that type of switchgear.  We are always trying to improve the inventory and that has been happening.</p> <p>  There is some leakage and we acknowledge that.  The leakage rate in comparison to other international utilities has been higher.  Part of the reason for that was the older switchgear that was put in place in Moneypoint in the 1980s.  That has now been replaced by newer switchgear and we are already seeing the impact of that.  When building a transmission station one needs a number of years to retire the old gear and bring in the new gear because it is a big job.  Our usage of SF6 gas in 2018 was significantly less that it was in 2017 because we had already moved some of the circuits from the old Moneypoint switchgear into the new switchgear.    </p> <p>  Ireland has 60 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.  To place SF6 gas usage into context, it equates to 0.027% of Ireland's overall greenhouse gas emissions.  That is not to minimise the fact that we have to manage it.</p></speech>

I should acknowledge that I had been talking to Mr. O&rsquo;Loughlin during this process.  I did not approach the ESB on any of this because I understood there was a mediation process taking place and I was hoping that it would resolve the issues.  I am not questioning any of the ESB representatives or Mr. O'Loughlin.</p> <p>  On a public interest matter, a concern was raised about the fault locator vans.  I am not a technical expert but I heard earlier a description of incidents involving fault identifier crews travelling in vans.  A question arose regarding the inventory of vans and the upgrading, maintenance and monitoring of them and the equipment in them.  A description was given of a crew who were getting a live electric charge - I do not know what the correct technical word is - but they had to earth it using a wooden platform or whatever to enable use of some of the fault detector equipment.  I may be inaccurate on that.  Ms Quane will have seen the earlier presentation and I presume she knows what I am talking about.  As I said earlier, I would have thought that fault detector vans would be a key part of the function the ESB prides itself on doing well in maintaining a grid, even in stormy or difficult conditions.</p></speech>

We looked to the Electrical Networks Association, ENA, in the UK, where there about 20 different network operators.  They have a voluntary reporting code under which the report to the local authorities.  We noted their threshold levels for dealing with leakage and their targets.  We have adopted the same targets as them, namely, 50 l per kilometre of cable per year.  That would give us a target of 10 cu. m of leakage per year.  We are on target for that now.</p></speech>

It is a case of finding a route for the cable.  The Deputy has just come in but we were discussing this earlier.  We have to find a route around the city or under the city streets that avoids the other services, and there is a lot of congestion and so on.

There are other underground cables, such as cables with paper insulation that do not have fluid and others with nitrogen gas insulation.  We are replacing all of those on a risk basis.

The purpose of this meeting is to examine the role of voluntary organisations in the delivery of health services.  This is our second meeting on this topic.  Our first meeting on it was held last month.  On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Mr. Ivan Cooper, who is director of policy with The Wheel, which is the national association of community and voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises; Mr. Austin O'Sullivan, who is director of resources with the WALK organisation, which supports adults with intellectual disabilities; Dr. Joanne McCarthy of the Disability Federation of Ireland and Mr. Gary Lee, who is the federation's chairperson; and Mr. Peter Murphy and Ms Niamh Jones of Epilepsy Ireland.  They are all very welcome.  I thank them for being here.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I wish to advise the witnesses that any opening statements they have submitted to the committee may be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Now that I have got the formalities out of the way, I welcome the witnesses and invite Mr. Ivan Cooper to make an opening statement on behalf of The Wheel.</p></speech>

As director of public policy for The Wheel, I am delighted to have an opportunity to present our position on the subject.  I am joined by Mr. Austin O&rsquo;Sullivan, who is director of resources with WALK, which is a long-standing member of The Wheel.  Before I introduce the members of the committee to The Wheel, I want to make it clear at the outset that The Wheel strongly supports the recommendations made in the independent review group report.  We believe the implementation of these recommendations will bring us closer to an optimised health service that focuses on maximising individual and community health.  When the recommendations are implemented, they will enable community and voluntary organisations to work in partnership with statutory funders to maximise the responsiveness and innovation they can bring to services.</p> <p>  The Wheel is Ireland&rsquo;s national association of community and voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises.  It has more than 1,600 member organisations, which employ over 35,000 people and involve over 45,000 volunteers in delivering services and supports across the country every day.  At least 150 of our member organisations are funded by the HSE under the provisions of sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004, with which members of the committee will be familiar.  They are among more than 800 organisations in total that are funded by the HSE to deliver services, thereby forming a key part of our national health and personal social service infrastructure.  These organisations support people, including people with disabilities and medical conditions, older people and children, to live independent lives and to realise their potential.  Many of these organisations were established through the initiative and advocacy of self-organising communities when no statutory services were provided.</p> <p>  Despite the long-standing role many of these organisations have played, they are facing challenges which limit or in some cases prevent them from carrying out their vital work.  Inadequate budgets and annual funding structures do not facilitate long-term service development.  The increasingly demanding general regulatory environment is diverting time and resources away from front-line services.  The compliance and reporting system is increasingly oriented towards financial compliance rather than effective service outcomes.  Relationships with the HSE are becoming increasingly contract-determined rather than collaborative.  Commissioning and contracting processes put community and voluntary providers at an inherent disadvantage compared to private sector providers.  In many cases, these trends are resulting in our member organisations being unable to meet service demands and maintain the responsive, innovative and person-centred approach that has characterised the sector.</p> <p>  The report proposes a range of practical and urgently needed solutions which would address these issues while improving the relationship between the State and the sector to ensure better outcomes for all.  The authors listened attentively and took a great deal of care in reaching balanced conclusions.  In addition to addressing the issues I have identified, those conclusions identified many areas for improvement in the practice of community and voluntary organisations.  Although these changes will present challenges, I can assure the committee that the sector will not shrink from implementing them.  We would like to bring some key recommendations in the report to the attention of the committee.</p><p>Key recommendations include that a forum for regular dialogue between relevant Departments and the sector be implemented; that a charter for a new relationship between the sector and the State focused on collaboratively developing world-class services be produced; that an agreement be reached on essential services to be fully funded and mapped throughout the country; that service agreements be simplified and duplication in reporting avoided; that multi-annual budgeting be introduced to enable organisations to plan for the long term; that a system to manage deficits be established; and that governance training and supports for smaller organisations be provided.</p><p> Finally, the Wheel believes that the forum on the independent review group's report, which is now in the initial stages of planning, offers a very valuable structure to advance and implement the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  This will be a key means to renew trust and improve collaborative working between all stakeholders.  The terms of reference for the forum should be transparent and open to consultation from representatives of organisations delivering services.  I will now pass to my colleague, Mr. O'Sullivan, director of resources for WALK.</p></speech>

WALK employs 205 staff.  WALK receives an annual grant from the HSE to provide its essential core services.  In addition to this core grant, up to 2008 WALK also received additional grants for salary increments and staff pensions.  Commencing in 2008 WALK has had cumulative cuts of &euro;3.2 million to its core funding and no increment or pension payments have been made since 2009.  In addition to this, WALK faces the additional costs of HIQA compliance, comprising &euro;187,270 in capital costs and annual operational costs of &euro;227,923.</p> <p>  What is the impact of these cuts to funding?  They primarily revolve around service-user safety and quality of life.  Due to this lack of funding, we have been unable to adequately staff support services and this has resulted in risks to service-user safety.  These risks have been fully documented and communicated to the HSE.  WALK continues to operate with high levels of risk in its front-line services.  In addition to these risks, WALK is aware that the lack of funding has had a direct impact on service-user quality of life.  This is most noticeable in incompatible placements of people in residential services and the lack of personalised supports to enable people to achieve their life goals.  The issue of changing needs is also relevant and poses a risk to the individual and the organisation.  </p> <p>  WALK staff earn, on average, 23% less than similar staff in section 38 and HSE-funded services.  Attrition of experienced staff was running at 18% in 2018.  This has had a further impact on the quality of services provided.  In 2014, the Labour Court ruled that St. Aidan&rsquo;s, a similar agency funded under section 39, was liable to pay increments to staff backdated to 2009.  On the back of this, WALK staff have commenced industrial action.  WALK's unsustainable organisation deficit since 2009, caused by funding cuts, has left it in a precarious financial position.</p></speech>

The recommendations in the independent review group report, which we are here to discuss and explore this morning, would go some way towards addressing some, but not all, of those challenges.  We look forward to working in partnership with the Oireachtas, the Government, the Department of Health, the HSE, and other Departments and agencies to ensure the very positive recommendations of the report are implemented and can play their part in achieving the health and social services Ireland deserves.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.484" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019071000002#C00700"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  For more than 50 years, Epilepsy Ireland has been supporting and representing people with epilepsy and their families.  Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological conditions, affecting 37,000 people in Ireland, including 10,000 to 15,000 people who live with uncontrolled, recurrent seizures.  It can be a source of major and long-term disability, which is often hidden and stigmatised.  It affects a person&rsquo;s employment, education, independence, and psychological functioning.</p> <p>  Epilepsy Ireland receives section 39 funding, under seven HSE service arrangements, to provide a range of community-based services.  These are delivered by a team of 11 community resource officers, all of whom work part-time.  My colleague, Ms Jones, is one of our community resource officers based in Cork and will speak about our services in a moment.  As the committee will see, these services are closely aligned with the goals of Sl&aacute;intecare.  </p> <p>  In terms of funding challenges, it is important to say that the difficulties we face are not unique.  They are replicated across the spectrum of small and medium-sized community-based organisations.  In our case, while the service in each HSE region is almost identical, the service level agreement, SLA, funding varies significantly from region to region.  In no area does the funding cover the full cost of delivering the service.  For example, in community healthcare organisation, CHO, area 2, which comprises Galway, Mayo, and Roscommon, the cost of providing our services is approximately &euro;50,000 per annum but the SLA is for just &euro;3,800.  In 2018, the total national cost of providing HSE-funded services was &euro;926,000 but total HSE income was just &euro;784,000.  As with other organisations, the SLA amounts are not negotiable.  A series of annual cuts were implemented in the early part of this decade and these were followed by a long period of static funding.  Today, this funding is 12% lower than it was in 2010.  </p> <p>  This has been compounded by growing cost pressures.  In recent years, we have worked to innovate and expand our services in response to changing service-user needs.  As a result, the total number of service-user contacts nationally increased from 14,000 in 2014 to 20,000 last year.  This, along with economic factors generally, has led to increases in virtually all direct and indirect operating costs, with the notable exception of pay, which remains at similar levels to 2009.  The cost of maintaining quality assurance and governance standards such as the triple lock, which is vital to funders and all our stakeholders, also have significant resource implications that did not exist a decade ago.  </p> <p>  Epilepsy Ireland, like other charities, actively fundraises to support our work, which extends well beyond SLA-funded activities.  This work includes funding research, awareness activities, training programmes and advocacy.  We accept and embrace the need to fundraise but, in recent years, greater demands have been placed on fundraising to cover HSE deficits while we also struggle to maintain wider organisational objectives.  SLA deficits are averaging &euro;160,000 per annum.  Driven by this, and despite tight cost control, more than &euro;600,000 of reserves were utilised between 2013 and 2017 to cover overall organisational deficits.  For an organisation that operates on a total budget of &euro;1.7 million per annum, this is not sustainable.  What will happen when the reserves run dry?  There has been no recognition of these issues by the HSE and no willingness or ability to address them in the annual SLA process.  Deficits are reported in detail on the HSE&rsquo;s annual financial monitoring return, which ties directly to audited accounts.  However, some CHO areas do not allow deficits to be recorded on SLAs, giving the false impression that services are provided at break-even.</p><p> The current funding relationship between the HSE and voluntary sector organisations does not reflect the economic realities of operating high-quality, needs-based community services.  Rather than continuing to innovate and deliver greater outcomes for people living with epilepsy, our primary focus in the current environment is on protecting existing services and ensuring resources are available annually to meet service level agreement deficits.  A fundamental shift in the relationship between the State and the voluntary sector, as detailed by the independent review group, is needed if smaller, community-based organisations like Epilepsy Ireland are to deliver on our mission.  That shift must begin with a recognition of the problems and a commitment to resolving them.  Two IRG recommendations are becoming increasingly urgent, namely, the need to review jointly the broken SLA process and, second, the requirement to move towards full-cost, multi-annual funding.  In short, non-profit should not mean loss-making.</p><p> I will now hand over to my colleague, Ms Niamh Jones.</p></speech>

Our aim is to empower people to become experts in their own condition and learn to self-manage it</p> <p>on a day-to-day basis.  In the past ten years, my role has evolved and expanded greatly, becoming more varied and flexible as we work to tailor our services to meet individual needs.  I will use my time to outline a recent case, which I hope will demonstrate</p> <p>the impact we are having on the welfare of people with epilepsy and their families.</p> <p>  I received a referral from the epilepsy team at Cork University Hospital of a man who had just been diagnosed.  I immediately arranged to meet him and his wife to start our Living Well with Epilepsy programme, which is designed specifically to meet the needs of people with a new diagnosis.  We discussed the relevant issues, including employment, driving, entitlements, safety and risk, lifestyle and triggers, and jointly worked out a plan and strategies to manage those issues.  We subsequently arranged a full family meeting as the couple's two children are likely at some point to find themselves alone with their father when he is having a tonic-clonic seizure.  The family members were enabled to express their concerns in a safe environment and I went through all the "dos and don'ts" of seizure first aid.  At a subsequent meeting, the man's children were happy to report that they had been at home with their father when he had a seizure and the knowledge they had gained meant they did very well looking after him.  Since then, I have delivered epilepsy awareness talks in both children's schools, and the man and his wife have attended our support group meetings, which take place in the evening, where they have received peer support from people in similar situations.  The man's employer called me recently asking for epilepsy training for staff, which is another service we provide.  This client will soon be attending our six-week STEPS self-management programme, which provides a learning environment where people can gain skills and knowledge to achieve the best health and quality of life that they can by managing their epilepsy in an active and positive way.  He may later avail of our Innerwise service, a more advanced personal development and well-being programme.</p> <p>  These innovative services were developed in response to unmet needs, and evaluations have shown very positive outcomes.  Our programmes also strongly complement the HSE's Sl&aacute;intecare objectives, such as the promotion of patient-centred,</p> <p>self-management interventions for chronic conditions.  In the near future, community and patient organisations like Epilepsy Ireland will play a key role in making Sl&aacute;intecare a reality.  This is only one example of my day-to-day work, but I hope it shows how accessible, valuable and complementary our service is in providing a person-centred approach to support and education, not just for the individual with epilepsy but also for all those who are impacted by the diagnosis in their daily lives.</p></speech>

We acknowledge that this is the second of two days of discussions with voluntary organisations in the health sector, which shows a welcome commitment on the part of the committee to get under the skin of this issue.  The Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, is a national support organisation comprising more than 120 member organisations.  We work to create an Ireland that is fully inclusive of people with disabilities.  It is important to note that we are not distinctive in the work that we do; in fact, there are huge interlinkages with Epilepsy Ireland, for instance, which is a member of DFI, and we are a founding member of The Wheel.  We all work well together to create a strong community infrastructure which supports people with disabilities and those at risk.  Members can find more information about DFI on our website.</p> <p>  Like our colleagues, we fully endorse the recommendations contained in the independent review group report, notwithstanding the reality that our member organisations will face significant challenges in implementing them.  One of the most important recommendations is the commitment the IRG is seeking to resetting the relationship between the voluntary sector, on the one hand, and the HSE and the Department of the Health, on the other, in the delivery of services.  We have heard stark evidence, both today and at the meeting of this committee on 19 June, of the need for that to happen.  It is one of the issues I hope members will take away and reflect upon following these meetings.  The reality is that the relationship between the State and the community and voluntary sector is broken.  There are significant failures in the process of agreeing on and delivering necessary supports and services to people with disabilities, whether in acute settings such as day services, respite and 24-7 residential services, as members heard on 19 June, or in the types of community-based services we are talking about today.  There is no planning mechanism in place to respond to changing needs, no effective costing mechanism, no clarity on what the State is willing to fund, and no agreement to fund services to their full cost.  These are core issues that go to the heart of the ability of organisations to provide high-quality services to some of the most vulnerable people in society.</p> <p>  Having noted the interlinkages between organisations in the sector, it is important to consider the complexity that underlies that commonality.  Members heard at the meeting on 19 June and again today that while we have agreement around the issues and recommendations in the IRG report, experiences vary greatly depending on the organisation.  We all agree on certain points, namely, that the nature of the HSE relationship is broken, there are chronic funding deficit issues that must be addressed, there is a difficulty in recruiting staff and there are pay issues and issues to do with the service level agreement as the mechanism for agreeing contractual relationships.  However, those issues are experienced differently depending on whether an organisation is  community-based or one that delivers what are seen as core disability services in the context of residential or day services.  We all know there is a funding crisis.  Most organisations took cuts during the recession and, in most cases, there was no attempt to secure agreement on how those cuts would be implemented and the impact they would have on service users.  There may have been that type of engagement with some of the larger organisations but not generally.  Fifty organisations are now in a process to achieve pay restoration, but most organisations in the sector, including the ones we represent, are not included in that process.  In other words, funding is a general problem, but how it is being experienced is not equitable across the system.</p> <p>  At the meeting on 19 June, we heard that the sector is facing a deficit of between &euro;30 million and &euro;40 million.  In fact, that estimate needs to include the types of things we have been discussing today, where organisations are running down their savings and using important fundraising money to supplement the cost of delivering core disability services.  This goes to the heart of the need to secure a multi-annual investment programme and, in addition, an agreement on the types of services we wish to deliver into the future.  I take this opportunity, before the Oireachtas goes into recess, to remind members of the importance of agreeing a list of essential services.  We are all agreed that the first thing that must be done is to establish a forum and agree on its charter, that is, the work it will be tasked to do.  After that, the next big challenge will be agreeing the list of essential services.  One option might be to seek to continue to deliver the services we currently deliver into the future.</p><p>If we do that we will be missing a significant opportunity to actually use something like the forum to deliver on Sl&aacute;intecare.<br/><br/>I will offer an example of how the money for disability in the 2019 budget is used.  A total of &euro;1.9 billion is going into disability services.  That is a significant amount of money - we all have to acknowledge that.  Decisions have been made around how that money was to be applied.  Fully 90% of that funding goes to fund residential respite and day services.  I am not suggesting these are not needed - in fact, we heard on 19 June that more is needed - but it means only 10% of &euro;1.9 billion is used to resource and fund centre and community-based services.  Day services and respite services respond to the need of approximately 30,000 people with disabilities and their families.  Yet, there are over 600,000 people with disabilities living in Ireland today.  Most of those are struggling in their own homes with changing needs and conditions.  The community-based organisations offering the types of services we have heard about today help to keep these people living in their own homes, staying as well as possible and away from heavy expensive services.  If that is not value for money, then we have to ask questions about what is.<br/><br/>Before coming in today we did a quick <i>tour de la table</i>with some of our member organisations to ensure we were still on the pulse of the issues being experienced by them.  I will offer a quick snapshot.  These are small organisations that help those with epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and post-polio.  They have family names.  Committee members will know them because they are in the local communities.  Most carry a service arrangement with between two and nine HSE community healthcare organisations.  We need to consider the administrative burden of this on a small organisation.  None of these organisations is fully funded.  We heard the example of how the epilepsy organisation gets &euro;3,500 but it costs &euro;50,000 to deliver the service.  There is no engagement to discuss how or what type of services will be delivered and how this will be funded.  That is a common experience across the board.  Some organisations have been feeling the pressure to use and divert existing resources to deal with increasing health demands.  A person from the Blanchardstown Centre for Independent Living explained that the centre has a bus that it had been using to support its members for social outings and engagements.  We all know the social isolation that people with disability experience.  That service is really important to maintain people's mental health and to create connections in communities.  Increasingly, because of the increasing health needs of that particular cohort of service users - I hate that term - or people with disabilities who use the services, the centre now has to use the bus to ferry people to and from medical appointments.  They are doing core health business but that has never been acknowledged in the service arrangement.  Again, at issue is the fact that the organisations are not allowed to record deficit and this causes major problems.  Oftentimes, the organisations not have a formal face-to-face relationship or even a meeting once a year with the HSE to agree the service plan.  These are core basic issues that need to be addressed to support the network of vital community services that support people.  I will hand over to the chair of the Disability Federation of Ireland who will make some further comments.</p></speech>

I wish to associate the Disability Federation of Ireland with the comments of the previous speakers from the other organisations.  I will follow on from what Dr. McCarthy said.  It is imperative that community-based supports serving 95% of people with a disability are recognised as essential services.  The list must be sector-specific and be respectful of the needs of people with disabilities.  The majority of people with a disability would identify measures such as respite, personal assistance hours or community programmes as essential services.  The importance of community based services is clear when we see the first-hand impact it can have on service users.  Some examples were given and there are more examples in our submission to the committee.</p> <p>  It is crucial to recognise that voluntary organisations are businesses.  To function they must have an open dialogue with the State, in particular, the Department of Health and the HSE, that can be facilitated through the establishment of the forum, as recommended in the independent review group report.  We need contracts that are fit for purpose and specific to the services we provide.  Voluntary organisations must be provided with the opportunity to plan for the future through multi-annual budgeting.  To allow for equity across the sector, the services that benefit all people with disabilities must be recognised as essential.</p> <p>  We recognise that the disability voluntary sector has issues that must be tackled and the implementation of the recommendations in the report will be a challenge to both the sector and the State.  However, it is of paramount importance that action is taken and that real change occurs in the relationship between the State and the voluntary sector.  A healthy working relationship stands only to better the lives of service users.</p> <p>  The independent review group report was an evidence-based report.  The committee was chaired by Catherine Day, as we know.  It is February since the report was issued.  Yet, we have not seen any progress on the report in that time.  Our concern is that it will be shelved.  It cannot be shelved.  The State needs the voluntary sector.  The voluntary sector provides essential services to people the State should be providing services to.  From our experience, the relationship between the State and the voluntary disability sector is broken.  I echo the comments of previous speakers on that point.  Something needs to be done about it.</p></speech>

The first relates to what Dr. McCarthy said about not being allowed to record deficits.  We had some discussion at the meeting on 19 June with regard to the impact this has.  As Dr. McCarthy said, the organisations are businesses.  In business terms, there is a name for that.  I have no wish to be throwing it around but we know what it is.  I wish to be clear.  The HSE prohibits the organisations from recording a deficit but the executive expect services to be delivered.  Can you confirm that the organisations effectively take referrals from the HSE, Dr. McCarthy?  People in the community are told where they can access these support services.  Ms Jones illustrated well exactly how that works.  It strikes me that there is an attitude of wanting it but not being prepared to pay for it on the part of the HSE.  Can you expand on that and explain how the relationship works, Dr. McCarthy?  Perhaps I am wrong but I am hearing that on the one hand the HSE says it desperately needs the organisations but on the other hand the HSE is not prepared to pay for them.</p></speech>

In the case of many of the community-based organisations the HSE does not even say it desperately wants them and that is part of the problem.  Let us consider Sl&aacute;intecare.  We recently had Ms Magahy in with us.  There is an interpretation of what a core disability service amounts to.  As we heard on 19 June, even those core services are being significantly challenged in terms of how they agree to deliver services.  The term "auxiliary services" is often used to describe community-based services.  There is probably a lack of understanding or appreciation of the value of those services because organisations do not necessarily have face-to-face meetings ever with the HSE to agree on the service.  There is no discussion even around what the HSE is willing to fund.  I reckon we need to take a step back.  There is a historical funding relationship that gets delivered through the service arrangement.  I am unsure whether there is a contemporary understanding of what these organisations are doing or the fact that this is the future model.  It is about delivering person-centred community services as close to the person's home as possible.  This is being put into operation by these organisations.  We fund a particular model and that is where 90% of the funding goes.  That is where the relationship is being driven.  I do not know if my colleagues want to talk about a particular point.</p><p>I would like to direct one question to Ms Jones.  She gave us an example.  Could she describe what would have happened if Epilepsy Ireland's service was not there?  What services exist for that gentleman?  Ms Jones's service is right there with him.  He is dealing with a fairly traumatic event in his life and Epilepsy Ireland is giving him practical support.  If it was not doing so, who in the HSE would step in to meet his needs?</p></speech>

However, we are the only organisation in the country representing people with epilepsy.  Once the epilepsy team has provided its education and support within the hospital environment, a patient is then out in the community.  We now have a direct referral link with the HSE epilepsy team.  We get the referrals, immediately contact them and tailor the response to the person's needs.  No other organisation exists to deal specifically with epilepsy.</p></speech>

That is not to undermine what has been said.  This level of expertise is quite common around the neurological bodies and it is usually undervalued.  Motor neurone disease is another example.  Voluntary bodies shadow affected families.  Approximately 400 families, give or take, are addressing the issue of neurology at any one time.  Voluntary bodies will shadow an affected family.  They know that in six months that family will need a hoist for the patient to get downstairs.  These organisations are able to predict needs and provide a wraparound service in the community that really sustains the capacity of those families to live with those conditions.</p></speech>

They are fundamentally divided into three parts.  The first part is very straightforward; it is the quantum of service an organisation is to provide on behalf of the HSE.  That arrangement pertains either to a number of people or a number of hours.  The second part is the cost, that is, how much it costs the organisation to provide those services.  The third part concerns the amount the HSE will actually pay.  In the vast majority of cases there is a fundamental difference between the cost of providing those services and the amount the HSE pays.  The HSE does not allow voluntary bodies to put the actual cost of providing services into their SLAs.  They have to manipulate things to show the costs as equal to the amount the HSE is paying.  It is very difficult for most organisations to get the chairperson of their board to sign off on that because it is not really true.</p></speech>

I do not necessarily have access to the history.  I can certainly comment on it on the basis of the documents available in our case.  In the pre-HSE era so-called section 65 funding under the Health Act 1953 was individually negotiated with each local health board.  There seems to have been a system for several years under which service plans were submitted locally for each region around the country.  Again, they grew up individually in each region.  Around the turn of the century a process called the Harmon review introduced funding arrangements for several smaller community organisations like ourselves.  These things all happened piecemeal and led over the years to individual funding amounts.  When the HSE was set up and the SLA process began, those amounts transferred over and they have been stationary ever since.</p></speech>

In addition to raising awareness and trying to source grants from the agency, in some cases they are also trying to raise money voluntarily.  Every organisation is involved in that.</p> <p>  I raise an issue in respect of healthcare.  We seem to be continually increasing the expenditure going into healthcare and I am not sure whether we are doing it in the right way.  I raised that issue previously with the HSE.  People here may not be aware that an additional 16,000 staff are working in the HSE now compared with the number four years ago.  I am not sure whether the witnesses are aware of that.  I do not believe there has been any growth in the numbers of people working in the organisations the witnesses represent.  Funding has not been given to increase the number of people in their organisations to the same extent as that which has occurred in the HSE.</p> <p>  In examining all these issues I have to consider the area of budget.  According to the 2018 annual report of the HSE, more than &euro;4.4 billion was paid out to the various section 38 and 39 organisations.  That is a very large slice of the HSE budget.  We seem to be reliant now on a range of organisations to deliver care in many areas.  For instance, we are very reliant on Epilepsy Ireland to deliver care for people with epilepsy.  Is there a need for a more co-ordinated approach?  It must be the case that some organisations are delivering the same services.  Should we consider if we can deliver better services by more co-ordination among existing organisations and the HSE?  The HSE has looked at the way its funding is being used, but I am not sure if the organisations have considered if a better service can be delivered by them working together rather than independently.  That is one area we need to examine.</p> <p>  More than 3,000 organisations get funding from the HSE.  That is a very large number and is a huge amount of the HSE budget, but is that funding being used wisely?  I am not convinced that the budget the HSE retains is being used wisely.  As I said, 16,000 additional staff have been recruited over four years.  I am mesmerised how that number has grown in such a short time.</p> <p>  Have the organisations considered doing a five-year or a ten-year programme?  We have talked about Sl&aacute;intecare, which is a ten-year programme.  In terms of forward planning, have the organisations looked at whether a merger or amalgamation would be beneficial in some cases or the possibility of delegating work one organisation is doing where another organisation is also providing the same service?  Have they examined that entire reorganisation issue?  It happened in the trade union movement 25 or 30 years ago.  It had a large number of different unions and they came to the conclusion that they would gain much more by amalgamating and working together rather than working independently.  Has that issue been examined?</p> <p>  I have the list from the HSE's 2018 annual report and there are a very large number of organisations.  I am aware that some of them are getting very large amounts of funding.  Some of the voluntary hospitals are included in that &euro;4.4 billion but it is still a major slice of the entire health budget.  It is about whether we can deliver services in a more co-ordinated way in certain areas.  I am not taking from the work of Epilepsy Ireland.  No other organisation can replace it because the work it does is comprehensive, but there is duplication in other areas and I wonder if we can do a better job in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.538" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joanne McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019071000002#G00500"><p>I will start and others can come in if they wish.  That is a question people always ask.  We hear of these large numbers of organisations.  To reply to the Senator I will go back to go forward.  The first point to remember is that 90% of the funding goes to a very small cohort of service delivery organisations.  The number the Senator is talking about is not that large.  Some &euro;1.9 million goes into the voluntary sector part of the disability programme and 90% of that goes in one particular way.</p> <p>  There are opportunities for looking at service design.  For example, a new rehabilitation strategy was published a year or two ago focusing on the clinical side of rehabilitation.  Part of it refers to the community side, which would bring organisations such as Epilepsy Ireland and others together to examine ways of sharing services, planning for the need for community-based services and then going to the HSE for funding of that need.  There is opportunity for that but the Senator should not forget that most of these organisations are bringing in significant resources.  First, they are co-funding services so how do we build that into the mix?  We cannot afford not to let Epilepsy Ireland use its own resources to deliver services.  Second, they have a significant amount of expertise that will not be in the system if we do not protect it.  All these organisations have major links with the European associations and research groups.  That level of expertise and added value must be valued and brought into the system.</p> <p>  Without a doubt, that conversation needs to start but not just at the point of amalgamations because we would lose the co-funded nature of many of these services and their significant added value in terms of expertise, specialism and the touching base with families and communities.  When we have that conversation it needs to be in that much broader context.  That is where I would start.  I do not know if anybody else wishes to contribute.</p></speech>

In fact, the research we have done shows that when organisations get to a certain size, the person gets lost, so to speak.  Our experience and the experiences of other community and voluntary organisations is that they arose out of the community to meet the needs of the community they serve.  When organisations are disassociated from the people, there are far fewer outcomes for those people.  It is a stated objective of the HSE to deal with far fewer organisations but I have yet to receive any evidence from it on the reason it believes that makes sense.</p></speech>

Is that not exactly what the HSE is now dealing with in that I presume many of the organisations find it difficult to tie down one individual in the HSE to make a decision?  Mr. O'Sullivan might talk about that experience where his organisation meets one person in the HSE only to find that he or she must go up along the line for a decision to be made.  One of the problems I find with the HSE is that I can make representations on a particular issue, and while I might make it to person A, I find that A passes it on to B, B onto C and C onto D before I can get a decision.  Are the voluntary organisations experiencing the same problem?</p></speech>

The relationship with the HSE is now purely a transactional one.  There is no partnership and no coming together to solve the needs of the cohort.  We find that the person we meet face to face has no power to decide on even the smallest thing.  Everything has to be sent up and we could be waiting for years before the answer comes back down.  The efficiency of communication between the sector and the HSE certainly has an impact on the ability of organisations to do their day-to-day work.</p></speech>

The role played by the voluntary and community organisations in health and social services is well understood by this committee and it is in every community in the country.  It is inextricably intertwined and bound up in our core health and social services.  The two are no longer separable and they need to be understood to be part of a system that needs to be re-understood and properly resourced.  The independent review group report published by Dr. Catherine Day and her team engaged very deeply with this particular issue and made a strong, central core recommendation - to which Dr. McCarthy alluded earlier - on the idea of essential services.  We are never going to escape this kind of circular conversation we are having currently.</p> <p>  In fairness to the folk who work in health services administration in the various departments, they are all under intense pressure in delivering outcomes and scrutiny around budgets, which of course is all right and proper.  Everybody is under pressure, but a core recommendation is to agree and identify the essential services people should have available to them in their day-to-day lives in their communities and that we should work backwards from that.  It is kind of like the old idea - most of us are familiar with the terminology - of outcomes-based working.  There is some theory there.  Inside the HSE there are people who think about this, and in the Department of Health, the Sl&aacute;intecare office is established now.  Maybe we can look more towards ideas of commissioning services where we look at the outcomes and then agree if the outcomes are going to be sufficient to meet the community need.  Ultimately, however, it starts off with having a clear sense of the need we are trying to serve within communities.  Then we can have a conversation about the types of resources and services that are necessary.</p> <p>  This plays back to Senator Burke's point about optimal ways for organisations to do things.  Of course, inevitably there are optimal ways of doing things.  If reform is to be structured around making central administrators' lives easier, the problem will be administration-led services that will come increasingly distant from communities.  If the reform is designed to make services more flexible, innovative and responsive at ground level, then it will be the other way around and we will end up with a devolution and delegation inside the system to the closest possible place where accountability should be experienced by individuals who require services.</p> <p>  Viewed that way, our community and voluntary sector being present in every community is in fact an asset that is already there, if we can find a way of connecting it up better with itself and integrating it in a more cohesive way into our health services' strategic thinking.  I would call today for the Department of Health and the HSE to engage the community and voluntary sector more in strategic thinking about the future of the health and social services.  The sector will not be found wanting ultimately in understanding the part it needs to play in well-designed services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.545" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1419" speakername="John Dolan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019071000002#H00500"><p>I welcome all of the witnesses.  I have had a long connection with all of them in my involvement with the Disability Federation of Ireland.  We were very core, which goes to the very idea of co-operation, to the importance of the establishment of The Wheel as something that was bigger and for the whole community and voluntary sector.  It is an example of understanding that it is beyond oneself.  WALK and Epilepsy Ireland and many others have been part of the movement for a long time.</p> <p>  This report gives our committee a strong basis for focusing its work over the next year or two around the disability issue.  It raises some of the critical strategic issues and brings it down to brass tacks.  The independent review group report referred to owing a debt of gratitude to the people who work in the voluntary sector.  It did not say the people who were employed.  It referred to those who work in it, which takes in both.  There is a high dependency in that regard as an integral part of the whole sector.  The report's authors were struck by the need of the organisations with which they engaged to be listened to and their willingness to find a new basis for co-operation.  The last part of that is a challenge to the voluntary organisations as well as just saying that they are great.</p> <p>  The report stated that Ireland benefits from a strong public service commitment in both the statutory and voluntary sectors.  Perhaps this is the place to start engagement between the HSE, the statutory health services and the voluntary services.  The report reads, "If the voluntary sector is to be retained, as we believe it should, there is a need to give public recognition to its legally separate nature".  This may be a soft way of putting it that they are not subcontractors of the HSE.  It goes to the heart of how we respectfully engage.  The report goes on that the voluntary sector must also recognise "its dependence on the State".  It is a two-way street.</p> <p>  I will move on to the witnesses, as I realise we are stuck for time.  We have been here before.  There was the White Paper in 2000 on supporting voluntary activity.  That was nearly 20 years ago.  It was a whole-of-government thing with all of the Departments, an implementation group and the whole works for a policy that came out in 1999.  That has withered on the vine and it withered fairly quickly.  In the context of this report and all of the things that would give us hope, how do we put that statement against the fact of what has happened previously and the difficulty of making things stick?</p> <p>  Is there actual respect for the public benefit these organisations bring? This is the term used in our charity legislation.  They cannot become charities unless they are adjudged to bring public benefit.  Is there actual respect for that?</p> <p>  The disability services programme of &euro;1.9 billion is built on an old administrative structure that perhaps goes back to the foundation of the State.  Will the witnesses comment on or make an input into the amount of support and engagement that takes place outside of the disability health services but within the health services? Much of the epilepsy support for people is neurologist teams and so on and is not funded through the disability services programme.  Perhaps the witnesses could give some sense of the importance of the broader picture.  How relevant do the representatives believe Sl&aacute;intecare is?  Is it another process that is going in parallel or in a similar direction?</p> <p>  Much of the disability services programme is about delivering reactive services, which must be provided because people have got to a certain situation.  Should we be getting to the point of delivering more of a proactive service?</p><p>Last week we had a meeting with the new chairman of the HSE.  He talked about the demographics and said we are trying to chase him at the wrong end of the spectrum.  I put that to the witnesses.  He says we must invest in prevention, amelioration and measures that prevent and-or slow down the impact of conditions.  He referred to medicines and other things.</p><p> Then there is the advocacy role and the work that is done outside of the specific disability.  Ms Jones spoke about schools, family and employment, and other witnesses made similar references.</p><p> That is it in a nutshell.</p></speech>

I am not a figures or administration person.  With regard to Sl&aacute;intecare, we are already there.  We take a very person-centred approach.  We are flexible and work out of hours.  I work at night and on Saturdays to provide our service.  That is very important to the public reaction and its appreciation of what we provide.  We are accessible.  We work everywhere - in the south, south west and up to the north.  I am saying that it should not just be on paper, but on the ground.  It should be looking at what I am doing.  My 11 colleagues and I are the people who are out providing a service that is recommended.  There is much talk about being person-centred and accessible, but how many of us can do that without the resources?  We need the resources to do it.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned that the funding is going into main sources, whereas much of ours has to come from fundraising and other areas to provide these formalised programmes.  We provide a continuum of care outside the hospital environment from new diagnosis right through the person's life.  It might be a parent at the beginning.  I am now meeting young adults who were children who have come through it.  I am going with them into colleges and providing epilepsy awareness in colleges throughout the country.  They are going into employment.  I belong to a single very small organisation in the group to which Dr. McCarthy referred.  Let us look at what we are doing on the ground.</p> <p>  I wish to get rid of a misconception that we do not work with other organisations.  We need to go there and examine that.  As the Senator said, ours is a very specialised organisation but we link on the ground.  We have very strong links.  It is not appreciated how much we link with the neurology teams, but outside those teams and in the community, we could not exist without networking with each other, education centres, acquired brain injury organisations and mental health organisations.  We are linking continually.  How one formalises that is the way to go forward.  We are not all working in isolation.  We work with people on the ground.  Look at what is happening on the ground and not just on paper.  Let it not be the words but the work on the ground.  This is all about the person with the condition and the people it impacts in the community.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.548" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joanne McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019071000002#J00300"><p>With regard to the &euro;1.9 billion, it is interesting that 90% of it is for core specialist disability services.  That is what the Senator was talking about on the 19th.  It is for the day services, 24-7 residential services and the respite care.  There is 10% which relates to much of what we are discussing today.  They are funded through disability services, but they equally could be funded through primary care.  They are a significant resource to primary care because they provide a specialist network of resources that enable people to live with conditions.  They do self-management courses, specialist yoga and so forth.  They provide core primary care services that have a specialist interest.</p> <p>  That goes back, perhaps, to what Senator Dolan said.  We are almost stuck to delivering disability services in an historical way when the reality of disability has changed over time.  One in four people now acquires a disability at working age.  That is all neurological.  Many of them are, for example, people with acquired brain injury and people with MS.  They are not planned for within disability services.  That is the 1,400 people who acquired a disability at working age and are now living in nursing homes because they are not planned for and there is no service for them.  We must think differently about what type of service we are willing to offer people with disabilities.  That includes better demographic planning for the 30,000 people who are in core disability services but it equally means we must plan the value of community-based disability organisations into the delivery of generic primary care community-based services at local level.  Where one will ring for the epilepsy, MS or motor neurone person, the HSE offices should know who the person in the region is and it plans in a coherent way the delivery of community services to people, whether it is through primary care or disability support services.</p> <p>  In that way one can see how critical it is for Sl&aacute;intecare to fully understand what community disability services do when it is beginning to plan its services.  The DFI had a seminar to which we invited Ms Magahy.  She acknowledged that and she said she recognises how critical it is for Sl&aacute;intecare to look at the recommendations from the Dr. Catherine Day report in this context.  We know that.  She also acknowledged that perhaps disability in its entirety had not been planned into Sl&aacute;intecare in its current position but that she was open to it and, hopefully, following our seminar, will begin to do that.  Undoubtedly, Sl&aacute;intecare should offer a way to create threading between specialist and disability services in the mainstream and then specialist community services and core disability residential or wraparound services.  It should allow us to thread those and see them as a tapestry of opportunity so people can come into and out of different types of services depending on what their need is.</p></speech>

With regard to respect for public benefit, this respect is articulated at senior leadership level in Departments and agencies and exists formally on paper in strategies and documents.  The system knows that it is reliant in many respects on organisations and the work they do on the ground.  It is articulated in that way.</p> <p>  There is a danger that the words do not move from that leadership level into practical application in terms of daily realities between funders and organisations.  The system, organisations and funding agencies are under stress, as I indicated.  Many of our members will report, for example, that they experience this double type of attitude to them.  Formally they are respected, but when it comes to the nuts and bolts of the contracts, the service arrangements and the annual negotiations on budgets the relationship is not like that.  It is felt more as a relationship that is moving in the direction of control via service contract.  Some members will use stronger language, such as "manipulation".  Very strong language is used sometimes, so there are mixed messages.  It is like the relationship between the funded organisations and their statutory funding partners.  It is a marriage that is under intense stress at present and is in danger of coming apart at the seams.  One member of the marriage appears to hold all the power in the form of the pay cheque, if members understand what I mean.  This is the reality.  They are putting a brave face on it in public when they are out and about but that is starting to wear off, to stretch the metaphor.  There is an issue in that regard.  To answer Senator Dolan's question directly, is it respect if one says one respects somebody but one's actions do not appear to be read by others as being respectful?  That issue is coming to a head.</p> <p>  Another point made by the Senator was about whether we have been in this situation previously; we have been.  It relates to the same issue.  It is the positive language.  Something happened ten years ago and everybody in the voluntary sector is awake to the stresses and strains, but Austin O'Sullivan articulated the extent of the cuts that were made.  They were never reinstated and demand is continuing to rise.</p> <p>  My final remark comes back to the idea of essential services.  We are going to be in a groundhog day conversation until we can get this issue nailed.  We have an opportunity to do it through Sl&aacute;intecare and this report.</p><p>It is important for us, given the forum we are in now, to signal very strongly to the officials in the Department, to politicians and to everybody that the sector does not want an adversarial relationship but a relationship of partnership and collaboration.  That is what we stand for in terms of our work.  Partnership work is difficult.  It is like a marriage under stress, it will come apart if positive action is not taken.</p></speech>

This is one of the key words I picked up from what Senator Dolan said.  It is difficult to state that there is a culture of respect when, as we have heard from others, we operate in an environment whereby the contract is king and governs the entire relationship.  It is very rare, if at all, that we will be questioned about the quality of the service we deliver, our plans for the future or anything that relates to the outcomes we deliver.  Any or all of the relationship interactions seem to be based on observing the timeline, meeting the deadline or informing us that we forgot to enter data in a particular column.  It is a technical relationship, as Mr. Cooper stated.  Everybody wants to move to a position whereby our work in the future will evaluated not just in the context of the financial numbers but on the basis of the actual outcomes we can deliver.  We try to deliver actual outcome information and data, but this is not necessarily something that is ever valued by the contracting partner.</p> <p>  We have heard a great deal about Sl&aacute;intecare.  As already stated, it is organisations such as Epilepsy Ireland that will play a key role in the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare.  We are looking to move from a hospital-centric model to the timely provision of services locally.  All of the neurological organisations and groups have a major role to play in this regard.</p> <p>  When one talks about the HSE, there is a significant difference between how organisations such as ours are viewed by our clinical partners.  In our case, these are the neurologists, the epilepsy specialist nurses and the wider services.  Those who work with us on a day-to-day basis see the value in how we supplement their services and, in certain instances, how we actually fill in the gaps, particularly in respect of epilepsy nursing and so on.  They see the real value of our service, but one does not form the impression that there is any form of partnership approach.  I wish that there could be a communications channel whereby our funders could engage withe the staff of the HSE with whom we work day to day.</p> <p>  Senator Dolan referred to advocacy and the significant role that organisations such as ours play in that.  Ms Jones referred to speaking to employers and various others regarding rights, entitlements and all the rest.  Another key aspect of advocacy is highlighting the deficiencies that are out there.  It is organisation such as ours that highlight these issues.  A recent example that this committee would be familiar with would be that of sodium valproate, a drug used to treat epilepsy that was brought to the attention of the Oireachtas through patient advocacy efforts.</p></speech>

I will focus on Senator Dolan's concept of value.  We know that what is counted is valued.  One can hear a great deal from the HSE regarding outputs.  Often, in the context of the types of services we are talking about today, there is no counting of unmet need.  The number of PA hours that are not being delivered in a particular region are not counted.  They are not looking at the number of respite services that are required in a particular region for families that are trying to support loved ones at home but just need that extra support.  That is not counted.  That the community services and supports available are not valued can often be seen in the fact that they are not counted.  Once it is counted, one must acknowledge the increasing level of demand and the inability of the system, as it stands, to meet it.  I want to use this opportunity to allow people to understand that it is not just about the funding, it is also about not gathering the evidence of the need that is there.  It is also about how organisations  at community level are being stretched in terms of trying to fill the gaps regarding something that is not actually been acknowledged or counted.</p></speech>

I have used the services of Epilepsy Ireland in my professional life in the context of people with new diagnoses.  There is always a void if someone, especially a young person, receives a diagnosis of epilepsy and needs support.  Epilepsy Ireland is the only organisation to which to refer people.  There is no one else to call.  The value of that support for an individual or a family who have never dealt with such a condition cannot be underestimated, particularly, as Ms Jones noted, in the context of working through the process as the person gets older and the changes in his or her life become more significant.  It is very concerning that there is very little value placed on or respect for this support.</p> <p>  In terms of Sl&aacute;intecare, would I be correct in stating that this is a contract-and-service based approach and that one would nearly be afraid it would be whittled down into a monetary contract and that the years of work, the years of relationships and the natural networks that have been built up would not be taken into consideration?  In other words, it would almost become an inanimate figure rather than comprising an evaluation and a qualitative analysis of all that our guests' organisations bring to the table.  I am concerned about whether, if it becomes a contractual, box-ticking, deadline-meeting exercise, that the core value of the voluntary bodies represented here will be destroyed.</p> <p>  Reference was made to sodium valproate.  Epilepsy Ireland, along with its international counterparts, has done significant work to help the people who need this drug but also to bring information on it to the attention of the medical professions and this committee.  It has done significant work in informing us and I do not know where we would have gone if it had not been for Epilepsy Ireland.  It also contributed greatly when we were considering the medicinal cannabis legislation and, as a professional body, had huge value to add in that regard.  This committee knows the value of Epilepsy Ireland and has respect for it.  We have benefited from its expertise.</p> <p>  I was not exactly sure what Dr. McCarthy was saying when she stated that 10% of what is budgeted for could through community services?</p></speech>

Of that &euro;1.9 billion, 90% funds residential respite and day services.  It is often respite care that is linked to the day services programme.  That allocation is for 30,000 people give or take.</p></speech>

Some 90% of the funding goes to fund that model of service and the remaining 10% is used for all the other community-based services.</p><p>It is crude, but it works off the value for money working group 1 report for 2017 and, as such, is quite accurate.</p></speech>

There seems to be a dissociation between the HSE and their work, with the Disability Federation of Ireland being an essential link in that regard.</p></speech>

I refer specifically to people with epilepsy who may not drive.  Epilepsy Ireland previously contacted me on this issue.  Such persons do not receive a travel pass.  Particularly in rural Ireland, people often take the risk of driving a car because they cannot otherwise go to work, operate their tractor, etc.  As a medical professional, I am concerned that it could have serious consequences if the person has a seizure.  When the delegates go to the Department about an issue such as this, for people with epilepsy who have a long-term illness card and, as such, receive their medication for free, how are such initiatives responded to?  Leaving aside the money and contract and, rather, focusing on their expertise, how does the Department and the HSE engage with the delegates?  Are they just dismissed?</p></speech>

On the specific issue of free travel, a campaign we have fought for more than ten years, approximately a year and a half ago we met the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, to discuss the issue.  He considered it fair that people who essentially were stopped from driving by the State should be compensated in some way by it.</p></speech>

If a person has active seizures, it goes without saying he or she should exercise caution.  It would make sense in terms of their independence and ability to function economically for people to automatically qualify for free travel on diagnosis of epilepsy or for as long as they cannot drive because of seizures.  The Minister of State was very enthusiastic about this idea.  Several weeks later we were put in touch with officials within the Department and every aspect of our plan was hit back to us.  We were given six or seven reasons it could not happen.</p></speech>

Although I cannot remember the exact cost of extending the free travel scheme to them, it would not be particularly significant.  The proposal has gone into hibernation based on some of the feedback we received from the Department which did not take the issue particularly seriously at the time.  It is one on which we hope to revert to the committee.  We recently sought to speak to the Deputy about the matter.</p></speech>

It is very difficult to explain to an 18 year old lad with epilepsy that he may not drive.  Perhaps as a result of this meeting the committee will write to the Minister to remind him of the correspondence in that regard.</p></speech>

I agree with the comments of Deputy O'Connell.  As someone who works on the ground, I often wonder whether the figure of 5,000 is accurate because people may under-report or diminish their symptoms.  I know of certain patients who are almost afraid to say they have had a seizure because their livelihood may depend on driving or working with farm machinery, etc., especially in a rural setting.</p> <p>  There is significant disjointed thinking when it comes to this sector, particularly in the funding model and primary care services.  I have repeatedly stated it is not really about the primary care building but about the activity that happens within it and the connectedness of primary care, the GP, neurology services and voluntary bodies such as those of the delegates.  The services provided by the delegates' organisations are not valued to the degree they ought to be.  From a neurology point of view, they are nearly treated as add-on services.  My doctor colleagues will give out to me for saying this, but sometimes one must say what one thinks.  The organisations do not carry the weight they deserve to carry and that upsets me.  One may sometimes perceive passiveness in the medical profession about the services they provide and that upsets me.  Doctors and the medical profession need to do more to value the role played by the organisations on a day-to-day basis for people who suffer from epilepsy.</p> <p>  As Dr. McCarthy stated, there is a tapestry of opportunities.  She hit the nail on the head in that respect.  The only way we will achieve things is by speaking about the role played by the organisations with positivity and engaging.  There is significant disjointed thinking when it comes to health.  Everyone seems to work in his or her own little box, including GPs such as me, the epilepsy nurse I contact occasionally in UCHG, the organisations represented today and neurologists.  We need to break down the barriers and concentrate less on the infrastructure of primary care services.  The delegates' organisations need to be funded through a proper funding model and there should be more communication.  We used to have many primary care meetings in the community some years ago, but they are no longer held.  It would be of benefit for the delegates to present more frequently to bring their message home to clinicians in the community.</p></speech>

I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the discussion.  </p> <p>  I was asked by the Inishowen Childrens Autism Related Education, iCARE, organisation in Buncrana, County Donegal, from where I come, to attend the meeting and tell its story as part of this dialogue.</p><p>The issues with the HSE are often to do with what are referred to as silos.  There is no communication between its various parts.  It appears the HSE wants to extend this approach to the community and voluntary sector so it has the same lack of professionalism and joined-up approach.  This is why the recommendations of the independent review group are welcome, particularly recommendations 8.1 to 8.4, inclusive, which deal with the list of essential services.</p><p> It is critical that we define the essential services in partnership with the community and voluntary sector.  Then we get into mapping where they are, the charter, which is a framework, and, of course, the forum.  This has been referred to today.  It is essential the recommendations are implemented.  It is self-evident that these must be done.  As has been said, in February it was welcomed by the Minister but here we are.  Everybody who lives in the State understands that if it were not for the community and voluntary sector, people with disabilities, the elderly and young people in their communities would be left behind.  All sectors would be left behind if it were not for the community and voluntary sector.</p><p> iCARE was established 18 years ago in my home town of Buncrana.  It is a groundbreaking organisation for children on the autism spectrum, which works with schools and the local community.  The service has grown and grown with no money from the State over all of those years.  Last year, it teamed up with Bluestack Special Needs Foundation in south Donegal, which has been in existence for 17 years, again with no funding from the State.  Both organisations, one at the top of Donegal and one in the south of the county, provide essential services, respite and support to children with disabilities in both areas with no State funding.  They came together, along with Extern, to make a professional application for funding under the ability programme.  It should have been a no-brainer but it was turned down.</p><p> They decided enough was enough and put together a map of disability services.  I am sorry to be somewhat parochial about this but it is a reality where I am from in Donegal.  If, on a map, a line is drawn from Dublin to Galway in so many respects, the services above that line are absolutely appalling.  There is an out of sight, out of mind mentality.  These organisations decided to do something about it, stood up and found their voice.  Significant political pressure then followed from the physical manifestation of the map where we could see the absolute discrimination and failure.  Both organisations received approximately &euro;35,000.  We thought this was a breakthrough.  The HSE found the money somehow.  Then we got to the beginning of this year, and again the money was found with another &euro;35,000.  Bluestack Special Needs Foundation needs &euro;150,000 per annum - this has been costed by the HSE - just to keep basic services going.  iCARE needs &euro;100,000 per annum.  What has been happening is that the parents, who are already carers and under ferocious pressure, must hold fundraiser after fundraiser and they are totally exhausted.  They are dead on their feet.  They were about to close the doors of both organisations, which would have been a disaster for the communities.</p><p> iCARE got one third of what it asked for and Bluestack Special Needs Foundation received approximately one quarter.  I am angry about something I recently found out.  Last year, we met the Minister for Health and Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities and we thought the Government had intervened and sorted this out but it had not.  The HSE, under political pressure, found money from somewhere, and God knows somebody else must have lost out, to solve the problem.  It was not resolved by the Department or the HSE at national level.  It was a local solution to a local problem.  No one in the senior echelons of the HSE is listening.  Nobody is listening in the Department of Health.  This is about respect and the democratisation of how we spend our money.</p><p> I always say to community groups, and particularly to disability groups, that if they were to knock on every door in their communities and ask how people would like their taxes to be spent, who would say they do not want them to be spent on disability organisations or on young people with disabilities so they can have dignity and achieve their potential in life.  It does not happen because we have an organisation called the HSE that tries to replicate its silo approach in the community and voluntary sector.</p><p> This is about respect.  I have sat here to have the opportunity to speak and I appreciate the committee giving me this platform to say on the record that the report from Dr. Catherine Day must be implemented.  We have to get beyond the approach that has been there.</p><p> If we talk to citizens and ask them how much value they put on community and voluntary organisations, particularly those organisations working with people with disabilities, they would absolutely demand that those organisations receive the resources they need because they save the State money through supporting carers and families and giving respite to people who are everyday heroes.  I urge the committee to put as much pressure as possible on the Minister for Health to ensure the review is fully implemented and that the HSE treats these organisations with respect and partnership in a democratic fashion using the resources of the State to deliver services to people who need them the most.</p><p> These are my comments.  They are not questions.  I just wanted to tell the story of iCARE and Bluestack Special Needs Foundation, what is going badly wrong in the State and why people do not want this to happen but the State and its apparatus allow it to happen.</p></speech>

I will not repeat or summarise what has been said.  I will add that the members of The Whee, which are HSE funded under sections 38 and 39, understand we live in the context of limited resources and significant unmet need.  We need to transition away from piecemeal <i>ad hoc</i>responses as we go along to a more strategic approach based on identifying the essential needs in communities.  I draw attention to a potent observation made by Dr. McCarthy that this has to do with establishing the actual need in communities because unless we live in a perfect world, there will always be a quantum of unmet need.  We need to have the courage to identify that there is unmet need in order to design services to meet the actual need that is there.  The sector is enthusiastic about the opportunity to work in partnership that is presented by the independent review group's report and Sl&aacute;intecare.  We hope we will be invited to work in partnership with the Department and the HSE on understanding the need that is there and playing our part in delivering a much more effective service and advocacy role for voluntary organisations and the people they support.</p></speech>

I will pick up on something said by Senators Burke and Dolan.  One of the greatest challenges we will face is taking the independent review group's report down off the shelf.  It is already gathering dust.  That is the biggest threat.  The independent review group's report is essential for delivering Sl&aacute;intecare.  We can pull at the heartstrings on the value of these organisations.</p><p>We could have 20 people with disabilities telling us the level of their need for personal assistance, which they are not getting.  There are core essential services they do not get.  That level of need is not being recorded.  We have to ensure that this committee understands how important it is to ensure that the report is taken off the shelf and stitched into Sl&aacute;intecare and that it is not just used to respond to existing deficits.  I am not saying there are no deficits.  We heard that at a recent meeting of the committee on 19 June and we have heard it today.  There are deficits in the delivery of the existing quantum of service.  It needs to reshape our understanding of what is a really valuable service to people with disabilities, considering how to expand the role of community services and make them link seamlessly with primary and acute services so that the person with a disability, that horrendous diagnosis of some condition, can be confident that the resources will be there to support them and their family.  I acknowledge the work of the committee in highlighting this and I encourage it to take the report off the shelf, get the forum established and the charter agreed and find a way to truly sketch out the list of essential services.</p></speech>

My colleagues have highlighted the importance of the forum's being set up and the development of a charter.  There are urgent practical day-to-day needs.  There is a crisis now.  Our organisation will have four years at the current rate before we run out of reserves.  What happens then?  We have been hearing for years that charities should not hold reserves or have money in their back pockets but what has happened in recent years has shown why organisations like ours planned for a rainy day.  That broken process needs to be fixed.</p> <p>  We need to have a full review of how service level agreement, SLA, negotiations are conducted.  We need to consider urgently a mechanism whereby full cost recovery is introduced.  There is already a system there for it.  All these deficits are highlighted in the annual financial monitoring return, AFMR, document which is sent annually to the HSE.  The information is there to be examined on an individual organisation basis.  It can be compiled pretty easily by any statistician or Excel specialist to understand the extent of those deficits.  That needs to be addressed from 2020.  Issues around reporting and the suitability of contracts need to be examined urgently.  The forum that is proposed is probably the best way to ensure that happens.</p> <p>  A couple of other issues did not come up today, for example, while many compliance and governance activities have been introduced in recent years, everybody would like to see the introduction of supports for the sector to maintain those standards.  Board training has been mentioned and I think it is in the independent review group, IRG, report, and there is a really positive recommendation to establish an innovation fund.  Organisations like ours drive innovation in service delivery.  I could give the committee five examples of things that we want to do that we know would improve service outcomes.  That would be an extremely well-subscribed scheme if it was set up because there would be many good projects from the community and voluntary sector.</p></speech>

Everybody is trying to rebuild and go back to where we were between 2005 and 2007.  I wonder if everybody is aware that we were broke then.  That is the problem.  We need to be careful about where we go from here and make sure we do not have another crash.  If we do, unfortunately, it will be more severe than the last one.  That is just a rider in the background to what I say now.</p> <p>  Mr. Cooper or Mr. O'Sullivan referred to the private sector and competition between it and the voluntary sector.  Could they expand on how the private sector may be competing with them in the delivery of services?</p> <p>  To what extent are the organisations reliant on direct funding from the State versus voluntary fundraising?  We need the voluntary sector and at the same time it should get a reward from the State to encourage, augment and help in the delivery of services.  Could they perhaps comment on those two points first?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.586" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ivan Cooper" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019071000002#N00500"><p>This is in our submission.  The competition issue is related to the fact that funding Departments are increasingly putting services out to tender.  There are several cases where services traditionally delivered by community and voluntary organisations at local level over decades were put out to tender and contracts were awarded to private firms to deliver those services.  The funding is lost to the public benefit community.  The assets move from the public into the private sector.  If community and voluntary organisations receive funding to deliver those services, they must sign a very detailed service level agreement and contract that are highly specific about what they can and cannot do with the resources, whereas private sector firms are simply awarded a commercial contract that is much more straightforward.  The playing field is considered to be uneven and community and voluntary organisations are put at a disadvantage in taking part in the process.  The assets, volunteerism and community connectedness that they bring to services are lost if services are awarded to private firms to deliver contracts.  If, for example, a private firm decides that it is not interested in renewing a contract at some point in the future, the capacity of the community to ensure that a service continues to be available locally is removed.  There is a series of strategic questions that we need to consider before making a wholesale rush to put everything up for competitive tendering without adequate consideration of the long-run consequences for communities.</p></speech>

There is a price potentially paid in respect of services offered in communities because voluntary organisations will go the extra mile.  They will respond to need, raise additional resources to provide the necessary service and all of that will be brought to bear, whereas the private firm will operate strictly within the resources it secured through the contract.</p><p>It is certainly not going to be out fundraising to bring additional resources to bear in relation to the service.</p></speech>

Given that the organisation is <i>in situ</i>and is specialising in the delivery of the services, it appears that if all things were equal, the private tenderer should not be able to get into the marketplace at all.  The national amorphous organisation that is dealing with larger organisations is a little like the HSE, which we complain about from time to time-----</p></speech>

I would like to make a point about the scale of the contract that is awarded.  It is important that contracts are kept at a scale that enables voluntary organisations with an existing capacity to bid for them.  If the contract award is designed for too great an area, smaller organisations will be excluded from being able to compete because they do not have the capacity to deliver the service at the specified level.</p></speech>

My other question related to the balance between fundraising in the voluntary sector and the State subventions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.601" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joanne McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019071000002#O00500"><p>I will take this question.  Some of the organisations we are talking about today, including some of our member organisations, receive absolutely no funding from the State.  Some of them receive 5% or 10% funding.  This means there is an enforced marriage or relationship between the funding side of an organisation and the service delivery side of the organisation through the service arrangements.  This is an ongoing challenge for organisations like Epilepsy Ireland.  Mr. Murphy may have more to say about this.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan also referred to the concept of rebuilding.  Perhaps we were not clear enough.  I would like to take this opportunity to restate a point that was made earlier.  I do not think anybody is asking for things to go back to how they were in 2006 or 2007.  Sl&aacute;intecare has redefined what our expectations of a health service should be.  We are asking for people to be guided by the IRG report in understanding the role and value of community-based disability service organisations as core deliverers of health services - not just disability services - that are embedded in primary care and are auxiliary resources in acute services.  Fundamentally, we are not asking to go back to 2006.  We are looking for a way forward that sees the value of community services as a roadmap for delivering personalised and person-centred services into the future.  We are asking for them to be included in the list of essential services.  I am using their language.  They have to be identified in the list of essential services.  They need to be costed appropriately.  The State needs to be honest about what it is willing to fund in order that we all know what the quantum is.</p> <p>  Demographics must also be used in this context.  We know that at any one time, approximately 400 families are affected by motor neurone disease.  I am using them as an example because I was going through some stuff relating to them recently.  The relevant organisations will not provide the names of the families or the geographical regions in question, but they will confirm that they support approximately 400 families at any one time.  They can set out the percentage of those involved who are in care, the percentage of those involved who are at the early diagnosis stage, and everything in between.  This allows them to plan demographically for bringing these people into the system and to ensure sufficient resources are in place to support community services as they seek to respond.  These organisations are really good at being responsive, listening to what people with disabilities and their families want, and developing appropriate services at the appropriate time to support people in their own homes and communities.  I suppose that is where we are looking to go.  I ask Mr. Murphy to pick up on the point that was made earlier with regard to fundraising.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.602" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019071000002#O00600"><p>It is important to bear in mind that the services provided under the HSE agreements are not the only activities in which most organisations are involved.  As stated earlier, over the past ten years we have invested more than &euro;1 million in epilepsy research.  We do a great deal of fundraising for those purposes.  We apply the income we accrue through fundraising to other things like public awareness and public education activities.  As indicated, we have a particular advocacy role that is not necessarily funded by the HSE.  There are many other activities.  There are ongoing operational costs associated with administration and governance.  It is understandable that nobody really wants to pay for such costs, but they have to be paid for.  Fundraising is currently supplementing what appears to be an actual contract for services.  The HSE contracts particular services which cost X, but it pays just 80% or 85% of X.  A commercial operator would have walked away from such an agreement many years ago.  One of the big advantages of this sector is that our organisations will not walk away from their missions and objectives just because 10% or 15% of funding is missing.  We will find ways.  We will get rid of non-essential costs.  We will slash things that are more essential, such as staff training.  We will raise funds.  I will mention a great example that relates to CHO 2 in the west, which is funded to a very low extent.  For a number of years, a large and popular cycling event was very successful in raising funds that helped to supplement the services provided in CHO 2.  The money from that event was used to support something that, in theory, the State is paying for through the HSE.  Regardless of whether a body is 5%-funded or 95%-funded under its contract, its obligations remain the same.  It is important to point out that under our service level agreement, we have the same obligations in respect of &euro;3,800 that a much larger organisation might have in respect of &euro;20 million.  The key point is that our organisations are not going to walk away from meeting the needs of our service users.  I am not sure that could necessarily be said of a private operator in a similar position.</p></speech>

The Deputy mentioned that the private sector has come in to take business from the community and volunteer sector.  I can talk about our experience in that regard.  In our dealings with the HSE, we are not looking for anything extra.  We are looking for a better way for funding to be spent.  I will give an example.  We proposed to the HSE that if it invested &euro;1.2 million in our residential services, we could create &euro;4 million worth of capacity for CHO 7, which spends an average of &euro;16 million each year on essential respite services.  The authorities in CHO 7 have told us that they cannot plan for these emergency placements, but they know they will spend an average of &euro;16 million each year.  When we came up with a plan that involved the HSE investing &euro;1.5 million with us, thereby enabling us to create &euro;4 million of capacity, the HSE was not interested.  Approximately 90% of the &euro;16 million spent by CHO 7 in this area goes to the private sector because the private sector has the resources to invest in buying the properties.  It takes six months from the time a property is bought to get HIQA approval to open it as a residential service.  The community and voluntary sector is not sitting on resources that would enable it to buy houses to be used six months later.</p><p>We believe that with a little bit of planning, money that is already being spent could be spent in a far better way.</p></speech>

We are joined by Senator Lynn Ruane, who has undertaken considerable work in this area.  She has beavered away to ensure that this meeting was scheduled before the recess.  I am very pleased to say that has been done.  We are also joined by representatives of the Irish Penal Reform Trust, namely, Ms F&iacute;ona N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide, executive director, and Ms Michelle Martyn, senior research and policy project manager.  They are both very welcome.  From University College Dublin, we are joined by Dr. T.J. McIntyre.  He is very welcome back.  We are also joined by Mr. Niall Walsh, manager of the Pathways Centre, an aftercare programme for former prisoners.  Mr. Walsh is also very welcome.  I have to go through the formal notification of privilege, after which I intend to invite the witnesses to speak in the order in which I have just introduced them.</p> <p>  I draw the attention of witnesses to the situation in respect of privilege.  They should note that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

I will mainly be covering the Private Members&rsquo; Bill, the Criminal Justice (Rehabilitative Periods) Bill 2019, which I was delighted to see pass Second Stage in the Seanad in February with unanimous, cross-party support.  The Bill would expand access to spent convictions to people other than those allowed for under the limited and unfortunately inadequate provisions of the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act, passed by the Oireachtas more than three and a half years ago.  I also welcome the fact that we will be discussing spent convictions reform more generally.</p><p>My motivation for introducing the Bill was based in the rehabilitative principles that underlie the justice system and my belief that a person who committed an offence in the past should be given a fair and reasonable opportunity to reintegrate into society after a set period has passed without him or her reoffending.  Previous convictions for minor, non-violent offences act as an unfair and disproportionate barrier to resources, opportunities a person needs to enter or re-enter employment, and education or travel after a period of offending behaviour.  While our current law was a welcome first step in legislating in respect of this important area, it is unfortunately not fulfilling its rehabilitative aims.  It is extraordinarily limited in scope and in practice and is simply not accessible to former offenders who need and deserve to benefit from its provisions.  Of particular note is the limitation placed by the single conviction rule.  Under this rule, only one conviction outside of minor driving and public order offences can become spent and the rehabilitative period one has to wait before a conviction is spent is set at a blanket seven years for all crimes, no matter how long or short the sentence handed down.</p><p>My Bill seeks to expand fair access to spent convictions in four ways, namely: by increasing the length of custodial and non-custodial sentences that are eligible to become spent; by removing the single conviction rule from the current Act; by making the waiting period, or rehabilitative period, proportional to the length of a sentence; and by creating a more generous regime for young adults between the ages of 18 and 23 in light of their greater rehabilitative needs.  The reintegration and rehabilitation of former offenders protects society from further acts of crime.  All international evidence demonstrates that a well-designed and fair spent convictions regime works to reduce recidivism and benefits both the individual and society as a whole.  When access to spent convictions is made available to individuals, incidences of crime and reoffending decrease as unnecessary conviction disclosures for minor, non-violent, non-sexual crimes no longer serve as a barrier to progression.</p><p>As a former community worker, I know from first-hand experience that, when working in professions relating to addiction or homelessness or in the areas of teaching or social work, having similar experiences to those with whom one works is invaluable.  Some of the best community workers and drug workers with whom I have worked have had previous convictions.  However, there are many who will never get the chance to work within the communities that need them most due to old, minor offences on their records.  These offences are simply no longer relevant to their lives due to a combination of the passage of time, changes in behaviour and circumstance, and major, substantive rehabilitation. </p><p>Since introducing this Bill, I have been inundated with heart-breaking testimony from people in these kinds of circumstances.  I have heard from students who have reached the second or third year of their degrees in the social sciences and who have then been refused work placement based on old minor offences that are still on their records.  We have had representations from professionals in high-level positions in the Civil Service and public bodies who will not apply for promotion due to a 20 year old mark on their record.  This is not only harmful for the individual but detrimental to society as our laws are literally forcing people out of education, employment and progression.  There is a cost to the individual and to society as a whole under the current regime and it needs to change.</p><p>This is an area that affects those from all walks of life and socioeconomic backgrounds.  It impacts on everyone from young men who are refused entry to the Army point-blank, to young women and lone parents who locked out of education and courses such as courses in social work, through to people from all sectors of society who are prohibited from visiting family members abroad who emigrated during the years of austerity.  In cases like these, we are talking about convictions for possession of &euro;15 worth of cannabis literally keeping families apart.</p><p>While this issue affects everyone, the limits of the current law have a disproportionate impact on marginalised, poorer and working-class communities.  This is made worse by the fact that the Act makes no allowance for more than one conviction to become spent, apart from an unlimited number of minor driving and public order offences.  This makes it easy to criticise the law as one written for the middle classes.  Removing the single conviction rule is an absolute must in this respect. </p><p>I brought this Bill forward because a spent convictions law is of no use if people cannot access it, which is unfortunately the case under the <i>status quo</i>.  My Bill is compassionate, fair and balanced and represents the right thing to do.  I hope that the committee can give the Bill its full support.  I thank members for their time.</p></speech>

The Irish Penal Reform Trust, IPRT, is delighted to meet the joint committee today to speak on the issue of spent convictions.  We will do our best to respond to any questions members might have following our opening statement.  For 25 years, the IPRT has been promoting policies that make communities safer, based on evidence of what works to prevent and reduce offending and reoffending.</p><p>One of our long-standing campaigns is for an effective spent convictions scheme in Ireland to allow people who are law-abiding and have stopped offending to move on with their lives.  It is rooted in the recognition that having a criminal record presents barriers in the context of the protective factors that we know promote desistance from offending, including employment, education and training, accommodation, volunteering, insurance and travel, among others. </p><p> There are two existing schemes for expungement in Ireland.  Section 258 of the Children Act 2001 applies to convictions for offences committed by children aged under 18 years, while the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016 applies to offences committed as adults.  The IPRT&rsquo;s position is that while the relevant provision included in the Children Act 2001 generally meets its rehabilitative aims, the spent convictions Act 2016 is so limited it fails to fulfil its rehabilitative purpose.   Limitations of the 2016 Act have also been identified by the committee in its 2018 report on penal reform and sentencing, the steering committee for the national drugs strategy, in the Mulvey report and, by application, in the analysis of the Irish Human Rights Commission of previous versions of the legislation.  To that end, the IPRT strongly welcomes the Criminal Justice (Rehabilitative Periods) Bill 2018 introduced by Senator Ruane as a positive step towards a better system and, in particular, the introduction of a new approach to dealing with offending by young adults aged 18 to 23 years.  However, our position is that the Bill could go much further to facilitate reintegration and rehabilitation.  </p><p> Our recommendations are as follows.  The limit on the number of convictions that can become spent should be removed, as previously recommended by the Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC.  It is draconian, where a person has two convictions, other than minor motor or public order offences, that neither can ever become spent.  Ireland&rsquo;s extremely conservative approach to allowing just one conviction ti become spent is an outlier in Europe.  Two or more convictions for separate offences does not indicate a pattern or propensity for offending but rather a set of circumstances or factors that contribute to offending.  It could be immaturity and impulsivity, or it could be poverty, mental health issues, homelessness, addictions, experience of violence or domestic abuse.  Expanded spent convictions legislation would present an opportunity to support people who have recovered from such circumstances and moved on from offending to lead law-abiding lives. </p><p> Eligibility of convictions that can become spent should be expanded by increasing the limit to 48 months for custodial sentences, as in England and Wales and, shortly, Scotland.  Concerns about specific categories of offence that would be included could be addressed separately through vetting in regulated areas of work.</p><p> Rehabilitation should be incentivised by setting proportionate and reasonable rehabilitative periods.  They must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the punishment received and should not be so long as to act as a disincentive.  The current position where it takes seven years for a minor fine to become spent is completely disproportionate.  </p><p> We recommend that the Employment Equality Acts be amended to ensure prospective employees would not be discriminated against on the basis of a conviction that had become spent.  Discrimination can and should also be addressed through policy interventions such as the &ldquo;ban the box&rdquo; campaigns in the United States and the United Kingdom whereby questions about convictions would be removed from application forms and delayed until later in the recruitment process.  Of course, this would not deal with other areas in which there is discrimination such as accommodation or insurance.  </p><p> It should be recognised that rehabilitation is at the heart of a victim-centred criminal justice system.  Research has found that crime survivors want the criminal justice system to focus more on rehabilitating people, rather than punishing them, by a margin of two to one.  They want the person who harmed them to be held accountable, but most of all they want him or her to desist from reoffending.</p><p> Broadening access to spent convictions supports rehabilitation and reduces barriers to employment, education, housing and more.  This, in turn, reduces the likelihood of reoffending, crime and the number of victims.  The IPRT, therefore, asks the committee to consider amending the Criminal Justice (Rehabilitative Periods) Bill 2018 in line with our recommendations and to progress the legislation as a matter of priority. </p><p> I thank the committee for its invitation and attention on this issue.  I emphasise that it represents an opportunity for it to support safer communities and a more equal society.  My colleague Ms Michelle Martyn and I are ready to respond to its questions as best we can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.620" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. T.J. McIntyre" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019071000002#E00200"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the committee on the issue of spent convictions.  It would be useful to discuss European law in that area and how it frames national responses.  <br/><br/>Three areas of European law are important.  One is the European Convention on Human Rights, of which Article 8 on private and family life shapes what the State can do and what our rehabilitation laws must look like.  Two other areas which may be of interest to members of the committee and into which I am happy to go further if so they wish are the role of data protection law here - it goes beyond the role of the State - and what regulates what private actors do.  The new GDPR limits what employers can ask for in relation to spent convictions and will limit what search engines can do.  It give individuals a right, in some cases, to have search results using their name removed where they indicate past convictions.  That is an important matter in practical terms.<br/><br/>Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights on private and family life specifies, in effect, that convictions can be part of someone's private life, such that disclosing them can, in some cases, infringe his or her right to privacy.  That sounds very unusual in an Irish context in which, unlike in some civil law or continental jurisdictions where there is greater privacy in the trial process, trials are always presumptively held in public.  They are widely reported in the media and individuals are named in an unredacted form.  The point made by the European Court of Human Rights in a case dating from 2012, M.M. <i>v.</i>the United Kingdom, was that offences and convictions practically became obscure as they receded into the past such that they were no longer immediately visible to people dealing with individuals and that individuals should be given an opportunity to grow and move beyond past convictions.  Where disclosing past convictions can have an adverse effect on people's rehabilitation or employment, we must ask whether it is proportionate.  Is it necessary in a democratic society to use the language of Article 8?  Is it necessary for public protection in being weighed against the impact on the former offender?  <br/><br/>Three cases - M.M. <i>v.</i>the United Kingdom and two judgments of the English Supreme Court in R (T. &amp;amp; Anor) <i>v.</i>Secretary of State for the Home Department and R (P, G and W) and Anor <i>v. </i>Home Secretary - have since developed this principle to set out a number of criteria which can be taken into account in looking at national spent convictions rules.  Under the European convention, there is considerable discretion for member states in deciding how they want to shape their national rehabilitation laws, but what is clear is that, at a minimum, they must have some national rehabilitation law and that the law must provide clear rules on when details of offences can be disclosed.  The national rehabilitation rules do not necessarily have to provide for an individual review mechanism, in the sense that individuals are entitled to have a case by case determination on when information should be disclosed, but the law must nevertheless have, at a minimum, clear categories to minimise the risk of unfairness or arbitrary results and try to avoid disproportionate results in individual cases.  The rules have to be proportionate.  We have to be able to identify a purpose being served by the rules such as are we protecting the public in that regard.  We must be able to show that the disclosure rules serve that purpose in order that they are not arbitrary.  For example, we would not necessarily find compatible with Article 8 a rule that states all old convictions of whatever nature must be disclosed, if somebody is working with children, for instance.  We could imagine somebody with an old conviction for dishonesty who had that conviction disclosed not necessarily being treated fairly, even though it might be appropriate to treat other types of conviction as suitable for disclosure.  <br/><br/>In the two cases in which the UK Supreme Court has addressed this issue, namely, R (T. &amp;amp; Anor) <i>v.</i>Secretary of State for the Home Department and R (P, G and W) and Anor <i>v. </i>Home Secretary, it has pushed out the boundaries of the rule somewhat from what the European Court of Human Rights articulated in M.M <i>v. </i>the United Kingdom.  In particular, it has stressed that it is not only state disclosure which matters but also disclosure in the context of questioning by employers, even in the context of purely private employment.  Even though a job does not fit within the general vetting scheme and an employer might not have access to state records as such, Article 8 is still implicated if the employer is entitled to ask a person about his or her previous convictions and he or she is, in effect, compelled to disclose them, the reason being that if one fails to do so, one is open to punishment.  Very often it will be a criminal offence to fail to disclose convictions in such a situation, or it could be exposure to disciplinary action or dismissal.</p><p>In addition to expanding these rules to the private employment context, the two UK Supreme Court decisions stressed that we must look closely at the way in which we graduate these rules and how we decide disclosure is appropriate.  In both those cases, the UK Supreme Court found, contrary to Article 8, rules which provide for either blanket disclosure in, as was the case in MM <i>v</i>. United Kingdom, or rules which provide for blanket disclosure but based on crude criteria.  For example, in the most recent case R (P, G and W) and Anor <i>v</i>. Secretary of State for the Home Department and Anor, the UK Supreme Court held that a single conviction rule, where, if individuals have more than one conviction, then all their past convictions must be revealed when somebody is applying for employment that requires a criminal records certificate, was essentially arbitrary and disproportionate.  Why?  It was based on the idea that having more than one conviction shows that one has a propensity or a track record of wrongdoing when, in fact, the second or third conviction might stem from the same incident or might relate to a small pattern of behaviour five, ten, 15 or 20 years ago.  It does not tend to show anything at all about the ongoing likelihood or an ongoing propensity to commit crime.<br/><br/>Instead, therefore, the UK Supreme Court has said that national rules of this type, if they are to be compatible with Article 8, should be more fine-grained and should take into account several factors.  For example, they should consider what was the specific nature of the offence; what were the circumstances around the offence, how old was the person when they committed it; what was the sentence imposed in respect of the offence; have there been further offences since; what length of time has elapsed since the offence; how relevant is the particular offence to the decision to be made, be it, for example, child protection or avoidance against offences of dishonesty.<br/><br/>When one measures the 2016 Act against those criteria, it shows several problems.  First, as the previous speakers indicated, the single conviction rule in the 2016 Act is deeply problematic.  To my mind, it is clearly incompatible with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and would be found so if challenged in the Irish courts for much the same reason given by the UK Supreme Court in the R (P, G and W) and Anor <i>v</i>. Secretary of State for the Home Department and Anor case.<br/><br/>Second, Irish law applies a crude cut-off in the limitation to a 12-month or 24-month custodial or non-custodial sentence.  As with UK law, it is permissible to have a graduated response based on the severity of sentence.  A simple cut-off of that sort, particularly where it is combined with the conviction rule, seems to me to be incompatible with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  That is the case in particular when one thinks about the different nature of Irish law compared to the UK rules.  The UK rules at stake in the MM <i>v</i>. United Kingdom and R (P, G and W) and Anor <i>v</i>. Secretary of State for the Home Department and Anor cases applied to particular classes of employment.  They were rules which applied where somebody had to have a criminal background check or a criminal record certificate issued.  These were cases involving people working with, for example, children or in sensitive occupations.  The UK rules generally regarding the rehabilitation of offenders are much wider than that.  Those narrow UK rules were limited to particular sensitive situations.  In Ireland, under the 2016 Act, the rules apply across the board, not just in that category.<br/><br/>Insofar as the 2016 Act adopts a rigid single offence rule subject to these so-called &ldquo;middle-class&rdquo; exceptions for motoring offences, for example, to the extent that the 2016 Act adopts a 12-month to 24-month custodial cut-off and a rigid seven-year rehabilitation period, the combination of those factors means that the scheme, as it stands, would be found contrary to Article 8 of the ECHR.</p></speech>

Founded in 1996, the centre offers respite to former prisoners in the crucial period after release by providing information, education, counselling, support and referral in a safe and understanding environment.  Our work comprises four essential elements, namely, peer support, guidance counselling, educational programmes and activities, as well as personal addiction counselling.  We work with upwards of 400 people every year, assisting them to change their life trajectory and reduce criminal behaviour.</p> <p>  Effective spent conviction legislation would assist in reducing recidivism and promoting reintegration through allowing individuals with previous convictions access education.  Education has been and still is a proven method of reducing criminal behaviour.  It allows individuals become productive members of society, break away from a cycle of poverty and imprisonment, as well as improving their life opportunities.  This legislation has the potential to lead to safer communities and parents engaging in their children's lives and not in prison.  It also has the knock-on effect of them contributing to the tax base and to their communities&rsquo; prosperity.</p> <p>  There are some barriers to reintegration.  Someone with a conviction may not be accepted to a college course or be able to complete a college course due to the placement element of the course.  If the individual cannot complete and has to drop out, the way fees are structured, they may have to pay to do a repeat first year in a different course.  This has the effect of education being financially impossible and that path may be forever closed.</p> <p>  Garda vetting affects all areas of life, college and employment.  Someone could lose their educational course or employment due to their convictions becoming disclosed.  Garda vetting is just that.  It is not but can be seen as Garda clearance.  We had a recent experience of a man with a serious conviction more than 20 years old, working as a bus driver.  When his employer found out about his conviction, through the media, he lost his job, then his accommodation and, eventually, ended up back in prison.  He had being doing well before losing his job.</p> <p>  If one has a conviction, no matter the type, when one discloses it to an insurance company, one will pay a higher premium for insurance.  Some of these premiums can be excessive - more than &euro;3,000 or more.</p> <p>  It can also act as a barrier to employment.  If an individual must disclose historical convictions, regardless of the length of time since they offended, then they may be unable to obtain even minimum wage employment.  Surely they have a right to work and provide for themselves and their families.</p> <p>  Section 55 of the Charities Act 2009 is a perfect example of discrimination.  If someone who has a conviction wishes to serve on the board of directors of a charity, he or she must go to the High Court to get an exemption to serve on that board.  He or she must have legal counsel and, through High Court affidavits, he or she must detail their life story.  The judge then decides if it is in the public interest for the individual to serve on the board of the charity.  If one wants to serve on another board of a charity, one must go back to the High Court each time.</p></speech>

The committee is interested in this issue because it produced a report last year in which it recognised the current legislation in this area is limited and fails to support the rehabilitation of more serious offenders.  That is why we welcome the legislation performed by the Senator.</p> <p>  What does she think of the proposal put forward by Ms F&iacute;ona N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide that her legislation needs to be expanded?  Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide did not criticise the Senator but she believes it needs to be made less restrictive.</p></speech>

I was trying to judge what the mood was like.  I wanted to bring people around to the idea that the single conviction rule is not enough and getting them to think in what other ways we can approach it.</p> <p>  As my legislation moves through the Houses, I am open to working with everybody to make the legislation as accessible and as liberal as possible.  I am not married to every single measure in the Bill.  It was more about getting the principle out there, the conversation going and having a starting point.  I agree with Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide&rsquo;s view on the legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.627" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019071000002#F00700"><p>There is a lot in what Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide has suggested.  That is no criticism of Senator Ruane.  If we are going to introduce legislation, we should ensure that it deals with the reality of the problem.  People can get into difficulties at a certain stage in their lives and have a series of convictions which, in years to come, may be remote and irrelevant to what one is seeking to do later on.</p><p>I would be supportive of trying to expand the legislation if the Senator can and I would support her in that regard.</p><p> From my experience since being elected a TD, I know this is a real problem for people.  A person who had been offered a good job in the State came to me recently.  It had come to the last hurdle, which was the vetting of the person, and the person had a real fear about a conviction they had got some 15 years earlier for an offence they had to disclose.  Unfortunately, it was not a spent conviction but it had to be disclosed and it created agony for that person who clearly was no longer in any way a threat.  We need to do something about this.  </p><p> With respect to the N.M., case, an interesting issue arises in terms of the article 8 rights.  On the matter of the right to freedom of expression, does Dr. McIntyre see a conflict with it in that newspapers could argue that if, say, I had a conviction dating back 15 or 20 years ago - I am not saying that I do, but if I did - that they should be able to write about it?</p></speech>

The N.M. case and the English cases are focusing very much on the question of state disclosure and requests by employers in the course of the hiring process.  They do not address the question of what the media can do.  There are two carve-outs here that are important.  One relates to the data protection sides of things where, as the Deputy will be aware, there is an exclusion for journalistic activity from the GDPR rules that apply to processing of convictions.  The second relates to article 8 where in a number of cases the European Court of Human Rights has said, most recently in a case brought by two murderers against Germany, that it is open to the state to decide to adopt rules that will allow, for example, newspapers to talk about old convictions and to include information about old convictions in their archives, and that is compatible with the article 8 rights of the individual.</p></speech>

He is not a public figure but a newspaper was able to write about a conviction he had going back some 20 years.  Would that be affected by article 8 rights covering this area?</p></speech>

The Deputy has put me slightly on the spot.  I do not have the details of those in front of me.  In one case the court of cassation in Belgium took the view that this was information which should be deleted, so information in a newspaper archive about an old conviction of an individual where there was no great public interest in the case could be required to be anonymised.  The newspaper could be required to redact the name of the individual in the old online report.   Whereas in the Spanish case the supreme court took the opposite view and held that the integrity of the newspaper archives outweighed the privacy and article 8 rights of the individual.</p></speech>

I would have thought the way to deal with the legislation, as the Senator has done, is to try to emphasise in it that relevance and remoteness are the important aspects.  For example, is the conviction relevant to something the person is doing and is it remote in terms of the years that have passed?  It is clearly the case that if somebody gets a conviction they serve their sentence and the sentence denies them of liberty and has other impacts upon them but it should not affect them after they have served their sentence.  They are only the comments and questions I have.</p></speech>

It is good legislation.  Like Deputy O'Callaghan, I find people come into my clinic occasionally to ask about their situation and whether the spent convictions legislation would apply to them.  Even before the facts of their cases are out of their mouths,  I am thinking it probably would not apply to them.  When the facts have been put before me, I have found the legislation may apply in one or two cases but much more often it does not apply and people have not been able to avail of it.</p> <p>  Incidentally, this is also an issue that delays citizenship applications proceeding, which is an area of a  ministerial discretion.  People may have had two or three convictions, some of which may be minor or not so minor, and from my experience the Minister has used his discretion not to grant citizenship even when the applicant has been living in Ireland for ten to 15 years, but that is an aside.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy O'Callaghan's point that potentially we can agree with the approach taken by Senator Ruane.  It is important we have this discussion but potentially if this legislation can be broadened out I would be happy to support it.  </p> <p>  In a wider policy context, one of the representatives of  the Irish Penal Reform Trust might indicate how Ireland rates in terms of rehabilitation and recidivism.  Senator Ruane, Mr. Niall Walsh and Dr. McIntyre can also respond to that  if they wish.  Are our rates improving or disimproving?</p></speech>

As of today, we do not know in that the latest recidivism statistics are due to be published shortly by the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  The probation statistics for recidivism were published recently.  Until we can compare the two we cannot say too much.    I believe we are about average but it depends on the countries with which we want to compare ourselves.  In Norway they were talking about the training and relationships between prison staff.  In terms of prison recidivism post-release, its rate has reduced from 25% to 20%.  By comparison, our  rate is in the region of 45% to 47%.</p></speech>

We will not know that until we have those statistics.  The most recent statistics are the 2010 cohort and their three-year recidivism rate.  We are expecting the 2011 and 2012 cohort to be published at the same time.  More recently it has crept down a little by a percentage and another percentage over the three years that have been published.  More generally,  we need to focus on supporting particular age groups from moving on from their offending histories, particularly those in the 18 to 25 age group.  We know that for people in that age group the adolescent brain is still in development, they have the highest rates of offending and reoffending but also the greatest capacity for change.  It has been said clearly by businesses in the community in England that young people with recent convictions face a triple disadvantage in the employment market.  They have no work experience, they do not have access to the same networks older people would have and, on top of that, they have the impact of a convictions history.  We definitely must support young people to move on.  They use the word "seismic" to describe the difference in a young person getting a job early on in life and moving on and the impact that will have on future decades in their lives.  We need to focus on that age group in particular.  I acknowledge Ireland has what we believe is an effective and generous provision for offending committed by people aged under 18.  We have a system that is very good but it all stops when one commits the offence after the age of 18.  Very few of us when we are aged 30, 40 or 50 would want to be judged by our behaviour when we were 18 or 19.  We must do more.</p></speech>

They state employment reduces the risk of reoffending, between one third and a half.  The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development in the UK stated that when people with criminal records find employment their likelihood of reoffending is cut by two thirds.  It is quite dramatic.  We recognise that getting a job in itself does not solve all the issues.  There is much pro-social interaction, contributing to society and being part of the enfranchised population that goes with that.  Receiving a job is part of a broader reintegration into the community but it makes sense.  Being able to provide for oneself and one's family supports reintegration and resistance from offending.</p></speech>

It is also about the type of employment, in particular if one is a young man from a working class community.  We received many representations from young men who wanted to join the Army but who were excluded because of one minor offence that came back in the Garda vetting process.  They were then pushed towards lower paid, low-skill jobs whereas they would have preferred to progress in very different directions but were prohibited.  It is not only about whether they are in employment but about the nature of the employment they are forced into, which reinforces inequality.  In low-skill jobs, they live closer to consistent poverty than if they had different opportunities and the type of employment they could gain.</p> <p>  The employment aspect is obviously an important one for rehabilitation, but spent convictions also impact on life within the community.  If one wants to go on the summer project with one&rsquo;s child, one is Garda vetted.  If one wants to volunteer with one&rsquo;s son or daughter&rsquo;s GAA team, one is vetted.  All these other spaces in which a family integrates into the community can be denied to a person because he or she has to be Garda vetted.  Vetting involves a blanket approach.  It is not just looking at sexual offences or offences that would require one to consider whether a person could go on a kids' summer project.  If a drug offence or a minor shoplifting offence comes up, one is excluded from being part of community life with one's family and that has a negative impact on recidivism.</p></speech>

Is there any scope to consolidate that particular incident for the purposes of spent convictions?  There might be more than two convictions and, in fact, more than two serious convictions, but those might have been applied in respect of the same act or incident.</p></speech>

It looks at a single incident.  As someone who has worked in the addiction sector, I have supported people who either had an episode of psychosis and ended up realising after one week that they faced ten different charges being dealt with in ten different courts.  It is the management of that.  I do not know whether Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide wants to comment but the current legislation provides for a single incident.</p></speech>

Two separate convictions for shoplifting can be on one's record for life and neither may become spent yet multiple motoring offences, which arguably put the public at greater immediate and direct danger, can be spent without limit.  There is certainly a disproportionate approach taken in particular to property offences and so-called offences of dishonesty.</p></speech>

This was flagged up in English litigation.  As it stands, if one has a conviction for criminal damage and assault arising out of the same drunken incident, those two convictions can be treated together as one conviction.  However, if one has a week-long mental health issue and a number of convictions arise from that or if one has a conviction for shoplifting in Boots and one for shoplifting in Marks and Spencer on the same day, those two convictions are treated as separate and not arising out of the same incident.  As such, they can never become spent.</p></speech>

While Senator Ruane's proposed legislation is a step in the right direction, this is the fourth time I have been privileged, or not, to be here campaigning through the IPRT to get legislation passed.  The Senator's legislation reflects the political realities of trying to get this passed.  Legislation like this leads to safer communities.  While one is trying to strike a balance with public safety, if one acknowledges, which is not to forget, that a conviction is in the past and that the person can move on, it leads to safer communities.  If that part of a person's past is allowed to remain in the past, they can reintegrate into society.</p></speech>

It is about how it exists and who has access to that information on spent convictions, albeit there are wider implications.  The witnesses might have reflections on other regimes as well as ours.  While access to the information is restricted, is it deleted entirely or simply held in a secure manner by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  How does that work regarding the information that exists or once existed on a spent conviction?  Is it entirely deleted or held securely?</p></speech>

The short answer is that we are not talking here about deleting records.  It is unlike some jurisdictions where criminal records are expunged after a period.  What we are talking about here is the obligation of individuals to volunteer the information when employers or insurance companies are asking about convictions and the capacity of the State vetting service to provide information in the context of vetting; we are not talking about modifying information held on central databases at all.</p></speech>

It is about the disclosure so that the records history remains in the State.  It is just what can be disclosed.  Only unspent convictions can be disclosed, apart from the area of soft information and vetting but that is another area of discussion completely.</p></speech>

What one has seen in the past few years are a great many newspaper archives, in particular from local newspapers, going online.  As such, people's old convictions for assault from 20 years ago might now be visible.  A great many court reports have gone online.  If someone has a conviction from 15 years ago for a serious offence that is mentioned in a High Court judgment, that is suddenly searchable in a way that it was not previously.  What has happened, anecdotally at least, to many people is that they have been caught out.  Information that had been in the past has suddenly become a great deal more visible because it is now on the front page of the Google search against their name.  I do not have any statistics on it - this is purely anecdotal - but I have heard more and more complaints from people who feel it is unfair that information that had been buried has resurfaced.</p></speech>

In the Pathways Centre, we try to help them to be a bit strategic about the courses they pick should they want to do a law degree.  The realities or practicalities of doing the FE 1 exams are that those doors may be closed to them.  As such, people need to be strategic in the courses they pick if they want to do social care work with young people.  Depending on the nature of the conviction, people need to be careful or they may get on a course and spend a great deal of time and effort gaining a qualification with the support of their families, the Pathways Centre and other organisations but never be able to work in the area in which they are qualified.  They might be more than capable and have all this life experience to use, but something that happened 20 years ago may prevent them. It can be soul-destroying and disheartening.  When one sees people coming out of prison with a law degree, that is great, but they cannot work as solicitors.  It very much limits what courses they pick and it is very disheartening for them.</p></speech>

We need to put some onus on business and employers to use their discretion if they become aware of some minor offences in someone's past and those employers, not the applicant, being strategic about whether whatever is contained in the vetting will impact on the job and ignore the Garda vetting, which is quite okay to do.</p></speech>

One is simply excluded at that stage.</p></speech>

That campaign has been extremely helpful.  The campaign is to ban the box and the same tag line has been used in the UK and US.  It seeks to remove the question "Do you have any former convictions?" from application forms.  The question can be asked much further down in the process, including at job offer stage.</p> <p>  We need a combination of policy change and the public information piece but also, on the other hand, support through legislation.  There is a need for some form of anti-discrimination legislation that takes a proportionate and reasonable approach alongside that.  Consider a situation where somebody is already performing a job very well when information of a previous conviction comes up and the person loses the job on that basis.  That person has no avenue of recourse at all because there is no protection.</p> <p>  There are international examples.  For almost 30 years, Australia has legislated that people should not be discriminated against in employment because of their criminal record if that record does not prevent them from carrying out "inherent requirements" of the job.  It is described slightly differently in Tasmania where the words "irrelevant criminal records" are used.  Approximately 23% of the cases of complaint that come before the Australian Human Rights Commission relate to discrimination cases on the basis of criminal records but the number that are successful is quite small - approximately six in 2012.  We certainly advocate, and will be asking the committee to consider, two forms of anti-discrimination legislation.  One is that no one should be discriminated against on the basis of convictions that are spent and the other relates to proportionality and the ability to meet and perform the inherent requirements of the particular job.</p> <p>  There is real fear for people who have former convictions.  Even if they were never asked about them and they are not relevant to the job, the fear of that information coming out is enormous.  I think Deputy O'Callaghan earlier referred to people being in agony and that is very real.</p> <p>  The other piece of it is people not going for promotions because a promotion might involve international travel at which point they have to talk about their conviction.  The problem is not just getting the job, it is retaining it and advancing in one's life.</p></speech>

That is why we welcome the provisions for 18 to 24 year olds because somebody can have a conviction at the age of 19 and still be affected by it at 23.  We did research in 2015 and one young person said that, if one cannot get a job, one is going to go on the rob.  That is important.</p> <p>  International and European countries have looked at extending provision from the juvenile system for those over 18 where international human rights law has requested that to be extended to include 18 to 21 year olds to take into account their development and brain maturity.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that this is a vital issue and I was delighted to co-sponsor Senator Ruane's Bill.</p> <p>  This is about changing people's lives for the better and there is no doubt that everybody deserves a second, and possibly even a third, chance.  I have worked in the field of addiction and with women in the prison service, the majority of whom, I am told by the governor of a prison, are in prison because of personal addiction or because they come from a family affected by addiction.  Those women just want to have normal lives like the rest of it.  The reality is that many of them are mothers.  They want to go back out, live and be treated with respect and dignity, like the rest of us.  That is what this Bill is about, especially when such women step into their own recovery.  The Bill is about treating people with respect and dignity.  That is the core piece of it.</p> <p>  Rehabilitation is obviously one of the core principles of it - becoming rehabilitated and moving on.  I have met wonderful people in recovery.  I am in recovery myself and have no shame in saying it.  Recovery can bring one to an amazing place.  I have worked with women and men who are in strong recovery and have reached unbelievable places.  It is truly inspiring.</p> <p>  This is also about passing on down to the next generation.  I have worked with families that experience a ripple effect when one person steps into recovery and the whole family gets recovery.  Whether the problem is addiction or mental health, if one person steps into recovery, the whole family benefits.  The children are impacted big time.  A child sees their mother or father go through a recovery process and rehabilitation and watches them go back into college or do something that will give them back their dignity and respect through training courses.  That is how children become inspired.  It breaks the cycle.  This is not just about the individual, it is about society as a whole and that is one of the core principles around this piece of legislation.</p> <p>  I commend Senator Ruane for introducing this vital legislation.  I wanted to connect with the Senator and I have some questions and, if anyone else wants to come in, that is obviously no problem.  What are the main arguments or barriers that Senator Ruane finds coming up in considering expanding access to spent convictions?  What concerns must the committee address?</p> <p>  Could Senator Ruane give us a little more detail on the offences that are excluded from the general spent conviction scheme and the Garda vetting scheme?  She might expand a little on that.  References have been made to murder and things like that and that is not what this is all about.  I ask those questions of Senator Ruane or anyone else who wants to come in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.664" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1404" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019071000002#J00800"><p>Fortunately, while some barriers and concerns get raised the feedback has on the whole been hugely positive, publicly and politically.  People have seemed open and welcoming to the idea of expanding spent convictions.  That is probably down to the number of representations that people get in their offices and they see that it affects almost everybody, or almost every family, in some way.</p> <p>  Some small concerns get raised throughout the debate.  We had a list of questions when we tabled the amendments to the legislation, one of which referenced the issue of whether more than one conviction represents a pattern of offending.  I do not come at this with that frame of thinking.  I think that if offending is a pattern, not offending is also a pattern.  If a period of time has passed since one's last offence, that is a pattern of non-offending.  It is about how we engage with the conversation and frame the questions we ask.</p><p>I would much prefer to look at what has happened since the person left prison, what they have engaged in and how long it is since they last offended.  Those are the patterns that are more important and that will benefit society more.</p><p> Another barrier which came up, and which also relates to the next question, is the issue of expanding the timeframe.  For example, does expanding from a custodial sentence of 12 months to a custodial sentence of 24 months sentence mean we include more serious crimes?  The question posed to me in the Chamber was what crimes are then included.  I would look at this question the other way around because that is not how spent convictions legislation is framed and it is more a question of what crimes are excluded.  If we were to look at included crimes, we would be making endless lists of every part of law, so it is best to look at what is excluded.  It is serious violent crimes that are excluded.  There is also the question of what court the case is heard in, and this would relate to the District Court and the Circuit Court.  In addition, it is a combined sentence, so it might not be a 48 month sentence and the person might have two convictions that resulted in sentences of more than 12 months on two separate occasions.  Therefore, the 48 months can be broken up in a number of different ways.</p><p> The victims of crime piece gets brought up as well because, obviously, people are concerned that victims of crime have their own trauma that they have to carry from the date of the offence, and it is very important that we support victims of crime to be able to deal with that.  It is about when the person receives the sentence in the court and where the relationship ends between the victim and the perpetrator.  It is about how we have those discussions in a way that is not hurtful or damaging to people who feel they have been wronged by an individual or by a certain circumstance.  For the person who has committed the crime, their contract is with the State when they leave prison, and their contract to not offend is not with the victim.  Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide touched on this in her contribution.  It is framed in a way that there is an assumption that victims of crime want punishment forever more for the individual, when many victims of crime actually want to see no more victims of crime from that perpetrator.  In many cases, we believe that victims of crime would much prefer to see rehabilitation of a person so crime is reduced overall and nobody has to experience what they experienced.</p><p> Those are some of the issues that have come up.  I answered the second question with the first.  We look at crimes that are excluded rather than included because it would be such an exhaustive list.  It is about making sure the crimes we all agree need to be disclosed in particular circumstances and employments would remain the same. </p></speech>

There is a contradiction at the heart of the criminal justice system if we are telling people they must reform but, at the same time, that they can never forget.  We need to recognise when people have moved on and demonstrated they have desisted from offending behaviour.  Another area of research is called "time to redemption" studies.  This is where an examination of when a previous criminal record still holds a predictive value on future offending.  This actually reduces over time and, on average, it is seven to ten years, beyond which the information is no longer relevant.  Therefore, in terms of predicting future offending, after that period it is the same as for somebody who has never been convicted of an offence.  While this would not be palatable, an argument can be made that all offences should be able to become spent at some time in the future following a longer rehabilitative period and, in fact, that is the case in many countries across Europe.  We are starting from a very conservative space on these two islands.  I echo what Senator Ruane said.  We need to focus on the relevance of this information into the future across all categories.</p></speech>

For example, addiction is one particular issue that should be taken into account, and that is why it is very important to examine the restrictions.  As Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide said, there is a lot of research in France, Spain and Sweden, and we should be looking at systems there, rather than just looking at England and Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

It was an attempt to look at everything from fines upwards.  At present, a person could have a fine or community service period on their record for seven years, although it is minor stuff.  It did not feel proportionate to have a blanket seven years.  What we attempted to do in the tables was to set a proportionality so whatever sentence a person was given, whether custodial or non-custodial, their waiting period was proportionate to the length of the sentence.  For example, if someone only received a sentence of three months, their waiting period would be shorter, and if it was 12 months, the waiting period would be a little longer.  It was to set a scale of proportionality.</p> <p>  Again, this is an area of the Bill I am open to looking at and discussing as time goes on.  We need to ask are those numbers arbitrary, why they are set as they are, can we improve them and does this need to have a proportionality scale or do we just set a lower blanket of a two or three year waiting period.  It was just an attempt by me to look at the seriousness of the crime and the sentence, and the proportion of waiting time.  Right now, it is disproportionate that somebody with such a minor offence would have to wait seven years.  It was trying to take that into account and to work on that as a principle in terms of whether proportionality should be part of spent convictions.</p></speech>

I apologise that I could not be here for the presentations but I have read the information.  This is my first meeting as a member of the committee so I am only getting used to the work.  I would say to Mr. Walsh that my daughter worked in Pathways on a job placement for a summer a few years ago, and she found it very worthwhile.  It is an excellent organisation and I congratulate Mr. Walsh on the work he does.</p> <p>  The question I want to ask has largely been answered in the last contribution.  Much of the issue around spent convictions is how society deals with them, rather than how the individuals deal with them.  It has always been put on the individual to make the changes when the bigger onus is on society.  It is useful that this debate has been taking place in the last couple of years.  I was positively disposed towards the last spent convictions Bill when it first appeared because a couple of people in Donegal had contacted me about convictions from 30 years ago which they still had to disclose.  I thought that Bill would go some way towards meeting the issue but the single-offence concept scuppered that straightaway.  It raised people's expectations and then dashed them again when they actually saw it was not helping them.</p> <p>  It is probably part of an evolution for us, as a society, rather than for the people with the convictions, who are probably more in tune with what is needed.  Although this is probably a rhetorical question, how much of this is about the rest of society getting used to the idea rather than spent convictions?</p></speech>

It is interesting that we have an imagined public that has pitchforks at dawn.  We have to look at the scale of the issue.  There is an absolute silence and invisibility around this issue because, by virtue of the fact people do not want to disclose their convictions, they are not talking about it and they are not appearing as case studies and information.</p><p>It would be useful if the Courts Service were to carry out some research to identify exactly how many people have convictions.  There is a new chief information officer in the Department of Justice and Equality and a new data research strategy, which are welcome in identifying the scale of the issue.  In the United Kingdom 11 million people, or 16.5% of the total population, have at least one conviction.  Proportionally, that would equate to more than 750,000 people in Ireland, although one must be careful in matching because it is not a direct correlation.  Nevertheless, it is in the hundreds of thousands.  A Scottish Government analysis has shown that 38% of men and 9% of women born in 1973 have at least one criminal conviction.  It extrapolated to the population as a whole, which suggests at least one third of the adult male population and almost one in ten of the adult female population are likely to have a criminal record.  Given the scale, the imagined public is affected by having a history of convictions.  Just as every family contains somebody who has been a victim of offending, we also know somebody who has committed an offence.  Data would be welcome, but the welcome would perhaps be silent.</p></speech>

One receives a prize at the end of a rehabilitation period, rather than it being a tool that promotes rehabilitation.  It is no good having it as a symbolic gesture at the end of seven years to say to somebody, "Well done.  You have desisted for that period," when a shorter period could be much more effective in promoting rehabilitation in the future.</p></speech>

For spent convictions and convictions in general, it is not about what the public will or will not say about the matter.  I did not have any negative pushback when I introduced the legislation.  People understand it.  It highlights the disproportionate way in which such laws and regimes affect people in minority groups and lower social classes.  It is not that the likelihood of offending is higher because someone is from a lower social class but rather the likelihood of being caught is disproportionate.  The presence of garda&iacute; in communities, the unconscious bias in the justice system and so on contribute to a disproportionate implementation of the law, of which people are aware.  Irrespective of what part of society someone is from, he or she may have an conviction or will understand it can negatively affect others more.</p></speech>

It is scary, or at least should be acknowledged, that 95% of the prison population will be released back into society.  They are our neighbours, sons, daughters and cousins and will be back living in the community, although I do not mean for victims to be left out of the matter in any way.  A judge decides the sentence, but the reality is that it starts only on release, given the barriers to reintegration and so on.  The legislation in question will lead to safer communities.  I apologise for repeating myself, but I wish to get the point across.</p></speech>

A reason I am so interested in the matter is, as I have written publicly, I was a young offender and it is only because of societal interventions that I am where I am.  It is because people ignored the Garda vetting process to give me employment at a young age in the area of addiction.  At home I have a shoebox full of letters from young men, from the age of 12 years when they were in the Oberstown centre, young adults in St. Patrick's Institution and later in Mountjoy Prison.  They have been my friends since we were kids.  There is a pattern in their letters that when they are released, they will return to school, get a job, join Youthreach and stop using drugs.  Something happens between institution and agency, when an individual returns to his or her community without the societal supports about which Mr. Walsh and Senator Black spoke in respect of addiction, homelessness, poverty and so on.  There is an onus on us to examine that age group, 18 to 24 year olds especially, to carve out a space for them in the legislation.  A large number of additional supports are needed.  If I had not been caught and provided with the supports I was at 17 or 18 years of age, I do not know in what position I would be.  I do not doubt that I could have ended up in the prison system.  The section that relates to 18 to 24 year olds is very important in the legislation and any policy we look for on the rehabilitation of young offenders especially.</p></speech>

I apologise that I had to leave, not least because I like to remain for the duration of committee meetings.  </p> <p>  I commend Senator Ruane for her Bill.  What she stated to Deputy Pringle struck me, namely, that while the issue affects everyone, the limits of the current law have a disproportionate impact on marginalised, poorer and working class communities.</p> <p>  Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide spoke about the scale of the convictions and how no research has been carried out in Ireland.  The Courts Service is considering compiling figures for the numbers of people who have been convicted.  Will she elaborate a little on that aspect?  There was a slight divergence between the IPRT and Senator Ruane on the recommended age.  The IPRT suggested the age should be higher.  </p> <p>  Mr. Walsh is very welcome and I have great respect for his organisation.  He stated it "would" reduce or help to prevent recidivism if spent convictions were acted on.  Are there figures or research in that regard, or what are the best areas to examine?  </p> <p>  Ultimately, I disagree slightly with Senator Ruane about people not being on board.  In the context of the Parole Bill 2016, there has been an attitude that prison is for punishment.  While victims must be paramount and we have all had related experiences with our families at some stage, part of the problem is that victims do not receive proper support all along.  It is difficult, therefore, to zone in on offenders.</p></speech>

Foster proved the link between who engaged in education or obtained an education qualification and rehabilitation.  To tie it into recidivism rates, they are approximately 30% or 35%, but one size does not fit all because the matter is so complex and it depends on the individual.  If there was a panacea, Pathways would have patented and run with it.  It is a tailored case for each individual who is released.  I accept that it can be career suicide for a politician to appear soft on crime and that it must be sold to the public, although that is not the way to consider the matter.  I apologise for repeating myself, but it leads to safer communities if the individual enters education.  It has a ripple effect for the children of the people in question.  While I do not mean to leave out victims, if someone engages in education and reduces criminal activity, his or her children will benefit and the multi-generational problem will be broken.  That, in turn, will lead to safer communities.</p><p>I am unsure whether that answers the question or assists in selling it to the public.</p></speech>

It is based on our research for the report in 2015 around young adults in the criminal justice system.  The reasons arise from the scientific evidence that shows the brain and maturity continue to develop beyond adolescence and into a person's 20s.  Socioeconomic factors have also been highlighted as placing young adults at higher risk of offending.  Research in the United Kingdom has highlighted how young men between the ages of 15 and 23 years were more likely to sustain a brain injury than any other group.  The national children and young people's framework of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs goes up to the age of 24 years.  In line with that we are calling for the age to be up to 24 years.  There are special provisions for young adults in 20 of 35 other European countries.  Some go up to the age of 25 years, including Sweden and Netherlands.  It is more a question of maturity rather than age that should be considered.</p></speech>

One important thing is to stop talking about victims and offenders as if they are two separate tribes.  As Senator Ruane alluded to, often they are the same people.  Males in the 18 to 24 years of age group are the most likely to offend but they are also by far the most likely to be victims of crime.  Ironically, they are also the least likely to worry about it, but they are twice as likely to be victims of an offence than someone who is aged over 65 years.</p> <p>  There is no research that we are aware of in respect of courts statistics.  The Courts Service published its 2018 report some days ago.  It is difficult to drill down into the information.  We know from the annual recorded crime statistics that there are in the region of 200,000 recorded crimes every year.  In 2017 in the District Court some 290,000 orders were made.  Not all of those involved a criminal conviction.  These related to 237,000 people before the courts.  A total of 143,000 of those before the courts were there for road traffic offences.  We believe that this is why the decision was taken to make minor motoring offences and public order offences unlimited.  We believe the approach was taken that this would apply to the greatest number of people.  Again, that is not linked to the main concern, which is protecting public safety.  We would welcome some detailed research such as that published by the Ministry of Justice in the United Kingdom and the Scottish Government analysis.  We would welcome for that to be conducted in Ireland.</p></speech>

I will follow up on Mr. Walsh's point.  Research has been done in Scotland and it was found that when the spent convictions regime was improved there was a notable reduction in recidivism.  That might be something we can look to in terms of research.  The public would obviously like to see that any change results in a reduction of crime and victims.  Maybe I will find that research and send it on.</p></speech>

Those responsible looked at a particular age group and a particular year.  It was similar to the Scottish research.  They found that one in three men born in 1971 had a criminal conviction and one in nine women.  This is consistent with the Scottish analysis, which was similar.  I read out the statistics earlier.  The corresponding figures were 38% of men born in 1973 and 9% of women.</p></speech>

What is the pathway for this in terms of the interaction of the trust with the Minister?  Where is it at around the Bermuda Triangle of legislation that we have at the moment?</p> <p>  I was just thinking about a separate point when I heard the interaction.  The parallel issue to all this is the Internet and the fact that someone may have a conviction and is labelled with that conviction forever.  Has that in some way superseded legislative intervention?  What solutions are there in that area?  We all know employers.  There is not only a formalised engagement around what conviction a person might have but there is also the obvious search that occurs and the trawl that happens.  How is that squared?  That will inevitably remove many people who we are talking about from potential employers.</p></speech>

We have had numerous positive interactions.  Obviously, we have had support across the Houses on Second Stage.  That can materialise but then disappear.  I believe there is a will around this.</p> <p>  I spoke earlier about the number of representations each political office gets on convictions.  The Department of Justice and Equality is highly aware of the issue.  The Department knows it started from a restrictive starting point in 2016.  We were one of the last countries to introduce a spent convictions regime.  We went back into all the commentary from the time the initial legislation was being brought in on spent convictions.  It did not seem like anyone was sold on the restrictive regime but they had to get it in at the time.  There has been an openness and a willingness to look at this right from the first tranche of legislation in terms of the single conviction rule and so on.  For me, it is a question of keeping the pressure on.  The committee has had hearings on spent convictions in general.  There is a good chance.  I hope to engage further with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and his office over the summer to bring my Bill back on Committee Stage in the Seanad in the autumn.</p></speech>

McIntyre" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019071000002#M01800"><p>The Deputy asked about the Internet and he is absolutely right that this is a problem.  Of course it is not only a problem for convictions but for charges as well.  Someone may have been acquitted but nevertheless the name turns up in a search.  That is a problem.  There are two questions.  One is a narrow individual question.  If an individual has an old conviction or an old mention of the fact that he or she was charged with an offence, can the person have it removed from the search results?  In some cases it is possible.  We have the so-called Google Spain principles and the so-called right to be forgotten, which was established by the European Court of Justice some time ago.  If a conviction is spent then Google will normally de-list it.  This means it will not show up in a search for the person's name although it will show up in the context of other searches.  That makes it practically important to consider the reach of spent convictions.  If a conviction is not spent, then Google is far less likely to de-list it.</p> <p>  That is a partial remedy.  It is a remedy for people who are well-informed enough to know about the existence of this right and how to go about exercising it.  However, it is not a great remedy for the average individual who is not aware of the finer points of European data protection law.  Moreover, it does not really do anything to address the wider issue, which is that of employers searching against the names of job applicants and looking at the information thrown up.  The information might be completely inaccurate.  It might be information that relates to someone else of the same name.  There are several people with the name T.J. McIntyre online.  I am not a science fiction writer.  I do not manufacture health foods in Boulder, Colorado.  However, if someone searches my name these are some of the first results to be seen.</p> <p>  There is a wider data protection issue that we might consider.  Should the Data Protection Commission be issuing guidance on this point?  Should it restrict how employers search against job applicants on the Internet?</p><p>The Data Protection Commission used to have guidance on this point online but it seems to have been taken down in the meantime.  It would be very helpful to see the Data Protection Commission issue guidance confirming that employers ordinarily should not be searching against people online, except having told them they are going to do that, with the opportunity to make representations on any information they find.  In other words, if an employer finds information on T.J. McIntyre, it should show it to me and ask, "This guy who got the conviction, is he the science fiction writer, the health food manufacturer or the law lecturer in UCD?"  On top of that, we should be making sure that employers are not looking for irrelevant information and information on old convictions, whether or not they are spent.  It is very often going to be irrelevant information because it is not relevant to the particular employment.</p><p> To some extent, that is a problem that is outside the scope of the current discussion because it is not really within the reach of the spent convictions legislation.  It is, however, within the reach of data protection law.  As I said, the appropriate step would probably be for the Data Protection Commissioner to consider reissuing guidance in this area. </p></speech>

Senator Ruane talked about her objective and why she set it out in the first place.  Today's meeting has certainly helped to get to a point where, it is fair to say, she has achieved her objective and she has created that wider address which is part of this and, ultimately, the passage of the appropriate legislation.  We will continue to make a contribution to that journey and we will be preparing a report which will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Obviously, it will be into the autumn resumption period as we are currently working on another report in regard to direct provision.  We would hope that, very early in the period following our first meeting on 18 September, we would be in a position to adopt the report in regard to today's hearing and the focus of the Senator's Bill.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I thank Senator Lynn Ruane, Ms N&iacute; Chinn&eacute;ide and Ms Michelle Martyn, and I thank Dr. McIntyre for returning again - he probably knew his seat exactly from before.  Mr. Walsh from Pathways is also very welcome.  I wish all concerned the very best.  My thanks to the committee also.  Well done to Senator Black - I was not left on my own at the conclusion.  In any case, I thank all members of the committee, in particular as this was the very first meeting for Deputies Pringle and Connolly, having replaced Deputies Wallace and Daly.  It was a good morning's work.  On behalf of the committee, I again thank each of the witnesses for joining us today.</p></speech>

The amendment proposed to our laws under this Bill comprises an interim reform measure.  While it is limited, it will have the effect of modernising and clarifying the provisions of what is, as matters stand, greatly outdated legislation.  I imagine everyone agrees with that.  Work on comprehensive legislation and regulatory reform, to include the establishment of a new licensing and regulatory authority for gambling, has commenced in my Department.  However, it is a mammoth task and it will take some time to bring the proposals to fruition.  I do not expect a revised general scheme of the gambling control Bill to be presented this year because it is such an onerous undertaking.</p> <p>  No Government amendments are proposed to the Bill before the committee.  I am looking forward to its examination of my proposals.  I look forward to responding to the amendments proposed by Deputies.  I hope that, with the co-operation of those on all sides, we can facilitate the swift passage of the Bill.  As always, I welcome the opportunity to engage with colleagues and learn from what people have to say.</p></speech>

I was contacted by the organisation representing private members' clubs.  The clubs believe that it is not the intention of the Minister of State for this legislation to apply to them.  However, they are concerned that, as they stand, the definitions will mean that gaming without a valid permit or licence will be a criminal offence.  They fear that their premises will be considered places where criminal offences are committed.  However, it is not possible for them to apply for either the gaming licence or permit.  Their concern is that this will eliminate them.  There is a view that they need a form of bespoke regulation and licensing to manage that particular sector.  My understanding is that the Minister of State does not intend the legislation to apply to them but they are concerned and believe that there is need for legal clarity on whether it will apply to them.</p></speech>

My response is similar to responses I have given to representatives of a private members' club on the text submitted.</p> <p>  I wish to provide some background.  Early in the debate on the Bill, I made the point repeatedly that the existence of such clubs arises on foot of constitutional protection.  Members' clubs are not governed by the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 or by this Bill.  Thus, according to the advice of the Office of Attorney General, there is no need to accept amendment No. 2.  I am told it would risk confusion and perhaps invite legal challenge.  To the best of my knowledge, many of these establishments are not member-driven clubs in the same way as normal sports clubs.  The membership is frequently not a stable feature and may vary considerably from night to night.  I will outline some of the questions that could be asked.  Who on the committee would be legally responsible for ensuring payment of any taxes to the Revenue Commissioners?  Who would ensure adherence to any money laundering laws?  Who would ensure that visitors to the premises do not engage in excessive gambling?  Who on the committee would direct a sharing of any surplus made by the club between all members?  Who might share the losses?</p> <p>  Many of these establishments hold themselves out to be casinos.  I am not in favour of any measure that would facilitate casino operations by the back door.  If we went down that road at this time, these establishments would not be subject to any licensing or regulatory constraints.  I also fear that gaming arcades operating in areas where no local authority resolution is in place under the 1956 Act might be tempted to avail of the proposed exemption with the attendant negative impacts I have already outlined.  I fully intend to address the issue of licensing and regulation of casinos in the context of the major reform work under way.  I contend that is the appropriate place to deal with the matter.  At that time, clubs would have the option to apply for a casino licence under regulation and so on.</p> <p>  I wish to make two other points.  Amendment No. 1 proposes governing by committee.  That is all; it goes no further.  We are of the view that neither amendment is needed.  Both amendments could open up all manner of unintended consequences.  As matters stand, there is constitutional protection for private members' clubs.  That is what they call themselves and that is what they are.  The advice is not to accept or support the amendments at this time.</p></speech>

There are well-run clubs and there are fly-by-night clubs.  There are people who come along and join on the night and so on.  There are major issues with some of the casinos.  Some are better run and manage their members well and would be bona fides private members' clubs.</p> <p>  There seems to be something of a contradiction to my mind in what the Minister of State said.  He referred to unintended consequences but such consequences could arise if matters are left as they currently stand.  It seems that it could be a criminal offence to organise gaming even with a valid permit or licence.  Would it not make sense to include in this Bill a form of licensing for the sector prior to whatever is eventually proposed in the gambling control Bill?  Those who contacted me are concerned about the uncertainty.  All the unintended consequences to which the Minister of State referred could arise as things stand.  There is a justifiable call for clarity and reassurance.  The best way to provide this would be if the Minister of State brought forward a regulatory framework for the sector within this legislation for Report Stage.  That is what should happen.</p></speech>

I think any of us who have been in touch with or contacted recently by individuals affected by the proposed legislation will be aware that this is a very unregulated yet highly competitive industry.</p> <p>  Regarding the legislation generally, I think we all agree that it would be preferable if we had very detailed legislation regulating the whole area of gambling and imposing a gambling regulator that could regulate issues such as private clubs, casinos and so on in a consistent way.  I understand, however, that we do not have that in this legislation.  I commend the Minister of State on bringing forward some amending legislation.  I can see what he is trying to do.</p> <p>  Regarding Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's amendments Nos. 1 and 2, I had considered tabling similar amendments in this format because I was also contacted by, I think, the Gaming &amp;amp; Leisure Association of Ireland GLAI.  There are many different organisations in this sector.  I did not table the amendments for reasons I do not need to go into.  The GLAI's concern is that if this legislation is enacted, it will find itself outside its parameters.  I do not know whether that is necessarily so.  I know that the GLAI has legal advice stating as much.  What it reveals is that we need to regulate all areas of the gambling business, but at present it appears to be the case that only some will be regulated.  I note what the Minister of State says about private members' clubs.  He seems to think it is not necessary for them to be dealt with in this legislation since they are not covered by it.  There is a lot of strength in that argument, considering that they accept they are not regulated by the 1956 Act, which therefore raises the question, why would amending legislation affect them?  I will give consideration to these issues as well.  I may table amendments on Report Stage but, as Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, it might be beneficial if the Minister of State gave further consideration to this before Report Stage.</p></speech>

This is the first legislation in this area in a long time, and that is welcome as a start.  There are many huge issues surrounding addiction, regulation and properly dealing with the huge amount of activity that is totally outside the scope of existing legislation, as well as the total lack of enforcement of that legislation.  I would like an update on where we are with the principal legislation.  Has drafting commenced?  That is where the solution lies.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has tried to take this on.  I understand that it is complex, but it needs to be accelerated.</p></speech>

I take what the Minister of State says, that in his opinion this will be dealt with by later legislation and that that is what he intends to do, but the problem is when that legislation will come before us.  Will it ever come?  What is the Minister of State's timescale for it?  It is vitally important.  Regarding the private members' clubs, gambling is a huge problem in Ireland, bigger than drink or anything else, and we need to tackle it.  I commend the Minister of State on taking these steps now to do so, but how long is his timescale for this happening in the future?  Would what we are talking about affect, say, GAA clubs when they hold poker classics?  Is that the same kind of thing we are talking about, or would this legislation affect organised businesses more?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.727" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2019071000002#C00500"><p>I, too, welcome the Minister of State's statement on the need for further legislative solutions to the regulation of gambling, particularly in respect of the licensing and registration of casinos.  I think all of us in this House would like to see a compendium of legislation that deals with all the issues, particularly online.  Mobile technology is now moving at such a pace that regulations in certain areas are soon outmoded by dint of advances in technology.  We should therefore take an overarching view.</p> <p>  I seek clarification on this amendment.  I note the Minister of State's comments on the 1956 Act.  I would like his confirmation on the following question.  Since the Bill does not speak specifically to private members' clubs, could it be said - and I will be guided by the Chairman on this - that one would in effect, by dint of supporting this amendment, be making new law if one were to seek to amend the Gaming and Lotteries Act?  Nonetheless, I welcome the Minister of State's statement in the round.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.728" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2019071000002#C00600"><p>I thank colleagues for their questions.  I will do my best to respond to them.  If I miss something, they might remind me of it.</p> <p>  Deputy Pringle asked about GAA clubs and so on.  These amendments have nothing to do with any of them, so there is no cause for concern there.</p> <p>  A number of colleagues asked about timelines and so on.  I said in my opening remarks that we would not see the heads of the Bill this year.  I hope to have them early next year.  Not only have we to draft the very complex legislation, to which Deputy Sherlock has alluded - it is extremely complex and is changing almost by the month as more things happen - but on top of that we must set up an authority comprising perhaps 100 people.  It will be very expensive and very complex to make sure we have all the right skill sets in place.  Work on both these aspects is ongoing.  There is no point in passing legislation without having the regulatory authority in place to enforce it, regulate it, research it and so forth.  I hope to have the heads of Bill prepared and ready to roll early next year.  At the same time, we are working on the structure of the authority and what it will look like.  As soon as we have that information ready, I would be interested in coming before the committee and getting colleagues' views as to what we propose to do.  If people have suggestions at that time, I would be interested in listening to them.  That gives the committee an idea of progress on the main Bill and where we are with the authority.  They are two mammoth tasks and they must happen together.  It is not a case of one or the other.</p> <p>  Regarding private members' clubs, my understanding is that if all of us here decided to form such a club, under the Constitution we could go away and engage in gambling, provided we are members of a private members' club.  This comes under what is understood as free association.  That is what these clubs in effect facilitate.  They are private clubs made up of members on a list who come in and do their business.  They are also businesses, by the way, and they need regulating.  When the main legislation comes forward there will be an opportunity for such businesses to apply for casino licences, as will be provided for in the legislation.  Such licences will be regulated.  This whole area will be taken up at that stage.  If, however, we take these amendments on board now, we will be moving into regulation and recognising these almost as bona fide casinos.  I am slow to do that at this point.  I do not think any of us wants to do it now when we do not have the regulation in place.  We would also in a way be inviting other groups to come forward to apply to become casinos.</p> <p>  That is the effect this legislation could have.  The committee itself is not defined as to how it is made up, what it is to do, how it will be structured and so on, and there are other issues in the legislation.  I am always open to considering colleagues' suggestions or questions on Report Stage, and I have listened carefully to what Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has said.  If, however, between now and Report Stage, which will be in the autumn, other issues arise, I will certainly be open to doing things then.  I contend, however, that the amendment, as presented, does not fit into the current Bill, which is very much an interim measure.  The amendment would also have other unintended consequences that I am concerned about.</p><p>When we do this, I want to do it properly under the full gamut of robust legislation that covers everything, as I think Deputy Sherlock also said.  We also need a regulatory authority in place to enforce the current law, research it and investigate what is going on out there.  I have heard of casinos in other jurisdictions that are quite profitable but they are in large countries.  In the UK, I think they are not and the big casinos have not opened there.  As my colleagues said, an awful lot of stuff is moving online, which is where we are focusing much of our attention.</p><p> When we talk abut gambling, the issue of problem gambling and addiction, rightly, always comes up.  It has been argued that any of us here has a right to go out and gamble if we want to.  It is a free country.  However, if somebody has an illness or an addiction, that becomes a health matter.  People with such an addiction need treatment, therapy and counselling.  Regulation can only go so far in protecting and safeguarding people but, if someone has an addiction, we must be careful and recognise that person has an illness, a sickness and needs counselling, therapy and professional help.  </p><p> We can do a certain amount through regulation to safeguard people we have discussed many options previously.  I have been at this for quite a number of years now since the hearing of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, of which I was chair, in 2013 when the heads of the Gambling Control Bill were produced.  Some of the stuff works and some does not.  We will have to be careful when we talk about addiction.  We can do a certain amount to make gambling less attractive and glamorous but we must also be careful to make it fair so that a properly tabulated and regulated machine has correct odds and is fair to gambling punters as a business transaction.  </p><p> Those are the reasons I am open to reconsidering anything my colleagues bring forward on Report Stage but, at this time, I am afraid that my advice is not to accept them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.730" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2019071000002#D00200"><p>I agree with an awful lot of what the Minister of State said.  I agree entirely about the significant damage that can be done and all of the committee members have the same objectives for this and future legislation.  I will not press the amendment but I ask him to consider it over the summer.  He must understand the argument that is being made.  He said that this legislation is not governed by the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 and, therefore, it does not affect him.  If he is correct about that, all the arguments relating to unintended consequences apply all the same.  By the same token, somebody could go away and set up that same private members club the Minister of State is talking about tomorrow morning and all the same unintended consequences that might exist if they were to be specifically excluded from the legislation could equally apply.  What if the Minister of State is not right and private members' clubs are covered by this?</p> <p>  The argument that they are covered is that, until this legislation, it was not an offence to the same extent to be involved in gaming without a gaming permit or licence.  It will now be an offence and whether or not one has a constitutional right to freedom of association, that does not entitle one to break the law in that environment.  That is the concern.  If the Minister of State is not correct, and private members' clubs are included, then they close down and there are job losses and all the rest of it involved in that.  I would like it if he could take whatever preparations are happening in the Department with the Gambling Control Bill, grab that part of the legislation and put it in here.  It is otherwise unfair to the people whose jobs are involved in these businesses because there is uncertainty which needs to be addressed.  I will not press the amendment and will withdraw it.</p></speech>

I meet a lot of people who have problems with gambling and they have nowhere to go.  What investment is the Minister of State going to make to help people with gambling addictions?  The bookmakers and people involved in the gambling business are contributing money towards psychiatrists and so on but I have seen advertising on television lately about sex and bullying but gambling addictions have been going on a long time.  The Minister of State is now coming out and talking about changing the entire system.  What about these people who need help?  Has he plans to look after people with addictions in the future?</p></speech>

It will also fund research which is important and provide information and education to people about the dangers of gambling.  If someone has an addiction issue, that is a health issue and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, is responsible for looking after addictions, including gambling addictions.</p> <p>  A private fund has been established recently by some elements of the industry to make funding available to some addiction services specifically ring-fenced for gambling and that is happening independent of me and the Department; we are not involved in that.  I advise anyone who is a problem gambler or who has an addiction to go to a therapy centre, get assistance, meet a therapist or a counsellor and get help in that regard.  It is a health issue at the end of the day and the Department of Health is leading on that and doing some good work.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will say that the Department of Justice and Equality has a responsibility.  He mentioned a levy.  If a levy is going to be charged, the Departments of Justice and Equality and Health should work very closely together to ensure these addicts are being looked after.  This has gone on far too long.</p> <p>  I will be honest that I gamble four times a year.  I love looking at golf and I gamble on the four majors.  I put a wee flutter on and that is probably how it all starts.  We must run an advertising campaign and explain that the problems and serious issues related to gambling are similar to those relating to drink.  I do not have a problem with gambling, and I am a pioneer and do not have a problem with drink.  I realise that other people have problems and need help.  The warning signs are there at an early stage.</p> <p>   I have been looking at television for the past number of years and I have seen nothing warning people about gambling addiction but I see advertisements about sex and bullying.  The Departments of Justice and Equality and Health should work together and highlight the serious issues people are having with gambling.  That might stop people at an early age.</p> <p>  Years ago, the biggest problem we had in this country was smoking and, all of a sudden, obesity and diabetes are bigger killers than smoking.  People worked so hard on the smoking and, all of a sudden, we now realise we have problems with other issues.  Prevention is the best cure and I would like the Minister of State's Department to work a wee bit closer with the Department of Health, using the levy and the moneys coming in to help addicts.</p></speech>

I have worked hard, as have many of us here, to get this to this point.  The gambling levy is not there yet because the main legislation is not there yet but, when it comes in, it will be there.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick made some good points and I will contact the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, but I have spoken to her about this issue already.  We have carried out some studies on this and another one is ongoing, which I will refer to later, on the prevalence of gambling in the jurisdiction, which is quite enlightening and we look forward to the results of that study when it is made available.  The Deputy made some interesting points and we should do more to educate people, inform and warn them about the dangers here and how they can get help if they need it.

If we look at the 1956 Act, we will see that section 14 is in Part 3 which deals with the licensing of amusement halls and funfairs.  We have all become aware of how unusual the legislation in this area is because local authorities can opt in to this Part of the 1956 Act - some have done so, while some have not - which means that different systems are operating throughout the country for amusement halls and funfairs, which is unusual from the point of view of legislation.  The amendments arise from a concern that people are spending too much money in gambling.  Section 14(b) of the 1956 Act states: &quot;the stake in each game is not to be more than sixpence for each player...&quot;.  That is still the law.  At paragraph (d) it states: &quot;no player may win more than the value of ten shillings...&quot;.  That may have been amended subsequently, but it is still extremely low.  The Minister has decided to insert a figure of &euro;10 for the stake and &euro;750 for the prize.  I understand the logic behind this.  The purpose of my amendment is to try to prevent people from spending too much money in gambling.  However, since I tabled the amendment, I have been contacted by people who own arcades to say this would be very unfair on them because there is no restriction on those who gamble online in the bet they can place.  They are asking why they will be being restricted under the new regime in the amount a person will be able to gamble on a machine.  It is a further example of how complicated the issue is.</p><p>I will not push the amendments on Committee Stage.  I will consider them further on Report Stage and the Minister should do the same.  I am interested in hearing what the Minister of State has to say to them in response, but clearly we need to update the legislation to ensure it will be meaningful.  If we are to provide in the Bill for meaningful stakes and prizes, they will have to be policed.  I am interested in hearing the Minister's response on how he believes that will happen.</p></speech>

There is a need for consultation over the summer, including with people involved in the business but also, importantly, those involved in dealing with individuals with a gambling addiction.</p> <p>  I take Deputy O'Callaghan's point about fairness and having an equal playing pitch in online versus land-based gambling.  I do not understand the science, but there is something about the dynamic of slot machines that results in compulsive behaviour.  It is reasonable that there are maximum stakes and we need to make sure they are right.  I do not believe the three cent, or sixpence, limit is applied in practice, but the rate proposed in the Bill is a huge increase on the rate in the existing legislation.  We need to examine revising it downwards from &euro;10, a proposal we would view favourably.  </p> <p>  On a technical issue - I would like the Minister of State to examine this - I would have supported the amendments.  If they are not being pressed, that is Deputy O'Callaghan's prerogative, but it is my understanding of the way it has been interpreted that, strictly speaking, every line is a game.  One could have 25 lines, on each of which one could place a tenner.  That issue needs to be examined.  One can imagine the matrix in the different lines of fruit, other symbols and so on.  The maximum stake is potentially substantially larger than what is officially set out in the legislation because each line is a game and one can win in each of the several combinations, similar to each line in a Lucky 31 being a separate bet.  I would like the Minister of State to examine that issue as we need to make sure we get it right.  It should involve consultation with the industry but also with those involved in dealing with individuals with a gambling addiction, particularly those who have experienced the dynamics of slot machines and so on.</p></speech>

In looking at something like an arcade which is referred to as an amusement arcade we must consider whether we are regulating an activity that is seen as gambling.  I accept the point others involved in the industry make that there is no other activity that is comparable.  One can buy a lotto ticket for &euro;2 and win &euro;250,000.  However, there is something about the addictive nature of gaming and the actual process in an amusement arcade that makes it worthwhile examining the general idea of what the maximum payout versus the stake should be.  I believe the figure &euro;750 is a little too generous, but I am interested in hearing what is the Minister of State's thinking on the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.754" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2019071000002#E01900"><p>I am interested in hearing how the Minister arrived at the figures of &euro;10 and &euro;750.  Thirty-five years ago in Killybegs I could have gambled &pound;2 when the stake was 2.5 pence.  There was no enforcement of the law.  How do we know that there will be enforcement of the law now?  If the law provides for a stake of &euro;10, I am 100% sure one can gamble &euro;100 in establishments because I know the way they work.  That is the problem.  I am more interested in hearing how the Minister arrived at the figures, but I am also interested in hearing how the law will be made workable and enforced.  The figures of &euro;10 and the &euro;750 are more than enough, but, in reality, the amounts gambled will be much more.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.755" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1441" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2019071000002#E02000"><p>I agree that we have to look at the stake and prize money.  The Bill states a person who holds a gaming licence should not accept a stake from a person under the age of 18 years.</p><p>What enforcement is being done to ensure that these gaming establishments are not taking money from young people under 18 years of age?  I do not know how any enforcement can be done whatsoever.  This is part of the addiction problem.  Is it the Department or the Garda which enforces this?  As I said earlier, prevention is the best cure.  It is okay reducing the stakes and the prize money.  However, what are we doing to stop young people putting money in these gaming machines?</p></speech>

Three cent to &euro;10 per spin or per game is a significant increase.  As legislators, we must consider the exceptions that can be created, no matter what type of figure one puts on the cost per game and the prize money.  When legislating for specific figures, no matter what figure one puts in, even if it is low, one must not drive people into other forms of gambling.  The advocates from the public health point of view, such as Mr. Barry Grant and Dr. Colin O'Gara, have made a legitimate case in terms of these specific figures.  We have listened to them in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.758" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2019071000002#F00300"><p>We are making gambling under 18 years of age an offence.  It will not be allowed anywhere and it is the first time it is being done.  Section 18 lists the offences and lays out the punishments.  There are consequences if people break the law in this area.  Enforcement is a matter for the enforcement authority, the Garda and others.</p> <p>  The amendments proposed relate to the maximum stakes and prices which can be played for on a gaming machine at a licensed amusement arcade under the terms of Part III of the principal Act.  The only role for the Minister for Justice and Equality under that Part concerns stakes and prize amounts.  Section 5 substitutes a new section 14 for that section of the 1956 Act.  The amendment concerns, essentially, the updating of a maximum allowable stake and prize amounts.  These are increased from three cent and 50 cent to &euro;10 and &euro;7.50.</p> <p>  Deputy Pringle asked how we arrived at these figures.  There is no science.  I have seen people, with sandwiches and flasks alongside them, sitting in arcades with bags of coins, just feeding them into machines all day.  One can argue that, whether it is &euro;2 or &euro;10 at a time, people with a problem with gambling will keep going until the bag of money is gone.  Gambling addiction is a problem area.</p> <p>  Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan mentioned that there are people employed in this area.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said, he gambles four times a year.  We will not do a roll call of the rest of us but people have a flutter every so often.  Some people gamble a bit more than others while others have an addiction problem and need help.  It has been said that the stakes and prizes are totally unrealistic and out of date.  We must bring them up to some form of realistic modern amount.</p> <p>  A new regulation in section 14 will allow the Minister to amend stake and prize amounts.  Through a statutory instrument, the Minister of the day can actually increase or decrease stakes or prizes.  This will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If whatever figure we finally arrive at is not working, the Minister of the day can change that in co-operation with the Houses.</p> <p>  In the past, the stakes and prizes were locked into legislation at three cent and 50 cent.  There has been no primary legislation in this area since 1956.  Deputy Pringle alluded to what was really happening on the ground which is another story.  We are trying to bring it up to something realistic.  The &euro;7.50 prize is the maximum amount.  Obviously, that will probably not happen that often.  If people want to gamble, they will want some kind of incentive or thrill to do it.  By having a realistic prize, people will be inclined to have a go and a bit of fun.  It stops being fun when it becomes a problem.</p> <p>  The Revenue Commissioners issued 12,113 gaming machine licences and 94 licences for gaming premises in 2018.  Within the past two years, it has undertaken a major enforcement drive against unlicensed premises and machines.  I very much support this effort and hope it will deal with the issues in question.  My own proposals seek to make it clear that licensed gaming machines should only be located in licensed gaming arcades where a local authority resolution is in place.  Again, I hope the Revenue and Garda enforcement efforts will continue to target unlicensed machines and lead to their removal from public houses, take-away food shops and other such locations.</p> <p>  This particular stake and prize amount has been in the public domain since we first published the proposals more than two years ago.  This is the first time it has been examined by the D&aacute;il.  Some colleagues in the Seanad raised it as well.  I am open to looking at this over the summer.  We have to be careful that it is realistic.  We are putting in the provision that it can be changed by ministerial order if it is found to be too high.</p> <p>  Several Deputies said there is a thrill to the arcades.  There is as much a thrill in gambling online.  It is silent and hidden, however.  I am far more concerned with the migration to online gambling and how we deal with that.  It is not going to be easy.  I would contend far much more is lost online than in the arcades.  The arcades are limited in their opening times and locations, whereas online is open 24-7.  That is where we will put a lot of our efforts to see how we can deal with that.</p> <p>  I understand the amendments are being withdrawn.  I agree to examine them again and communicate with colleagues in order that we can agree on some figures.  We will certainly give it careful thought over the summer.</p></speech>

We are referring to slot machines and gaming machines.  Section 149(2) states the Minister may, by regulation, vary the amount specified.  I am not an expert in identifying what is the appropriate amount that will be effective in trying to tackle compulsive gambling.  However, that is a matter the Minister of State might need to look at.  It might be the case that one does not specify the amount in the primary legislation and leave it for ministerial regulation.  Section 14(2) allows for that.  However, it needs to be looked at.</p><p>I take the Minister of State's point that even if we say nobody can place a bet of more than &euro;2 on a slot machine, there is nothing to stop a person from sitting at the machine all day and repeatedly putting &euro;2 into it.  What is the stake on slot machines in arcades at present?  Presumably, it has to be in coins.  There is a problem.  Nobody wishes to stop summer time arcades where people can win and have some fun, but what we want to stop or deter is compulsive gambling.  A bigger place where that can occur is probably online, but we must do something.  We are withdrawing the amendments, but the Minister of State might give them consideration.  We are all happy to discuss them with him.</p></speech>

There are people who get addicted to slot machines who might not be addicted to gambling in other forms.  It is something that happens and we must be conscious of this.  The Minister of State did not respond to the point I made about lines.  I do not know if he can respond to it; if not, perhaps he might look at it over the summer.  If that is the case - I cannot be certain that it is - it makes a significant difference in the decisions we have to make.</p> <p>  On another question, there is a difference between slot machines and what are called fixed odds betting terminals which are used for roulette, blackjack and the like.  They are considered to be even more addictive.  I read a story about somebody in Britain who lost &pound;6,000 in 60 minutes on these machines which I believe are being banned there.  They were not legal in this jurisdiction previously.  Am I right that that remains the case?</p></speech>

On the situation in the United Kingdom, there is a category of machines colloquially known as fixed odds betting terminals, FOBTs.  Four of these machines were allowed per shop, which led to a big increase in the number of pop-up bookmakers.  The UK Government has reduced the maximum stake for the four category B gaming machines to &pound;2.  There were no changes to maximum prize amounts, which range from &pound;400 to &pound;500.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire is correct that studies in the United Kingdom have suggested FOBT machines are highly addictive and can lead to serious problem gambling.  Such machines have never been a feature of bookmaker shops in Ireland.  Gaming machines are only allowed in licensed gaming arcades here.  To return to what Deputy Fitzpatrick said, we must ensure our enforcement measures are robust.  I encourage the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda to be extra vigilant in removing machines from unlicensed locations.  Gaming machines have been available in licensed gaming arcades in the State since the 1956 Act was commenced.</p> <p>  The results of the 2014-15 survey of the prevalence of gambling which were published in February this year by the Department of Health show that the most prevalent forms of gambling engaged in were, believe it or not, those associated with the national lottery.</p> <p>  On the issue of unlicensed machines in premises, I hope the District Courts in dealing with applications for certificates under Part 3 of the legislation will be satisfied that such local authority resolutions are in place before issuing such certificates.</p> <p>  I am not an expert on lines and so forth, but I understand it can be per spin.  We will do carry out research and refer back to the Deputy on the matter.</p></speech>

Its concern is that the situation for bingo game organisations was not properly anticipated or considered adequately.  Some of the organisations are commercial and often run bingo games on behalf of charitable organisations.  Their concern is that they are not covered because they will not be the licensee but an agent of the licensee and will be unable to run the bingo games on behalf of the licensee.  They believe they are not covered and are legitimately concerned.</p><p>With regard to amendment No. 7 and the dynamics of bingo games, under the legislation, as drafted, 50% is the maximum figure for prizes.  The association's view - I am not an expert - is that for a bingo game to be attractive, the prize must be in the range of 60% to 70%.  It believes an adequate number of people will not be got through the door, unless the pot is 60% to 70% because that is what is expected.</p><p>There is a difference between my amendment and that of Deputy O'Callaghan.  My understanding is the figure of 40% included in my amendment and the expenses incurred in promotion and so forth includes the payments that would be made to the charitable organisation on behalf of which the licensee was acting.  Perhaps the wording requires work to clarify-----</p></speech>

As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, there are organisations which run bingo games for charities.  For example, if a GAA club wishes to organise a bingo night event, it will need a certain amount of equipment and technology to run it.  The concern is that under the legislation as proposed in the amendment to section 28, it will be precluded from obtaining a licence for the purpose of running this lottery.  Our first amendment is to subsection (8) which states: "A person who holds a lottery permit shall not transfer that permit to any other person and any such purported transfer shall be void and of no effect".</p><p>What we propose is the insertion of wording to the effect of save where a licensee utilises an agent to conduct a lottery on its behalf.  If an applicant which is a charity applies to the District Court for a lottery licence, it cannot then transfer it to somebody else under this legislation, and charities believe that will change the position that operates at present because currently they can be delegated to be run on their behalf.  I would be interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say on that.  As amendments Nos. 7 and 8 are in this grouping, my amendment No. 8 proposes that "in the case of the lottery conducted by an agent of the licensee [which is what we are discussing here], not more than 25 per cent of the gross proceeds shall be utilised for the expenses of promotion, including commission". Obviously, the legislation can and should place a limit on how much money collected can be used for the profits of an agent running this type of operation.  The objective we want is to ensure that most of money will go to the philanthropic and charitable purpose.  I await hearing what the Minister of State has to say in respect of this.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.788" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2019071000002#H00500"><p>I will start by dealing with amendments Nos. 5 and 6, which, as the Chairman said, are related.  They concern section 12, which substitutes section 28 of 1956 Act with a new section that sets out the application process for a lottery licensed by the District Court.  This section maintains the current maximum prize amount of &euro;30,000.  However, it makes provision for a prize fund limit of &euro;360,000 where a once-off annual lottery is promoted under a District Court licence.</p> <p>  The District Court grants a licence to an applicant where the applicant fulfils the conditions laid down in the new section 28. There are significant additional conditions for the prospective licensee to meet.  I contend these are necessary and legitimate requirements to ensure the best promotion of the lottery to guard against fraudulent behaviour and to prevent potential criminal behaviour, including money laundering.</p> <p>  Any lottery licensee may appoint an agent or agents to help promote a lottery.  This is permitted by the current law and confirmed by court judgment.  This does not mean, however, that the licensee can abandon responsibility or control of the lottery to an agent.  This would undermine the policy and legislative intention of modernising the provisions on the better promotion of lotteries.</p> <p>  The amendments proposed by Deputies O&rsquo;Callaghan and &Oacute; Laoghaire would have the effect of allowing the transfer of a lottery licence issued to an applicant by the District Court to an agent to conduct that lottery.  No checks or controls on such an agent, as are imposed on the licensee, are proposed in the amendment.  There are inherent dangers associated with such an approach.  The proposed amendments would appear to arise from representations from some associations which purport to run commercial bingo by acting as agents of lottery licensees.  I have also received those representations.</p> <p>  In my view, despite any assertions to the contrary, no pathway was provided in the 1956 Act for commercial bingo as a profit-driven business for agents or operators acting for licensees.  I do not propose to accept the amendments along the lines proposed for the reasons I have outlined.</p></speech>

The manner in which we have drafted subsection (8) clearly implies there would be permission to transfer the licence from the applicant to the agent and the agent would then conduct the lottery on its behalf.  Is the Minister of State saying that, as matters currently stand, even if a person is not the holder of the licence, he or she can still promote the lottery if that person is an agent?</p></speech>

The amendment as drafted would allow the transfer of a licence to an agent who had not been through the checks and balances of the court.  For example, Deputy O'Callaghan could get a licence and transfer it Deputy Jack Chambers who may or may not be of good character, and he would then operate it and the court would have no way of checking what is happening.  That is the reason these serious safeguards are included.  If somebody applies as a licensee, they can employ an agent to help them to run the licence, but transferring the licence is a completely different matter.</p></speech>

As I understand it, the way the amendments are phrased effectively puts a straight end run around the whole licensing process.  It is not that we could see somebody doing this but an organisation or entity which fulfilled the criteria for getting a licence would then be able to transfer it to somebody in respect of which there was no vetting or regulation, which would almost nullify the process if people wanted to use it in a particular way.  That is my reservation about these amendments.  If there is an opportunity for an organisation to engage in a commercial arrangement with someone to engage in aspects of fulfilling the licence it has been granted, surely that meets the criteria of what people are seeking in this area who would legitimately want to operate it.  However, I would have grave reservations about the amendments.</p></speech>

What if the wording stated "a named agent"?  In that way, there would be a licensee and a named agent as part of that licence which would be transparent rather than giving unlimited control to the licensee to have a potential agent.  If a named agent were incorporated through the courts awarding of a licence, it might be preferable.</p></speech>

I could agree with amendment Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment up to a point but the Bill also pitches an allowable expenses at a maximum of 25% reduced from 40% of total proceeds in the 1956 Act.  Critically the Bill also provides for the first time the amount of the total proceeds that must be allocated to prizes, a maximum of 50%, and to the charitable or philanthropic cause a maximum of 25%.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's amendment No. 7 has the effect of restoring the 40% expenses provision for agents.  No guaranteed amount for the good cause of lottery was licenced for or intended to benefit is provided for either of the Deputies proposed amendments.  What we are proposing is more positive in that regard.  </p> <p>  In all stages of the debates on the Bill so far, no one has opposed the modernisation of the lottery licence application and issue process but it is useful to discuss it.  The grant by the court of a lottery licence is a significant matter.  The Deputies' amendments would effectively hand over lottery licences to agents who would not have to go through the licence application of the court.  </p> <p>  The proposition in the Deputies respective second amendments would only guarantee an agent a fixed proportion of the total lottery proceeds while not giving any mandated return to the charitable or philanthropic organisation cause involved or to the prize fund.  The impact would be that we would focus on the takings of an agent when we should focus on the good cause that needs the funds.  That is why the amendments are not balanced.  The Bill, for the first time, guarantees a maximum of 50% to prizes and 25% must be given to the charity.</p></speech>

I have no research or evidence as to whether a large pay out is necessary, however the Bill provides for 50% which, I contend, is quite substantial.  In the past the agent got 40% and only 60% was left.  If that was broken down, one would expect the charity to get a fair amount of that.  This Bill reduces the amount the agent or promoter can take and ensuring that the charity gets a maximum of 25%.  The rest must go to prizes.  If I understand the Deputy correctly, the prizes must be pitched at a certain level in order to attract people to play.  In this case 50% is the maximum that can be allocated.</p></speech>

Is the Deputy suggesting that 70% or 80% should go on prizes, and that there is also an operator cost built in?  The core reason for its existence, namely, that it benefits the organisation with the licence to run it, is almost zero.  As good as it might be for those playing, the Deputy is saying that by the time the prizes are given out and the operator gets its cut, the amount given to the charity, must on those figures, be virtually zero or around 5%.  If the beneficiary received so little, it would put into question the whole underlying basis of the licence being issued.  If people playing the game marketed as operated in support of X or Y, and knew that X or Y only received 5%, we would be on a very dangerous road.</p></speech>

In most countries betting on the national lottery is not allowed.  Currently, there are several online ways to speculate or bet on the outcome of the national lottery which is money that could potentially go to the lottery itself.  The lottery's own analysis is that it could make a &euro;110 million difference to its good causes fund annually.</p><p>This could benefit community organisations, sporting clubs and charitable organisations.  It is commonplace in other jurisdictions throughout Europe and the world.  Ireland's lack of regulation in this area is unusual as I understand it.  I would like to see us working towards some form of consensus in the area.  It is an issue that needs to be explored and I will be interested to hear the Minister of State's view on it.  It is a significant amount of money that could benefit charitable purposes.</p></speech>

They are perfectly entitled to do so but it is of public concern because when people buy a lottery ticket part of the money goes to the Central Fund, which is for the benefit of the public and we all know of good projects.  If we have people drifting away from buying national lottery tickets to betting on the lottery online, they do not contribute to the Central Fund.  This was the purpose of the Bill.</p> <p>  The Minister of State dealt with this a little in the Seanad so I will listen to what he has to say.  There is a slight difference between Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's amendment and mine.  I have redefined the outcome of a lottery game so as to not catch those people who are not offshore online operators.  Many people are affected by it or present themselves as being affected by it.

The national lottery is now controlled and owned by a Canadian pension fund.  Will the Minister of State accept an amendment on Report Stage to ring-fence the unclaimed prizes, which are used for marketing purposes at present, so they go back to public or charitable projects?  Will he agree to this amendment?  Some of these amendments are about the national lottery wanting to stave off competition from other operators and I am not that bothered by this.  I am bothered by the fact the national lottery uses unclaimed prizes to promote itself rather than the money being used for the purposes of charities or proper projects.  It is a public issue with regard to the drafting of the Act.  Is the Minister of State open to changing this so any unclaimed prize would have to be pooled towards charitable projects or go back to the State rather than being used by the private pension fund to promote its own activity?  There is huge public concern about this.  Huge amounts of money are being kept by the lottery operator and not going to this particular purpose.  It is a separate argument but it relates to lotteries.</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance has doubled taxation on betting shops.  They pay tax and create jobs, particularly in rural areas.  There has been betting on the lottery for the past 25 years.  It is completely different from the national lottery.  Will we start to exclude competition?  I come from a business background and competition is good.  They are two completely different things and I cannot support Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire's amendment.  We have to be very careful given the number of jobs this involves.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-07-10a.849" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2019071000002#K01200"><p>I thank colleagues for their comments and questions.  This matter appears to be raised in almost the same terms by both amendments.  As has been said, this was discussed extensively in the Seanad.  I note the amendments are the same as the text of a Bill submitted by the national lottery to the Department in 2018 and similar to a Bill tabled by Deputy O'Callaghan at the same time.</p> <p>  We spoke to the Office of the Attorney General about this and it is in agreement with the position I set out in some detail in the other House.  There is an issue whereby accepting the amendment might lead to further demands from the national lottery, perhaps seeking to prohibit the local lotteries that support sports clubs and community organisations.  Many of our sports clubs and community organisations depend on lotteries.  We could argue they are in direct competition with the national lottery.  A similar argument to that made by the Deputies is that these lotteries for football, rugby, hurling and Tidy Towns also impact on the turnover of the national lottery.  It could be argued they have an impact on sales.  None of us could agree on doing anything to curtail this activity, which directly benefits local sports clubs and other organisations.</p> <p>  Deputy Chambers mentioned that the national lottery is now a private company.  The essence of the amendment seems to be to enhance its position as a private company by seeking to end the possibility of licensed bookmakers, land based and remote, offering bets on the outcome of Irish national lottery draws as they might on any other probability outcomes.  Deputy Fitzpatrick made this point.  The Deputies' proposals would allow licensed land-based or online bookmakers to offer bets on any other lottery but not the Irish one.  Should the Deputies' proposition be accepted, I foresee certain legal uncertainties and potential challenges from licensed bookmakers.  I do not think it would achieve what is intended, which is possibly increased sales for the national lottery.  For information, the turnover of the national lottery in 2015 was &euro;670 million, in 2016 it was &euro;750 million, in 2017 it was &euro;800 million and in 2018 it was &euro;805 million.  There was a 20% increase over four years.  This certainly does not suggest much impact since 2015 on the lottery operator arising from the licensing of bets.</p> <p>  The contribution of the national lottery to good causes increased each year.  This is to be welcomed, although such contribution is surely critical to having a national lottery in the first place.  The turnover is increasing every year and there is no convincing evidence that betting on lottery numbers undermines funding for good causes or that it threatens the profitability of the national lottery operator in the long term.  As I said, it is now a private company.</p> <p>  In addition, there is no evidence that I am aware of that betting on lottery numbers leads to a loss of revenue to the Exchequer.  Licensed remote bookmakers offering bets on lottery numbers and all licensed Irish betting shops must pay tax on every bet they take.  They must pay the current necessary licence fee.  Bookmaker shops also contribute to the Exchequer by, as has been said, providing many jobs in towns and villages throughout the country.  The product offered in betting shops or online is a bet and not a ticket sale.  I understand Irish bookmakers offer bets on one, two, three, four or five numbers being drawn.  In terms of cost to customers, bookmakers accept bets of 5 cent and upwards while the national lottery minimum stake is &euro;5 for two lines without the plus option.</p><p>Online operators normally offer bets on the outcome of the national lottery, EuroMillions and other lotteries, with players having to choose the corresponding numbers relating to those draws.  I have not been provided with any information to suggest that the outcomes of the weekly national lottery draws are exempt from being bet on.  Such is the position with football matches and races.  I may bet on their outcomes without hindrance by the organisers of the events.  I am aware of no argument to suggest the national lottery numbers are afforded some special form of legal or intellectual property protection.  In any representations I have received on this matter, the national lottery operator has advanced no such arguments.</p><p> As I stated in the Seanad, I have no function in respect of the national lottery as such.  Regulation of its licensing is a matter for the Minister for Finance under the National Lottery Act 2013.  My Department's role concerning licensed bookmakers under the betting Acts is limited to the provision of certificates of fitness for applicants for bookmakers' licences, remote bookmakers licences and for remote betting intermediaries.  The Revenue Commissioners issue licences after that.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform did not provide in the National Lottery Act for any prohibition on licensed bookmakers offering bets on the outcome of the national lottery draws on Wednesdays and Saturdays, nor did the Minister for Finance address this point during the preparation of the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015.  To the best of my knowledge, there are no conditions or prohibitions imposed in the Betting Acts 1931 to 2015 in respect of the nature and extent of the bets that licensed bookmakers, land-based or remote, might offer.  I am sorry for going on a bit but I feel we must ventilate this.</p><p> Deputy Jack Chambers asked about unclaimed winnings.  While I agree with the sentiment he expressed, this is a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to deal with it.</p></speech>

I will pretend that it was not parties in here which supported it.  There are parties here that opposed it.  The decision was a bad one.  The company cannot be treated as any other private company because there is a good causes fund from which the public benefits.  It is in the public interest that the fund remain at a high level.  It is also in the public interest to renew the licence at some stage, potentially involving some other company.  In the meantime, we want a healthy fund and as many clubs as possible to benefit.  That is a reasonable public objective.  I would not have chosen the private company route but that is how matters stand.</p> <p>  I listened to what the Minister of State said.  Some of the provisions are technical but, on the principal point, it is increasingly the case that very many people are using online companies to bet on the lotto.  There are other elements also, involving bookmakers and all the rest of it, but the question of catching the first element is the difficulty in drafting the Bill as a whole.  A very substantial sum is potentially being lost out on.  Most European jurisdictions protect their national lotteries and the funds that emanate from them.  Could the Minister of state offer a comment on that or clarify matters?  The current position might be healthy but if the drift continues in the direction of commercially operated lotteries with no public benefit, then the national lottery will be undermined.  Nobody wants to go near a lottery of Bride Rovers or Terenure Tidy Towns, for example, and that is not proposed in this amendment.  The Minister of State can speculate on what might happen in the future but it is not anticipated in this amendment.  This amendment will not do what he describes.</p></speech>

The national lottery is established under legislation so it is different from a private enterprise.  There are moneys for the benefit of the public.  As a result of what Deputy Sherlock stated about people betting on a couple of numbers, I am conscious that the amendment, as drafted, may go a bit further than anticipated.  I tried to limit it a little in order that it would not cover such situations.  The matter is complicated.  We have had a fairly consensual meeting here.  I might return to this amendment on Report Stage rather than pressing it now.  I do not know whether I will necessarily win the argument in any event.  The Government should, however, seek to determine what it can do to protect the Central Fund.  The Minister of State gave statistics indicating the lottery is doing very well but we know from other jurisdictions that a lottery can be undermined by very effective offshore operators.  We need to ensure that we do not permit this.  If it happens, it will be too late to start introducing legislative measures to try to protect the national lottery.  The harm will have been done.  The Minister of State should give greater recognition to the need to protect the Central Fund.</p></speech>

Determining the cost is quite difficult, and possibly insurmountable &mdash; I do not know.  One would have to go into every single bookmaker's shop in the country and seek to measure the revenue arising from bets on the Lotto numbers on Wednesday and Saturday nights.  I am not sure how feasible that is.  The Minister of State might have a response to my remark nonetheless.</p></speech>

He gave a figure of &euro;670 million for 2015.  In 2018, it was &euro;802 million.  That is an increase of &euro;132 million in a short period, which is great.  The Irish betting shops have been doing this lottery for the past 25 years.  Many people are dependent on the shops for jobs.  Are we actually thinking about what we are doing?  Next we will be chasing the GAA clubs and Tidy Towns committees.  It is all right stating it will not happen but that is the way things go.  Suddenly, there could be a drive to get rid of betting shops or Internet betting.  The next thing, charities would be the focus.  It is wrong.  The betting shops are paying their taxes.  The tax was increased by 100% recently.  There is an anti-betting shop trend.  I have met people involved in the industry, especially in my county, Louth.  What is being proposed would be a bad influence.</p></speech>

I do not gamble at all so I may not understand the associated mentality.  Surely if somebody wants to have a bet on the generation of six random numbers, his or her convenience point comprises the Irish lotto numbers.  If we say he or she cannot bet on the lotto, the most likely next course of action will be to bet on the generation of six random numbers in, say, the UK lotto, rather than change over and make a decision to buy a lottery ticket.  Therefore, I cannot see the purpose of the amendments.  I do not see what they will achieve at all.  I do not even believe that, if accepted, they would protect the fund or increase the profitability of the national lottery.  It is so marginal that the gamblers will just switch over to betting on something different.  Six numbers are six numbers.</p></speech>

That it is owned by a Canadian pension fund demonstrates the difficulty.  My issue is not with what has been specifically submitted through these amendments.  As mentioned, &euro;16 million that was inherited by the private operator from An Post was meant to go into the public fund for charitable causes but is instead being used by the private operator to promote itself.  It is also claiming unclaimed prizes in order to promote itself.</p><p>I take the point made regarding turnover, but I do not have much sympathy for either of the amendments.  Would the Minister accept an amendment to mandate the operator to ring-fence unclaimed prizes for public causes?  Neither the regulator nor the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, are dealing with it and this might be an opportunity to do so.  It seems that nobody is willing to provide better oversight.  There are millions of euro at stake which could be allocated to good causes but are being hoovered up by the operator because of the ambiguity of our current legislative position.  I raise this issue now because we need to deal with the fact that the operator inherited &euro;16 million of public money and is able to use it to promote itself, which is shocking.  This is a good opportunity to deal with it.</p></speech>

I will communicate them to the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, under whose remit the national lottery falls.  I am slow to stand on his toes at this stage, but I will bring the Deputy's points to his attention and ask him to consider them in his overall view.  The Deputy's proposal is not in line with the intention of the Bill, which is to do with gambling rather than unclaimed prizes in the national lottery, but I will raise the issue with the Minister.</p> <p>  The 2014-15 survey of gambling prevalence published in February of this year by the Department of Health indicates that the most prevalent forms of gambling engaged in were games associated with the national lottery.  The operator has quite an aggressive ongoing advertising campaign and I have certain issues with some of the messages portrayed, such as winning islands and so on, which glamorise gambling.  As I stated, turnover has increased every year.  The betting on lottery numbers with other betting providers is not impacting on the turnover of the national lottery.  In fact, it is going the other way.</p> <p>  I am taken by Deputy Sherlock's comment that the impact of these amendments would be to prevent people having a flutter on the numbers on a Saturday night or a Wednesday.  The citizen who wants to have a small bet on the outcome would no longer be permitted to do so under the amendments.  We would curtail that freedom and those placing such bets would move elsewhere.  The amendments would not have the desired impact except in terms of taking away the freedom of our citizens to have a small flutter, to use Deputy Sherlock's words, on the outcome of the lotto.  If we pass the amendments, those are the people who would be affected.  It would not make any difference to the turnover of the national lottery.  There is no guarantee that people who currently bet on the national lottery numbers would not decide to bet on something else instead.  The amendments would not have the desired effect. </p></speech>

My proposal has received the widespread support of the House.  There is an abuse of the licence by the current private operator.  All members agree that it is exploiting the loophole of unclaimed prizes and I intend to draft an amendment to deal with the issue.  It falls within the general remit of the forthcoming courts and civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill which is so broad and all encompassing in draft form that my proposal could be included.  It is time that we addressed this issue.  I do not have any sympathy for the pensioners in Canada and what they are getting out of the Irish lottery system.  We need to narrow the interpretation in respect of what unclaimed prizes may be retained.</p></speech>

A significant number of companies are making big money out of betting on the Irish and various other lotteries.  My understanding is that most European jurisdictions have legislation to protect their lottery.  Is that the case?  If it is, how is it done?</p></speech>

The Exchequer gains from people placing bets on lottery numbers and we must bear that in mind.  Bookmakers provide jobs in towns and villages across Ireland and are worried about the sustainability of those jobs if the amendments are passed.</p></speech>

It would inform policy and would need to be of very high quality.  That is the purpose of the amendment.  I would like the Minister to seek such a report.</p></speech>

Subsection (1) states: "The Minister for Justice and Equality shall, not later than 3 months after the commencement of this Act, seek a report regarding the prevalence of gambling on an all-island basis."  Subsection (2) states: "The Minister for Justice and Equality shall, not later than 2 years after the commencement of this Act, cause a report to be prepared on the operation of the Act and shall cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas."  The issue raised in subsection (1) of the amendment was also raised in the Seanad, as I am sure members are aware.  It regards the prevalence of gambling in general rather than solely problem gambling.  I share with the Deputy and other members of the committee deep concerns regarding how we can best address the issues of harmful gambling which affect the lives of persons so addicted, their families and wider society.  We are at one in that regard.</p> <p>  I always place our approach on this matter in a healthcare context and as being for the attention of relevant qualified professionals.  We must be careful not to come to the view or let others think that if we set up our gambling regulator, that will assist problem gambling to a significant extent.  If a person has an addiction, it is a health issue and we must focus on it from that point of view.  A regulator will only go so far.  If a person has an addiction, no amount of regulation will help; rather, he or she needs treatment.  I agree that we must seek to better understand the issues involved and obtain credible evidence on the nature and extent of the problems arising.  As stated by colleagues, gambling is complex and increasingly taking place in an online environment.  It is a matter for the Department of Health.  Obviously, it is not within my remit to carry out a report on the prevalence of gambling in Northern Ireland.  That should go without saying.</p> <p>  The drug prevalence survey for 2014-15 published on 27 February 2019 by my colleague, the Minister for State with responsibility for health promotion and the national drug strategy, Deputy Catherine Byrne, contained the first set of data on the extent of gambling in Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The data are based on fieldwork carried out between August 2014 and August 2015.  This general population survey of more than 7,000 persons was a collaborative project between the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol and colleagues in the public information and health research branch of the Department of Health in Northern Ireland.</p><p>Ipsos MRBI carried out the field work and my Department contributed to the cost of the survey.  While I accept that the survey is perhaps a little dated now, it provides a baseline of data to assist in policy formulation and future planning and action on gambling.  The survey found that the prevalence of problem gambling in the general population was 0.8%.  Problem gambling is most common in young males, at 1.9% among males aged 18 to 24 and 2.9% among males aged 25 to 34.  The Health Research Board is now undertaking a prevalence study for 2018 and 2019.  This will further assist in policy formulation, planning and action in this area.  Results are expected in 2020.  This survey will contain a specific section on gambling prevalence with an extended range of questions.  My Department is contributing to the costs of that survey.</p><p> While I welcome the concerns that motivate the proposed amendment, I believe that the Government is addressing those concerns through the large-scale professional work by the Health Research Board which is now under way.  We should await those results.  I do not think there is any point in duplicating it.  The first part of the Deputy's proposal risks imposing a significant cost on the Exchequer.  As we are doing it already, I do not see any reason why we should do it twice.  The second part of the proposal seeks to impose a requirement to carry out a two-year review of the operation of the Act.  This period is one normally found in legislation.  My Department will review the provisions of the amended Gaming and Lotteries Act as we work to bring forward proposals for the comprehensive reform of licensing and regulation of gambling in Ireland.  I do not see any particular need to impose this review provision.  I hope that comprehensive legislative proposals for reform will be published in this period.  We are doing substantial work in tandem with this.  I ask the Deputy to consider withdrawing the amendment because this is only an interim measure.  I want to have the limited resources that we have focused on getting the regulator established and the larger Bill drafted and enacted.  If we were to take resources away to do a review of this Act while doing the other at the same time, it may be counterproductive.  I can see the intention of the Deputy's amendment but I think it will happen anyway as we work on the larger Bill.</p></speech>

I have raised the issue of gambling addiction with the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne.  The Department of Health has no interest in dealing with this issue.  The Department of Justice and Equality can keep deflecting from gambling addiction but the Department of Health and the HSE have no interest in doing anything for anyone with a gambling addiction.  If one talks to any front-line health professional, there is no support at all for people with an addiction related to gambling.  As someone who is preparing to regulate the industry and potentially impose levies on it and provide a social fund for it, I think the Minister of State is obliged to front up on the healthcare aspects of this.  We are all fed up with hearing the old Whitehall model of excuse, that it is a different Department's responsibility.  We hear about interdepartmental collaboration and cross-departmental engagement in respect of climate change in particular.  The Minister of State should take the lead on the addiction issue because the Department of Health has no interest.  It has not implemented Crystal Fulton's recommendation on a gambling addiction strategy.  I do not believe that the health system will provide for those with a gambling addiction in the short to medium term.  It is an opportunity for the Department of Justice and Equality to do something.  Perhaps it could develop a private pathway for those with a specific addiction.  It is not good enough to keep deflecting to the Department of Health because, as the Minister of State knows as well as I do, it will not do anything about the problem.  We have to flag that now because if any of us are here in years to come, the Department of Health will have done nothing about this.  Together with my former colleagues, Mick Wallace and Clare Daly, I submitted parliamentary questions on it to which the Department did not even respond.  We need to see more from the Minister of State and his Department, which is trying to do something about it.  I support the amendments from Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire because if it gets the Department to start fronting up, that may be good for people in future.</p></speech>

I take it from that that this provision will be included in the new Bill.  The Minister of State said he is doing that work for the next Bill and does not want to duplicate it here.  Therefore, he would have no problem with this amendment if it was in the next Bill.</p></speech>

It is my first time being on this committee.  It is interesting to listen to the discussion.  With regard to that review, I hope that Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire would push it or, if not, that we would come back to it on Report Stage.  I think it is essential to have a review clause in all legislation.  I hear what the Minister of State said, as my colleague has said, that this is interim legislation and that he will come back to address the area again.  I echo what Deputy Pringle just said.  Is the Minister of State against the idea of a review in principle?  I understand that he is saying this is interim, so there is no need for it.  We asked for a review of the Parole Bill and the Minister said no.  Standing Order 164A was quoted, stating that reviews take place anyway.  That review is extremely limited.  There is an attitude among various Departments that a review is not necessary because it is an extra burden on the Department.  It seems to me that it is an essential part of any legislation if we are genuinely interested in effecting change although I understand the caution if this is interim legislation.</p></speech>

As Deputy Jack Chambers alluded to, we have stepped up by providing funding for research to find out what the issue is.  As colleagues know, this Department has as much legislation as the next five Departments put together.  We do not, nor should we have the expertise to deal with treatment.  The main legislation which we are working on will provide for a social fund.  There will be levies on the industry, which will be made available for treatment, research, education, raising awareness and so on.  When it comes to treating people who have an illness, I respectfully suggest that this is not the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality but of the Department of Health.  I cannot agree with the Deputy that the Department of Health is not interested.  I know that my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, is very interested in addiction services and is doing much work in that area, bringing forward some very innovative and radical proposals on addiction.</p> <p>  With respect to the first amendment proposed, we are carrying out research on drug prevalence under the Health Research Board.  I agree with Deputy Connolly that legislation should be reviewed to see how effective it is.  This is a small Bill.  It updates an existing 1956 Act.  It does not do anything major.  We are undertaking major reform in this area and that is the legislation which should be reviewed after it is published.  This is a small, interim Bill and it does not do much at the end of the day, though what it does is important.  There will not be much to review.  We will have to come back to what changing the stakes and prizes will mean.  We are saying that people under 18 cannot place bets.  There are other conditions too, as the Deputy has seen here.</p><p>There is not a great deal to review there.  I want to focus on the main legislation.  To answer the Deputy's question, I agree that legislation should be reviewed but primarily major Acts that have a significant impact.  This legislation is interim and while it is important, it will not make a major difference.</p></speech>
