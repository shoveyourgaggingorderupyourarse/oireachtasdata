    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Hughes" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019111300002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chair and the committee for the invitation to attend.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, together with the enterprise agencies, many of which will be familiar to members, such as Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland, and the four local enterprise offices in Laois, Longford, Offaly and Westmeath which are under the remit of the Department is deeply engaged in the enterprise development agenda in the midlands.</p><p>The importance of this enterprise development work has been brought into sharp focus in the context of the particular vulnerability - and the opportunities - presented by the transition from brown to green in the region, which is the subject of today's discussions.  The midlands was hit relatively hard by the recession, which affected all regions, but like the rest of the country it has made a strong recovery.  The unemployment rate in the midlands currently stands at 6.6%, compared to the State average of 5.4% so it just over 1% above the national average.  That was as of quarter 2 of 2019.  This is a vast improvement on the position at the beginning of 2015, when unemployment stood at 14.9%.  That was almost 4.5% above the national average at that time.  Since quarter 1 of 2015, just under 19,500 jobs were created in the midlands region.  That exceeds the target we had set of a 15% increase, as it was about a 17% increase.</p><p> It is worth reminding ourselves the midlands has a strong and evolving enterprise base.  It has strengths in the food and non-food manufacturing base, which continues to transition from more traditional activities to those driven by technology and digitalisation across sectors, such as medical devices, advanced engineering and an emerging internationally traded services sector.  The region has significant tourism assets that can be developed in a more integrated way in the context of the brand experience of Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East and Ireland's Hidden Heartlands.  The region benefits from a strong institute of technology in Athlone and has unparalleled national interconnectivity, being just over one hour from Galway and Dublin, in addition to having digital connectivity.</p><p> On our development agencies, IDA Ireland supports 42 client companies in the midlands, which bring foreign direct investment, FDI, into the region.  They employed 5,720 people in 2018.  The region was the highest performing region from a job creation perspective across the IDA Ireland regional portfolio in 2018, which is a good base from which to come into the current challenges.  FDI employment grew by 13%, with 701 net new jobs in 2018.  Recent IDA Ireland announcements for the midlands include: Greenfield Global with 75 jobs in Portlaoise; Leetha Industries and Red Seal Cups with 100 jobs in Longford; Avery Dennison with 200 jobs in Longford; Neueda Technologies with 200 jobs in Westmeath and; SkOUT Secure Intelligence with 30 jobs in Portlaoise.  Similarly with Enterprise Ireland and indigenous enterprise, there are over 12,300 people employed in 247 Enterprise Ireland-supported companies in the midlands, which was up by 4% in 2018.  Recent announcements there include from Revive Active with 11 jobs in Westmeath and Glanbia with 78 jobs in Portlaoise.  That is a &euro;130 million investment into Portlaoise and about 250 jobs will come on stream as part of the construction of that new facility. As for local enterprise offices, LEOs, LEO-supported micro-enterprises added 271 net new jobs across the midlands during 2018.</p><p> Despite this positive performance, the midlands now faces a new challenge, which will require renewed efforts to grow alternative sources of employment.  The enterprise agencies, namely, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, the LEOs and other development bodies are fully engaged in this agenda, and are focused on leveraging the key strengths and the potential areas of opportunity for enterprise growth and job creation in the midlands.  The Department also has close engagement with the Department of the Taoiseach on just transition and the midlands strategy.  Strong cross-governmental co-ordination at the regional level, in partnership with the enterprise sector, is critical at this juncture to focus on the proactive medium to long-term measures, as well as the short-term responses that are necessary to help with the structural adjustment in the midlands region.  In this context, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is leading on the development of the regional enterprise plans, which are successors to the regional action plans for jobs that were initiated in 2014 and 2015.</p><p> The regional enterprise plan for the midlands is strongly aligned with and supportive of the work of the regional transition team.  Specifically under strategic objective 1 in the plan, it aims to: "Ensure that the Midlands is well positioned to address the challenges posed by the transition to a low carbon economy and renewable energy".  The midlands plan had already adopted climate action and just transition as a focus area ahead of the climate action plan and we were drawing from this committee's own report in that context.  The climate action plan has since requested that all the regional steering committees adopt just transition as a standing agenda item.  The Department worked closely with the agencies, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs, in the preparation of the regional enterprise plan.  Reflecting the critical need for a collaborative approach, the midlands plan is overseen by a regional steering committee made up of representatives from the public and private sectors.  This includes the enterprise agencies, the local authorities, Athlone Institute of Technology, AIT, the education and training boards - which are here today, F&aacute;ilte Ireland; the regional skills forum for the midlands and the enterprise champions.  It is chaired by Dr. Anne Cusack, managing director of Critical Healthcare, a leading indigenous business in the region.</p><p> All of the regional enterprise plans are working to the 2020 target set under the previous regional action plan for jobs, to deliver a 10 to 15% uplift in employment.  That employment focus is at the centre of and will continue to be at the centre of the regional enterprise plans.  The midlands steering committee has a number of working groups in place to drive the individual actions in the plan.  It will be reporting on its progress to the Minister at the end of this year and the end of next year.  The Minister regularly meets the chairs of the regional steering committees, and did so most recently in September, to share experiences and to focus on the evolving situation in the midlands.  The delivery of actions under the regional enterprise plans is supported by a specific fund, namely, the regional enterprise development fund, which is administered for the Department by Enterprise Ireland.  This fund supports significant collaborative and innovative regional initiatives to help drive enterprise growth and job creation.  We have had two calls to date for total funding of &euro;60 million, with which 42 projects have been funded.  A third call for &euro;45 million is currently being assessed.  To date, the midlands region has secured &euro;3.4 million under the first two calls and some of the initiatives that have been funded include: the Irish Manufacturing Research centre, which is based in Mullingar; Offaly Innovation and Design Centre and I-LOFAR in Birr, which is a significant Science Foundation Ireland and AIT collaborative initiative; the Mountmellick Development Association, which is an enterprise hub in Mountmellick that was opened earlier this year and; a joint Leitrim, Cavan and Longford enterprise hub project.  Each region in the midlands under the current call, call 3, stands to benefit from at least &euro;2 million.  As I said, those projects should be announced by the end of the year and we understand there are some strong and positive projects from the midlands coming through there.  The midlands has also benefited from significant funding, of &euro;13.7 million so far, under the Project Ireland 2040 urban and rural regeneration and development funds, which is important from a place-making perspective, is part of the regional enterprise plans and is part of developing the region as an attractive place for businesses to locate, grow and develop and for people to live and work.</p><p> The transition to a low-carbon economy means a new economic model is necessary, focused on low-carbon growth, resource efficiency and sustainable development.  That presents significant transformational challenges for enterprise, and is the focus of a dedicated chapter in the Government&rsquo;s climate action plan, whose purpose is to support enterprises and individuals to make the changes in behaviour necessary to achieve our greenhouse gas emissions targets.  The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has a number of specific actions to undertake as part of the Government's climate action plan, including focusing on issues such as decarbonising processes in the cement and food and drinks sectors, which is a major employer in the midlands region, and improving the support available to firms looking to introduce lower carbon technologies.  That is an ongoing focus of the agencies.  The Department also has a dedicated team that is managing the achievement of the targets assigned to us, while ensuring the interests of enterprise are considered throughout the policymaking and implementation processes across Government.  The transition to a low-carbon economy is a central pillar in the Future Jobs Ireland 2019 agenda and similarly will be a key focus in the work we are doing for Future Jobs Ireland 2020.  We work closely with the Department of the Taoiseach on that strategy and we had a major session last week on the 2020 plan with over 200 stakeholders.  Again, climate action, decarbonising and responding to the brown to green transition were key focuses of those discussions.  A key issue in enterprise development and job creation is ensuring we have people with the right skills for what the market is looking for and that we have appropriate supports in place for upskilling and for reskilling, particularly for existing and emerging jobs.</p><p>This will not only play a critical role in initiating the transition but also in enabling a just transition.  Without a suitably trained workforce, including through upskilling and retraining, the transition will be challenging.</p><p> The Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is committed to working with its partners across Government and stakeholders, nationally and regionally, to deliver on the potential for enterprise development in the midlands and to deliver a just transition in the face of the current challenge, in particular through opening up opportunities for the affected workers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aileen Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019111300002#E00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss this important issue.  I am accompanied today by my colleague, Mr. Jim Scheer, who is the head of policy insights and design.</p> <p>  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, is Ireland&rsquo;s national energy authority funded by the Government through the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Our mission is to help Ireland transition to a low-carbon society, meeting challenging sustainable energy targets along the way.  One of SEAI&rsquo;s core values is that the work we do is people-centred and that we reach, empower and take account of all citizens in the transition away from fossil fuels.</p> <p>  The SEAI&rsquo;s programmes and supports are designed to take account of the citizen, communities, businesses, individual householders and the vulnerable.  However, to achieve reach the ambition detailed in the Government&rsquo;s recently-published climate action plan, there is to be a sharp acceleration of climate action and the SEAI is highly conscious of the need to be vigilant; that with this positive, albeit challenging, transition that everyone is factored in and no citizen is left behind.</p> <p>  As part of our role, the SEAI provides policy advice and analysis to our parent department, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We provided significant inputs to the climate action plan and are very encouraged by the ambition set out with concrete actions, clear timelines and responsible agents.  At the same time, we are in no doubt that there are huge challenges ahead with delivering these ambitions, for example retrofitting 500,000 homes to a B2 rating or cost-optimal level.  We wholeheartedly welcome the clear acknowledgement by the Government throughout the plan that for this transition to be a success, there is a critical need to understand, include and empower, rather than merely impose.  The establishment of the just transition review group within the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, will help to ensure this and we look forward to contributing.</p> <p>  The climate action plan pays particular attention to those groups who will need special support and assistance: those who will suffer job losses or business decline as fossil fuel industries wind down; those who struggle to afford sufficient heat for their homes; and, in general, those in our communities who must be mobilised and empowered to ensure we have the capacity needed to deliver.</p> <p>   As part of our remit, SEAI is already significantly involved in a range of areas that support a just transition.  On addressing fuel poverty, SEAI has been running the warmer homes scheme since 2001, upgrading over 140,000 homes of those in, or at risk of, fuel poverty.  The scheme has expanded to provide deeper measures in the past 18 months, leading to increased comfort, improved health and on-bill energy savings.  A full review of the programme is currently being carried out to see how targeting and impact can be further enhanced.  The scheme budget for 2020 has benefitted from carbon tax ring-fencing of &euro;13 million, bringing the total 2020 budget to almost &euro;53 million.</p> <p>  Since 2016, the SEAI has been running a warmth and well-being pilot scheme in collaboration with the HSE.  This scheme has targeted over 1,500 homes in fuel poverty where the occupants are suffering from chronic respiratory conditions.  The research outcomes on the impact of energy efficiency on occupants' health are highly anticipated in Ireland and internationally.  These programmes and their learnings will be critical in ensuring our most vulnerable are protected and included.</p> <p>  The SEAI is taking several actions to contribute to the development of the necessary skills and making the most of supply chain opportunities.  For example, we have been involved in the development of a national training specification on near zero energy buildings.  This specification is due for publication shortly and, as per the climate plan, will be rolled out at a national level through SOLAS and the Department of Education and Skills.</p> <p>  In 2020, we will review our 2014 supply chain opportunity report, highlighting opportunities for Irish businesses to capture growth in sectors facilitating the transition.  With our first experience of delivering retrofit programmes for homes and businesses, we are also advising other organisations.  Recently we met the midlands regional transition team, sharing insights from our retrofit programmes.  We continue to support Government in our policy advisory role in the areas of energy statistics and modelling, research, design and development and sustainable business and finance model development including one-stop shops and aggregation models.</p> <p>  The SEAI has been working with communities for many years, recognising the importance of grass roots action in delivering our mission.  Our community energy network goes from strength to strength, with 320 member communities across the country.  We have an ambition to grow this network to 1,500 by 2030.  Through this scheme, the SEAI provides supports for communities to identify their own opportunities and create a vision for their local area.  We provide funding for development of local energy master plans and technical support via a panel of expert mentors.</p> <p>  Our community capital grants are mobilising action at a local level with around 300 projects delivered to date and a further 57 projects added in 2019.  So far, this scheme has delivered sustainable energy upgrades to over 18,000 homes and 2,000 community buildings and businesses across Ireland.  Community upgrades of this nature enrol broad cross sections of the community, achieve economies of scale driving down delivery costs, and importantly, generate conversations around the activity delivered at a local level.</p> <p>  The SEAI is committed to deliver as best we can on the ambitions set out in the climate action plan and will continue to put the citizen at the centre of our programmes as we deliver on Government policy goals.  We look forward to working with those here today, and others, on this task.  We are happy to take questions today focused on our low-income homes support programmes in particular and on other activities in which we are a stakeholder supporting a just transition away from fossil fuels.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anna Marie Delaney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019111300002#E00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting the midlands regional transition team to engage with them this afternoon.  I am joined by my colleague, Ms Sarah Morgan, and by Mr. Padraig Boland, the training manager with Laois and Offaly education and training board, ETB, who is also a member of the regional transition team.</p> <p>  I will outline the importance of both peat harvesting and the power stations to the midlands economy and will outline the interventions and activities undertaken by the regional transition team to date.  Bord na M&oacute;na was established by the Government in the 1940s with a remit to provide employment opportunities in the midlands region.  That was a period when there were very few employment opportunities and emigration was a dominant feature of life in the midlands.  The remit was to provide employment opportunities and Bord na M&oacute;na transformed the economic landscape of the region, with the midlands experiencing in-migration, new settlement and community formation in predominantly rural areas in close proximity to the bogs and the power stations that emerged.</p> <p>  At the height of employment in the 1980s, Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB accounted for some 7,000 jobs in a very sparsely populated and rural region, becoming the mainstay of the midlands economy, providing employment for generations of families and often for many of them, obtaining such employment straight from school.</p> <p>  In October 2015, Bord na M&oacute;na signalled end of peat harvesting by 2030, which provided for a 15-year period of transition.  A further announcement came in October 2018, with Bord na M&oacute;na announcing its brown to green strategy and the acceleration of its decarbonisation programme, indicating that peat harvesting would cease in 2027.  In response to this announcement, the midlands regional transition team was established under the auspices of the midlands regional enterprise plan, its membership comprising regional stakeholders.  The purposes and objectives for that team, set out at that time, were to pursue funding opportunities and actions to mitigate the impact of the Bord na M&oacute;na job losses on the individuals concerned and the impact on the local and regional economy and to position the region to develop alternative forms of employment, attract investment and maximise existing employment opportunities and resources.</p> <p>  In 2018, Bord na M&oacute;na employment figures in the region were some 2,000 directly employed with an additional 2,000 indirectly supported.  Of those directly employed, some 1,200 were in peat harvesting.  Approximately 1,000 of the total directly employed were employed within County Offaly.</p> <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na opened its voluntary redundancy programme in October 2018 and close to 500 people will have exited by the end of 2019.</p><p>We are a large employer in a rural region and the closure of 21 bogs in that region is deeply felt directly and indirectly.<br/><br/>In October, Bord na M&oacute;na brought forward to 2025 its plans to cease peat harvesting and recently reopened its voluntary redundancy programme.  Following last Friday's announcement of the closure of two power stations in the midlands at the end of 2020, it is reasonable to assume the 2025 date may be brought forward again.<br/><br/>Since its establishment, the regional transition team has worked in four areas.  These are securing special status and designation for Offaly and the midlands region and related funding opportunities, addressing the needs of those offered redundancy and emerging employment opportunities, assess the emerging property and land opportunities that might arise and marketing the region.<br/><br/>Key highlights and achievements in these areas include the acceptance of the midlands into the EU coal regions in transition platform.  This will enable the midlands region to avail of the support of a dedicated country team.  Technical assistance will be provided under the secretariat's technical assistance to regions in transition, START, programme, with site visits by experts confirmed for December.  An holistic plan for just transition for the midlands region will be developed to provide a blueprint for the impacted communities.  Another highlight is the recent budget announcement of the midlands just transition fund and midlands deep retrofit programme.  We welcome both of these announcements.  We have also engaged with NESC, which Ms Duffy mentioned earlier.  This engagement has been on the development of a framework for action on transitioning to a low-carbon digital future.  Numerous clinics have been held in bog communities to assist those employees impacted by the decarbonisation agenda.  A skills, education and jobs fair and idea generation boot camp was held in May in the Mount Lucas training centre.  This was very well attended.  It targeted casual, seasonal and those full-time Bord na M&oacute;na employees exiting under the voluntary redundancy scheme.  There was a sectoral focus on manufacturing and construction.  It was in partnership with Bord na M&oacute;na, the Construction Industry Federation, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the local enterprise offices throughout the region, the regional skills forum and the education and training boards.<br/><br/>We have also seen the implementation of the explore initiative for former Bord na M&oacute;na staff, which is a programme designed to upskill older employees in manufacturing in areas such as digital skills, personal development and preparation for change.  The programme was delivered by the education and training boards following a funding application by the regional skills forum.  It was very well received by the participants.<br/><br/>Athlone Institute of Technology and the regional skills forum have been delivering Springboard+ for skills to advance programmes for those leaving Bord na M&oacute;na through voluntary redundancy.  The education and training boards have developed bespoke courses on skills for those accepting voluntary redundancy.  The education and training boards and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection are undertaking on-site skills audits in Blackwater and Mount Dillon with a view to developing bespoke training courses for destination employment sectors.  The education and training boards are developing bespoke courses for the nearly zero energy building standard and the deep retrofit programme.<br/><br/>Bord na M&oacute;na and Offaly County Council are undertaking a scoping report to examine the possible expansion of the Bord na M&oacute;na<b></b>discovery park into an ecotourism destination of national and international significance.  We are striving to position the midlands as the low-carbon region of Ireland, retaining its association with energy generation, transitioning to cleaner forms of energy, such as the Lumcloon energy battery energy storage system, the first of its kind in Ireland on a commercial basis.  A sod turning event was held in September.  There is also the development of Portlaoise as a national low-carbon town model.<br/><br/>A national conference on creating business opportunities from climate change was held on October 9.  This is another initiative of the regional transition team.  It engaged with the climate action regional office and examined international trends and demonstrated how responses to climate change by business, including within communities, can effectively drive innovation and the adoption of disruptive technologies and can embrace more flexible work practices.  There was a panel of expert speakers and the keynote speaker was Dr. Tara Shine.<br/><br/>A midlands network of co-working facilities has recently been established, comprising more than 20 facilities that can provide flexible working solutions.  It is exploring opportunities to provide additional enterprise space in impacted bog communities as facilities become vacant.  This is delivering on the midlands regional enterprise plan and contributes to Enterprise Ireland's powering the regions policy to provide 600 spaces in the midlands region.<br/><br/>The regional transition team welcomes the Government&rsquo;s commitment to provide a just transition fund of &euro;11 million, including the &euro;5 million pledged by the ESB.  This is targeted at the midlands to support retraining, reskill workers and assist local communities and businesses in the low carbon transition.  It also welcomes the additional &euro;5 million for the National Parks and Wildlife Service for bog rehabilitation and the &euro;20 million midlands deep retrofit housing programme.  We look forward to receiving more details about these initiatives in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>We welcome the appointment of the first just transition commissioner, Dr. Kieran Mulvey, and we look forward to developing a framework for the region to support our citizens and develop new employment opportunities for the workers impacted by the acceleration of decarbonisation, thereby ensuring a just transition, while also sustaining our rural communities.<br/><br/>In recent years, under the Action Plan for Jobs the midlands experienced employment growth.  These hard-earned gains are now under threat.  The measures announced in the budget must be supported and reinforced in the years ahead and we as a region ask that the unique challenge faced by the midlands in transitioning to a low-carbon economy is very much to the fore as negotiations commence on the EU budget post 2020.</p></speech>

We have a specific regional enterprise plan and a steering committee involving all of the stakeholders, including enterprise, wider society, local authorities and education and training boards.  They have been asked to put specific focus on the transition and what issues are arising for businesses as well as communities.  The Minister has met the chair of the regional enterprise plan, Dr. Anne Cusack, and they have had specific discussions on what additional initiatives can be taken.  We are also engaged with the transition team.</p> <p>  Enterprise Ireland is actively engaged with Bord na M&oacute;na on assessing areas of opportunities for new business.  Some of them are set out in the regional enterprise plan.  We had already been considering them.  It is not as if this has come as a shock and this could be seen in the strategy earlier in the year.  This is stepping up some of that engagement.  Particularly in terms of engagement with Bord na M&oacute;na, there was a meeting on 23 October between Enterprise Ireland and the senior management team looking at a range of opportunities.</p><p>Some of them are set out around the aquaculture side, herb development and the energy side but also looking at the property portfolio and seeing what opportunities that may give rise to in terms of second sites or for other industries to locate.  It is a similar situation then with the local enterprise offices in terms of seeing what additional measures they can take.  The key thing now is that the skills audit is under way with the education and training boards, and once that is complete, we will then have a sense of the skills that are available in the region, if there is a need for upskilling, if there are entrepreneurial opportunities or opportunities for new business and how effectively we engage with them.</p></speech>

We heard about 400 jobs being created directly and indirectly to retrofit homes in the midlands, starting with social homes.  A total of 100 jobs will be created in the National Parks and Wildlife Service to rehabilitate the bogland.  That is committed funding in budget 2020.  Bord na M&oacute;na will also prioritise job creation.  I mentioned the engagement that has taken place with Enterprise Ireland.  It envisages 100 new direct jobs and 150 indirect jobs involving the development of renewable energy assets by 2023.  There will be 100 new jobs in the new recycling operations and potentially another 150 to 300 new jobs in new green business projects.  Real work is being done in developing opportunities and bringing forward jobs.</p> <p>  I also mentioned the work of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland to ensure we have a spotlight on the midlands and that it is an attractive place to bring investment.  I mentioned the Glanbia investment in Laois, which is an area that had not got significant investment in a long time.  There was an investment of &euro;130 million in a new mozzarella cheese plant last year.  That is a significant investment.</p></speech>

What specific steps has the SEAI taken to ensure the delivery of retrofits for those in social housing and at risk of energy poverty in the first instance?  Could the witnesses provide a high-level breakdown of how the &euro;13 million will be specifically allocated?  What involvement has the SEAI had with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on the delivery of retrofits in the midlands?  When did the discussions commence?</p> <p>  I wish to ask about the 300 loans to households that submitted applications before the deadline for the SEAI's deep retrofit scheme was closed.  How many of the 300 households have had their applications progressed and approved?</p></speech>

In terms of the &euro;13 million in carbon tax, that is being put towards the warmer homes scheme.  It essentially increased the budget that was in place for 2020.  The way the scheme works is that it is demand led and people in fuel poverty apply for it.  We deal with the applications on a first come, first served basis.  It will enable us to do a greater number of homes.  It will get wrapped up in the overall capital budget, which is now at &euro;53 million.  There is no specific target for the &euro;13 million but it will help us do more homes.</p> <p>  Regarding the deep retrofit, I do not have an exact number in terms of householders, but applications from anyone who applied before the cut-off date are being evaluated at the moment.  We are working through providing letters of offer on those.  We have gone back to contractors with some questions as well.  We are working through the process as quickly as we can.</p></speech>

I will concentrate on the midlands regional transition team as I am a Westmeath man myself.  While there were plans and the team was working towards 2027, as such, since Friday the date is 2020.  What initial communications have the witnesses had from the Departments with regard to funding and changing the outlook?</p> <p>  I would like to hear more from Laois and Offaly Education and Training Board about training.  It was mentioned that people who are taking redundancy and who will be unemployed are being put forward for courses.  I would like to hear about the age profile of the people the ETB is dealing with, the existing skills they have, and what kind of programmes are envisaged.  The commentary suggests that everybody will walk out the gate of Bord na M&oacute;na and start retrofitting houses.  For someone to retrofit a house at the moment, he or she must be on the approved contractor list.  It is not as if it is going to be that easy.  I would also like to hear the ETB's opinion on the kind of supports that will be available locally, apart from training individuals or re-employing them, for small and medium-sized businesses that have been supplying Bord na M&oacute;na or the ESB.  In one conversation I had, somebody mentioned the caterers in Shannonbridge and the people who are supplying them.  That is a stand-alone business that will take a serious hit.  They are not going to go for retraining.  What funds or facilities have been put at the disposal of the ETB to support people like that?  The witnesses can answer the questions all together.</p> <p>  From an Offaly perspective, we hear about the funding and the &euro;11 million that has been put in.  The ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na are possibly the two biggest ratepayers to Offaly County Council.  When one takes one from the other or adds one to the other, how is the council fixed financially?  It is great to hear about all the money it is getting, but what will it lose when it balances its books at the end of the year?  Will it be able to fund the personnel, facilities and programmes it needs to carry out?</p> <p>  The witnesses can answer this as briefly as possible.  We are all aware in the midlands, Westmeath, Longford, Offaly and Laois that the majority of people in Bord na M&oacute;na were seasonal workers who were farmers.  They worked part time in Bord na M&oacute;na and they were part-time farmers.  One income supplemented, more so than complemented, the other.  What interaction has there been with the farm agencies?  We all know the situation with farming.  That is for a different committee and I will not go into it now, but there are people who are facing a double whammy who are possibly not employable on a full-time basis because of that situation.  How will that scenario be addressed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.38" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anna Marie Delaney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019111300002#G01600"><p>On the announcement last Friday about 2020, we had expected that there would be a 15-year transition period and we were talking about 2030 initially.  Peat harvesting is finishing now at the end of 2020, so we really have 13 months to try to transition, and that is a challenge.  It is to be hoped the Government funding supports that have been put in place under budget 2020 and the just transition fund will provide some of the supports to the SMEs that will assist with the transition period that we have.</p> <p>  Regarding the supports to business itself, our local enterprise offices are engaging with the various agencies about community supports.  In addition, in terms of job creation opportunities, the local authority would be facilitating that role through our local enterprise offices across the region.  All of them are engaged in it, as well as the business support units that we have and also through our local development companies to try to develop social enterprise in some of those areas.  We would expect that the just transition fund would assist with a number of the supports and that the just transition commissioner would assist and engage with us on how that might be rolled out and how it might work.  We are waiting to get some details on that.  The commissioner was just announced on Friday.  We have invited him to our next meeting of the transition team.</p> <p>  With regard to the rates base for the local authorities, it is a very significant hit for both Offaly and Longford county councils.</p><p> The Shannonbridge station pays Offaly County Council &euro;2.8 million per annum in rates.  The loss of that will be a significant hit to the services and supports in the area.  We will engage with the commissioner and the Department about the supports and resources that may need to be put in place.  The Lough Ree station in Lanesborough is worth &euro;1.2 million in rates to Longford County Council.  Losing that will also be a significant hit to the council's books.  We will engage in the same process there and through the transition team.  I will now ask Mr. Boland to comment on training and reskilling.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.40" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Padraig Boland" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2019111300002#H00200"><p>On training and the skills base, we have been engaging with Bord na M&oacute;na workers via workshop information and advice clinics.  We started these last February when news of the strategy to 2028 first broke.  Those workshops and clinics are ongoing.  Th process has been ratcheted up a bit.  This week, for example, the education and training boards, ETBs, are in Mount Dillion.  These are the Galway-Roscommon ETB, the Laois-Offaly ETB and the Longford-Westmeath ETB, along with our colleagues from Athlone Institute of Technology and the regional skills forum.  The ETBs are taking the lead in each case.  We have been advising people broadly and we are trying to get engagement.</p> <p>  We are cognisant that many of these workers have been out of an education or training setting for a long time.  We need to help them identify the skills they may have gained over the years.  Many may have got jobs with Bord na M&oacute;na straight from school.  While thinking they had jobs for life, they now have this foisted upon them.  I am thinking in particular of last Friday when we happened to be in Blackwater when, unfortunately, the news broke about Shannonbridge.  These workers have had to deal with the shock element.  We have engaged experts in career guidance.  We are looking to perform skills audits of those workers and carry out a training needs analysis for how to develop career pathways.  These are new, bespoke programmes and are additional to those accommodating the 11,000 learners we have in the further education and training sector in Laois and Offaly.  These Bord na M&oacute;na workers are not the 1,000 people we have already moved directly into employment from our other employment engagement programmes in the last year in Laois and Offaly.  This is in addition to that.</p> <p>  Two programmes are funded by SOLAS nationally.  The Skills to Advance programme is primarily focused on upskilling employees who are already in a workforce.  The other programme involves traineeships that can be developed.  It is based on the apprenticeship model, alternance training and work placement.  It is a flexible approach to upskilling people.  This can be focused at employed and unemployed people.</p> <p>  It is a little premature to answer the Senator's question without the skills audit being completed.  We have been looking for this for a long time.  It started with the workers in Mount Dillion on Monday.  All of the ETBs have had staff in Mount Dillion for the week.  They will then move to Blackwater on Monday next and we will start there.  When we have the skills audit we will marry it with a study of the skills gaps - as undertaken by Mr. John Costello and the regional skills forum - and then work with the rest of the transition team.  There will be bespoke training programmes.</p></speech>

I have a few questions, the first of which is for Mr. Hughes.  How does he see the interplay between the objectives of a just transition and balanced regional development, especially with regard to Project Ireland 2040?  This is in the context of the regional enterprise strategies where we are trying to drive investment and growth into the regions and out of the bigger urban centres.</p> <p>  I will now go through the other questions, which are related.  With regard to policy around data centres, I am aware there are energy guzzlers.  Does the Department have any green energy requirements for data centres that IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland or whoever might support?  This is aside from the commitments to green energy for data centres and declarations made publicly by some of the tech companies.  Is there a policy to drive the development of data centres outside the greater Dublin area?  How is the Department getting on with that?  What is IDA Ireland actively doing in this regard?  What are the successes in this area?  It is an issue I am familiar with and I will give an example.  In north Mayo the former Asahi site has had planning permission, granted for a several years, for a data centre.  A high-speed fibre technology cable is coming from North America to there.  It is a break-out point and there is a planning application for a combined heat and power high-efficiency biomass plant.  Yet, they cannot seem to get a data centre there.  It is a brownfield site and appears to tick all the boxes, but nothing has happened.  It is a puzzle as to why this is the case.  What are the Department and its agencies doing about this? </p></speech>

At the heart of the regional enterprise plan for 2020 is just transition and responding to challenges and opportunities relating to climate change.  It is also at the heart of our national enterprise policy and is one of the key pillars of our future jobs strategy for the next five to ten years in repositioning the economy.  We are approaching full employment but we are very conscious that, in the context of those jobs, we need businesses to be resilient and workers that are resilient.  We have to respond to the opportunities that are there in the context of moving from brown to green and encouraging sustainable development.</p> <p>  Our enterprise agencies are very focused on the opportunities around new sectors and new areas of activity be they in engineering or food production.  We have a specific target to reduce carbon emissions in the food sector by 10% to 15% over the period to 2030 and we will work on that.  A key part of this will be working to ensure that we sustain jobs in the regions and that we upskill the workers in the regions and therefore we have the regional enterprise development fund.  This &euro;60 million regional fund supports bottom-up projects and collaborative projects across the regions, with a minimum allocation of &euro;2 million for each region.  As already stated, this has been successful as part of Project Ireland 2040.  It is a new initiative but it sits alongside the Project Ireland 2040 rural funds and the urban development funds.  The climate action fund is also part of that.  There is a joined-up approach with the regional enterprise plans in networking with the transition team in the midlands and ensuring we can achieve balanced regional development, as referred to by the Senator.  It is also about ensuring that every region achieves its potential. This means we must have significant investment into the regions, property programmes for IDA Ireland with additional site visits, and work with the institutes of technology and the universities in the regions to ensure there are attractive places to live and work as well as having property solutions.</p> <p>  In addition to regional enterprise funds, we have had a call from the LEOs for capacity-building at local level.  This is additional funding.  Of the &euro;2.5 million that was competitively offered across the LEOs in the autumn, the midlands won &euro;750,000, which is nearly 30%.  One project in particular, Going Green, was awarded &euro;220,000 to educate, advise and support small businesses in the midlands region in their adoption of environmentally positive actions and helping their move to improving their green credentials.  There was also a project on ingenuity engineering.  A third project awarded funding in the initiative was specifically around increasing the number of first-time exporters from the region.  Key to ensuring the sustainability and resilience of businesses is that they diversify their markets and look at new opportunities, and internationally especially.  That project was awarded &euro;150,000.  As in other regions, it will bring on new exporters.</p> <p>  Project Ireland 2040, together with the regional enterprise plans are very aligned in their funding and capacity building capability.  Through the regional enterprise plans at local level the agencies such as IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs are working with the local authorities.  Those initiatives are led by industry champions.  It is very much attuned to the business view on what the opportunities are and realising those.</p> <p>  On data centres, we did work with the Department of the Taoiseach and in July 2018 there was a Government statement on the role of data centres in Ireland's enterprise strategy.</p><p>This set out clearly the focus on looking for locations outside of Dublin and on aligning those with locations that have energy and connectivity infrastructure, specifically, as the Deputy mentioned, high-speed data lines and telecommunications capacity.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are continuously engaging with investors to see where there may be opportunities.  I do not have the detail on the specific site the Deputy mentioned.</p></speech>

We will certainly be happy to engage with the Senator on the matter.</p> <p>  We know from all of our engagements through Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, as well as directly, that data centre owners and operators are very focused on the use and development of renewable energy sources.  In some cases, they are investing significantly in renewable energy sources to improve their green credentials.  It is also an important part of our own grid development and ensuring we have usage for electricity from renewable sources at off-peak times.  There are other technologies that can be used.  A mix of solar, battery and other technologies will optimise our grid.</p> <p>  IDA Ireland also works with clients seeking to support an increase in renewable and green activity.  Its Go Green initiative includes data centres to enable them to improve their green credentials and investments.  Many multinationals are at advanced stages of investing in energy efficient data management and optimising their own systems.</p> <p>  From an Enterprise Ireland perspective, a key focus of its involvement with large companies is energy investment and energy efficiency retrofitting in many cases, whether it is combined heat and power, CHP, or other forms of energy usage.  That is what the market and consumers are demanding and we are very much behind that.  If we can support that investment, particularly in major employers in the regions, that will improve their competitiveness and sustainability in the long term to sustain jobs in the regions, particularly in the food and drinks sector, a key employer in rural and regional locations.</p></speech>

Anderson Ireland in Rathkeale, where I am from, closed in 2014, and ProCad, a design company, has moved in to the area since then.  Many of the workers in Anderson Ireland have retrained and found employment, which is very welcome.</p> <p>  Has any sort of analysis been done on the demographic of workers who may be affected by this?  This goes back to something that I champion, having a background in recruitment.  I refer to people trying to find sustainable employment after losing their jobs or being out of work for ten, 15 or 20 years.  They may be trained in different skills but it can be difficult finding a job, particularly for those aged between 50 and 55.  They often experience covert discrimination when looking for work.  Has the Department looked at ways to combat that, with specific emphasis on traditional industries where people may be in jobs or roles for a large part of their career, through no fault of their own.  They face difficulties afterwards and I know from my experience in recruitment that the problem is rife.</p></speech>

In other contexts, not just in this context, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is very much at the centre of the considerations of the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Education and Skills.  The Department of Education and Skills has responsibility for liaising with the EU and has well established processes for drawing down funds from and engaging with the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.  We understand that the Department is progressing the matter in this case.  This would provide support for training.  It is also some advantages with regard to the types of training that can be funded, the allowances, etc.  I do not think there will be any particular issue in ensuring that is available.  It is part of the suite of supports that is being considered.</p> <p>  To respond to the Deputy's point about workers, the key concern is around demographics and skills.  There are some headline figures on the skills and age profile of the different cohorts.  Mr. Boland mentioned the work being done by the education and training boards, where they meet the affected workers and engage with them on their age profiles, skills, the areas in which they have been involved and their experience.  Not everything comes down to a specific qualification.  Somebody who has spent 15, 20, 30 or 40 years in an employment may have a key set of skills.  Our agencies make an input into the regional skills forum, which is also led by the Department of Educational and Skills, by identifying where the jobs, skill needs and opportunities are and providing information on the supply side.</p> <p>  Obviously, the workers affected by the decisions by Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB will form part of that assessment to identify if there are opportunities available for them across a range of sectors.  Some of the 1,050 job opportunities announced on Monday, whether in retrofitting bogs or other areas, will have certain skill demands.  Some of the investments on the construction side will also have demand for certain skills.  In two or three weeks, the work of the education and training board will be complete and this will feed into the assessment by the agencies with the regional skills group.  From there, we will be able to see what additional retraining is needed.</p></speech>

Have the training bodies done any studies on how to help people diversify their skills?  I have in mind people who were used to doing the same type of work and are not academically focused.  Has work been done on transitioning people from physical work to more intellectual-type roles, for want of a better term?</p></speech>

We are discussing a redundancy scheme here.  The first group who applied for the voluntary redundancy scheme were in the older age cohort.  We have been exploring areas that might enhance the quality of life of individuals.  This can involve looking at part-time employment options in healthcare and social care that they may not have considered previously and where they have garnered skills.  Much of this is done through engagement and sitting down with people to talk through and identify skills they may not realise they have.  Some of those skills may have been attained through voluntary or other work.  Many may feel they cannot take up employment or may not be offered employment in the areas in which they have traditionally worked.  We are trying to transition that.  It is a slow and ongoing process.</p></speech>

This is a very important subject.  As the CEO of the county council, Ms Delaney, said, 15 years have been being compressed into a few years and we are racing to catch up.</p> <p>  I will keep my questions short and I ask the witnesses to keep their replies short because time is limited.  Funding of &euro;20 million has been announced for retrofitting.  Will Mr. Scheer indicate the potential number of retrofits that may be needed in the four midland counties?</p><p>My other question also relates to retrofitting and is for the ETB.  The skilled labour required for retrofitting includes plasterers, plumbers, electricians, window fitters and so on.  What survey has been done to assess that?  Is the ETB planning on running short courses or apprenticeships since, for instance, plumbers are trained over four years, as are plasterers?</p></speech>

As far as drilling those numbers down regionally, I do not have those numbers to hand but they can be estimated.  The SEAI launched a building energy rating map recently that shows at small area level, that is, groups of 50 to 100 homes around the country, the distribution of the building energy ratings from A to G for each of the small area codes.  That could be used to build up a picture of the quality of the building stock by region.  We could provide that to the committee if we are specifically requested to do so.  We also have details of where the grants are being drawn down by county, and they are available.</p></speech>

That agreement has been put in place.  The Deputy is correct in identifying that the multiplicity of skill sets required needs a level of craftsmanship that would require a four-year apprenticeship.  Bord na M&oacute;na would have some employees who are fully qualified craftpersons.  There is an initial NZEB training centre in Ireland with Waterford and Wexford ETB in a training facility in Enniscorthy.  We will replicate that.  Those programmes are primarily upskilling current craftspeople, such as plumbers, electricians etc., to bring a building to NZEB standard.  One element of it is for general operatives, which might be suitable to those who do not have the full craft.</p> <p>  Another area that we are looking at and on which we have engaged with Waterford and Wexford ETB, SOLAS and external expertise is the development of a programme that would give a qualification to people to undertake the work to deep retrofit and looking at a programme that would be bespoke to the housing stock in the midlands.  That is only in its very early stages.</p></speech>

A sum of &euro;20 million was announced for it this week.  I calculate that at &euro;40,000 per house, and it could cost much more for some houses, it would deep retrofit 500 homes.  Will the SEAI comment on that?</p> <p>  I am glad to hear that Mount Lucas will be the centre of the universe and Laois and Offaly ETB is in the middle of it.  It has done a lot of work with training and upskilling people.</p> <p>  Ms Delaney from the county council might answer my next question on the rewetting of bogs.  The carbon sinks are an important use.  We must regenerate those carbon sinks and rewet the bogs.  Is the council looking at any other use?  There can only be so many Lough Booras and tourist attractions, and I have been down to Lough Boora several times.  Is there any other purpose for those bogs, economic or otherwise?</p> <p>  Another question for Ms Delaney relates to Laois and Coolnamona.  There has been no just transition whatever in Laois.  I do not know if anyone from Laois is on the transition team.  I worked on it, and there were up to 300 of us there at one time.  We knew it would come to an end some day, and that has accelerated, but there are still workers there, and many have lost their jobs in recent years.  Will Coolnamona be included?</p> <p>  We have argued for years that we need to create a biomass supply chain.  Even if only Edenderry is left, although I think the other two power stations should be left standing and brought back into use for 100% biomass, because when there is no sun shining and no wind blowing, we will need dispatchable power, as we cannot just rely on nuclear power from England the whole time, are there any moves afoot to put in place a substantial supply chain of biomass?</p></speech>

We are working with the Department on the high-level task force that will determine the eventual design of that scheme and how exactly it will be rolled out.  That is not yet finalised.  The Deputy's estimates on the basis of a deep retrofit, which we would consider bringing a house into the A range, are not necessarily the target for that scheme.  It is set in line with the current 2030 target for the 500,000 homes to a B2 or cost-optimal level.  Our modelling suggests that those homes do not cost into the &euro;40,000 to &euro;60,000 range but are more in the &euro;20,000 to &euro;25,000 for an upgrade.</p></speech>

There is also discussion on how to best leverage that money in terms of the aggregation model.  It is hoped that we would achieve some economies of scale by that direct targeting in local areas and building up the numbers.  Where the money is spent, private homes would be invited into that model.  They could also leverage funds through the SEAI grant programmes, which would build a bigger pot of homes to be done.  All those issues are being fleshed out now.</p></speech>

It has mentioned it as one of the possibilities of some of its boglands.  We have engaged with Bord na M&oacute;na on the new business opportunities and the alternative uses for the landbanks and the vacant workshops.  Mr. Hughes also mentioned IDA Ireland advising on those.  The holistic programme that is to be prepared under the EU STARTS programme is also given the remit of exploring alternative uses for landbanks and the vacant workshops for community gain.  That would not just be tourism opportunities but might also be enterprise hubs and similar initiatives.</p> <p>  On biomass, An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision really impacts this.  Edenderry is co-fired by peat and biomass and has permission for this until the end of 2023.  After that the options will have to be considered.  Bord na M&oacute;na is exploring new opportunities in relation to various pilot programmes, such as aquaculture, birch water harvesting, herb farming programmes, and renewables.  It will be coming before the committee next week and may address some of those issues in more detail.  We do engage with Bord na M&oacute;na very significantly on landbanks and its various initiatives, and some of those pilots are based at Mount Lucas.</p></speech>

Approximately 1,000 are at risk at Bord na M&oacute;na, and while we know about them, there are many more.  Mr. Hughes might send us a note on what work is being done to estimate the scale of the challenge.  Once we understand the scale of the challenge, we can hold to account the Department and others in respect of the responses put in place.  We will need a bit more than what we have heard today from Mr. Hughes on the scale of the challenge.  We will need hard facts, for both the public and private sectors, on what jobs are at risk and the level of transition that will need to happen.</p></speech>

I should say, however, that a range of work has previously been done on the green economy.  The expert group has examined the matter and a number of reports over the years have continually quantified the sectors and jobs at risk.  The agencies and others have stepped in to ensure that the investment will be made to support the jobs and help the sectors with the transition.</p> <p>  There are always jobs at risk.  The food and drink industry, for example, is under continuous pressure in respect of sustainability credentials and so on, and it is now making those investments.  In the dairy processing sector, &euro;800 million was invested last year to protect and grow jobs.  Much of that investment is to enhance energy efficiency and productivity.  We continually focus on such jobs, and in the context of full employment, that has to be the main focus.  Between 5% and 10% of jobs will probably always be at risk.  It can be seen in the case of our enterprise agencies.  There is a continual churn and we continually work with affected sectors-----</p></speech>

Mr. Hughes responded to Deputy Stanley on the &euro;20 million made available for retrofitting.  Mr. Hughes indicated it would not be the deep retrofit done in previous programmes but rather that approximately 1,000 houses will be done.  He stated the details of the scheme are still being worked out.  Is the retrofit still at concept stage?</p></speech>

It is new.  To date, our schemes have generally been open to all comers from throughout the country.  A number of community grant schemes and so on have taken place in specific areas, but never before has there been a dedicated bucket of money for a specific area.</p></speech>

The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will deliver it through its existing local authority scheme.  That is the mechanism already in place, and the &euro;20 million is an increment of the scheme, which is already doing work in local authorities.</p></speech>

Why then did we have to wait until last Monday for the skills audit to start at Mountdillon?  Mountdillon and Blackwater have been named but when will the audit happen at the 15 other Bord na M&oacute;na sites?  What specific steps are being taken by the SEAI to recruit local retrofit contractors in the midland peat counties, which also include counties Galway and Roscommon, to capitalise on the &euro;20 million retrofit plan?</p></speech>

We were given access for a skills audit from last Monday.  I cannot answer the Deputy's other question.  We have engagement with Bord na M&oacute;na, and the level of access to employees has recently improved dramatically.  Previously, we had access only to those employees who had taken each voluntary redundancy package as it became available.  That previous process is why the audit started only on Monday at Mountdillon.  There is also Derrygreenagh, for example.  Several more sites will come on stream and we will need access to them.</p></speech>

Our role as the national energy agency is to set the standards for retrofits.  We are clear that if a Government grant is taken, the house must be upgraded to a particular standard.  We issued those standards and maintain a list of registered installers, as has been mentioned.  We also set the qualification levels for the skills and have a list on our website of accredited training bodies throughout the country.  I do not know whether any of the training bodies are in the areas the Deputy mentioned, although there is a list on our website.</p></speech>

I attended a briefing this morning at the Nevin Economic Research Institute.  It was pointed out that the midlands is in a poor position to adopt private capital and that it has the lowest rate of foreign direct investment in the country.  A strong case was made for the State to take the initiative to mobilise public intervention and public investment in areas such as the midlands.  Does Mr. Hughes agree with that conclusion?</p></speech>

We are conscious of the need for asymmetric or special support for regions that were lacking, not least in the case of the midlands.  In recent years, there has been a specific focus on additional investment.  For example, in the midlands, there have been advanced technology construction and investment in Athlone, through the IDA property programme-----</p></speech>

It jumped out at me that he stated there are big data opportunities.  I do not know whether he watched Philip Boucher-Hayes's report last night on the plan to create multiple data centres in various parts of the country and the fact that they will eventually use one third of all our electricity needs.

The Department of Education and Skills is the liaison and co-ordination body in Ireland.  It works closely with us and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on capturing the data on those who are impacted by job losses, redundancies or structural changes.  What we are discussing is obviously a significant structural change for the people affected.  Their training needs can be tracked and supported.  The Department of Education and Skills, which is the training provider through the ETBs, compiles the submission.  Someone has to be responsible, but it is not that Department on its own.

Our involvement is as part of a high-level housing retrofit task force convened by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is also on, to add our expertise on how that might be delivered.  I understand that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government already has a &euro;30 million fund for upgrading local authority housing.  It will be augmented by the &euro;20 million.  The energy parts of the upgrades that are occurring through that scheme will be enhanced to the B2 level.</p></speech>

I have many problems with the way people are supported.  There are many sick, old and needy people who do not fall under the SEAI's remit.</p> <p>  My final question is for the midlands regional transition team.  Its delegates referred to addressing the needs of those offered redundancy and emerging employment opportunities.  How many of those made redundant have come to the delegates' organisations and how many have they dealt with?  Is it the majority of those affected, all of them or half?  The delegates also mentioned that, in the beginning, older workers were receiving access to the voluntary redundancy scheme.  Does that mean that they have not been able to access it recently?  The evidence I have is that workers of more than 61 or 62 years of age are not being allowed into the scheme because Bord na M&oacute;na can hold onto them for the few years they have left instead of paying them redundancy.</p> <p>  I would like the delegates to comment on something else that was mentioned this morning.  In highlighting the nature of employment that has followed on from the cessation of peat production, the Littleton briquette factory in Tipperary was used as an example.  It is instructive.  Following the loss of 124 Bord na M&oacute;na jobs in Littleton, the factory is now a plastic recycling plant staffed by workers on one-year contracts earning barely more than the minimum wage.  Would the delegates like to comment on that?  Do they view that as the future for Bord na M&oacute;na workers in the best possible sense?  They have jobs, but they certainly have nothing like the terms and conditions that they enjoyed previously or from which their communities have thrived.</p></speech>

No one came to us - we went out to the workshops.  In most cases, 80% plus of workers who have taken the voluntary redundancy package participate in our programmes.  I have not heard the narrative of older people no longer being given redundancy, but it is not borne out by what we are meeting on the ground.  We had 95 people last Friday morning in Blackwater and a further 45 in the afternoon.  The age profile was varied and included many older people.</p></speech>

As a recent member of Offaly County Council, this was an issue that we discussed inside and outside the chamber.  I live in north Offaly, which is very much in the heartland of these issues.  The job losses from the peat and energy generation sectors are catastrophic for the area.  If similar levels of jobs were to be lost in a tech centre in Dublin, the country would be in meltdown.  Unfortunately, I do not get that sense of urgency generally about these losses.</p> <p>  While the figures on job creation in the midlands over the past decade have been positive, I would argue that some parts of Offaly and the wider midlands never came out of the recession.  The exodus of commuters from towns like Edenderry and Portarlington is vast.  They are all travelling to Dublin for their jobs.  The midlands face unique challenges, but we must look to and learn from the countries and regions that have transitioned successfully.  We must also learn from the mistakes of other areas that have not done this well.</p><p>We obviously really need to fast-track this.  We are down to months and years at this stage.  If we do not get this right, we are going to run the risk of turning the midlands into the rust belt of Ireland.  I would like to address a couple of questions to the midlands transition team, probably to Ms Delaney.  Does she feel that the challenges faced with adopting a just transition from a local authority perspective would be facilitated in some way with some local government reform?  As Ms Delaney will be well aware, we are one of the most poorly funded and supported local governments in Europe.  If so, what provisions does she think should be put in place or what type of reform would she consider necessary?  It may have been answered already and apologies if it has, but I would be interested to know the age profile across the board for the Bord na M&oacute;na and ESB workers and also the age profile of the 500 people who will have exited by 2019 through the voluntary redundancy option since 2018.  </p><p> I never get a figure from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation of the number of jobs created from aquaculture and herbs and all of these developments within the Bord na M&oacute;na lands at present.  If the Department could provide that that would be great.  Also, have there been any discussions within the Department regarding the cessation of peat extraction for horticultural purposes?  That is a vast amount which has an environmental impact both in terms of peat and carbon loss.  </p></speech>

We are in discussions with some of them through Enterprise Ireland on how they can be taken forward, so there are some interesting proposals.  One will see them in the plan there around acquaculture and herbs and the energy park and I know they are looking at some other ones as well.  They have a very good asset base, and the issue is how we can develop products which would meet markets.  Certainly there is demand for some of those products and, climatically, we are good in terms of potential for growing them as well and we have that asset base.</p> <p>  On the more general issues around the horticultural extraction, I do not have the detail on that but I would say more generally there are always opportunities.  If there are opportunities for alternative uses or alternative products etc., Enterprise Ireland, EI, and the local enterprise offices are available to work with entrepreneurs locally.  It is something EI will be working with, similarly through the Education and Training Boards, ETBs, with individuals to see if are there business opportunities which they might take forward if they were replacing existing products or developing new products.</p></speech>

That is to provide hot-desking to enable one or two days a week working within the local region for people who might be commuting; it is an opportunity and we are linking in with a number of companies in Dublin to try to facilitate that process.  The age profile in our experience to date and the information that we have is mixed, but Bord na M&oacute;na might be better placed to give that full information to us.  That is something to perhaps ask them next week as well; that will be a challenge as for the local just transition commissioner and the fund.</p> <p>  On our own financial position and the financial position of a number of counties in the midlands region, I would recommend a review of the local government reforms for finance.  We have not had an increase in the Local Government Fund since 2014.  The impact of the rates base there and the hit from the Shannonbridge closure will certainly warrant a full review of the services within our own local authority area.  We would be engaging with the Department and the just transition commissioner on the supply of resources and supports to the area.  In the midlands region, the local authorities are all represented including Roscommon and Kildare.  It is not just the midlands counties that are represented on the regional transition team.  We have expanded to the other areas as well.  The agencies have been working very significantly on reskilling and retraining together with Athlone IT, the regional skills forum and the ETBs across the region.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has also been very engaged on outreach to workers on reskilling and retraining and have provided tremendous support across the board.</p></speech>

Did anyone see the presentation made about that?  An academic from UCD, Dr. Florence Renou-Wilson made, to my mind, a brilliant, really significant submission showing that peatland emissions account for 11 million tonnes, which is the equivalent of our entire energy emissions.  I do not know if anyone saw the RT&Eacute; programme, "Hot Air", last night.  I thought it was really good.  When they were doing this calculation figure, 60 million tonnes, horticulture peat extraction and industrial peat extraction accounts for 5 million tonnes, and I just put it to the committee that it seems to me that we should be really honest with communities here that the likelihood of horticultural peat extraction continuing is very slim, and Dr. Renou-Wilson from UCD when asked for advice said it was clear we will be stopping all peat extraction.  Has anyone countenanced that within the work that is going on?</p></speech>

I am of this community as well as working with the community.  A just transition that focuses solely on the employees is missing missing a lot in terms of the sustainability of rural communities and being honest with these communities as they face the future.  One of the difficulties for rural communities, including the employees, is that this has been a long, drawn-out process.  It is currently in the name of climate change, but this started in 1999 with the loss of a cooling tower in the ESB in Ferbane, and the redirection of Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB at that stage.  I would welcome an honest approach being taken with the communities.  They need and deserve honesty.  What is happening at the moment is probably neither just nor a transition.  If we are going to get there, I would welcome that.  If that is the future the communities of the midlands face, they deserve to know it and we need to be prepared to plan that future with them.</p></speech>

It is estimated there are 20,000 jobs in retrofitting.  I think there will be a similar number of jobs in re-wetting bogs, which Bord na M&oacute;na workers have real skills in.  There may be a similar number of jobs in forestry.  Going back to what I was saying earlier on, we are doing none of the training for this.  We have none of the apprenticeships and none of the institutes of technology is doing it.  We have only one forestry class coming out.  There are no apprenticeships coming in the craft of retrofitting.</p><p>I was thrilled to hear about the one in Wexford.  </p><p> On the basis of being upfront and straight, it is clear from the recent court case that there is no legal planning permission for any industrial peat extraction.  The application to have industrial peat extraction made exempt was turned down by the courts.  All of the existing industrial peat extraction is illegal and could end tomorrow.  On the need for scale and an urgent response, we should let people know that what is taking place is not legal and could legally be stopped at any moment.  We need to ramp up our engagement with the communities on that scale of challenge.</p></speech>

By way of background, the Department has provided lots of detail on what appears to be many successful employment initiatives and start-ups in the midlands.  It is sobering to recall that the unemployment rate in 2015 was 14.9%, whereas it now stands at 6.6%.  I know from my constituency in Donegal that one of the main factors in the reduction in employment was emigration.</p> <p>  Can the witnesses provide statistics on how many of the 19,500 jobs that have been created are based in the midlands, how many have been taken up by long-term unemployed people in the midlands and how many people have emigrated from the region since 2015?  As has been said, people are in work but they may be working in Dublin and Galway.  I am interested in finding out those figures.</p> <p>  Mr. Hughes stated that the midlands plan sets out seven strategic objectives.  Two of the objectives listed were a transition to a low carbon economy and big data opportunities.  How are those two objectives compatible?

EirGrid estimates that the demand from data centres could account for up to 36% of Ireland's electricity demand by 2030 and 75% of new electricity demand growth.  How are big data opportunities compatible with a low carbon economy?</p> <p>  Does the SEAI have examples of sustainable energy community projects that are located in the midlands?  What lessons can be used to develop such projects as part of the transition?</p></speech>

The transition to the low carbon economy is a huge challenge but also an opportunity given the asset base that the midlands have.  The new opportunities, which we just discussed with Senator Hackett, include the opportunities to reuse Bord na M&oacute;na bogs for an energy park, aquaculture, herb growth, etc.  There are, therefore, tangible opportunities for reuse.</p> <p>  A second opportunity arises from having a low carbon town, namely, Portlaoise, acting as a demonstrator and developing new technologies, including smart technologies, for managing urban areas.  These can then act as demonstrators for others and will, hopefully, stimulate innovation.  Another opportunity is the county climate change adaption plan, which involves local authorities working on resource efficiency and reuse.  As a pillar in its own right, that presents opportunities for developing new jobs and businesses and for transitioning the workers.  Last Monday, Bord na M&oacute;na issued a statement on what it considers to be opportunities to create about 500 new jobs.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about leveraging opportunities in big data and data analytics.  That is really saying we should position the region for the future.  A key part of that is investing in research, science and e-hubs in the region so as to create jobs for people who, as the Deputy noted, live in the region but may commute to jobs in Galway or Dublin.  Could we get these people to come back?  Are there opportunities in those areas and in developing the talent pool?  </p></speech>

It is the third action.  As the Deputy will know, data centres have a very strong focus on ensuring that they use and invest in renewable energy.  The Government has produced a statement on the development of data centres.  These centres are a key part of ensuring we can support the 120,000 jobs in the ICT sector, which comprises software, data management, call centres, etc.  The sector needs server farms or data centres.</p></speech>

That also applies to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Data centres are an essential part of the digital smart economy.  The key point as regards data centres is to ensure they stick to their own objectives of using and investing in renewable energy and are optimised in terms of the use of that energy.  Ireland is not a bad location for data centres because we have a good, moderate climate which facilitates minimal use of air conditioning.</p></speech>

The very stable energy demand of a data centre is key to securing investment in renewables because it balances the very cyclical nature of households and everyday demand.  It makes Ireland more attractive in terms of investment in renewables because there is a guaranteed demand.  Regardless of whether it is during the day and we are all busy or whether we are all asleep in bed, there is a steady level of demand.  This means an investor in renewable technology can get a return on their investment on a 24-hour cycle.</p></speech>

All of the other sectors recorded growth in that period, according to the statistics.  I know that growth in the midlands has been hard earned.

There are 320 sustainable energy communities currently being supported by the SEAI.  Any group of people who want to get together and call themselves a community can get training and support from the SEAI.  We can also assign them an expert mentor who can help them to determine an energy master plan for their area and set their own vision for how they want to see the transition happen in their area.  There is a map of those on our website on which members can view the various sustainable energy communities by region, drill into them and get some details about who they are.  Their contact details are available.  I am sure there are some case studies on the web as well.  I will take a look and make sure to send on any that are relevant for that area.</p><p>That is our sustainable energy community model, which aims to help communities learn about and plan for sustainable energy.  Hanging off that, as well as the supports to develop those master plans, we provide approximately &euro;20 million in grants through the better energy communities capital grant scheme.  That involves different agencies aggregating homes, including the fuel poor and the can pay sector, to have their homes upgraded along with other sectors, maybe some local businesses, the local community sports hall or schools.  There have been between 300 and 400.  I do not have the exact number.  I will send on the kind of progression with the number of projects that have been supported through that scheme.  I imagine there are a couple of case studies coming out of that work as well.  We are monitoring the impacts of those schemes because we certainly feel that the community-based model is something that is scaleable to the level we need to get to, and the strength of those kinds of grassroots versus house-by-house schemes are the way forward.</p></speech>

Part of that is looking at those who are involved or employed in Bord na M&oacute;na.  The other part is looking at keeping jobs in the locality, because in counties such as Offaly, 93% of our active enterprises have ten or fewer employees.  It is a case of recognising the indigenous and small scale and building our strengths.  We are looking to harness in some way the entrepreneurial flair that existed in Bord na M&oacute;na from the early days when the German and Russian machines came in and had to be modified by men with no education who thought they had little skill, and to build on that entrepreneurial skill and look at enterprise development as a traineeship and a model we could work on.</p> <p>  The other focus is to work with the Department, my colleague, Ms Morgan, the digital hubs, shared working spaces in the midlands, and to look at remote working, with people maybe being able to stay in the midlands.  It is not a case of looking at our local employers taking on one extra employee, which is a 10% increase for them, if that is the rate, but looking at those work placeless companies, as it were, where a person can be working for someone in America or Australia or wherever else and based in the rural communities.  That person would be living in the communities and keeping the schools and shops open.  We are trying that two-pronged approach.</p></speech>

This is important as they can still cause serious problems for broadcasting, editorial and sound staff, even when left in silent mode.  </p> <p>  Today we will have a discussion on the European Union's enlargement strategy from the perspective of candidate and potential candidate countries.  I warmly welcome the ambassador of the Republic of Turkey to Ireland, Mr. Burhan, and Mr. Jasmin Kahil, charg&eacute; d'affaires at the Embassy of the Republic of North Macedonia.  I also welcome the ambassadors and other distinguished guests in the Visitors Gallery.  I hope they will find the meeting beneficial and informative.  I thank Mr. Kahil for taking the time to travel from London to speak to us.</p> <p>  The enlargement stratey encompasses one of the European Union's most important and influential policies.  The European Union started with six member states in 1957.  Today it has 28 member states, at least for the time being.  We, in Ireland, have always been very supportive of enlargement.  Ireland joined the European Union over 45 years ago in 1973.  Membership of the Union has been of enormous benefit to us, both socially and economically, and we would not pull up the ladder behind us.  The opportunity to join the European Union should be open to those countries that meet the membership criteria, although at the same time the Union must be conscious of its capacity.  That is an important point.</p> <p>  I am delighted to have the opportunity to build on the discussions we held last year on the European Union's enlargement strategy and discuss it from the point of view of the two candidate countries with which we were not in a position to engage last year.  The process for joining the European Union is not an easy one; neither is the process for leaving it.  The road to accession is often very bumpy.  As we have seen, it can be fraught with political obstacles.  We genuinely appreciate, therefore, the immense efforts each candidate country has made to meet the European Union's membership criteria and hope they will be rewarded in time.</p> <p>  When it comes to discussing the efforts the Republic of North Macedonia has made, I am sure no country has changed its name in order to travel down this road.</p><p>I was disappointed when the recent European Council was not able to come to an agreed position to move to the next stage of the process with the Republic of North Macedonia.  We are very interested in hearing the delegates' perspectives on the benefits of and challenges in the accession process.  <br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

Following the First World War and the proclamation of the republic in 1923, it chose western Europe as the model for its new secular structure.  Turkey was one of the founding members of the United Nations and is a member of the Council of Europe, NATO and the OECD.<br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  For the sake of brevity, I will move to the background to Turkey's relationship with the European Union.  The Ankara Agreement which constitutes the legal basis of the association between Turkey and the European Union was signed in 1963, but the negotiations had begun in 1959, the year I was born, which means that it has been a one generation journey which is ongoing.  The application for full membership was made in 1987.  The eligibility of Turkey as a full member was accepted by the European Commission in 1989.  It was also endorsed by the then Council.  The customs union was established in 1995</font><b><font color="#2F2F2F">.  </font></b><font color="#2F2F2F">At the Helsinki European Council in December 1999 - a turning point in our relationship - Turkey was officially recognised as a candidate state and a</font><font color="#2F2F2F">ccession negotiations started in October 2005.  Up to today, 16 of the 35 chapters are open, while only one has been temporarily closed.  For the time being, our relations are at a standstill, as defined by the European Union.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  I will now share our views on the enlargement process.  In our meeting today we will also focus on this aspect of our relationship with the European Union.  </font>It is a fact that the European Union has been facing considerable internal and external challenges which are simultaneous and multi-layered.  They include the rise of far right and increased populist policies; economic, financial and social concerns; migration pressures; Brexit and the weakening of transatlantic ties.  In that context, enlargement has been the most valuable asset in the possession of the European Union.  It is clear that if it wants to be an influential actor in the global arena, it needs to keep its doors open.<br/><br/>If the European Union of today, despite the conjunctural challenges it faces, has become a model of integration from the European Steel and Coal Community of 1952, it is thanks solely to the consecutive enlargement waves.  On the other hand, enlargement is also the European Union's greatest soft power tool.  Constantly questioning it jeopardises its anchor role.  Doubts about opening negotiations with the Republic of North Macedonia and Albania raise the issue of reliability of the European Union.  Common regional challenges of the Balkan countries require regional dialogue and co-operation.  Turkey contributes to the development and prosperity of the Balkans.  The Balkan dimension of the European Union&rsquo;s enlargement policy cannot be finalised unless Turkey's accession process is completed.  Considering Turkey as one of the external actors that tries to gain influence in the region is a populistic approach which harms Turkey-EU relations and the interests of the Balkan countries.  During the new Commission&rsquo;s term, we expect the European Union to make enlargement policy a priority.  Keeping a strong membership perspective, with no discrimination among candidates, is crucial.<br/><br/><b></b>I will now share our views on the current state of affairs between Turkey and the European Union,<b></b>on<b></b>the background to which I have provided some information.<font color="#2F2F2F">  Our relationship with the </font>European Union<font color="#2F2F2F"> can be described as a complex, multi-layered and multi-dimensional partnership.  At the time of Turkey's application for membership to the </font>European Union<font color="#2F2F2F"> in 1987, the Turkish Prime Minister, Turgut &Ouml;zal, likened the process to &quot;a long and narrow road&quot;, referring to a famous verse by the folk poet, Ak Veysel.  Time has proved that not only has the road been long, winding and narrow but that it has also been bumpy, as mentioned by the Chairman in his opening remarks, yet each time the relationship showed resilience and we found a way through.  We are again going through a delicate period, but we believe we will be able to find a way through this time too.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  In November last year we had the last high level Turkey-EU political dialogue.  We regret the recent decision by the European Union to suspend it as we believe we have a lot to gain from keeping the channels of communication open to better understand each other's views.  In December last year the Joint Parliamentary Committee also met after more than a three-year break, but we do not know when the next meeting will take place.  In January we had high level dialogue on transport and in February, on the economy.  The Turkey-EU Association Council met in March after a four-year break.  In the last country report on Turkey, published in May, it was confirmed that Turkey had in general reached a good level of alignment in 22 chapters and that there had been progress at various levels in 20 chapters during the past year.  There had been some backsliding in some other chapters.  However, we think that alignment cannot be expected to take place independently of the accession negotiations.  For that reason, we would like to bring to the attention of the committee chapter 22 - judiciary and fundamental rights - and chapter 24 - justice, freedom and security, being the areas most criticised by the European Union, which chapters remain closed, unfortunately.  </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  Our quest to modernise the customs union to include services and agricultural goods - it would be a win-win for the European Union and Turkey - has been obstructed by the Union, mainly for political reasons.  The customs union involves an asymmetric relationship for Turkey, but it has been part of it for the past 20 to 25 years.</font>We need to avoid misperceptions in our relations with the help of proper communication channels.</p><p>Parliamentarian diplomacy is one of them.  The EU should acknowledge the fact that Turkey's accession process is also in the EU's interest.  <br/><br/>Since 15 July 2019, the consecutive conclusions adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council have led to growing resentment in Turkey.  The Council's conclusions regarding our drilling activities in the eastern Mediterranean and Operation Peace Spring are unfair and by no means objective.  Turkey has the resolve to enhance its bilateral relations with the EU.  However, this negative trend, which is further exploited by some member states, should come to an end.  The EU should see the reality that the security and prosperity of Europe and NATO start at Turkey's eastern borders.  As in the concrete example of the agreement of 18 March, Turkey has always made significant contributions to the security, stability and the prosperity of the EU.  We are seeking to have the spirit of co-operation reached on migration in other areas, especially in our fight against terrorism.  Our expectation is to implement the agreement of 18 March in its entirety.  That involves progress on our accession negotiations, starting the modernisation of the customs union and supporting our efforts on visa liberalisation. <br/><br/>We are committed to the reform process.  The parliament passed the first judicial reform package and it entered into force on 24 October 2019.  Its objectives, among others, are to <font color="#2F2F2F">improve the independence, impartiality and transparency of the judiciary; further strengthen the freedom of expression and press; enhance the right to a fair trial by setting maximum detention periods; and reduce workloads of the judiciary.  Following the adoption of this new law, competent courts have already ruled to release some detainees.  This means that there is a legal process in accordance with the laws in force.  Domestic legal remedies are in place, including the right of appeal to higher courts, and in the last instance domestically, individual application to the constitutional court is also possible.  Where all domestic remedies are exhausted, an individual application to the European Court of Human Rights is also possible.</font>We are now working on the six remaining benchmarks for visa liberalisation.<br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> On the other side, we expect the EU to display visionary leadership and anchoring </font><i><font color="#2F2F2F">vis-&agrave;-vis</font></i><font color="#2F2F2F">Turkey.  We are aware that Turkey's accession to the EU may be the most difficult and most questioned but once realised its membership will be the most beneficial, for both Turkey and the EU in addition to the wider geographic region.  Overcoming the difficulties in Turkey-EU relations will result in significant gains not only for Turkey and the EU but also for our region, the international system and global peace.  No other country's membership of the EU is more valuable and meaningful to the people of Europe and its wider geographical area than that of Turkey, in areas ranging from foreign policy to culture, from security to energy and from trade to peace.  Turkey's accession is key to addressing the major challenges that the EU and the rest of Europe are facing.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> In these testing times, the EU and Turkey need each other more than before and have a lot to gain from co-operation in areas such as the fight against terrorism, security threats, irregular migration, energy security, the economy, trade and transport, in addition to people to people contact, in order to contribute to the security, stability and prosperity of our Continent and beyond.  EU is Turkey's largest trade partner while Turkey is the EU's fifth.  </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> Turkey considers itself to be part of the European family.  We are a long-standing member of all European structures.  Against all odds, becoming a full member of the EU - I emphasise &quot;full member&quot; - is still our strategic objective.  </font><font color="#4F4F4F">Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh go l&eacute;ir.</font></p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.187" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jasmin Kahil" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019111300002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman, the distinguished members of this committee and my dear colleagues.  It is a great privilege for me to have the opportunity to represent the case of my country regarding the EU.  I will start on our relations with Ireland.  The relations are good.  Ireland has a special place on our path towards the EU because, during the Irish Presidency of the European Council in 2004, we submitted our application for membership.  The day 26 February 2004 was a very sad one for us not because of the submission of the application but because 20 minutes before our then Prime Minister's scheduled meeting in Dublin with the then Irish Prime Minister, Mr. Bertie Ahern, we heard the sad news that our President, Mr. Boris Trajkovski, had died suddenly.  Consequently, the submitting of the application was postponed for one month but our then Prime Minister, Mr. Branko Crvenkovski, still attended in April 2004.  We became candidates in London in 2005.<br/><br/>In the recent period, the Republic of North Macedonia, which has been the official name since 16 February this year, has completed thorough domestic reforms and has solved longstanding difficult and sensitive open issues with its neighbour Bulgaria. <font color="#2F2F2F"> We signed an agreement on friendship and co-operation in 2017.  We signed the Prespa agreement with Greece</font>in June <font color="#2F2F2F">2018</font>.  We have shown the maturity to pay a high political price.  We believe it is the only path that secures the prosperity of our country.  The European perspective, especially the promise to open the accession negotiations, was the key motivation for us to deliver on all fields.  That is why there is a great feeling of disappointment and bitterness among the citizens of North Macedonia, regardless of their ethnicity.  The EU did not deliver on the long-promised start of the accession negotiations although we have delivered by carrying out reforms and changing such a sacred thing as the name of the country, which is a still a highly polarising issue among our citizens.  Even with the reward of entering the EU and NATO, the changing of the name was too high a price.  One can imagine how great the disappointment was when we did not get at least half of the price, that is, a start to the negotiations with the EU.  The atmosphere is very disappointing.<br/><br/>North Macedonia has been an EU candidate country since December 2005, when Britain held the Presidency under former UK Prime Minister Mr. Tony Blair.  Since then, we had a very bumpy road in our negotiations, or on starting the negotiations with the EU.  We believed we had done our homework and that everything would be ready for this year but what we wanted did not happen.  Fortunately, NATO fulfilled its promise so we are going to be the 30th NATO member country, probably by April of next year.  It should have been December 2019 but, because of the internal problems in Spain, which would be the last country to ratify the accession protocol for NATO, we are not going to catch the Leaders' summit in London on 3 and 4 December.  We hope, however, we will be a member of NATO by April next year.<br/><br/>There are already some consequences arising from last month's EU Council decision.  Our Prime Minister, Mr. Zoran Zaev, requested early parliamentary elections that will enable the citizens to decide on how to further European integration. The elections will be held on 12 April 2020, seven months before the regular date.<br/><br/>North Macedonia, as well as the other countries from the western Balkans, has no choice other than to continue on its way to full membership of the European Union.  We are aware that we have to implement the necessary reforms to comply fully with European values and reach European standards but the latest conclusions of the European Union leave North Macedonia in great uncertainty in respect of whether they represent a withdrawal of the European perspective regarding EU membership for the western Balkan countries.  This would not only be an historical mistake but also a strategic failure of the European Union.</p><p>We are aware that today the EU enlargement does not resonate well within some EU member states.  We should work very hard on changing this perception of our region in the EU.  If this can be achieved through reforming the methodology of the current accession process and merit-based evaluation for every candidate separately, then North Macedonia fully supports such an approach.  The full membership in the European Union is the goal of my country that cannot be replaced by just "special" relations with the EU, or any other country outside the EU.</p><p> There is no alternative for us on our European path.  The results of the Irish membership in the EU are the best recommendation for us never to give up efforts for reaching this goal, no matter how long and difficult this process will be.  At first, however, the process of accession negotiation has to start.  Better sooner than later.</p></speech>

I thank both of our guests for joining us and for their very enlightening and indeed frank presentations.  I will start in reverse order.</p> <p>  The Republic of North Macedonia is a country that I have some familiarity with.  In a previous life I was on the joint consultative committee with the then former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, with the European Committee of the Regions.  I had the opportunity to visit Skopje and beyond on a number of occasions.  I must echo the absolute disappointment of the Irish Government that we have not proceeded to the next stage.  That is something that is being reflected by our Minister and our Taoiseach at European Council level and will be repeated next week at the General Affairs Council meeting.  I place, however, perhaps some misplaced and some actual hope in the meeting in Zagreb next year and the commitment of the incoming Croatian Presidency to further this, which is the path we need to go down.  It is very important that ongoing talks, both with North Macedonia and Albania are moved separate to any review.  They should not become one another.  We can review the enlargement policy separate to the actual starting of the accession negotiations.  I wish North Macedonia well and believe there is great potential for  increased bilateral co-operation between Ireland and North Macedonia.  I look forward to the day when there are embassies in both countries and a much greater interaction.  </p> <p>  To address the Turkish ambassador, I have been a long-time supporter of Turkish accession to the European Union, as have the Irish Government and most Irish political parties.  I will be quite frank, as the ambassador was in his address, that it is becoming more difficult to be that supporter at a European level.  I appreciate that there are colleagues in member states who are always, naturally, ill-disposed to this idea.  It then becomes an issue in internal political campaigns.  While the ambassador cites certain criticism of recent actions as being unfair, he must appreciate that from a European point of view, it is not always possible to give the benefit of the doubt.  </p> <p>  If we look at what the European Union believes in, the fundamental values of the rule of law, democracy, and the rights of humans, we therefore have serious concerns at what is going on in Turkey.  That does not have to be an unfair criticism until it is fully explained.</p> <p>  The recent activities on the border with Syria and Kurdistan are also extremely worrying.  </p> <p>  I agree with the ambassador that we need to increase the level of communication because, all having been said, I still very much believe that a Turkey within the European Union is a much better prospect for everyone, not just in the EU and in Turkey, but for the wider region.  Looking at the history of Turkey and the secular vision laid out by Ataturk, I have to ask whether Turkey is really still serious about joining the EU.  Turkey says it is , but I would question its actions, especially in recent months.</p> <p>  The more we ask these questions of each other - and I ask the same question of other colleagues - as to whether they are serious about these accession talks.  Ireland is serious.  As a member of the governing party, Ireland within the EU will always push for Turkish accession.  It would be much more helpful if it was a bit easier to do this at a European level.</p></speech>

Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Helen McEntee stated that in this room at this meeting and we were very supportive of this candidacy.  Again, like the previous speaker, we hope that the General Affairs Council meeting on 19 November will kickstart the process again with, ultimately, the EU-western Balkans summit in May 2020.  All of us would agree that were North Macedonia in the European Union, it would be a great source of stability for the region, for the western Balkans and so forth.  I am sure that the <i>charg&eacute; d'affaires</i>is aware that he has our full support.</p><p>I note the Turkish ambassador's comments in his conclusion which stated that: </p><blockquote>Turkey considers itself as part of the European family.  We are a long standing member of all European structures. Against all odds, becoming a full member of the EU, and I emphasize full member, is still our strategic objective. </blockquote> <p>I also have to question that statement.  There are concerns about Turkey's Government and its authoritarian style at this time.  There are major issues of concern issues on the rule of law and the freedom of the press.  We have to question Turkey's commitment to joining the European Union and to subscribing to its values.  I appreciate that this is a long process that started some time ago.</p><p>What is the domestic support for the European Union in Turkey?  I am sure that opinion is divided on the issue.  Is Turkey a genuine European country?  I am aware that Europe and the Middle East straddles its border.  Can the ambassador categorically say that Turkey is of the European family, and is a European country at heart?</p><p>On the EU-Turkey deal regarding Syrian refugees, could the ambassador comment on how he considers that is working?  Does it need to be reconsidered and does he think it is in the interests of both Turkey and the EU?  I am interested in the Turkish Government's perspective on that particular deal as it is panning out.</p><p>It would certainly be in everybody's interest, as the ambassador has stated, for Turkey to be in the EU for stability in the region and for peace and progress generally.  Subject to those few queries, Ireland is very supportive of this long-term goal, provided Turkey meets all of the different criteria.</p><p>There is concern in this country on the military activity on the border, as mentioned by Senator Richmond, and the plight of the Kurds.  What is the Turkish Government's view and what are its aims and objectives are in this regard?  From an Irish perspective, we would take a humanitarian view of the situation and be very concerned about the plight of refugees.  I would welcome the ambassador's comments on these matters, please.</p></speech>

There was a lot of hope and anticipation at that particular time.  The aspirations faded somewhat in the meantime.</p> <p>  Similarly, on North Macedonia, I would have a strong opinion on the strategic importance of the western Balkans for a great number of reasons - geopolitical, historical, and the need to ensure there is recognition in the western Balkans that the European Union is a friend, and in particular, a friend in need.  We need to look at it in that light.  </p> <p>  There are those across Europe who would say that we should consolidate Europe.  We should consolidate all of the time.  That is part of the business of nations coming and growing together.  We should also, however, be alert at all times to those who have an aspiration to join the union.  If we close those doors or allow them to fade, then interest fades, particularly among the applicant and the potential applicant countries.  That is not good for the European Union or for the applicant countries or for the geopolitical situation globally.</p> <p>  I, like my colleagues, have concerns about the issues raised by the European Union in respect of Turkey.  That is not being critical but being objective.  I acknowledge the work done by Turkey with refugees from the adjoining wars over the past number of years, very often, when others were slow to respond.</p><p>That must be recognised.<br/><br/>We need to recognise the need for applicant countries to be in line with the <i>acquis communautaire</i>within the European Union.  If a huge difference arises during the course of the negotiations, it does not make for an early or satisfactory conclusion.  Colleagues have referred to the rule of law, humanitarian issues and the fact that there are similar issues in various parts of the European Union.  Given the size of Turkey and its position alongside the European Union, virtually on its doorstep, it is important that there is a good relationship between the two.  In the future we will need to nurture those discussions taking place, help them along and do everything possible to ensure we do not drift further apart.  The danger in drifting further apart is that a different association will be formed, which will be to the advantage neither of applicant countries nor of the European Union and an opportunity will be missed.  It is important for all countries, developed and developing, to recognise that we all have a contribution to make to the creation of a situation that is amenable to the objectives, one of which should and must be Turkish membership of the European Union in the shorter rather than the longer term.<br/><br/>Every generation has its challenges.  How we will deal with them remains to be seen.  In the first half of the 20th century, Europe had several challenges.  Unfortunately, there was a vast cost to the resolution of those challenges, both within Europe and globally, and there was a loss of life as a result of the failure to address issues that should and could have been addressed by negotiations but were not.  We must learn from those lessons, move on from here and try to ensure that the same mistakes are not made again.<br/><br/>Turkey is a large country with a large population and influence and must be treated as such by the European Union.  Turkey can have a truly stabilising effect in the region.  Sadly, the smaller countries in the western Balkans have had a tragic history as well and paid a huge price.  They were minions in the issues that took place in their vicinity, over the heads, without discussion with them and over which they had no control.  The danger is that we might miss the opportunity to bring them closer, welcome them towards the European Union and encourage them.  If we play our cards right on both sides of that debate, I think we will be able to do well.  We have the ability to do well and to bring everybody together.  If we decide we want to become obstinate, go in different directions and assume a position of playing hard to get, I think there will be a disaster and, given the tendencies in some quarters of the globe at present, I would fear for peace and stability in the future, unless there is a move towards the kind of thing we have been talking about.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.196" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019111300002#E00200"><p>The witnesses are very welcome.  Both talked about roads.  One was a bumpy one and the other a long, narrow one.  We should probably try to concentrate on roadmaps.</p> <p>  I will start with the charg&eacute; d'affaires at the Embassy of the Republic of North Macedonia.  I congratulate him on his country's successful ending of the name dispute it had with Greece.  I know that negotiations were sensitive and difficult but both Governments approached them positively and I am delighted the matter was successfully resolved through dialogue and discussion.  North Macedonia received official candidate status, as Mr. Kahil said, in 2005, and progress since then has been delayed because of the dispute with Greece.  At the most recent European Council meeting, Emmanuel Macron used France's veto to prevent North Macedonia from being given a start date for EU accession talks.  I am sure Mr. Kahil and his countrymen are extremely upset and concerned by this recent development.  Many of us are critical of the EU, particularly in its current format and many of us want to see major reforms of it but my party does not oppose starting these accession talks.  They should happen.  Has North Macedonia's President met the French President to discuss his concerns and perhaps work out a pathway forward?  Linked to that, I understand that North Macedonia's President has now called for early elections and that they will take place in April 2020, probably around the same time we will have ours but earlier than previously planned.  Does Mr. Kahil believe that this is because of the EU accession talks setback?  Will the matter be a significant part of the election campaign or are other domestic issues at play?</p> <p>  As for the situation in Turkey, in my role as a parliamentarian, I chair the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  As part of that, I have met civil society representatives, people from Turkey, politicians and others in looking at the Irish peace process and learning whatever lessons might be learned from things that worked in Ireland.  People from all over the world come to Ireland to talk to us about that.  As part of this work we have argued clearly that in situations in which there does not seem to be any clear way out except repression or a military route, sometimes discussions and talks can lead to a breakthrough.  I know there were discussions at one time between the Turkish President and Abdullah &Ouml;calan and that those talks broke down and so on.  The ambassador started off talking about the difficulty and the long road Turkey has been on, but I think many of us looking at the situation in Turkey would argue that it is probably further away from EU accession now than it was at the start of that journey.  I say that respectfully on the basis of the information we have coming out of Turkey, including on the tens of thousands of political prisoners.  The ambassador mentioned the changes to the courts and so on but in recent days, I have seen reports from Amnesty International raising two cases of two journalists who had been detained indefinitely and ended up being released and then rearrested to face similar charges.  We know that people from all walks of life have been arrested in Turkey - judges, military personnel, politicians - and that mayors and MPs are now being arrested.  The charge of terrorism has become so broad and ambiguous that it is a catch-all term used against almost all dissenting voices.  I note that the ambassador says there have been changes in respect of strengthening freedom of expression and the press, but people following what is happening in that part of the world do not see that or get a sense that it is happening.  In fact, we think things are getting worse rather than better.</p> <p>  The invasion of Syria was mentioned.  It has led to more conflict.  I refer to the use of mercenaries in part of the invasion and the activities of those mercenaries.  Again, everyone around the world who is looking at this is asking how a country can align itself with this element as part of an invasion.</p><p>In the past week, four democratically elected mayors in the Kurdish majority areas were removed from office and replaced by government-imposed appointees.  I am pointing out the significant challenges we face.  European leaders and people from various backgrounds want peace and stability in Turkey and in the region but we believe the narrow road Turkey is on will lead to further conflict.  That is my big concern.  If people look at what is happening in Turkey, such as the removal of democratically elected representatives, that has led to further conflict.  We can learn lessons from Ireland in terms of what is happening in prisons such as making political prisoners wear uniforms, forcing them to stand for the Turkish national anthem and prisoners not being given medical supports, including those who are critically ill.  I am not comfortable with the narrative.  I do not want to get into a row with the ambassador.  His presentation was reasonable but it does not reflect what I believe is the reality of what is happening in Turkey and the wider region.  I apologise, but I think that politicians must sit down with people who have been through conflict and consider other ways forward.  Perhaps that is a positive way the Irish people could support Turkey.</p><p> I do not agree with countries joining NATO.  That merely adds further militarisation.  We have a different view.  We are not a member of NATO.  We consider dialogue, discussion and inclusive talks to be the way forward.  I am sorry for that rant.  I know there were not many questions but they are implicit in what I have said.</p></speech>

I cannot take from anything my colleagues have said so far.  I do not wish to go back over the same ground.  I will start with Turkey if I may.  I compliment the ambassador on his use of the Irish language and his wonderful singing of "Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann" at his national day.  It shows a true desire to become integrated into Irish society while he is here.</p> <p>  The west has not been good to the east, in particular the Middle East.  We have set up demigods and then we have sought to tear them down again.  When I say "we" I am talking about western military powers outside of Ireland.  They have moved into countries and then sought to tear down the people they have set up.  They have interfered in countries right across the Middle East and, to a large degree, some of our friends are responsible for the instability that now exists throughout the Middle East.  There are many questions to be answered.  Even right now in Turkey we see that the Americans said they were pulling out and left disaster behind them.  They left the state far more unstable than it was.  I do not for one moment agree that the incursions into Kurdish areas in Syria are acceptable.  I believe that Turkey has a right to protect its borders but I do not believe that right extends to moving into a foreign country and taking hold of land to protect itself.  I just do not accept that under any circumstances.  That is a question Turkey is going to have to answer soon.  I agree with what Deputy Crowe has just set out.  There are significant questions to be answered and Turkey will have to deal with them.</p> <p>  On the other side of the equation, we were happy in the EU to dump as many migrants, refugees and anything else one cares to think of into Turkey, at a financial gain for Turkey, or if one wants, we pawned off our problems on Turkey, gave it a load of money and said it should look after all those people as we do not want them.  When one does that, one creates bitterness and an unacceptable approach to what is now an international problem with respect to migration and refugees.  The two terms are used interchangeably.  We must sit down as nation states and decide what is a migrant and what is a refugee.  As a country that was famous for its migration as far back as history can go, we are in no position to judge anybody's rules on migration, other than the fact that we should be open to migration and we should try to manage it, whether it is economic or for whatever other reason.  I take my hat off to Turkey for taking on the problems of Europe.  To a certain degree, Turkey has been thrown under the bus for helping Europe.</p> <p>  The ambassador and I spoke earlier about Islam.  Turkey is an Islamic state.  There is a job of work in this regard and Turkey is ideally placed to do it.  Islam is not fundamentalism, as in the ISIS view of Islam.  Islam is a peace-loving religion.  People have views as to how strong or weak the religious rules should be.  We in ireland cannot throw any stones either because from the foundation of the State we danced to the tune of one particular religion for many years.  We were dominated by it.  Legislation had to be presented to the Archbishop of Dublin before it could be implemented.  The problem in the west now is that Islam has been demonised and, by so doing, we have demonised countries that have a leaning towards Islam.  That is worrying because I wonder if our colleagues throughout the EU that should be moving towards accession talks with various countries in that part of the world are looking through glasses that see Islam and fear rather than how accession could bring greater stability to the region.  There is a job of work to be done in that regard.  I say that as a sceptic with respect to enlargement.  My training in economics tells me that we must be careful about the diminishing marginal returns from enlargement.</p> <p>  Brexit has opened a number of controversial doors throughout Europe.  Some countries are moving towards nationalism, borders, barbed wire, checkpoints and to the far right.  We see the rise of the right in many nations around Europe.  However, other countries are taking strong views on religion and colour.  Those are all very dangerous issues.  They hark back to a time in Europe we all want to forget so I am concerned about that.  Like Deputy Crowe, I am not asking questions.  What I am trying to do is articulate the issues as I see them throughout Europe.</p> <p>  North Macedonia has gone through hell and high water to change the name of the country to try to appease its next door neighbour.  I am sure citizens are asking what else they have to do and what will be the next demand.  As Europeans, we have to be aware that one can only push people so far.  I have never seen the European project as a peace project.  The Balkans worry me, not necessarily North Macedonia.  There is a rush to accede to the EU in the hope that it will underpin a sensitive and troublesome peace.  I wonder how that sits with North Macedonia at the moment.</p> <p>  Turkey, in particular, must start making sounds that people in Europe want to hear.  I do not for one moment suggest that Europe does not have to move its position as well.  I would welcome accession if it could be shown not to bring diminishing marginal returns economically, but also on the social and civic side that would question the mores we hold so dear in Europe.</p><p>I do not want to see those eroded because we are moving to somewhere else.  I visited Turkey some years ago.  We have a relationship with Turkey that dates right back to Gallipoli and all that went on there.  We have strong ties with Turkey.  Whether we go to Turkey to visit our dead, or on holidays, we are always welcomed.  I want to see Turkey move but I am concerned about the current regime and people being locked up, as mentioned by Deputy Crowe.  I cannot understand why people fear the Kurds in that part of the world.  Turkey must start getting its house in order or the windy, bumpy road it is on will reach a cul-de-sac very quickly, which would be bad for Europe not just Turkey.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.203" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="H.E. Mr. Levent Murat Burhan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2019111300002#G00500"><p>No, I will try to give succinct answers.  Several distinguished members have mentioned the current situation in Syria.  As I have said to the people who I met over the last couple of weeks, the reason Turkey had to intervene in Syria was because of an existential national security threat. To us, the situation in Syria is what Brexit is for Ireland and the EU.</p> <p>  Some members said Turkey was against the Kurds.  I respectfully disagree because I cannot accept that we are against the Kurds.  One must differentiate between the Kurds and PKK, the terrorist organisation.  YPG is an offshoot of the PKK in Syria and I have provided some information in that context.  It is the same terrorist organisation and does not represent any segment of Syrian society or Syrian Kurds.  The YPG forces control areas in northern Syria but 350,000 Syrian Kurds took refuge in Turkey.  Why?</p> <p>  We want to protect the territorial integrity of Syria, and we always state that at all levels but that is not the same for YPG, which is a terrorist organisation.  I have provided a list of attacks.  More than 300 rocket and mortar attacks have been launched across the border into the Turkish side and caused civilian casualties during the last two years.  In addition, our friends and allies provide arms and ammunition to the YPG forces because they said they would fight Daesh.  However, the same arms and ammunition have been smuggled through tunnels into the Turkish side and given to the PKK whose members are fighting Turkish security forces and caused a lot of deaths in the civilian population.  </p> <p>  Deputy Crowe mentioned Abdullah &Ouml;calan.  He is the leader of the PKK organisation and YPG is part of the umbrella organisation of Koma Civak&ecirc;n Kurdistan&yacute;, KCK, whose members also recognise Abdullah &Ouml;calan as their leader.  The organisations use different names but they are all part of the same terrorist organisation and we should not consider them as representing Kurdish people anywhere in the region.  </p> <p>  We have excellent relations with the northern Iraqi-Kurdish administration.  I have been in Erbil, for example.  A lot of trade takes place and many Turkish companies are active in the region.  If one checks the figures about Turkey on the Internet one will see that the ruling party gets more votes in the south-eastern region and provinces than the party that claims to represent Kurdish people.  One cannot say that Turkey is against the Kurds, rather one must remember that Turkey is fighting a terrorist organisation.  My Government and State have an obligation and responsibility to protect its own citizens.  Many terrorist attacks came from the Syrian side so we had to intervene.  We have intervened twice before.  First, it was Operation Euphrates Shield, which was completely against the Daesh forces.  Our allies claimed that YPG forces were fighting Daesh.  However, during the Iraq co-operation the BBC discovered the special deals that the YPG terrorists made with the Daesh terrorists and how they let them go.  The same thing happened during the recent operation.  The YPG opened a prison and set all of the Daesh prisoners free.  Today, the Minister of the Interior in Turkey released a statement that one of the important guys of Daesh was caught in Syria.  The YPG has a completely different agenda and does not support the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Syria.  In fact, we do.  </p> <p>  In terms of YPG, international reports have been mentioned.  I have provided reports by Amnesty International and other international organisations on how the YPG violated human rights and treated the local people, which led to 360,000 people seeking refuge in Turkey.  The YPG oppressed and intimidated the local population, particularly Syrian Kurds.  The YPG forcibly displaced them, and forcibly recruited child soldiers and underage soldiers.</p><p>We have to make the differentiation that there was really a national security threat which is accepted also as a legitimate security concern by the US, Russia and in some EU documents these legitimate security concerns are recognised.  As is the case with the previous two interventions we tried to establish stability in that region.  First we tried to stop this security threat on the Turkish side and then establish stability and security there to lay the ground for the safe and voluntary return of displaced Syrians.  That has been the case in the western part of Syria, next to the borders with the Afrin region.  For example, 365,000 were returned to the Afrin region according to the latest figures.  This region is a majority Syrian-Kurdish populated area and now a local administration has been set up there composed of a Syrian-Kurdish majority.  The chair of that local administration is also a Syrian Kurd.  We have no secret, hidden agenda <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Syria.  Our aim is to prevent any kind of terror threat towards Turkish national security; to enforce Syria's territorial integrity and unity; to free local people from YPG's operation; and to lay the ground for the safe and voluntary return of Syrians.  When I say safe and voluntary they have, as I said, returned 365,000 to Afrin.  They returned voluntarily to their original places of residence.  We are not forcing anybody.  We are working with the UN especially with UN in order to co-ordinate this in accordance with international humanitarian laws.<br/><br/>In this Afrin region, which has a majority Syrian-Kurd population, we built three new hospitals, three more were repaired and equipped by us and now 2,000 Syrians are employed in these six hospitals.  We have built and refurbished schools for 330,000 students in the Afrin region.  We have repaired the Mydanki dam providing running water; infrastructure has been repaired; electricity is provided in the Azaz region with generators provided by us; and the Jarablus region receives electricity from Turkey.  We opened a new border from Afrin to Turkey in order to facilitate trade routes and supported the agriculture there.  We do not have any secret agendas <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Syria.  We just want Syria to have stability, security and peace because it is also in our interests to have stability and security along our borders.  This has not been the case so far.  If we look to the future of Syria we want the future of Syria to be decided by a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process based on UN Security Council Resolution 2254.  The constitutional committee has been established and we have contributed to the formation of this committee and hope that it will finalise its work as quickly as possible.  We want the return of the Syrian refugees but this return should be safe, dignified, voluntary and to their original places of residence and should be co-ordinated with the UN.  We are ready to help them to improve; as I said there is a humanitarian infrastructure and we are giving the same kind of humanitarian aid liberated by the Turkish peacekeeping operation in the eastern part of the Turkish Syria border.  We have provided assistance, together with our Red Crescent and AFAD which is the national agency for natural disasters and emergencies and we are co-operating with the UN Disaster Risk Reduction, UNDRR, and other UN-related non-governmental organisations.</p></speech>

The differentiation between Kurds and the PKK is very important for us.</p> <p>  We know that we have to improve in the context of human rights but in October a new judicial reform package was passed and the effects were seen on the ground in that some detainees were released by the decision of the courts.  We are aware of our obligations under international law and we pay full respect to the rule of law, and the principle of necessity and proportionality also which we have to take into account.  </p> <p>  It was mentioned that lots of people were dismissed following the coup two and a half years ago.</p><p>The legal remedies are very much in place.  Thanks to these, for example, 43,000 employees were reinstated and 360 private entities were allowed to function again.  Journalists in prison were mentioned.  In fact, they are not detained because of their journalistic work but due to their acts in support of and links to terrorist organisations.  As I said, this is decided by the independent courts, which take their decisions on the merits of each case.  As I said also, legal remedies exist and individuals can appeal to a higher court.  Indeed, we have recognised the individual right of appeal to the constitutional court and, as I said in my speech, even to the European Court of Human Rights.  Those rights are available.</p><p> The mayors who were dismissed were mentioned.  This was because of concern about their use of municipality resources to support terrorist activities instead of providing basic services to the local population.  They put into practice some methods, like a co-chair method, whereby they convey their mayoral authority to co-mayors who not elected by the voters in the elections.  This has no basis in Turkish legislation.  These co-mayors illegally exercise all the administrative powers of the elected mayor.  Most of the cases are because of this, and the mayors in question are dismissed as an interim measure until investigative proceedings are finalised.  Everything is done according to our constitution and our laws, and legal remedies exist.</p><p> Some MPs were mentioned.  I remind the committee that 154 MPs had their immunity lifted.  That was decided by the Turkish Parliament, and these MPs included people from the ruling party and from the main opposition party.  They were asked by the public prosecutors to give their depositions, which most of them did.  Even the leader of the main opposition party gave his deposition, but some MPs did not.  They said that they did not recognise the authority of these courts or the public prosecutors.  That is why they were detained.  That is a fact.</p><p> Deputy Crowe mentioned some prisoners not being given food, medical support and so on.  I respectfully disagree with him.  We cannot accept such claims.  We are party to the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the UN Committee Against Torture.  They have monitoring mechanisms and they come to Turkey to monitor the situation, including all the prisons and so on, and then they publish their report.  That is not to say we are perfect.  Of course, we can improve.  There is always room for improvement and because of that, as I said, we recently initiated this new judicial reform package.  However, we would like our allies and partners to understand that we are fighting on multiple fronts.  We are fighting against Daesh, we are fighting against the PKK and we are fighting against this group, which has staged this-----</p></speech>

If one thinks about the history of Europe, one cannot write it or rewrite it without Turkey.  The Balkans are very close to us.  It is a neighbouring region.  We expect all Balkan countries, including, of course, North Macedonia and Albania, to become full members.  We believe that we will be able to overcome our difficulties, which we are going through in this delicate period.  In order to overcome these present difficulties, we need more dialogue.  We need more channels of communication to be opened, and to remain open.  We do not want the opposite.  We need also the co-operation of the other side in this respect, but our final aim is to become a full member of the EU.  This is our strategic objective.</p> <p>  I was asked what the opinion of Turkish people is.  The people were asked if they thought becoming a member of the EU would be good for Turkey.  The answer was 75% to 80% "Yes".  If the question was whether the people believed Turkey would become a member of the EU, the percentage would go down.</p></speech>

In regard to Turkey, I was lucky to spend three years of my diplomatic life there, and ten years ago the situation was not the same and the relations between the EU and Turkey were far better.  I was going to the Ministry for European Union Affairs and to Mr. Egemen Ba for advice.  At that time, ten years ago, it really seemed that Turkey was very close to the EU and it was opening chapters but something changed in the meantime.</p> <p>  In regard to North Macedonia, we have had three or four very bleak days since our independence.  A commission was set up by the European Union in January 1992.  It was chaired by Mr. Badinter and Mr. Herzog was a member.  This commission had to say which republics of the former Yugoslavia should be independent states.  On 15 January 1992, a decision was made that it would be only Slovenia and Macedonia.  On the same night, we were waiting on recognition from half of Europe.  Nothing happened except the decision to include Bulgaria and then a few weeks later Turkey.  All of a sudden, we were aware that there was a big problem.  That was a big disappointment.</p> <p>  The second disappointment one was in June 1992, when the EU made the unbelievable decision that we could not be an independent state unless we change the name without Macedonia.  That was completely unacceptable and a big disappointment.  The third disappointment was in April 2008 at the Bucharest NATO summit.  President Bush said that from the next day, Albania, Croatia and Macedonia would be NATO members.</p><p>We did not become a member of NATO because our membership was vetoed.  Our Greek friends stated that they did not veto our membership.  We took a case to the International Court of Justice in the Hague because an agreement between Greece and North Macedonia dating from 1995 states that each country may not veto the other side's entering an international organisation on the basis of the name issue.  It was obvious that was the reason for Greece doing so.  We won our case, with the court deciding in our favour on a unanimous basis, 15:0.  However, nothing happened because NATO stated that it was a political decision.  The third big disappointment was in April 2008.  The failure last month to begin talks on our membership of the EU was a fourth big disappointment.  We are managing the situation.  We anticipate that we will complete our accession to NATO before next April.  We hope to become a member of the EU.</p><p> There was a question on possible meetings between President Pendarovski and President Macron of France.  The presidents met yesterday.  The North Macedonian President explained our situation and why we should start negotiations.  President Macron insisted on the new criteria and referred to March.  He mentioned that he sent proposals regarding the new criteria for the accession process to other member states.  We hope it will be concluded before the EU-Western Balkans summit in Zagreb but for many years, we have hoped that it would be concluded at the next EU summit.  </p><p> The elections in April were precipitated by the decision of the EU.  In 2008, after the debacle at the NATO summit in Bucharest, the former Prime Minister called an early election and won that election.  The current Prime Minister decided to do likewise.  He had stated that if we did not get the promised date for starting the negotiations, he would call an election, and he did so.  One of the main issues in the election will be whether it was a mistake to change the name of the country and the impact of that decision on our accession.  There are five months until the election.</p><p> There was a very good question regarding whether my country wishes to become a member of the EU for reasons of stability, peace and so on.  It may be the case that it wishes to become a member of NATO for those reasons, but they are not our reasons for wishing to join the EU.  We are Europeans.  We were part of Yugoslavia which, although it was a communist country, was quite liberal compared to other such countries.  We were raised on British humour and rock music.  I listened to U2, Thin Lizzy and many other bands and came here to see them.  We did not need a visa to come here at the time, unlike the current situation.  Even though I have a diplomatic passport and I am a charg&eacute; d'affaires in the UK, I need a visa to come here.  People in my country were raised on western culture.  My country, the former Republic of Macedonia, now North Macedonia, has never been under the influence of any other country, as members will understand.  We were always western-oriented.  We continue to believe that we are part of Europe.  The Eurovision Song Contest is as popular in my country as it is in Ireland.  We nearly won it this year.  In the 1990s, Ireland was the most successful country in the contest.  We North Macedonians are Europeans and that is the main reason our country should be a member of the EU.  We will contribute to the EU.  It is not just about maintaining peace.  We are Europeans.  My country was influenced by no country other than those with western values, rock music, literature and so on.  Yugoslavia was that kind of country, unlike certain other countries in the region at the time.</p></speech>

In the first session we will hear from representatives from the Irish Farmers Association and officials from the Department of Health as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the nursing homes support scheme (amendment) Bill 2019.  It is proposing amending legislation intended to change the treatment of family farms and businesses under the nursing home support scheme, also known as the fair deal scheme.</p><p>I welcome from the Department of Health, Mr. Niall Redmond, principal officer, Mr. Karl Duff, assistant principal and Ms Helen Simon, administrative officer.  From the Irish Farmers Association, I welcome the president, Mr. Joe Healy, Ms Caroline Farrell, chair of the farm family and social affairs committee, Mr. Martin Stapleton, chair of the farm business committee and Ms Geraldine O'Sullivan, farm family and social affairs committee executive.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

I am joined by my colleagues Mr. Karl Duff, assistant principal and Ms Helen Simon, administrative officer, from the services for older people unit in the Department of Health.</p> <p>  I hope to provide this hearing with the background to the Government decision to approve and publish the general scheme of the nursing homes support scheme (amendment) Bill 2019, and to briefly outline its main provisions.  The general scheme of the nursing homes support scheme (amendment) Bill 2019 will create an additional legislative framework implementing a policy objective whereby family farms and family businesses will be better safeguarded for future generations.</p> <p>  The nursing homes support scheme, NHSS, was developed in the late 2000s and built on the existing nursing homes subvention scheme.  There was an identified need to regularise payments through legislative underpinning, and to remove financial hardship from many individuals and their families who, under the previous system of subvention, had to sell or re-mortgage homes to pay for the cost of nursing home care.  The nursing homes support scheme has been very successful to date, supporting nearly 100,000 people to avail of nursing home care since its commencement just ten years ago.  The scheme has proven to be robust and fair, reflective perhaps of the legislation having remained largely unchanged since its introduction.</p> <p>  When the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act was developed and commenced in 2009 it was done with the proviso that a review of the scheme would be initiated following its first three years of operation.  This review, published in 2015, examined a wide range of issues.  A public consultation process was initially undertaken to inform the work of the review, with some 61 submissions received from a range of individuals, nursing homes, statutory and private organisations, voluntary bodies and organisations representing the interests of older people, including the Irish FarmersAssociation and Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, among others.  The recommendations received and the themes identified through that consultation informed the review.</p><p>A recommendation arising from the review was that consideration should be given to whether a cap should be applied to the charge for nursing home care based on non-residential productive assets passed on to a direct family member after the death of a NHSS participant, and where the new owner carries on the farm or business as their principal livelihood.  The existing programme for partnership Government committed to introduce these changes to the assessment of family businesses and farms in the context of the financial assessment of means under the scheme. <br/><br/>Farms are traditionally passed down through generations and it is recognised that it is important for rural communities that farms can continue to operate within the family unit and be maintained as sustainable productive assets.  The same may also be said of businesses such as family businesses.  Small farms, in particular, play an important role in supporting rural employment and maintaining the social fabric of rural areas and thus contribute to the objective of balanced territorial development.  In a wider context, the general scheme proposes to help ensure the continued viability of family-run farms and businesses, especially for those for whom early succession planning has not been possible.  The general scheme aims to give effect to the recommendation of the fair deal review and to deliver on the programme for Government commitment in that regard. <br/><br/>It is also important that we are cognisant of the wider situation with regard to ageing in Ireland.  Our population is living longer than ever, and our older population is consistently growing in size.  It is, therefore, important that, in any change to the NHSS, we ensure the longer-term sustainability of the scheme and ensuring continued and timely access for those who need it. <br/><br/>The NHSS is a financial support scheme that provides State support towards the cost of long-term residential care for adults in Ireland, irrespective of age.  The amount of State support provided is dependent on the means of the applicant, where those with least means receive the most support and those who can afford to cover a greater share of the cost of their care, do so.  This helps to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, ensuring that finite resources are targeted at those most in need. <br/><br/>Having regard to that, the stated policy objective of the general scheme is to introduce further safeguards in the NHSS to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for them their livelihood.  Under existing conditions, applicants or participants to the scheme who experienced a sudden illness or disability that necessitated long-term residential care have their contribution based on their farm or business assets capped at three years in line with the treatment of the principal residence, subject to certain conditions.  This general scheme aims to broaden the application of this three-year cap by removing the requirement to have suffered a sudden illness or disability resulting in the need for care and instead introducing revised criteria.  This amendment will extend the application of the cap to family-run farms and businesses that satisfy the prescribed criteria, thus extending the sense of certainty to all farm and business owners for whom a family successor will succeed the concern. <br/><br/>The general scheme comprises two parts.  Part 1 deals with the normal standard provisions such as interpretation and commencement.  Part 2 includes all other provisions for the amendment.  The criteria required to qualify for the three-year cap on farm or business assets is set out in head 4.This introduces the requirement that the farm or business was actively worked by either the NHSS participant or applicant or a qualifying family successor for a minimum period of three years in the five years prior to nursing home admission and that the farm or business will be actively worked, as per the requirements in the amendment, by a family successor for a period of not less than six years following nomination of the said family successor. <br/><br/>Given the complexity of the scheme, a significant consideration has been given to how to amend existing provisions and introduce new provisions that will satisfy the policy objective in question.  Where possible, we have endeavoured to build on existing provisions.  However, there is need for changes in the operation and administration of the scheme, changes to the obligations on family successors in respect of their undertakings and associated reporting structures, and all other necessary changes to ensure the policy objective is implemented equitably and that existing participants in the scheme are not unnecessarily disadvantaged. <br/><br/>The general scheme provides for robust verification requirements in the continued active working of the farm or business in question, as well as the introduction of obligations on the family successor to comply with the verifications required and other criteria, as set out, such as commitment to continue working the farm or business and engage with the HSE on that matter.  These requirements are included to ensure that the public policy objective is met as intended.  <br/><br/>Heads 6, 7, 10, 12 and 13 set out obligations of both the NHSS participant and their family successor.  It should be noted that a number of these provisions are in operation in the existing Act but their application is being extended to facilitate the three-year cap.  <br/><br/>I draw the committee's attention to head 10, in particular, which is entitled &quot;Special Provisions&quot;.  This head has been included recognising that plans may not always work out as intended.  In this instance, these<i>force majeure </i>style provisions recognise for example, that the family successor may not, through no fault of their own, be able to meet the requirement to work the farm or business for the required six years, and rather than an immediate obligation to repay the relief enjoyed arising from the cap, there is an opportunity to nominate a new family successor who will continue to meet that obligation. <br/><br/>The proposed amendment will also require a change to how elements of the scheme are operated, namely to include processes on the nomination of the successor, to allow for application of a cap on contributions, to calculate the value of said cap, and to set out how the criteria associated with the cap may be satisfied.  <br/><br/>Heads 5, 8, 9, 11, 16, 17, 18 and 20 provide for the necessary changes in operations and powers of the executive, the HSE, in that regard.  <br/><br/>As noted earlier, the existing legislation provides for those who have experienced a sudden illness or disability that requires long-term residential care as a result, as early succession planning may not have been feasible in such instances.  Participants who have entered the scheme under this provision will not be required to adhere to the new conditions that are being introduced.  <br/><br/>Head 14 includes provisions for current participants to whom the sudden illness or disability clause may refer. <br/><br/>Where an NHSS participant or applicant is deemed to not have the capacity to make a decision in respect of certain matters under the 2009 Act, a care representative may be appointed by the court to act on these matters.  Head 15 proposes the introduction of an additional power for the care representative, to allow for the nomination of a family successor in the case where a participant, at the necessary time, does not have the capacity to make such a nomination.  <br/><br/>This overview gives a flavour of the Bill.  I thank the Chairman and the committee for undertaking this pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme.  We look forward to receiving the committee's report, which will make a valuable contribution in the further development of the legislation, and we are happy to answer any questions in that regard.</p></speech>

They have worked constructively with the IFA to remove the uncertainty in the NHSS in order that farm families can plan appropriately for the cost of care.</p> <p>  The IFA supports the scheme and recognises its important role in providing financial support and security for people going into long-term nursing home care, as well as their families.  The scheme operates under the principle of the ability to pay, which means that a person&rsquo;s copayment is calculated based on 80% of their assessable income and up to 7.5% of the value of their assets.  Under the scheme, the principal private residence is capped at three years and following this period, it is disregarded from the financial assessment.</p> <p>  A key concern for the IFA since the introduction of the scheme has been the potentially uncapped liability on the farm business asset.  Farm business assets are productive assets and are required to generate income.  They are not a measure of additional ability to pay.  Significant uncertainty and anxiety has been created for family farms, with fear that the viability of the farm will be undermined or lost while attempting to meet the costs of care.  This has led to the introduction of a three-year cap on farm business assets in circumstances of sudden illness.</p> <p>  It is also important to note that assets transferred for less than five years are included in the assessment of means.  As members can imagine, this has proven to be a barrier to the next generation taking over the family farm due to the debt owing on the farm business asset.</p> <p>  At this stage, before I go into detail on the draft heads of Bill and the proposed changes to the scheme, it would be useful to give a brief overview of the agricultural sector in Ireland.  It is the backbone of the economy and is our largest indigenous industry with a turnover of &euro;26 billion annually.  The family farm is at the heart of the agricultural sector.  There are 137,500 farms in Ireland, of which 99.7% are classified as family farms.  The 2018 Teagasc national farm survey showed that 30% of farmers are aged 65 or over, while only 7% are under the age of 35.  This steady erosion of farm incomes threatens both the viability and sustainability of the family farm and the sector&rsquo;s growth prospects.  This can be clearly seen in the survey findings with only 34% or 47,000 of farms classified as viable.</p> <p>  A farm is economically viable if it can remunerate family labour at the average agricultural wage and provide a 5% return on non-land assets.</p><p>A total of 32% of farms are classified as sustainable because of off-farm income and 34% are classified as vulnerable.  It is critical to understand that farm assets are productive assets, which are required to generate income.  They are not a measure of an additional ability to pay.  If the farm asset is reduced, the income earning potential will decrease and the viability of the farm can be put in question.  The agrifood sector, which employs more than 7% of the working population and is responsible for approximately 8% of GDP, is vital to the economy, but especially to the rural economy.  Farming provides the raw material that underpins the success of the agrifood sector and it is vital that the future viability of family farms be protected.</p><p> The importance of the agrifood sector is clearly recognised and has been prioritised as a major economic driver in the programme for Government.  It is acknowledged there are significant challenges facing the sector and that a number of important structural deficits affect its competitiveness.  In particular, issues such as farm size, fragmentation, low land mobility and an ageing demographic profile are believed to affect negatively the efficiency of primary production.  In the 2014 agri-taxation review, there was consensus that such structural deficiencies needed to be addressed and the report proposed a 50% increase in the income tax relief for leased land.</p><p> Long-term land leasing has operated in Ireland since the mid-1990s.  As a farm business structure, land leasing is growing in importance, not least since the increase in the income tax relief on long-term leases introduced in budget 2015.  The income tax relief rates and the tiered structure have encouraged farmers to enter long-term leases.  Since its introduction, the changes in the income tax relief rates have resulted in a near doubling of the number of long-term leases and are an important policy driver that encouraged and incentivised farmers to enter long-term leases with third parties.  The latest available Revenue figures show that the number of long-term land leases has more than doubled since 2013, rising from 4,370 to 9,790 in 2017.  The rate has continued apace in 2018 and 2019, meaning that the number is now far higher than 9,790.  It is important to stress that the income tax relief on leased land is not eligible to close family relatives and, therefore, Government policy has actively encouraged farm families to enter long-term leases with third parties.</p><p> In the draft heads of Bill to amend the nursing home support scheme, it is proposed to extend the three-year cap to farm business assets where the farmer, partner or spouse, or a family successor has worked a substantial part of the working day on the farm for three of the previous five years, prior to the person receiving care, or where a family successor is appointed and commits to continue consistently and regularly to apply a substantial part of his or her working day to farming for a period of not less than six years.  Under the proposed changes, family farms leased to third parties are excluded from the three-year cap, as they are classified as an investment asset rather than a productive asset.  The proposed changes and the classification of leased farm assets under the draft heads of Bill are inconsistent with other Government policies that actively incentivised and encouraged farmers to enter long-term leases with third parties.  Crucial to the success of the income tax relief and the incentivising of long-term leases is the confidence farmers have that in leasing their farms, they will not be negatively affected in the future transfer of their asset.  If the proposed changes were introduced, it could threaten the future viability of such farm businesses and undermine the progress made to address deficiencies in the sector.</p><p> The IFA proposes that the precedent set out under the agricultural relief, a relief available on farm land transferred either in one&rsquo;s lifetime or on death, be applied under the fair deal scheme to qualify for the three-year cap.  To create cohesive Government policy that continues to protect the competitiveness of the agricultural sector, the IFA proposes that the qualifying criteria under the fair deal scheme would be similar to agricultural relief, which states farm land must be farmed on a commercial basis for at least six years or the property must be leased to someone who farms the agricultural property on a commercial basis for at least six years from the date of transfer.  The rationale behind the relief is to encourage the productive use of agricultural land and prevent the sale or break-up of family farms.  Introducing a similar qualifying condition under the fair deal scheme for leased farm land would strengthen existing Government policy to address structural deficiencies in the sector and improve competitiveness.</p><p> Protecting the sector&rsquo;s competitiveness has never been so important, when the uncertainty of Brexit and the increasing production costs are considered.  The IFA proposes that the eligibility criteria for the three-year cap are that the farm is farmed on a commercial basis for three of the five years prior to the person receiving care, by either the farmer, partner or spouse, family successor or leasee, or that the farm is farmed on a commercial basis for at least six years from the date the person receives care, by either the farmer, partner or spouse, family successor or leasee.  Amending the draft heads of Bill to include the leasees is vital if the future viability of the family farm is to be protected.</p><p> Another condition not addressed in the draft heads of Bill is the clawback on farm assets transferred for less than five years.  The IFA is fully supportive of and encourages lifetime transfers of farms.  It is fundamentally opposed to a financial burden being placed on a transferred asset and is unclear how a third party could find itself responsible for the previous owner&rsquo;s cost of care.  There is no doubt this has proven to be a barrier to the next generation taking over the family farm, as the viability of the farm business may be undermined by the impact of an unknown cost of care on the future value of the assets.  Furthermore, farmers face a challenging credit environment and would be unable to secure credit to make the necessary investment in the farm business to increase efficiencies and production.  The clawback mechanism is grossly unjust and must be reviewed.  In other support schemes for elderly people, such as the non-contributory pension, when ownership of the farm asset is transferred, it is no longer included in the means assessment.  If a transfer has taken place, the person is asked to supply a copy of the deed of transfer stamped by the Revenue Commissioners, or if the deed has been lodged, a letter from the solicitors confirming that the deed of transfer has been lodged with the Revenue Commissioners is supplied.</p><p> The document, Review of the Nursing Home Support Scheme, A Fair Deal, was published in July 2015, three years after the IFA&rsquo;s submission to the consultation process.  It recognised the IFA&rsquo;s position that income generating assets should be treated differently.  In July 2018, the Government approved proposals to change how farm assets are treated under the fair deal scheme.  At the time, the Minister stated the draft heads of Bill would be progressed in the Oireachtas in the autumn session.  It took a further year, however, before the draft heads of Bill were published in June 2019.  The significant delays in the legislative process have had a negative impact on the viability of family farms.  The Government has given a commitment that the changes will be applied retrospectively, which means that once the Act is amended, it will apply to existing nursing home residents as well as new entrants.  The IFA proposes that the retrospection be applied from July 2018, when the Government approved the proposal, and that the existing nursing home residents who satisfy the three-year cap as of July 2018 be refunded their contribution from the farm business asset.  Farm families should not be financially penalised as a result of the delays progressing the drafting the legislation.</p><p> In conclusion, the IFA welcomes the opportunity to share its concerns with the committee, and present constructive and realistic recommendations that, if enacted, would enable farm families to plan appropriately for the cost of nursing home care and positively affect the future viability of Ireland&rsquo;s family farm model</p><p>We would very much welcome any questions members may have and thank them for their time and consideration.</p></speech>

I am glad we are discussing this issue today but regret that we were not discussing it a couple of years ago.  It has been on the long finger for far too long.  Many of us, particularly those from rural constituencies like mine, have been dealing with this issue in our clinics and in real life with our neighbours for some time because of the current inequity that must be addressed.</p> <p>  I want to acknowledge at the outset, and I am not always in this space, the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, in respect of this issue.  To be fair to him, he took it on when others would not.  I acknowledge that across politics because he progressed it when others did not.</p> <p>  The fact that this issue has not moved on is affecting decision making across families.  I see it; I live on our family farm.  There are many people close to me, geographically as well as personally - they are my neighbours - and the fact that this has not been dealt with is impacting on intergenerational issues.  It is impacting on decision making.  It is changing people's lives and careers.  It is affecting diversification.  As a Government and a country, we are encouraging diversification in farming but because this decision has not been made, this is impacting on investment, credit and a range of other issues.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  I would say that, in the main, they are the same questions most members will have for the witnesses.  They are the ones people raise with us in our clinics.  These questions are for the Department officials rather than the IFA.  On the issue of leasing to third parties and excluding them from the three-year gap, what are the plans to deal with that?  This cannot go forward without this issue being dealt with in some way or having some form of criteria that will change the interpretation.  The witnesses might explain why they are not willing to examine this, or are they willing to look at it?  Perhaps they have changed their minds about it.  As has been outlined, and as I have said, it contradicts Government policy in numerous other areas.  We could cite many examples.  Only one has been cited here in respect of agricultural relief but if I went far enough I could pull out examples across other areas.  How will that issue be dealt with?  It will have a significant impact as regards this scheme because on the one hand many farmers, dare I say it, of my generation have been encouraged to go in a certain direction in respect of leasing but the condition here will impact on the scheme.  That is my first question.</p> <p>  The second issue is one I have juggling with for some time because I do not know how it will work.  It relates to the clawback.  I refer to the penalty in respect of the clawback for less than five years of assets that have been transferred.  I have no idea how this will work, and it is not outlined.  How does the Department put a condition on a third party who has received the asset?  How will that work legally?  The witnesses might outline that.  There needs to be some form of criteria in respect of that because the way the heads of the Bill are written is puzzling.  I have no way of knowing how this will work.</p> <p>  The third issue relates to the actual timing of this Bill.  As I said in my introduction, many people are being conditioned as regards its timing.  We will have to bring in some form of retrospective application for those who are in nursing homes and new entrants in respect of this Bill.  In some cases, people have had to make decisions in a rushed way.  Some families had been holding out but could not hold out any longer.  We will have to apply this legislation retrospectively in some way.  I am open to discussing the dates.  I have no fixed date in my head.  The Department could look at the date it was published and other dates but the likelihood is that in the current political environment the passage of the Bill through the legislative process could go on for some time.  I would like to see it done before this D&aacute;il is due to conclude by next March, April or May.  Do the Department officials intend having this scheme legislated for by then?  We will have to retrospectively insert something in the legislation to make it applicable to those people to whom I referred.  Those are my three questions, all of which are for the Department officials.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.230" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Redmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019111300002#F00400"><p>I thank Deputy Kelly for those questions.  In terms of the length of time it has taken us to get to this position, it is probably fair to say, and it is not news to anybody in this room, that the scheme and the primary legislation that underpins it is complex.  It contains many complex and competing issues that we have to examine, not just in terms of looking out to farms and businesses but also the impacts any changes to the scheme would have in respect of the sustainability of the scheme going forward.  Next year, the scheme will reach over the &euro;1 billion mark in terms of budget.  It is a very significant scheme in terms of expenditure for the State and we will have to think carefully about any changes to it that could impact on its longer-term sustainability.  That is part of the reason we spent so much time trying to identify the issues and the legal complexities and trying to address those in the heads of the Bill.  We would like to have done it quicker but, unfortunately, the nature of the legislation and the background to it did not permit that.  However, we are making progress now.</p> <p>  To deal with the Deputy's last question on our intentions around progression of the Bill, we have no desire to hang around in terms of moving this forward.  We have drafters appointed now who are working with us and who will start drafting the Bill soon in respect of that.  The sooner we can get that finished and into the Houses for debate and to progress it, the better.  We have no reason to delay it any further, other than dealing with any issues that may arise that may need to be examined.  By and large, however, we are as ambitious and as anxious to move it forward as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  In terms of the specific questions, on the issue of leasing, which the Deputy and the representatives of the IFA outlined, we have looked at it in great detail.  Part of that was in respect of the complexities involved.  When we look across Government at different policies it is important to get to the hub of the intent of any policy.  The policy intent behind the agricultural tax relief relates predominantly to land mobility.  This amendment to this scheme is about the protection of the family farm within the family unit as a source of employment and income going forward.  It has a different policy intent.  I do not believe it is incompatible necessarily with land mobility policy.  The reason land mobility policy exists to some extent is because the farm, by and large, had not been worked.  This is about keeping the farm that is being worked working and providing safeguards to protect the viability in respect of the financial debt that may run up in that regard.  I do not believe they are compatible.</p> <p>  The issue here is that we have to think about all other classes of assets that may be part of the financial means assessment in the scheme.  To move away from the policy intent that the farm would be protected for the next generation in terms of working the land would depart from that policy intent.</p><p>It would potentially have a domino effect in respect of other assets that people may have and create discrimination in the equitable administration of the scheme.  It probably brings us all the way back to the subvention scheme that the fair deal tried to replace by undoing some of the inequitable principles embedded in that scheme.  We do not want to take a retrograde step.  We cannot include third parties in this because it does not meet the policy intent, which is to protect the family farm for the next generation who will farm the land.  That is why those conditions are in the scheme and the conditions around sudden illness and disability provisions which are currently in the 2009 Act also cover that in respect of the requirement to be working the land.  </p><p> In terms of clawback and the heads of the Bill, we have tried to improve the situation and in the head dealing specifically with transferred assets we tried to recognise that for a variety of reasons, including retirement, the farm may have been transferred to a family member already before the nursing home care is required.  To address that we have allowed for the cap to be applied to such situations which currently is not the case.  We have also allowed for the fact that under the existing provisions there is a hard cut-off of five years.  We have introduced here a possibility for the land to be worked in only three of the last five years.  We have moved to try to improve the position.  The five-year transferred asset period has been a feature of the scheme since day one.  Part of that is a particular safeguard to protect the scheme bearing in mind that it is based on means.  The majority of people are honest and work with what is there but the safeguard put in place in 2009 was to stop people putting assets beyond the scheme nefariously rather than by accident.  We have tried to recognise what happens on the ground in respect of succession.  We have introduced what I think is a positive amendment in that respect to try to apply the cap to those situations as well.</p><p> Retrospection of the changes creates a difficult precedent in that we are trying to reach back legislatively to apply conditions to people who did not know those conditions existed.  I suppose they did not exist at the time in respect of what is being proposed here.  That is a challenging precedent to try to introduce to the scheme and it has knock-on effects irrespective of whether we talk about seven days or seven years ago.  We have examined that in detail.  We think the challenges and the risks are quite high for potential knock-on impacts.  In our assessment it is not possible, particularly in the retrospective application of conditions that did not exist at the time.  </p></speech>

Here we are giving an option, where there is a family successor in place who is working the farm or the business, to agree to continue to work that, enter into a legal agreement and we can apply the cap in that situation.  Under the current situation, the cap does not apply in those circumstances.</p></speech>

In general I would agree with Deputy Kelly's remarks on the legalities likely to emerge and the extent to which the courts could well be full of issues arising from this.</p> <p>  Mr. Redmond has evaluated how the clawback will or will not work.  However, over the past few years has the Department carried out any audit directly to familiarise itself with the way the scheme has worked to date and the snags it threw up?  Are its proposals based on what happened during that period?  For example, I am sure we all know of several cases where the farmer's business had to be liquidated before payments could be made because, especially in the case of a long stay in a nursing home, the bills are colossal.  In some cases that creates a problem if there happens to be a member of the farm or business family who has a disability, which imposes a double penalty on them.  They have the problem of the disability and of an extraordinary bill that they cannot afford to pay other than by disposing of the assets and then there is a problem which falls back on the State eventually.  The legalities of it in the way the Bill looks to be heading could well tie them up in such a way that there is no resolution.  It could be passed onto the next generation or to the person who leases the property.  I do not know how that is going to work out.  I would be very worried because while there of course will be cases before the courts to determine how the legislation will work, that should not be unnecessary.</p> <p>  The first question I would like answered is the extent to which the Department has examined the way the scheme has worked to date, the snags it threw up and how they have been resolved.  Not all cases are dealt with in the same fashion, some are dealt with more sympathetically than others, depending on who the person is dealing with.  The important point at this stage is to realise that we are dealing with a vulnerable group of people in the very precarious situation of no longer being in control of a situation they had control of previously during their working lives. </p></speech>

The 2015 review considered the operation of the scheme from top to bottom and how all aspects of it worked, not just on this particular issue but all aspects.  That came up with a range of recommendations, one of which was on this issue.  The Deputy used the word "audit" but the Department of Health does not audit the scheme, so to speak.  We engage on a monthly basis with the HSE.  We have a specific structure set up with it to monitor implementation and not just the financial aspects but emerging issues coming up from the ground around policy and operation.  We do have a good understanding of how it operates and where issues may arise.  By and large many of them can be addressed on an ongoing basis.  We do have that ongoing dialogue because it is a very complex scheme and does provide a lot of value to people.  We are conscious of that and anything we can do in respect of examining its operation we do on an ongoing basis.  The review was the formal period when all aspects of it were covered.</p><p>Off the top of my head, I think the review came up with recommendations for 32 administrative reforms.  Almost all of those have been implemented.  We are looking at a number of other reforms that required further work, relating to farms and businesses and to other matters, which required a deeper review, which is ongoing.  That was probably the formal milestone of the review of the scheme in a nutshell.  We have constant ongoing engagement with the HSE and other agencies of the State about the operation of the scheme.  We keep a close eye on that and related issues that arise.</p></speech>

Mr. Redmond mentioned the viability of the scheme.  In the course of those exchanges of views with the HSE, what has been to the fore?  Has the concern been primarily for the viability of the scheme, with the necessity to get more funding from whatever sources are available?  Has the concern been to make it workable, accessible and functional?  What is the primary issue in that debate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.243" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Redmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019111300002#H00300"><p>I do not think that any specific issue takes primacy with regard to what we look at.  We try to look at it from every angle.  We have to put our minds back to the first principles of the scheme, namely, what it is about, why it was set up, what it intends to do and what it does.  It is to provide financial support.  As I outlined in my opening statement, it is a means-assessed scheme, so those who can afford to do so pay more and those who cannot get more State support.  That is the basic tenet of the scheme.  We have to understand that and protect that basic tenet of the underlying policy of the scheme.  That means that when we look at making changes to the scheme, especially changes to the financial means assessment, we have to try to understand what the consequences of those changes may be, not just for the type of change that we are trying to make but for the cohort of people to whom we are trying to introduce additional safeguards.</p> <p>  If we make a change to the treatment of a specific kind of asset for a policy objective, we have actually to meet that policy objective and the question of proportionality and relevance comes in.  We do not want to create a scenario where effectively every asset that anybody could have would suddenly be fair game in the financial assessment.  We would then be moving away from a financial means assessment of the ability to pay to this being just a payment scheme, which is not the intention of this scheme.  That poses significant financial challenges with regard to the scheme going forward if the doors are thrown open to all assets being excluded from the financial means assessment.  That has a significant impact on budgetary issues and the ability of people to access the scheme.  The reality is that the scheme is set up so that people can get access to nursing home care when they cannot afford to do so themselves.  Our primary objective with the legislation is to ensure that people can access nursing home care when they need it and are supported to do that.  Anything that risks that would be a significant problem for us.</p></speech>

Are the possible resolution or elimination of issues that have arisen and a means to resolve them primary concerns?  Have the number of situations where individuals have been placed in financial jeopardy as a result of the scheme and the manner in which it has been operated heretofore been brought to the Department's attention?  I am sure that everybody here knows a number of such people.  What degree of urgency arises as a result of identification of issues of that nature?</p></speech>

Some submissions that were made to the review group during that process are being used, such as those from the Irish Farmers Association.  Our primary aim in this has been to try to address the recommendation of the fair deal review regarding farm and business assets.  We have to be cognisant, when addressing that, that we do not create a difficulty for the scheme and undermine its sustainability.  We do not look at it on the basis of an approach to revenue raising.  This change increases the cost to the scheme itself and we have had to take that into account in our discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and in our own assessment of how this might work in practice.  Those considerations have to be part of any good policy assessment process.  Our primary concern has been to address the review findings in a way that protects the scheme and delivers on the policy intent and recommendations of the review.</p> <p>  The HSE is largely able to manage issues that arise within the existing framework.  Various safeguards are built into the scheme as it currently stands.  The Deputy has mentioned cashflow and the potential of people having to sell assets to meet the cost of their nursing home care.  A mechanism built into the scheme is the ability for people to take out ancillary State support, the nursing home support loan, which allows people's contribution based on their assets to be covered through a loan from the HSE, which means that they do not necessarily have to sell property when they go into care.  Other safeguards are built into that, especially regarding the family home.  When somebody leaves the scheme and the loan has to be repaid, there are mechanisms for where there is a partner or child, and some other conditions when people are living in the family home, such that repayment of the loan can be deferred for the time that that person lives in the home.  That safeguard protects against the family home being sold from under somebody.  Aside from the work that we have done on the heads of Bill, going back to 2007 and 2008, then the eventual introduction of the Act in 2009, there was much consideration of safeguards.  The nursing home loan provides an opportunity for people to be able to continue to avail of nursing home care if, for example, they have a high-value asset without having to sell that asset.  That important safeguard has existed since the beginning of the scheme.</p></speech>

I will talk to Mr. Redmond first.  I commend the work done by my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and the Department of Health.  Why is it taking so long?  Mr. Redmond mentioned it at the start.  There have been a couple of announcements.  The impression was given that this was a done deal, if the witnesses will excuse the pun, and we were all systems go.  Farmers' lives are on hold.  I know of many families who are holding off on making a decision about their future, waiting for this Bill to pass.  Why is it taking so long?</p></speech>

The Bill is complex.  We cannot look at the issue in isolation.  We have to look at the whole picture of the scheme, where we are going, ageing, the budget for the fair deal scheme in the future and all the legal complications.  Without having to cast our minds back to the situation that existed prior to the introduction of this scheme, with the old subvention scheme, part of the reason for the fair deal scheme being introduced and for that pseudonym being given to it was to try to correct some of the issues that existed previously, particularly with inequity in the scheme.</p><p>This can get very complex but one of the issues we have had to look at very closely is the constitutional element around equity, equal treatment and policy objectives or intents behind change in the level of treatment.  Treatment may no longer be necessarily equal but it would still be fair.  We have had to look very carefully at all those issues.</p><p> I do not want to bring up too much but, unfortunately, when we were in the depths of some of the very close engagement with our legal people in the Department and officials in the Attorney General's office, there were issues around the legal response to Brexit and all of that.  It did not help, in truth, and we lost a bit of time with it.  I do not want to put that up as a primary reason for this taking so long.  It is just very complex and we are trying to work our way through the issues as best and as quickly as we can.  We also have a duty to ensure that what we bring forward does not undermine or break the scheme in future or create difficulty for the people who need to access it.</p></speech>

My colleagues have asked the nitty-gritty questions that I was ready to ask but I ask Mr. Redmond to examine retrospection again.  It is very important.</p> <p>  I wish Mr. Healy well as he comes to the end of his tenure and say "well done" on a great few years as he represented the IFA very well.  The Teagasc survey indicates that 30% of farmers are over 65.  That is a large percentage and it may indicate that people are slow enough to pass assets to children in any event.  We cannot blame it all on the delay in the Bill, although we may like to do so.  Does the IFA advise farmers on how to do things legally or ease the process of passing on assets?</p></speech>

Mr. James Staines is our legal adviser and he is available to any of our people.  As the Deputy correctly says, 30% of farmers are over 65 and over half our farmers are over 55, with just 6% under 35.  There are a number of problems.  The first is the very low levels of income from farming and the Teagasc farm survey pinpoints that, particularly in the dry stock sectors where the direct payments account for over 100% of the average farm income.  Mr. Martin Stapleton is our farm business chairman and much of our lobbying is focused on trying to ease the burden of the transfer of farms.  This is one example but there are also inheritance tax and stamp duty incentives that we seek on a yearly basis.  All the members have attended our lobby days on such matters as it can be a very costly time for farmer families.  When people take over farms, other members of the family may need to be educated.  If a person takes over a farm now, it must look after two families, namely, that person's family and his or her parents.</p> <p>  We could say that everything we do is about improving the farmer's lot, income and making a farm more attractive to the next generation.  It is about easing the burden and cost of transfer.  Much of that involves providing advice through our staff network of offices around the country and people like Ms O'Sullivan being made available to these farmers.  This is a case in point where there is such fear.  I repeat our very clear requests.  I take Mr. Redmond's point that he hopes the drafting of the Bill will start soon but how long is a bit of string in that context?  With all due respect, "soon" can mean next week to some people and next year to others.  We would prefer a more definite period.  This has been going on for so long now and it has caused so much anxiety.  It was one of the key issues in my election campaign this time four years ago.  I went into houses where people were hamstrung by the cost of care.  We want the Bill to be drafted immediately because this has been going on for long enough.  If there are issues which are not clear now, I am not sure another four or six years will clarify them either.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony has correctly highlighted the issue of retrospection and we want that to be applied from July 2018, when the Government approved the proposal.  We also want the leasee to be included in eligibility criteria and for the clawback issue to be sorted out to avoid undermining the impact of an unknown cost of care on the future value of the assets.  These four requests are very clear and there is no more or no less.  We cannot be clearer than that at this stage.</p></speech>

What is the net cost to the country?  Will he give an overview of the average stay of a person in nursing home care?  How many people does this policy measure that we are awaiting affect?  How many people on an annual basis and overall will benefit from the measure?  I address this to Mr. Healy and Mr. Redmond.

A number of people are still on previous arrangements so the average time for people who are only on the new scheme would, I imagine, be slightly less than three years.  As for who will be affected by this amendment, the HSE captures quite high-level information on the people coming in and the nature of their assets, specifically their interest in productive farm and business assets, and there are some 700 people in the NHSS with a farm asset at the moment.  A total of 23,300 people are being supported under the fair deal scheme and that represents approximately 3%, which is along the lines of the representation of the general population.  If we take out the people who are currently availing of the sudden illness provision, there will be an immediate impact.  People in long-term care under fair deal, and who have an interest in a farm or business asset and have been in the scheme for in excess of three years, will be immediately impacted and they will be able to avail of the cap if they nominate the family successor and meet the conditions.</p></speech>

We imagine they might be attracted into the scheme, though we think they are a small cohort.  If they were to come into the scheme, there would be a cost as they would immediately be able to avail of the three-year cap.  We estimate 50 or 60 people in this category.  We also feel there is a cohort of people holding off on entering the scheme.  They may be availing of home support but now that they understand this proposal, they may be attracted into the scheme if they have some assurance as to the sustainability of their productive assets.  The cap will not take effect for another three years but there is an immediate cost if we attract that cohort into the scheme.  Three years from now, there will be a further cost when the cap is realised.</p></speech>

Approximately 3% of the client base have an interest in a farm but the number of farmers we believe to be in need of long-term care is slightly higher than 3%, at close to 3.4%.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.272" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019111300002#K01600"><p>I have made a detailed submission to the committee and I hope it will be considered.  It dovetails with the earlier presentation by Mr. Joe Healy.  The IFA made a valid proposal, which is that the test relating to farming replicate what is already in primary legislation in the way of agriculture relief.  It is of fundamental importance that there be consistency across government in this area because otherwise confusion will be created.  The objective of the provision before us is to remove current anomalies in the fair deal scheme and, therefore, it should not create other anomalies but if we do not take the agriculture relief as the definition, that is what we will do.</p> <p>  In his response to colleagues, Mr. Redmond stated that this was a land mobility policy, which should not be looked at in terms of the NHSS.  I appreciate where he is coming from but he is creating a further anomaly in the system and we will have to come back to amend this again as it will undermine the clear objective and policy of Government to provide for land mobility.  If the legislation is drafted as currently proposed, many people who would wish to go into long-term leasing will not do so because they will be discriminated against if they do.</p><p>In his defence of not moving from this position, Mr. Redmond stated that it would threaten the equity of the scheme and that there is a constitutional issue in terms of equity.  I am glad that he raised the issue of equity.  Taking the example that Mr. Healy gave, can Mr. Redmond explain the justification for the current proposals regarding the lease of land for the first three years?  We can argue about what should happen after three years, but I would like to tease out the position in regard to the first three years.  First, 3.5% of the capital value of that farm is taken into account under the NHSS.  Second, the rental income from the land is also considered income under the scheme.  Third, if that money goes through the older person's bank account, which in all likelihood it would, that money is considered capital on deposit.  This means the same land is charged for three times under the scheme.  I ask Mr. Redmond to explain to me how that is equitable, constitutional or fair.  </p><p> This does not only happen in regard to farm land.  It is also the case in regard to a private home.  Currently, there are five vacant homes in the ownership of elderly people in long-term nursing home care for every homeless family in this country.  The dots do not join up.  There are 9,000 vacant homes in respect of which the owners have gone into long-term nursing home care and in a bizarre twist of the current policy under the fair deal scheme, we are effectively banning the rental of these homes because they will be hit on the treble under the penalty system that is currently in place under the scheme.  This penalty is such that in the case of a house owned by an older person in long-term nursing home care, the capital value is taken into account at the rate of 7.5% per annum.  On top of that, if the house is rented, the income generated is also taken in account.  As I said, that money is likely to go through the older person's bank account, which is considered capital on deposit subject to charge at a rate of 7.5%.  </p><p> There are 9,000 vacant houses, some of which - it may only be a small cohort - families are prepared to rent out but the difficulty is that they would be subject to a charge three times.  This is not equitable.  It is even more bizarre that under the national broadband scheme 1,000 Mbps high-speed broadband is being provided outside some of these vacant homes that could accommodate families.  Infrastructure is being installed yet these houses remain vacant, with weeds growing around them.  This penalty is undermining the stated Government policy of trying to reopen vacant houses.  </p><p> Following on from Mr. Healy's submission, and as set out in my own submission, what we need is equity, fairness and transparency.  A property should be charged only once under the means assessment.  Under the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection non-contributory old page pension mechanism, where a capital asset generates an income, that income is taken into account.  For example, if a farm is leased out, the lease income is taken into account.  If the land is farmed, the income generated is taken into account.  If the farm is not being farmed or leased, the capital value of the land is taken into account.  A house that is the principal private residence is excluded under the social welfare scheme.  In the case of any other property, the capital value of the property or any income generated from it is taken into account.  I have no difficulty with people paying their fair share.  I am not seeking a sweetheart deal for farmers or older people; rather, I am seeking equity.  A property should be means assessed only once, not twice and definitely not three times.  This is the fundamental anomaly of the NHSS as currently applied in terms of the lease of farm land and the rent of houses.  </p><p> The argument will be made by the witnesses and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the way forward is to progress with what has been proposed and to revisit the issue another time.  The difficulty is that this scheme has been under review since 2012.  I had a commitment written into the programme for Government that this would be fast forwarded because of the failure to progress it over the four years prior to the drafting of the programme for Government.  Thanks to the support of individuals such as Maura Canning of the IFA, we have made progress.  I accept that the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has done a lot of work and each of the witnesses has done a lot of work in that regard.  I am aware of the barriers and bottlenecks they have dealt with in terms of other arms of government because I was involved at Cabinet in pushing through them.  Now that we have the opportunity to take anomalies out of the system, to introduce an element of fairness and equity into the system, we should do so.</p><p> I ask the witnesses to incorporate the definition of "agricultural relief" in the Finance Act 2019 into the provisions of this scheme and, in terms of capital assessment, to treat property equitably, as provided for under primary legislation for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  All we are looking for is equity in this area.   Conservatively, there are more than 50,000 vacant houses throughout the country.  The fair deal scheme boycott is one element in that regard.  Another element in regard to the blockage of these homes is the issue of probate.  People in County Roscommon and the adjoining county of Galway have to wait, on average, three and a half months for it to be processed.  If one is unfortunate enough to live in County Kilkenny, the process takes four and a half months.  In Cork city, it takes two and a half months and, in Waterford city, it takes three and a half months.  These are areas of the country where there is demand for housing yet the probate system is blocking the release of houses onto the market.  There are 1.75 million houses in the country.  We need to utilise them in the best way.  We need to work with older people and their families to unblock any blockages in that regard.  I hope committee members and officials of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will examine the blockage that has been created by the fair deal scheme and address the anomaly in respect of farm leasing.</p></speech>

On equity, as I have mentioned, it is important to take into account the purpose and the policy objectives of the fair deal scheme, including in the context of the heads of Bill that we have developed, and the situation prior to the introduction of the scheme.  I have read some of the Oireachtas debates on the introduction of the Act in 2008.  One of the main aims of the fair deal scheme was to correct the situation whereby people of similar means were paying different levels of contribution.</p><p>Part of what the fair deal scheme attempts to do is to provide a situation where a person pays a contribution towards his or her care based on the means he or she has.  Effectively, that boils down the more means a person has, the more one pays, and the less means one has, the less one pays.  What is being suggested would fundamentally move away from that, irrespective of the other policies that may exist and those other policies that exist in relation to other aspects of Government.  They have a particular policy intent and a particular policy objective.  I am not necessarily convinced that this undermines any of those.  I think this is a different policy intent.  The fundamentals of the nursing homes support scheme being based on financial assessment of means would be significantly undone if we were to do anything else in relation to that and would actually create a situation where we are back to a position again that we were in previously where one resident in a nursing home has more means than another but contributes less to the scheme.  That is the situation that the scheme tried to fix.  We have done well in terms of doing that and supporting 100,000 people in the past ten years.  Any move backwards in relation to that would create significant difficulties with the scheme.</p></speech>

I do not disagree with it.  I wholeheartedly agree that if one has more means, one pays more.  That is a fundamental tenet of the scheme, and should be a fundamental tenet of the scheme, but I vehemently oppose the fact that if one has a single asset that one pays three times for it.  Let me make it clear to Mr. Redmond.  The Department is drafting the legislation at the moment.  I do not know what the formulation of the House will be when this legislation goes through, but whoever the Minister of the day is bringing this primary legislation through the House, he or she will not be in a position to defend a situation where one pays three times for a single asset.  That is inequitable.  It is unconstitutional.  It is unfair.  I urge the Department to reconsider exactly what I have said while the legislation is being drafted to ensure that it provides the equity we all believe should be part of the scheme.</p></speech>

Deputy Naughten raised the issue of rental income.  That is a particularly difficult one, for the same principles I have outlined.  Currently, there is no income within the scheme that is treated differently from other types of income.  It would be difficult to try to segregate rental income and treat it differently and not have a situation where there is inequitable treatment.  That is a major issue.  I do not think that will work, in terms of the way the scheme is set up and what it is intended to do.  That goes back to the issue of the cap and the precedent that exists in that regard.  It has been a feature of the scheme since day one.  We are working with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to look at, for example, the possibility of capping the proceeds from the sale of the home at three years.  It is an anomaly that can be addressed.  Currently, the situation with the scheme is that if one has the physical property one pays 7.5% of the value of the property for three years and then it is capped.  If one decides to sell the property either before going into care or when one is in care the cash proceeds from the asset are not subject to a cap.  If someone was in nursing home care for ten years, one would pay 75% of it.  There is definitely an issue in that regard.  That would be a barrier to people selling on the property.  We are committed to having a look at that.  It is unclear how quickly we can get through it, but it is our intention if people are in agreement that we could try to piggy-back an amendment to the scheme when the Bill is eventually debated.  That is something we can do.  One of the issues, more broadly, is trying to get good evidence and a good methodology in place.  This goes back to the issue of proportionality.  The rational process for delivering a policy objective is trying to understand realistically how many vacant homes are out there that are a direct result of a person going into long-term care.  Some data came out of the 2016 census.  The CSO has highlighted the difficulty in its disclaimers, for want of a better word, in that it was a small process that was done on an experimental basis.  We are working with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to see what we can do to try to get a better handle on what the figures might be and have a more robust methodology for looking at those.</p> <p>  The second part of the equation is trying to understand what is the realistic benefit in terms of freeing up homes by making a change to the scheme.  That is a difficult one in itself because if one takes something like, rental income, for example, just because something is a possibility does not mean that people will follow through.  There may be a whole host of reasons for that, not least because what we are talking about are people who themselves may not be vulnerable but who are in vulnerable positions in terms of being elderly in a nursing home with various medical and other needs, but I am not sure how likely it would be to happen on a large scale that they would take on the role of landlord and all of the legal implications and responsibilities that has.  That is an important aspect when we look at this issue.  The more important piece is trying to segregate a particular type of income and treat it differently from every other income and have the situation we had previously where people of different means were paying different contributions but not based on paying more because they have more means but paying less because they have more means.  That would create a very fundamental unfairness in the system.</p></speech>

The statistics I have given in terms of the 9,000 are from the HSE and relate to the nursing homes support scheme.  They are on foot of a reply to a parliamentary question.  I believe many older people and their families do not want to rent out their properties.  That is fair enough.  That is their own decision.  It is very hard to know what the impact will be until one does something.  However, the fundamental issue is that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has a very equitable, fair and defensible system of calculating income but in the nursing homes support scheme we are saying that if one has a particular type of income, then one pays for it three times.  That is wrong.  That is inequitable.  It is immoral and needs to be changed.  All I am asking the Department to do is to look back over what I have said this morning, look at the legislation in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and bring a bit of fairness into the fair deal scheme.</p></speech>

Following on from Deputy Naughten's comments, there has been much talk back and forth and the point has been laboured.  I do not think anyone is suggesting that anybody should be treated in an unfair manner.  The point is that it is the assets that are being treated differently.  I do not think anyone is suggesting that someone from a farming background should be treated more favourably than somebody coming from an alternative background.  The point being made is that the asset has potentially been targeted three times as part of the calculations.  I want to make sure that we do not have to go back over it another three times.  The point is very clear.</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Healy's four asks.  I do not think they are too much.  The cost for people in farming communities of the lack of mobility and paralysis on this issue cannot be overstated, as it has had real-life impacts for people who are trying to succession plan as part of their lives in rural Ireland.  I agree in particular with the back-dating of any proposal as compensation for the stagnation that has occurred with the progression of this legislation.</p> <p>  I do not wish to go back over the exact same points as anybody else, but I know the Department is in contact with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government about leasing or renting properties.  I have a slight concern with Mr. Redmond's assumption that everybody that is in a nursing home is not of sound mind or that there is a vulnerability there.  Many people have extensive support networks and, with all due respect, it is their families that stand up for them and their communities.  I do not think we need to classify them as a particular type of vulnerable person here this morning.</p><p>The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government was mentioned.  I have been informed by the Minister that it is considering this as an option to free up the supply of stock.  I imagine that there may be issues of suitability.  For example, many rural homes might not have insulation or be retrofitted and, consequently, might not be fit for rent.  That is a decision for the family, though.</p><p> In terms of the all-of-Government approach to climate action, has this matter been considered?  The witnesses might think I am being a bit out there in this, but there is supposed to be carbon checking or a climate response from every Department.  Some years ago, there were initiatives to incentivise the leasing of land to improve land mobility so that younger or more progressive farmers would not need to go to a bank and seek funding that they might not get.  I am sure that the departmental officials are fully aware of those tax incentives to encourage the leasing of land.  It has been referred to as income, given that the leased asset is considered in the calculation.  Without making broader statements, and perhaps Mr. Healy will agree, a younger farmer tends to be qualified in the areas of the beef genomics scheme and all those other progressive actions we are taking in agriculture.  The role that rural Ireland and farms in particular have to play in our decarbonisation is so important that we cannot do anything that in any way disincentivises people.  The number of leases that have been taken up has doubled to 10,000 as a result of the policy of encouraging land mobility.  If we do not make the modifications that are being asked for today, we will not be climate proofing this policy and it will make moving into the farming sphere less equitable and fair.  The younger, more progressive farmers will be penalised and, therefore, we as a country will not get the benefits that we should from their progressive methods and standards.</p><p> I am concerned about the five-year clawback.  There have been a couple of instances of people not meeting the five-year threshold.  A line must be drawn somewhere, but is there an appeals system?  If something happened in a family four years and 360 days ago, would a sliding scale apply or would it be completely black and white?  Is any compassion shown if people are in a difficult situation with, for example, a sick family member?</p><p> I am informed by the IFA that 86% of farmers have no succession plan.  That is worrying, given that they are the custodians of most of the land that will trap the carbon.  As such, the issue under discussion is being looked at in a silo rather than as part of the overall solution for the country.  Has the Department considered this matter in its planning on the legislation?</p></speech>

Everyone with a broader stake in farming and agriculture recognises that.  The IFA mentioned its recognition of it at this meeting.  In the context of the fair deal scheme, a major solution to many of the issues around the continued viability of farming is to plan ahead, plan well and effect that succession planning as early as possible.  This important point needs to be made.  It has been an in-built incentive in the scheme from day one.</p> <p>  The five-year period is black and white under the primary legislation.  In that light, I do not know what allowances would be made in practice if someone was at four years and 364 days.  I can check it out with the HSE.</p></speech>

They might prop mammy up at home until they reached it.  That is not good policy.  The older person should be the focus.</p></speech>

Looking at it from a different angle, though, if people can divest themselves of all assets before they enter the scheme, the scheme will cost whatever it costs and people will not get access unless we find a pot of money that can live with that additional cost.  There are issues in that regard, so it is a question of trying to strike a balance.  The five-year period was decided on in 2009 to strike that balance and give people an opportunity.</p> <p>  Regarding the Bill's head on transferred assets, the three-year cap can apply to transferred assets on the condition that they have gone to a family successor.  We have tried to move that forward a little while also protecting the integral part of the scheme and the sustainability of what it is trying to do.</p> <p>  To be honest, we have not given climate action consideration.  This is a financial support scheme and I understand that-----</p></speech>

Everything is supposed to have that consideration.  There was a concerted effort to reduce fragmentation - pockets of land - and make things more efficient, but some of this Bill will have a negative effect on that policy.  I cannot see how it is not a consideration.  I would like the Department to consider it.  The people who are taking over these farms are the people with the hedgerows, the grasslands, the land that will be planted, GLAS and so on.  They are the ones on whom we will be dependent to decarbonise our economy and to cool the environment.  There are positive benefits to efficient, progressive farming, larger farms and making it possible for younger farmers to afford to get land without buying it.  We must consider all of that if we are serious about the climate issue.</p></speech>

To qualify for the cap, one must have a family member who is working the farm.  The basic policy objective is to protect situations where the family farm is passed on to the next generation to work the land and to avoid the uncertainty of an open-ended contribution towards nursing home fees.  What we have proposed addresses that.</p> <p>  If people for whatever reason do not want to or cannot work their land, there is an opportunity to transfer that asset in good time and have it in someone else's productive use.  The scheme does not undermine that.  An important aspect is how it presents people with a range of choices about how to manage their land and affairs.  We must also consider the scheme in a broader context than just farm and business assets.  If we make it the case that one could have any asset, be one working or not-----</p></speech>

If the land is not leased and is left fallow, there will be an issue.  Active farming of the land and the maintenance of biodiversity and so on that farming communities do are important.  The point of the incentives some years ago to promote leasing and land mobility was to make the farm an equitable business.  In consideration of the leased land as an asset, and for the purposes of calculation, it almost undoes the good of the previous policy objective.  </p></speech>

As we are all well aware, this matter has been ongoing for several years.  I call the fair deal scheme for farmers the lousiest deal in the world.  They are being militated against and a bush has been put in their way to access the fair deal.  So much wrong has been done to them that it is unbelievable it is happening in a democratic country such as Ireland, and that it is being allowed to continue.</p> <p>  I call it a debacle.  We thought we had brought it to a head in July 2018.  Our Rural Independent Group, of which the Chairman is a member, called a vote in the Chamber on the matter at the time.  The Government and its supporters voted against it and Fianna F&aacute;il abstained, but I am glad to say Sinn F&eacute;in and small groupings of parties ensured that we had a majority and the Government would have to address it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, seemed to be receptive but it is clear that other forces within the Government are resisting it.  The finance of the fair deal scheme, for this year alone, has been under threat.  People qualified for the scheme and submitted their application but were then told they would have to wait until funding became available.  It is clear that what is happening is the funding is not available for the fair deal scheme and, therefore, the crowd will block it or try to extract as much as they can from farmers.  It is ridiculous.</p> <p>  We had a notion that a three-year cap would be put in place for farmers accessing the scheme.  The position that obtains, whereby the applicant must pay 7.5% of his or her assets, applies in cases where he or she is the sole owner of the farm.  In rural Ireland, it may be that one person owns the farm even though he or she is married, or in a couple or whatever, and it is often the case that the other person's name is not on the farm.  A figure of 7.5% is charged, which, multiplied by five in the case of a &euro;500,000 farm, is &euro;37,500, although, as Mr. Healy will be aware, one would not buy much of a farm for &euro;500,000 in today's world.  A young farmer, who might be a woman or man trying to continue on his or her own, will be liable for that payment each year.  That is totally unfair and undemocratic.  In the case of everyone else in the country, if he or she has a house, it is only the value of the house that will be assessed for the scheme.</p> <p>  I met a man in west Cork a few months ago who had just bought a farm.  We all know that one must increase production even to stand still in respect of one's income.  The farm's value will be taken into consideration.  The man's wife has motor neurone disease.  She accompanied him to a wedding I attended.  She did not know exactly where she was but she was able to move around.  The man told me that in six months, she would have to move to a nursing home.  They have a young family and he will have to contend with that.</p> <p>  That is what is being doled out.  It is a matter of like it or lump it, and one must pay the rate of 7.5% for as many years as possible, until someone caves in somewhere and agrees to the cap.  One matter the IFA may not have pushed hard enough, which I resent, is that the full value of the farm is assessed but it should not be.  It is very unfair.  In most other instances, only the family home is assessed.  Someone suggested that farms be passed on in good time but when is a good time?  People get sick when they are 30 years old, in their mid-20s or when they are 40.  Should one pass on the farm 20 years early?  Most people believe they should retire in their mid or late 60s.  Should people hand over their farm before they turn 40 years of age?  That is ridiculous to entertain.  The matter is simple.  The Government can keep putting bushes in the gap and say farmers cannot qualify if they will not farm the land for six years after the owner has gone into care or has accessed the fair deal scheme, or that the person in charge of the farm at the time cannot rent it out.  It is ridiculous.  Take, for example, a man who is seriously injured.  Farming is a physically demanding occupation.  If something happens and the man must move to a nursing home, his wife may have a young family who must be minded and she may have to get a part-time job to try to keep food on the table.  If she is told she cannot access the fair deal scheme because she leases it out, that should not be entertained.  If that is shoved down people's throats, they will not take it because it is just not fair.</p> <p>  I have nothing against Mr. Redmond or any of our guests.  I accept that it is a combined effort of the Government, which resists giving farmers a fair deal when they get sick or must access a nursing home.  It is a combined effort of the Government and, perhaps, Department officials, although I do not suggest it was the fault of any of our guests.  When a chairman or member of a company becomes sick, is the value of all the parts of the company or business taken into account in the same way that a small family farm is hit when someone wants to access the fair deal scheme?</p><p>I hope it is not just farmers who are being hit by this.  I ask for an answer to my question.</p></speech>

The Deputy's point is well made, as were the points made by all the other speakers.  I have repeated our asks.  They are simple and straightforward for a number of reasons.  We have given examples, and Deputy Naughten repeated them, of the rules that apply in other Departments and parts of Government.  We look at the inequity of excluding farmers who lease their lands when it is a measure recommended by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in a number of other areas, as I outlined in my opening statement.  From a Government point of view, we need to see consistency through the different Departments.  If consistency were applied, it would solve many of the problems we have been discussing.</p></speech>

We have looked at these issues in great detail and it is not as simple as just applying the measures suggested.  Deputy Healy-Rae raised the issue of sudden illness, which is an important point.  In 2009, when the original Act was being developed and debated, that was an issue that came up in great detail.  A clause was included in the scheme at the time providing that, in circumstances where a farmer or business operator, through no fault of their own, experiences a sudden illness or disability, for example, as a result of an injury, the three-year cap could apply provided he or she has been operating the farm or business and a family successor continues with it in his or her stead.  That has been a feature of the scheme.  What we are trying to do with the amendments is to build on that feature and broaden it so that the sudden illness and disability clause is not required.  We have moved on that position.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about companies.  This goes back to a current that runs through this morning's discussion, namely, the issue of equity.  One of the challenges is to segregate a type of asset for a particular policy purpose and to treat it differently from other assets.  That is what we are doing here and that effectively exists already in the scheme, with the sudden illness clause.  That also has to be consistent in terms of businesses and companies that are not farm-related.  That will continue to exist in the scheme under this proposal.</p> <p>  Somebody who is operating a business will also qualify for the three-year cap if he or she meets the same conditions that would have to be met if he or she was farming land.  One thing that differentiates businesses is that where a business is a limited company, the assets of the company are not the assets of the person.  By and large, these assets are not taken into account in the financial assessment, although the person's share in the company may be taken into account.  The assets of a limited company may not be taken into account because it is a separate legal entity.  All of that exists in the scheme and we are broadening it with this amendment, particularly in removing the requirement to have suffered a sudden illness or disability.  That is the angle we have taken in trying to build on that.</p> <p>  There are other safeguards built into the scheme as well, some of which we have discussed and some of which we have not discussed.  For example, the Deputy mentioned couples and farming families.  There is an asset disregard of &euro;72,000, which means that in the case of a coupe, the first &euro;72,000 is not included in the financial assessment.  There are other safeguards in the scheme to try to create a level of fairness around issues such as that.</p> <p>  To return to the discussion with Deputy O'Connell on the issue of people's vulnerability, I was not suggesting that because someone is in a nursing home, he or she has, by default, some level of vulnerability.  That is not the point I was making.</p></speech>

Is the value of that borrowed farm taken into account or will it continue to be taken into account and assessed if new provisions are made for farmers?</p></speech>

However, there are a range of allowable deductions in the scheme, one of which is interest on a mortgage in the purchase of an asset.  The interest can be discounted from the financial assessment.</p></speech>

It is wrong that this will be calculated as part of the assessment.  We know farmers have done their best through the generations to hand the farm on to the next generation in as good or better condition as when they got it in the first place.  Insisting that someone who accesses the fair deal scheme must pay back &euro;7,500 on each &euro;100,000 of the value of the farm land would mean that &euro;35,000 per year would be paid for three years in the case of a farm valued at &euro;500,000.  That would place a burden of &euro;105,000 on a young farmer trying to take over a farm who would be behind as soon as he or she starts out.  Credit is hard to get from banks and the other lending institutions.  What this will most likely mean for young fellows who find themselves in this situation is that they will have to walk away and sell the farm that was handed down to them.  The farm may have been in the family for five or six generations.  Is that what the Government will allow to happen in this day and age?  It is not fair and should not be the case.</p></speech>

Any asset that has been transferred over five years before someone goes into nursing home care is disregarded and not included in the financial assessment.  I have said already, as have others, that I would strongly encourage all those who are involved in farming or a farm business to plan ahead, consider their succession options and put in place mechanisms for succession.  If they do that, much of this conversation will have been unnecessary.  We know that for various reasons and through no one's fault, that is sometimes not possible but, by and large, it is possible with good planning.  I encourage as many people as possible to do that because we will not have to consider the asset within the financial assessment.  It comes back to the purpose of the scheme, which is to provide financial support.</p><p>The State provides financial support to avail of nursing home care which is based on means.  Those who have income and many assets pay more.  That is the basic principle of the scheme.</p></speech>

However, we do not know at this point how it will shape up.</p> <p>  Part of the funding we secured in budget 2020 was to allow us to commence a programme of rigorous testing of different approaches to the statutory homecare scheme and the delivery of homecare under the new scheme in 2020.  The testing programme is being developed between the Department and HSE and some of these issues will be looked at in that context.  There are probably some issues that are quite natural and which may not have an impact.  I cannot say for definite until the process is completed, but the expectation that somebody will pay 80% of his or her income while still living at home, compared to somebody living in a nursing home in which a certain amount services are provided, including bed and board, is not likely to be compatible.  It is a key feature that we will have to examine.  It will all start to become more apparent next year as we work through the testing programme.  My understanding is we will test slightly different approaches in different areas to build a profile of what will actually work under the new scheme.</p></speech>

I am conscious that this has been a long session and that they have been here for longer than I have.</p> <p>  On the question of vulnerability, we should not hesitate to acknowledge the fact that we will all become vulnerable as we grow older.  People are in nursing homes precisely because they are vulnerable.  That is why this is an important debate.  Mr. Redmond was kind to acknowledge and clarify this, but it was probably not necessary for him to do so.</p> <p>  I return to the question of extending the eligibility criteria to include a situation where land is leased.  I apologise if I am cutting stubble.  On the one hand, the tax incentives for long-term leases are to achieve the particular policy objective of promoting land mobility.  Mr. Redmond considered the different policy objective of ensuring families could be enabled to continue farming a productive asset.  He stated these were two different policy objectives and that he was considering them together.  Speaking about family vulnerability, I am somewhat close to this problem, but I do not know how extensive it is.  However, it seems that families sometimes lease land in order to be able to continue farming a productive asset.  I am thinking of people who are caring for a person in the home.  While it might become a more challenging task, they might want to continue to do so for as long as is possible.  It might be in contemplation of the possibility that at some point in the future nursing home care might be required.  One might have a situation where a family would prefer to lease land for a period to allow them to focus on the provision of care and cope with something that could be challenging.  However, they are prevented from doing so because if they have leased land, at some point in the future when they seek to avail of nursing home care, they will not be able to avail of the cap.  Is that not an anomaly?  Is it not very unfair?  Does Mr. Healy agree with me that it is one of the possible range of scenarios that might arise?  Is it correct that there may be cases where people want to lease land precisely to postpone the day when they will need to avail of nursing home care?  This is an issue that needs to be taken into account.  What is the fundamental objection to extending the eligibility criteria to include leased land?</p></speech>

To recognise certain situations, we have introduced a measure whereby one only needs to have been working it in three of the past five years.  The reason for this is to address some of these issues but also to be clear on the fact that one has to show some intention.  The real plan is that one will work the land or that one&rsquo;s family successor will.</p> <p>  Again, it is one thing to look at one policy and its objective and another to look at another policy and its objective.  We have to look at all of the consequences in dealing with these issues which are necessarily directly related.  If one is talking about leasing, one is talking about something which is passive in terms of a person's involvement.  A person leases land, but by default he or she does not have to do much with it.  The issue is that potential applicants have a range of assets such as stocks and shares.  All of their assets become qualifiable under the conditions of the scheme.  That is one of the major dangers.  One would end up getting to a situation where all assets would be capped.  That would have a significant impact on the sustainability of the scheme.</p> <p>  Part of what we are trying to do is recognise some situations and deliver on the recommendations made in the 2015 review.  At the same time, we have to be cognisant of the need to protect the scheme for what it is and its basic principles, as well as ensuring people can continue to be supported into the future.  As I stated in my opening statement, we are conscious of the ageing demographics and what lies ahead.  Anything that undermines the sustainability of the scheme is not good for citizens in a general sense.</p></speech>

Leasing has become an integral part of succession and is recognised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Finance and across government.  It is incredible that there is a reluctance to treat it in the same way for the good of the scheme, agriculture and succession, as well as in ensuring land is well looked after and put to productive use.  That is the argument we are making.  We have the Bill, the leasing issue, the clawback and the issue of retrospection.  They are the four key issues.  There has to be an acknowledgement that leasing is a central part of succession.  That is what we are asking for as part of our four requests.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and all public representatives.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae referred to the IFA.  When all is said and done, it is a lobbying organisation.  Public representatives have the power to ensure it will be pushed at the various levels.  That is what we are asking the committee to do for us.</p></speech>

We have submitted our written statement, which we have been advised is very lengthy.  Therefore, we will endeavour to condense it in our presentation.</p> <p>  The issue of staffing in the health service is one on which we have been campaigning for more than a decade.  It involved us taking strike action earlier this year.  The issue still remains a major one for our members both in the hospital sector and in the community sector.  The main issues particular to nursing and midwifery are that nursing and midwifery as professions have a worldwide shortage.  We set out in the submission that the issues we face here are not unique to Ireland but, unfortunately, we have to work much harder to maintain our level of staffing and particularly to retain our graduates once they qualify.  We qualify 1,850 graduates a year and we will manage this year to hold on to approximately 900, which is good.  That is an improvement on previous years but, obviously, it is not good enough.  We have set out the turnover rates in our submission and there is considerable detail on that, which I would like to go through with the committee, if that is okay.  In the submission, we go through the global shortage and set out exactly what that means, which is that each country that requires nursing and midwifery is basically recruiting from the same pool.  We are largely dependent on the non-EU workforce made up of nurses who come from the Philippines, India and Nigeria.  They are the three top countries and are the countries on which the American countries, Canada and Australia also rely.  The recruitment costs are quite expensive for obvious reasons.</p><p>We must send teams to interview and then ensure that when we recruit, we provide accommodation for a period of time.  A stipend salary is also provided, estimated at a cost of &euro;11,000 per person, prior to taking up a job in the health service.  In the meantime, a recruitment pause was introduced in May, although the HSE continues to deny there is a pause.  In fact, it is very evident, including in the front-line workforce, and presents a real problem.  The circular issued by the HSE to service providers on 20 June states:</p><blockquote>- No new posts [other than those approved and funded developments via the existing national control process] or replacement posts can proceed to offer stage or be put onto the payroll in any CHO, HG or [section] 38.<br /><br />- No career break returnees or any other returns which are at the discretion of the employer can be allowed to take place during the period [this control] is in force.  Also, no increases to weekly hours of staff who are not already working full time can be allowed to take place or approved during the period that [this control] is in force.  Reductions to weekly hours can proceed.</blockquote><p>This means that we have applications from nurses to return from a career break and that they are being denied and that they are sitting at home.  Under the career break scheme, the employer has the right to postpone the return date by one year but must then lawfully take the employee back.  Unfortunately, we are absolutely crippled by the recruitment pause.  Our members report daily that they are working with completely inadequate numbers, that they cannot provide the required care and that conditions are unsafe.  Their physical and mental health is being affected to an absolutely unprecedented and unacceptable level and no one can be recruited because of the introduction of the pause.  It affects one third of the workforce and the turnover within the nursing and midwifery professions will be higher than in any other profession because of their numbers.  Therefore, they will be affected by the pause to a greater extent and that is what we are witnessing.<br/><br/>We cannot open additional beds.  We have had the overcrowding of hospitals reported this week at a figure of just over 100,000 people who are sick enough to be admitted to hospital and who require hospital care but for whom there are no beds.  It is an absolute scandal.  The figure is increasing week on week and we have been reporting it daily.  We view that reporting as a very important part of our role.  We do it in order to highlight that the health service is not working in the way it should be.  It is now a dangerous place to which to be admitted.  We have recently met groups that have reported to us that the admission of the elderly population, that is, those who are over 75 years of age, is at a higher rate than for those under 75.  They have nowhere else to go in certain circumstances because community step-down services are not available.  As there has been a decrease in palliative care services, people are being admitted to emergency departments and dying on trolleys.  That is not the service in which our members want to work and provide care or for which they want to apologiese continuously.<br/><br/>When we talk about workforce planning, we say there are a number of solutions.  In 2017 we presented all of these arguments to the Government and exhausted the machinery of the State through the WRC.  We reached an agreement which required an annual service plan and a workforce plan to be developed and funded by November each year.  The only year in which this was actually achieved was 2017.  It was ignored in 2018.  We met representatives of the HSE yesterday evening and it does not have a workforce plan for the professions of nursing and midwifery for 2019.  That makes it two Novembers for which we do not have a workforce plan.  What we have is a very serious restriction on the ability to recruit.  The memo of instruction, dated 20 June 2019, from the financial officer of the HSE requires that for any post that becomes vacant for whatever reason, for example, if someone retires, resigns or takes a period of leave, the replacement to be sanctioned by the chief officer or the head of the hospital group.  That is one person who must sign each form that eventually reaches that level.  Can the committee imagine the delays in this process, considering the size of the workforce in the health service?  There are approximately 70,000 staff in the acute hospital division and there is a turnover of staff.  Obviously, this introduces significant delays.  As late as Tuesday of this week, we were receiving reports from the directors of nursing in Cork University Hospital which is extremely overcrowded that they had been waiting for nearly three months for a response to the request that posts be advertised that had become vacant.  We had to intervene again this week in the matter of unfilled public health nurse posts in east Galway.  Services for the public are affected.  For example, when patients receive chemotherapy at home, they require a public health nurse.  The directors of public health nursing are saying such a service will have to cease because we cannot replace nurses.  <br/><br/>These are very real issues for citizens who are dependent on the public health service.  Until someone is in an overcrowded emergency department or ward, it is difficult to understand how serious the problem is and how serious the consequences are for those being cared for in areas that are overcrowded, with staff who are absolutely stressed and trying to provide a service that is safe.  It is simply not possible to do so.<br/><br/>We are delighted to be here to highlight these issues, but we believe a number of very practical solutions can be introduced immediately.  We ask the committee to make representations at the highest levels of government in that regard.  We must immediately bring an end to the current recruitment pause, particularly in the nursing and midwifery professions.  Once it ceases, there will be a ripple effect in recruitment for approximately six to eight months.  That is how long it takes to recruit to the professions of nursing and midwifery.  We also need to consider in the medium term increasing the number of undergraduate places.  We need to train more nurses and midwives at undergraduate level in order to have a steady supply.  As I said, we train approximately 1,850 across all disciplines.  We could accommodate a greater number.  We know, for example, that the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland registered 1,750 non-EU nurses in the last calendar year.  That is how many nurses are coming into the country to register to work in both the private and public sectors.<br/><br/>As part of the recent settlement of our dispute, we obtained agreement from the Government that it would fund the measurement tool to determine how many nurses and midwives were needed in hospitals in surgical and medical wards.  We have never had such a tool and it is Government policy to fund it.  It is called the framework for safe staffing and based on patient outcomes.  It was measured by a team of researchers led by University College Cork over two years in six wards in three hospitals.  What they concluded was that when the correct number of nurses were employed, the level of patient mortality and length of stay decreased, patient outcomes and retention of staff improved and the level of sick leave reduced, while there was a dramatic decrease in agency costs, all of which is good news and accepted by the Government.  The Minister for Health launched the policy, but it was not funded.  Therefore, as part of our strike settlement, we sought funding to be made available in this year's service plan for the nurse staffing framework.  As late as yesterday evening, we sought confirmation that this part of our settlement would be honoured because it is a huge plank and everyone agrees that it is right to base staffing levels not on funding but on patient outcomes.  Unfortunately, we have not yet received confirmation of the service plan, but we remind the HSE that the Labour Court recommendation that settled our dispute clearly sets out that funding has to be made available as part of this year's service plan, as well as the plans for 2020 and 2021, to fully roll out the framework over a three-year period.</p><p>This annual funding for the workforce strategy on which we had agreement in 2017 must form a normal part of business for the HSE annually.  Otherwise, we will continue to be reliant on agencies and an <i>ad hoc </i>filling of posts and there will be an inability to open new beds to relieve the pressure on the acute hospital system.  The working environment of our members in hospitals and the community, particularly in overcrowded hospitals, is such that their health and safety is being deliberately interfered with by the policy that has been introduced by their employer.  That cannot continue.  We are happy to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019111300002#U00200"><p>I thank the delegates for their attendance.  We have been down this road several times.  I am well aware of the issues and recommendations.  I support all of the recommendations.  I hope to tease out through my questions where we are in practical terms.  Every day, I deal with the issues raised by Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha.  The two hospitals with which I deal most are University Hospital Limerick, UHL, and South Tipperary General Hospital.  It is like a perfect storm or Bismarck's nightmare.  They are two of the worst hospitals in Ireland for overcrowding.</p> <p>  Many people have contacted me regarding the recruitment freeze.  I tabled multiple parliamentary questions on the matter and asked questions directly and indirectly of Ministers and the chief executive of the HSE .  The answers I have received have all been rubbish.  One gets a standard reply stating that there is no recruitment freeze but, rather, a process through which the HSE is managing its funds.  That is rubbish.  It is a recruitment freeze aligned with a lack of retention planning and other matters on top of administrative burdens that have been put in place to slow down recruitment.  That is what is happening.  Nobody can tell me otherwise.  So many people have contacted me on this issue that I could probably take out my phone and get the details of 15 or 20 cases without having to check too hard.  The issue of those returning after leave is incredible.  I have had to contact hospital managers regarding cases where they stated they lacked nursing specialists in certain areas and I had people who were returning and wanted to go back to work.  In some cases, I had to embarrass the managers or argue that the staff needed to be taken on to fill the vacancies the hospitals are publicly stating exist.  In some cases, they were taken on.  It is a significant issue.  A modular unit in South Tipperary General Hospital will have to open in two tranches because the management cannot recruit sufficiently to staff it.  If the hospital manages to stick to its plan, 20 beds will be opened in January and another 20 will be opened five or six months later.</p> <p>  I have carried out a comparative analysis of statistics for two hospitals that are of the same scale and model, namely, UHL and Beaumont Hospital.  The Chair is well aware of my work on this issue.  There are 1,294 nursing and midwifery staff in Beaumont and 1,016 in UHL.  UHL has 349 health professionals compared with 527 in Beaumont and 228 support staff compared with 459 in Beaumont.  This matter is of such seriousness that it goes beyond politics.  I have never seen a situation like that in the hospital in Limerick this November.  I have no idea what it will be like there in January and February.  Several members of my family who have recently been in the hospital were left on trolleys for days or weekends.  Very elderly people have been left on trolleys.  Infection control is a significant issue there.  Patients have been moved to Nenagh Hospital to avoid infection.  That is not on.</p> <p>  The recruitment freeze must be lifted.  We need to deal with this issue immediately.  It has gone on for too long.  We need to address the recruitment freeze, the administrative burden and the lack of planning and so on.  I know the HSE and the Department of Health are watching these proceedings.  I am begging Mr. Paul Reid to deal with this issue.  I have written to him, spoken to him and questioned him.  My pleas have fallen on deaf ears.  I acknowledge he must try to meet his targets and do what he must do, but there must be other ways to reach those targets.  People are suffering badly.  The situation in Cork hospitals has escalated.  It was not too bad in previous years but the situation has been aggravated by a lack of specialist nurses in certain areas, in addition to other issues.</p> <p>  I have significant understanding of the issues and sympathy for those involved,.  My questions relate to details that could help us to formulate the necessary arguments.  I agree with the remarks of Ms N&iacute; Sheaghda.  Does she have statistics regarding geographical areas and specific hospitals that have the biggest issues?  She referred a slight increase in retention of graduates, which is to be welcomed.  What is behind that increase?  Is there a specific reason for it that we could push on a little more?  Does she have more information on the lack of places in step-down care?  Are there areas where particular issues have arisen?  It is definitely a problem in my area.  Has the INMO been consulted on the winter plan that is meant to be announced this week?  I have no idea what magic the Minister will come up with, but it will need to be magic.  If the INMO has been consulted on the plan, what is its opinion thereof?  Ms N&iacute; Shealghdha referred to a decrease in palliative care services, which is very disturbing and disheartening.  Have specific areas been affected in that regard?  I referred to the fact that beds in South Tipperary General Hospital cannot be opened because of a lack of nursing capacity.  The new modular unit should open in the first week of January but that seems doubtful.  I hope it will.  Are there similar situations elsewhere?  The workforce planning strategy was published in 2017.  Who initiated it?  Was it of benefit in the grand scheme of things?  I presume it was.  What has changed such that it has not been carried out in the past two years?  Is Ms N&iacute; Shealghdha aware of an example of its being of assistance?  I presume it was of assistance.  Why has it not been carried out since?</p> <p>  My hope is that the more we can focus on the areas, hospitals and policies that are not working and how they are affecting people, the more political traction we can get to deal with them.  Given where we are headed early next year, we need to deal with them urgently.  I am not being dramatic.  The statistics back me up.  This will be one of the worst periods in Irish healthcare.  A hospital clinical lead told me that the trajectory of overcrowding is such that he or she expects catastrophic events this winter.</p><p>What they mean by that is that people are going to die unnecessarily.  Would Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha agree with that statement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.335" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019111300002#V00200"><p>To answer the last question first, there is research that demonstrates that the period of time spent on a trolley causes the patient to have poorer health outcomes and unfortunately that means the patient is more than likely to have a very poor outcome.  That clearly is not good enough.</p> <p>  We sought the workforce plan as part of a dispute on the numbers of nurses and midwives employed in Ireland.  We have a maternity strategy that determines how many midwives we should have per birth.  We should have one midwife for 29.5 births.  That is the science and that is to ensure safe delivery of care to the mother and the baby.  We are now 220 plus midwives short of that target in all of our maternity units.  It is a national figure.  We know this.  The plan was put in place to recruit 90 in 2017 and the remainder in 2018.  The latest figure we have is that we are even further behind the 2017 figure than when we started because we have an inability to retain and to recruit.  This year when midwives graduated, we had to argue with employers to give them permanent jobs in Limerick, Galway and Letterkenny - throughout the country - despite the fact that the Minister for Health at our conference guaranteed that every graduating nurse would have a permanent contract.  That did not happen.  We recruited 900 because post strike, we concentrated on the low salary for the new graduates.  We have improvements to that, we explained that to new graduates.  We told them the salary is increasing; it is improving and the Minister for Health has guaranteed publicly that they would get a permanent job.  That led us to a situation in September where we had to argue, in many instances site by site, for the retention of our graduates, which is beyond comprehension.</p> <p>  The workplace plan does make a significant difference because those posts are funded and therefore the arguments about whether we can put the advertisement on the HSE website or whether we can recruit disappear.  The funding is there in advance, there is a set number and one's concentration is on filling the numbers set out in the workforce plan.  We had a very modest 1, 270 odd as a target for 2017.  The numbers who leave versus those who are recruited always leaves approximately 67%, onto which one must add.  If 1,000 nurses are needed, one needs to recruit 1,670 to reach 1,000 because the turnover through resignation and retirements requires that.  Very disappointingly, in the staff nurse grade according to the recent census, the numbers recruited since last December are down for that very reason.  The HSE will say it is recruiting nurses but what it will not say is how many left during the same period.  The margin is quite significant.  Consequently, one cannot take one's foot off the pedal for recruitment and retention in nursing and midwifery.  It is just too difficult to recruit without obstacles that an employer puts in.  If that is coupled with a moratorium or a pause, one will be going backwards for several years.  Unfortunately, we will be going backwards.  </p> <p>  As for the geographical areas, we have a lot of information from various hospitals.  There is no doubt but that the HSE sites are affected to a greater extent.  The voluntary hospitals, the section 38 agencies - the Mater, Beaumont, St. James's - use a much more sensible approach.  They try to recruit and retain and have a bit more autonomy in doing that.  In respect of the statistics comparing Beaumont and UHL, Beaumont's argument has always been that it is a tertiary referral centre for neurosurgery in particular, which requires a higher staffing level in some of its intensive care units etc.  It does a good job of trying to recruit and the committee will notice from the trolley figures that it has also done a good job in respect of trying to reduce the trolley count by ensuring, lobbying and getting additional capacity in the community in various units around north Dublin and that requires funding. </p></speech>

It is very simple.  If additional beds are required, as the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Sl&aacute;intecare report tell us we need, staffing needs to be planned around those and getting to that point.  We are not doing that.  In fact, we are doing the opposite.  We are closing the lid firmly on recruitment.  It is simply counterproductive.  The staff in our grades, nursing and midwifery particularly, are not hanging around.  They are going to the UK, and particularly now, with the emphasis on Brexit, the UK has become extremely active in recruiting from the Republic of Ireland on the basis that it is not getting nurses who will travel to work from other European countries.  We have a real problem.  The Deputy said that he has written to Paul Reid, we have written to him also.  We believe that the solution is very simple.  One should look at the 2017 workforce plan and do what is supposed to be done in accordance with the agreement we have under the Workplace Relations Commission, that is, an agreed, funded, workforce plan for nursing and midwifery.  If there is a need to pause, then one pauses but one makes sure those posts are filled because they are essential.</p></speech>

What has the HSE said about the recruitment pause?  The Minister has said there is no pause.  In Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha's opinion, what are the reasons for any slowdown or pause?</p> <p>  She mentioned that insufficient staff were available to staff wards and that there were beds available.  She said many beds are available that cannot be used due to lack of adequate staffing.  That is a simple question.</p> <p>  We had a meeting with the heads of services in our area in the past few days.</p><p>They seem to be optimistic about getting to grips with the situation in a much better manner than they had been able to do previously, for a variety of reasons.  Can Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha tell us about the extent to which and the manner in which staffing levels are affected by career breaks?  As she said, it has not been possible to allow people returning from career breaks to take up their permanent positions.  To what extent has that affected the delivery of services?  Where have such effects most often been recognised?  Which region has been most affected in this fashion?  On the question of recruitment and retention, can Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha give us an indication of the people who are most likely to be difficult to retain?  Are they people who have been indigenously recruited or people who have been recruited through overseas recruitment?  How does that affect the delivery of the service?  Does Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha find that it is more difficult to retain those who have been recruited from overseas?  Obviously, they may want to go back home.  Where do they go?  Has any of this been researched?  Do they go to other overseas countries?  I have some other questions that I would like to ask after Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha has answered the questions I have already asked.</p></speech>

There is a pause.  The memo of 20 June 2019 sets out the particulars around it.  No job can be offered and no recruit can be put on the payroll unless the correct process has been followed and the relevant form has been signed by the single national official who is in charge of this area.  That is a fair bar when we are talking about over 70,000 people in a service.</p></speech>

The point we are making is that a pause of this nature will have an effect on those grades that comprise a third of the workforce because the turnover happens more regularly.  The budgeting is the reason.  We are told that last year's overrun cannot recur this year.  All recruitment is being stopped as a very crude instrument until the budget is brought down.  I understand the relevant number at the moment is approximately 350.  That is what the target has become.  I will explain how the pause, which is affecting the front-line service, is manifesting itself.  Some of the bed numbers that currently exist have been reduced.  More importantly, we now have extra capacity on wards.  We record that on a daily basis.  As well as having additional trolleys in accident and emergency departments, there are additional trolleys on wards.  I will mention an example of the reduced volume of workers that was given to us as late as last evening.  Four nurses were supposed to be going on night duty, but instead there were just two.  They should have had 28 beds, but instead they had 32 because of additional trolleys.  It is simply not possible to provide any level of safe care in that environment.  That is not an isolated incident.</p></speech>

The staffing of those beds known as "surge beds" is a mixture of agency staff, which is very costly, and very poor staffing numbers.  According to the last figure we had, just under 460 beds are closed throughout the country.  We know from the Sl&aacute;intecare and ESRI reports that we are down approximately 2,000 acute beds, based on the projected need and the fact that community services have not been developed to provide an alternative to acute hospitals.  The Deputy asked what happens when people on career break are refused the right of return.  Invariably, they will work as agency staff.  In some instances, they will be employed through agencies.  In other instances, they do not work as a nurse for a period of time or they go to the private sector.  The point is that all of this is nonsensical.</p></speech>

We measure the number of staff nurses in the front-line grade, who normally work at the bedside.  We know that since December 2018, the number of staff nurses working in the public health service has decreased by 395.  We know the levers and we can measure that.  The last statistics in that regard are from 2017.  The number of overseas nurses working in Ireland is continuing at a pace.  Approximately 1,700 are being registered.  That includes the private sector.  We get those statistics from the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, which has to register people who request to work here.  We continue to be very dependent on our overseas colleagues to provide services.  The Deputy also asked about where nurses are being recruited to.  Nurses in general are being recruited to England first and to Australia second.</p></speech>

It does not matter whether they trained in Ireland or they trained in a different jurisdiction and have experience of working in the Irish system.  The Canadian health service looks to Ireland.  When I attended a conference in Canada recently, I met a nurse who worked in the Mater hospital for six years.  He is originally from the Philippines.  He was recruited from Ireland to Canada along with six other people from his community with whom he had been recruited to Ireland in the first instance.  Many recruitment agencies look at the Irish market with a view to recruiting nurses who were trained in Ireland and nurses who have experience in Ireland.  It is seen as a good place to recruit from.  When we introduce a pause, we make it more difficult to retain.  It makes absolutely no sense.</p></speech>

We will take it up again.  We will take it up with the HSE as well.  I would like to ask Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha about the need for more undergraduate places.  What is her view on the wisdom of increasing the number of undergraduate places here, bearing in mind the extent to which they tend to go abroad afterwards?  It is generally accepted that it is not rewarding, from the point of view of the delivery of health services in this jurisdiction, for large numbers of medical and nursing graduates to go abroad, perhaps after staying at home for a year.  A pattern must be identified as we look at what will happen if we end up handing over our graduates to the highest bidder after we have trained them.  That is where we are going.  We have dealt with this matter here.  At a meeting here not so long ago, we were told by the HSE that we have to compete with Canada, Sydney, New York and the Middle East every time a post is advertised.  In some of those jurisdictions, tax-free salaries of up to &euro;120,000 are available.  We cannot compete with that here.</p><p>In order to retain a reasonable staffing level and thereby provide a secure health service, how can we encourage graduates to remain here or encourage graduates from abroad to come here?  Must we train staff from overseas in our training schools to try to provide the service expected and, in the course of doing so, improve the quality of life for staff at all levels in the health service?  It is a convoluted way to ask the question.  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha has heard it before.</p></speech>

I am not mixed up at all; I am quite clear on this.  We have had representatives of the HSE here, asked the questions and got the answers.  We keep asking the same questions and getting the same answers.  How can we arrive at a situation whereby, by one means or another, be it recruitment at home or recruitment overseas, we can have an adequate level of staff, including nurses, medical staff and consultants, in our hospitals?  I appreciate that Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha has no function regarding medical and consultant staff.</p></speech>

As I stated, we had to work very hard as a trade union to ensure graduates  were offered posts this year.  That was following a commitment from the Minister for Health that they all would be.</p> <p>  There are two fairly simple solutions.  There is oversubscription in respect of school leavers applying to do nursing, which is good.  Therefore, we know that students in school who are considering their career choices still consider nursing.  Although the CSO figures indicate a drop, there is still oversubscription.  The point is that if we provide more undergraduate places, they will be filled.  We need to train more nurses and midwives but we also need to make sure that when they qualify, there will be jobs made available to them.  That is simply done.  We have put our proposal in this regard to the HSE in the past.  When nurses and midwives are trained, they become employees in their fourth year.  The get a contract of employment for 36 weeks.  That contract needs to be extended to include the first year after qualification.  It is simple.  It cuts out all the bureaucracy of recruitment.  The point is that the individuals are qualified and trained.  Once they pass their exams, posts should be made available to them in order to consolidate their training.  This would guarantee that they would stay.  If they do not, they will have a reason other than one we are currently battling, which is that posts are not being offered to them.</p> <p>  In the context of existing places, there are 920 for general nursing, 140 for general and sick children, 420 for mental health, 210 for intellectual disability and 140 for midwifery.  That amounts to 1,830.  As stated in our submission, the conservative estimate from the workforce planners involved the development of the new children's hospital is that we will need 300 sick-children nurses over and above the current number.  We are training 140 for general and sick children, which means some of them will remain in the general service after qualification.  That is a four-year programme.  Accounting for resignations, retirements, etc., we know this end that we will not have enough.  Therefore, we need to increase the number significantly in order to staff the hospital.</p> <p>  We stated in our submission that much of the debate has been on the capital expenditure on the children's hospital.  The workforce planning has not got an airing.  It needs to because, although a very expensive hospital may be opened, it may not be possible to staff it.  Therefore, some of the wards will remain closed.  Those responsible for staffing must be cognisant of the fact that each of the rooms in the wards will be different.  Being single rooms, a higher number of staff will be required.  This is particularly the case for a children's hospital.  That is a genuine issue.  There are two ways of dealing with that.  One is to recruit intensively now and do everything possible to retain every graduate within the discipline.  That includes removing all obstacles of a procedural nature that are introduced by the employer, including a pause in recruitment.  The second way involves increasing the number of undergraduate places to ensure supply will meet the need.</p></speech>

For as long as I can remember, no new institution that ever opened had an adequate supply of staff at the time even though the staffing requirement was well anticipated.  This goes back as far as the opening of Beaumont Hospital, which was a long time ago.  Beaumont was not open for about a year after it was built because of a lack of staff.  At least that is what we were told at the time.</p> <p>  The aspect that irks me most is the pause.  When it came, it affected all staff, even though this committee was raising time and again the need for medical and nursing staff to be prioritised.  I refer to front-line staff.  I do not expect Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha to answer this question but she can give me a hint if she wants to.  Who made the decision?  Was it the Minister, the HSE or somebody at mid-management level who believed it would be a good idea?  Has anybody been identified as the culprit in failing to prioritise recruitment to ensure the required levels of nursing and medical staff?</p></speech>

It is Government policy to stay within budget.  The HSE has issued the recruitment pause and all its properties by memo to the system.  It is not a secret.

From our perspective, the most important point we are trying to make at this committee is that there is a ready-made solution.  There is a pre-existing agreement indicating there is a need for a workforce plan that is funded to cater for the numbers of nursing and midwifery staff required to provide a public health service that is safe.  We are aware, although we do not like reporting it, that people are now afraid of going to public hospitals.  They are afraid of the waiting time and they are afraid that they will not be seen on time.  That is very unfortunate.  It should not be happening in 2019.</p></speech>

We are trying to keep St. Joseph's Shankill dementia care centre open so we had a big rally outside the gates.  I needed to be there.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the work of the INMO's members.  The current system is extraordinarily difficult.  Almost every interaction I have had with public hospitals and some of the community-based services - the nursing services - points to extraordinarily dedicated nurses and midwives working in what are becoming impossible conditions.  The circumstances were very difficult and demanding, leading to demoralisation and burnout, but I am now seeing conditions that are inhumane.  Ms N&Iacute; Sheaghdha used the word "inhumane" recently.  I acknowledge the work the nurses and midwives are doing to keep the system going in what are inhumane conditions.</p><p>I read through the INMO opening statement last night with a mixture of despair and frustration that the INMO needed to come here asking for something as basic as a workforce plan.  There are something like 30,000 nurses and midwives in the system and we have thousands of doctors in the system, and the idea that there is not a plan for training, recruitment, retention and promotion of nurses and midwives in our hospital system beggars belief.  As the INMO lays out, there was a Government commitment to do so.  Is it the case the HSE does not have a workplace plan for nurses and midwives for 2018, 2919 or 2020?  Is that essentially what the INMO is saying? </p></speech>

That was to be repeated in November 2018 and November 2019, and it has not been.  A workforce plan is grand in theory but it has to be funded, so the key is that we get a funded workforce plan.  The funded workforce plan for 2017 was fairly modest, considering our turnaround.  We know how many nurses we need to recruit in order to just replace those who retire and resign.  The workforce plan was designed in that year with the assistance of the WRC to ensure we at least broke even at the end of the year.  However, as I reported earlier to the committee, we know now that we are further behind in 2019 than we were in 2017.  For example, the maternity strategy required an increase of just over 240 midwives to maintain a safe level of care, given 1:29 births is the threshold.  Dr. Peter Boylan was on radio this weekend describing what it means for situations in maternity hospitals and general hospitals when there are two midwives looking after a very large volume of very seriously ill patients, and the consequences of that.</p></speech>

I apologise to the Chair if I am covering ground that has already been covered.  Given it is obvious a workforce plan is needed, given we are looking at one-year, five-year and ten-year thinking and investment in training, in graduate courses and in recruitment and retention, and given there is a commitment in place for that, and it is plain as day that we need it, what is the INMO's view as to why these commitments have not been honoured by Government?  It is something the Government committed to and something we obviously need.  What is the INMO's sense as to why the Government has reneged on these promises?</p></speech>

We can overrun in our capital spend but we cut back on the workforce because that is the only easy method of reducing the annual cost.</p> <p>  We are still running our health services on an annual budget.  We have challenged both the political system and the HSE itself on this.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report clearly states we cannot plan on a yearly basis when we have a service like ours, which has a growing elderly population and an increased cost of pharmacology.  We are very proud to work in a health service that develops and is developing new, innovative ways of looking after and improving population health.  Unfortunately, we cannot do that and then cut the workforce.</p></speech>

I said I am being contacted by nurses who are telephoning hospitals around the country, and I named various hospitals, and they are being told there is a recruitment ban in place.  I put it directly to HSE management and they said unambiguously there is no recruitment ban in place.  They then caveated that by saying that, of course, if they do not have X, Y and Z in place, they may not be allowed to hire anybody.  It is certainly my contention, but is it the INMO's contention that there is essentially a recruitment pause or ban in place at the moment for nurses and midwives?</p></speech>

It states that the mandated interim controls provide that no new posts, other than those approved and funded developments via the existing national control process, or replacement posts can proceed to offer stage or be put onto the payroll in any community health care organisation, hospital group or section 38.  That is a pause.  In fact, it is a moratorium - that is exactly what it is.</p></speech>

I thank Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha for that.  Some really good progress was made by the INMO over the last two years in terms of getting agreed safe staffing levels.  When I go into the acute hospitals, what the doctors and nurse managers say is that they do not have the nurses on the ward.  I was in a hospital recently and one nurse seemed to be doing all the work in two wards.  I looked and I thought that she looked very young, so I went and had a chat with her.  Of course, she is young; she is a student and not a qualified nurse.  The INMO made good progress in terms of the research and then, I thought, agreement with Government to get to safe staffing levels.  Certainly, I know my own anecdotal experience of our healthcare system and while it may be I am wandering into the least staffed wards around, I bet I am not.  Has there been any progress on getting to safe staffing levels for nurses and midwives?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.391" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019111300002#Y00800"><p>The Deputy is correct.  The progress we made, which is Government policy and which we were very supportive of, was the policy framework on safe staffing on surgical and medical wards for nurses and healthcare assistants.  This is a measurement tool that determines how many are needed.  When this framework was piloted in Beaumont, Loughlinstown and Our Lady of Lourdes in Drogheda, it proved to do a number of things.  The main one was that it cut the spend on agency staff significantly - from 100 to 30 was one of the examples given.  It improved the patient experience significantly, reduced the length of stay in an acute hospital, which is the most expensive part of our healthcare provision, improved retention of staff and improved and reduced burnout and sick leave.  It ticks all of the boxes from a patient perspective and from an economic perspective because it saves money.</p> <p>  The agreement, as part of our strike settlement, was that that would be funded in 2019 outside of the service plan to the tune of &euro;5 million and that, in the service plan for this year, which covers 2020 and 2021, there would be sufficient funding available to roll it out across all of the remaining hospitals.  We met the HSE last evening and we asked what is the progress, where is the service plan and how much is being assigned to the framework.  Clearly, if, in a strike settlement which covers from May to the end of the year, one is allocating &euro;5 million, one will need to allocate a minimum of &euro;10 million for a full year.  They were unable to tell us.  It is still, they tell us, a dialogue between the HSE, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We are very clear this is part of the strike settlement and it has to be funded and implemented.  Otherwise, it is a breach of the agreement. </p></speech>

That is being rolled out and nine co-ordinator positions have been advertised across the country.  Nine co-ordinators at nursing grade will oversee that.  The uplift at the pilot sites at Beaumont, Loughlinstown and Our Lady of Lourdes in Drogheda to meet the safe level of staffing has been maintained in the large wards and areas.  However, in some instances it has not been maintained because of the normal recruitment issues.  When the emphasis on the pilot was reduced, shall we say, funding then had to be found within the hospitals' budget.  This requires national funding.  It is national policy, agreed by Government and it was launched by the Minister for Health as a policy that will ensure good patient outcomes, safe levels of care and an economic way of staffing wards.</p></speech>

She loves her job and loves being a midwife.  She has undertaken all sorts of extra study, training and education, including completing a master's degree in midwifery.  She works in one of the Dublin hospitals.  She said that her job has gotten so difficult, the cost of living has gone up so much, congestion has gotten so bad and the conditions in which she is trying to treat mums and their babies are such that, with a very heavy heart, she is currently looking for a job in the local supermarket.  I talk to nurses on the wards and I keep hearing stories of nurses being burnt out.  This is particularly true in certain areas like emergency medicine.  We know there is pressure on the entire system but are there particular pressure points where it is becoming more difficult, where INMO members are under even more pressure than is the norm?  Are there pressure points in particular areas like emergency medicine, paediatrics, oncology or in certain parts of the country where, as a matter of urgency, we need to act immediately?</p></speech>

Nurse managers are now finding it extremely difficult to manage in a system into which they have no financial input and over which they have no control in terms of who is recruited, how recruitment takes place or even whether recruitment can take place, despite the clinical need.  The lack of autonomy of nursing managers is causing an increase in resignations, as evidenced by the statistics.  That is hugely problematic.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, because of the staffing levels, that is not always possible.  In fact, it is the norm for nurse managers to take a patient caseload as well as carry out their management functions and that is simply not possible.  That causes burnout.  Nurse managers tell us that in some cases nurses, some of whom are not even trained, are taking charge of areas.  Employment controls are in place and there are not enough staff working.  This means that nurse managers go on duty to find that instead of the six nurses required, there are only three.  Patient volumes have increased because the emergency department is overcrowded and there are additional trolleys on the ward.  What do the nurse managers do?  It is impossible.  If the nurse manager makes a mistake or if there is an omission of care, he or she will be referred to the registration body to determine fitness to practise.  That is the strain under which nurse managers are working.  It is inhumane.  That is the only word that describes it adequately.  The employer's health and safety obligations are being completely ignored in these circumstances.  The employer is obliged to provide a safe place of work for nurses and midwives.  They go to work with the aim of doing a good day's work but they are being prevented from providing safe care because of the moratorium.  The system does not discriminate positively towards front-line staff, which it should do.</p></speech>

I could also say thanks to the members of the INMO but everyone says that.  There is never a bad word said about nurses.  I do not know how many times people in my clinics in Swords, Balbriggan and elsewhere say that they do not know how nurses put up with it or how they do what they do.  However, it is getting beyond the point of being reasonable at this stage.  I was thinking earlier of the last moratorium on recruitment, of which Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha would have been aware.  She and I would have worked together at that time.  Again, it was the same story from Government in terms of denial.  As Yogi Bear says, it is like <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>all over again.</p><p>It is right that we focus on patients, 603 of whom are on trolleys today, according to the INMO.  We have already hit the 100,000 mark this year, which is an absolute shame on this Government, its policies and those who support it.  I am interested in the impact on front-line staff.  If one goes back to 2007, one of the issues that we would have raised at the time was the potential long-term impact of the moratorium.  Has there been any recovery from the 2007 moratorium?  I do not recall a massive uplift in recruitment in the interim that would have buffered us against this new moratorium.  It is not just this year's moratorium but also the historic impact of the previous moratorium that we are dealing with now.  If my memory serves me, the Government imposed a moratorium on the health service first and then on every other sector about two years later.  </p></speech>

We know that in some instances, albeit erroneously, they have committed to writing that there is a moratorium, yet they come in here and deny it.  Was there a recovery?  Are we working off a higher base than we would have been?  Was there a significant uplift in recruitment that would buffer us against this, or are we still falling from one to another?</p></speech>

The census figure for August 2019 was 37,998.  Of that figure, 882 were students in training.  That leaves us with about 37,116 qualified nurses, so we have not recovered.  That is the point we are making.  Introducing a pause to nursing and midwifery has a longer-term effect and it is very much an expensive game to be in considering the global shortage.</p></speech>

It is clear that there have been implications and we are living with them.  Regarding the impact of this on staff, my understanding is that there are a number of implications where there has been a failure to recruit and the staffing levels are low.  One is the cost of agency staff.  We know that this is only going in one direction.  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha might outline the figures if she has them.  If not, she can send them on to us.  The second implication is around the issue of the workplace becoming a dangerous place for workers.  There is a direct relationship between the levels of staffing and the levels of assault, so if Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha has some information that, I would appreciate hearing it.  I would like not just to find out the figures, because I know that there is an issue with healthcare professionals.  I know from my previous work that there is significant under-reporting of assaults.  We know that is happening.  Will Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha outline the numbers and types of assaults and their impact on the workplace, not just in terms of time lost but in terms of morale and the work environment for nurses and midwives who are up against it and indeed all healthcare workers?  Would that it were exclusive to one particular grade group or category of workers, but we see a lot of shortages among front-line staff.  Will Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha outline the impact this has on the workforce?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.423" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019111300002#AA00400"><p>Again, the Deputy is correct.  The correlation between assaults and staffing levels is well documented in nursing and midwifery across European and international studies that have proved that when staffing levels are reduced, unfortunately, assault numbers go up.  HSE assault figures are recorded by hospital group.  Traditionally, they would have only been recorded for the HSE hospitals with the voluntary hospitals being left outside of that, so we do not have a full figure but we know that 60% of all assaults are perpetrated against nursing, are recorded as being perpetrated against nursing and midwifery staff, and are on the increase.  The issues are that assaults are not confined to what we would have traditionally viewed as areas of concern such as psychiatry and emergency departments.  We see an increased incidence in locations such as children's hospitals and care of the elderly.  Again, there is no excuse.  It is a requirement of the employer to provide a safe place of work.  In particular, with regard to emergency departments, we have an agreement dating back nearly six years where security personnel must be employed.  Our members report to us that there are incidences when that is not the case, which is unacceptable.  Assaults constitute a problem that is increasing.</p> <p>  In addition, we have significant cross-infection in hospitals with which staff must cope.  Staff are becoming unwell themselves because of the incorrect overcrowding and all that goes with that when there is a contagious condition.  These are the well-documented consequences that are well known to the employer and the Health and Safety Authority.  The employer is obliged to notify the Health and Safety Authority when somebody is absent for three days as a result of an assault at work, so all those figures are available and known.  No more than anything else, the pause does not stipulate that the grades of nursing and midwifery be treated in a manner that is any different from any other grade employed in the health service.</p></speech>

To be fair, his response is that they prioritise the health and safety of staff.  Is it common for a security guard not to be physically present?  The response I sometimes get is that there will be a security presence in the hospital but it will not necessarily be in the emergency department.  Does the agreement referred to by Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha specifically refer to a presence in the emergency department?</p></speech>

Regarding the winter plan, and I know this was raised previously, will Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha outline best practice because we love that?  It involves best international practice and looking at somewhere where they are getting it right, where they are getting their winter initiative and planning correct and are bang on the money.  I assume they would publish their plans much earlier than we do.  My understanding is that it is expected next week.  I apologise if this question was asked previously but will Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha outline the level of negotiation that has taken place and the funded element of that if there is one for workplace planning?</p></speech>

We have requested that the winter plan be published towards the end of August.  The response we get from the HSE is that it is planning all year for the winter.  I am not being flippant about it but we know that the overcrowding figures have increased significantly this year during the summer.  They are moving towards 100,000 and it is early November, so we know that whatever plan is there is obviously not working.  We are advised that the winter plan will be published this Thursday, which is tomorrow.  We expect that there will be some announcement in respect of the additional provision of home care packages and services through the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  If there are announcements around additional beds at this point in the year, it will be impossible to staff those beds because the pause will remain in place and the pause has caused people who graduated in Ireland to make decisions around where they work.  We managed to increase the number of graduates who were employed, but not all of them were offered jobs and they do not hang around.  This is the point we made earlier.  Likewise, when a service is working short-term continuously, people do have choices and there is a really active recruitment campaign from the UK and the private hospitals in Ireland.  If the announcement indicates that additional beds, which we know are needed in community settings and in long-term and step-down care, will be made available, our fear is that it will be impossible to open them because the staffing crisis is such that we do not have staff to recruit to staff those beds.</p></speech>

Are efforts being made with the colleges to that end?  It would be an awful shame if any effort to increase numbers was only to the benefit of the private sector, as well as hospitals in Britain, America, Australia and everywhere else our graduates have gone.  Is this work ongoing with the colleges to build capacity?  Some of the colleges are full to capacity.  Is that plan in place?</p></speech>

I understand negotiations are ongoing with one private educational provider, but we are not privy to them.  We know that if jobs are available, people like to consolidate their training in the country where they have been trained.  There is the obstacle of making the job available, plus we know, thankfully, that school-leavers still consider careers in nursing and midwifery to be attractive.  The numbers applying for courses still exceed the numbers of places available.  Therefore, if the number of places is increased, there will be applicants.  The trick is, as we have said on a number of occasions, to make a contract of employment available in the fourth year when they become employees that will expand the initial period post-qualification.  That seems to be entirely sensible to us.  It would give us a ready and guaranteed stream of graduates every year.  The numbers of college places and the clinical placements have increased slightly since 2017 in specific disciplines.  There is a need to increase numbers, particularly, as we said, in children's nursing, intellectual disability and mental health services, as well as the general sphere.  The overall intake can and must be increased.</p></speech>

I note the discussions with the private educator, but I am not convinced that it will shore up the gap in any meaningful way.</p> <p>  I thank the representatives of the INMO for coming as I know that they are busy, but it is very useful for us to get the picture from the front line.  I thank INMO members for the work they do day in and day out.  We need to be able to get to grips with this problem and this is an opportunity to highlight the issues.  We need to start to hear about the Government's plans to deal with it as we are caught in a very expensive spiral.</p></speech>

Sl&aacute;intecare makes a proposal which is accepted for a regionalisation of the HSE into six regions based on hospital groups.  Will that make recruitment and retention easier?  Will it reduce the number of steps required to recruit somebody in the organisations?</p> <p>  On limiting recruitment, a moratorium or a pause, does the INMO believe the Department of Health and the HSE understand it is a counter-intuitive move?  Limiting recruitment will have knock-on effects.  There will be an increase in the levels of unmet need and waiting lists and poorer outcomes for patients.  Patients do not tend to go away.  If they are not receiving a service in one location, they will seek it in another, unfortunately, in emergency departments.</p> <p>  Is there still a pay differential for nurses?  If so, what effect does it have on recruitment?  Does the INMO believe nurses are valued within the system or are they seen as a resource, rather than employees?  Are they encouraged to advance their careers by increasing their professional education to gain extra qualifications which can be fed back into the system?  I understand there is very little financial support in that regard, as well as limited opportunities to take leave to attend education courses.</p> <p>  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha spoke about the recruitment of overseas nurses.  Did I understand her correctly that it costs up to &euro;11,000 to recruit an overseas nurse?  Surely that is-----</p></speech>

Are theatres closed because hospitals cannot recruit sufficient numbers of theatre nurses?  It feeds down through the system, with a backlog of surgical cases backing down into emergency departments.  What is happening in emergency departments is just a symptom of what is happening in the health service.  Because of what is happening elsewhere in the health service, community services and the supply of beds and recruitment, people end up in emergency departments unnecessarily and inappropriately in some cases.  Their progress through the emergency department is then limited because of the lack of bed capacity and recruitment.  I ask Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha to comment on these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.438" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019111300002#BB00700"><p>I will deal with the final point first.  Theatre time is not being utilised largely because hospitals are admitting a large number of medical patients to beds through the emergency department.  The majority of patients admitted through emergency departments are medical patients.  Therefore, the post-operative beds are simply not available.  One will often hear stories from patients who are taken directly from the emergency department to theatre and then to the recovery room in some instances for two or three nights because no ward bed is available for them.  That is impacting on patients booked in for elective procedures.  If no bed is identified, obviously they cannot be asked to come.  Many patients talk about elective operations being cancelled repeatedly because of the lack of availability of beds.</p> <p>  Theatre nurses are highly trained and skilled and in short supply.  While we have managed to keep numbers sufficiently above the threshold, the requirement to provide an on-call service impacts significantly on them.  As well as working a 39-hour week, they also need to provide an on-call service which in many instances takes them out of the service.  We need to staff theatres inclusive of the on-call commitment.  Basing it on a 39-hour week is not helping to determine the correct number because every single night of the week an on-call team needs to be available and in some instances two, depending on the specialty involved.  In some hospitals where maternity services are also a feature, if there is an emergency, the hospital might only have one on-call team to deal with an emergency and it might have an emergency obstetrics case.  It has become a significant risk in some hospitals, particularly those outside the maternity specialism.  Some hospitals cater for general admissions, maternity services and paediatrics all under the one roof and have one theatre on-call team, which is not safe.</p><p>With regard to the pay differential, the settlement of the dispute, which was delayed but has now started to be implemented, will see a big difference in salary at staff nurse grade.  The second part of this is the expert group on the management grades.  We are disappointed in the length of time it has taken the Department of Health to revert to us on the terms of reference and the parties to conduct it.  The Labour Court has instructed that it has to be concluded by next May in order to feed into the next round of public service pay talks.  Despite numerous requests, we have not received the terms of reference.  We have submitted our draft terms of reference and the parties to conduct the expert review.  We are awaiting this from the Department and it is well overdue.</p></speech>

Placing difficulties in the way of recruitment would be viewed by other countries as nonsensical.  They will probably take advantage because if we are hampered in recruiting, it will be to their gain, particularly that of the UK, our close neighbour.  Britain is short of nurses and has reduced payments and bursaries for undergraduates, which saw a drop-off in its training places.  It has a huge interest in recruitment from the Republic of Ireland.</p></speech>

The Chairman is correct that it is not supported.  We have best practice that states advanced nurse practitioners should make up 2% of the overall workforce.  This would require us to have 700 advanced nurse practitioners, of which we have approximately 247.  These nurses can provide services that have proved to reduce waiting times in emergency departments and the need to admit.  When advanced nurse practitioners work in emergency departments they reduce the length of time patients wait and can assist in getting the patient home as opposed to being admitted.  Likewise, in all other services where they work, and international studies demonstrate this, they improve the patient's journey considerably and they provide a very safe service.  Unfortunately, in this country we have had a real problem in getting the Government to fund places for advanced nurse practitioners to the point that we are still well below the recommended 700 mark for these grades.</p> <p>  We have met the leads on Sl&aacute;intecare who accept that advanced nurse practitioners add to the efficient use of bed time.  They also accept that advanced nurse practitioners can and should be extended more broadly into community services.  There is an idea that management of chronic disease in the community should not be led by advanced nurse practitioners but everybody knows they have a great deal to add.  The same applies with regard to clinical nurse specialists.  However, this requires investment in educating nurses and midwives to these levels.  That would give us a service that actually has a chance of delivering primary care in the community in a very safe manner and in remote areas where advanced nurse practitioners could lead services.  We can have nursing-led services in these areas.  The plan needs to be approved, the availability of education needs to be fast-tracked and we need to look at models of healthcare delivery that are not solely based on the medical model.  Advanced nurse practice and clinical nurse specialism are well established but they need to be funded.</p></speech>

We hope the legislation will bring about the regional authorities being devolved so the financial authority, recruitment and retention is decentralised.  The centralisation of these, particularly with the pause at central national level, makes absolutely no sense.  The regional authorities should have and must have the right to recruit and manage their budgets based on their geographical patch.</p></speech>

They keep people out of hospital and allow people to come out of hospital quickly.  My experience of community intervention teams is that they are now being restricted.  There is a recruitment difficulty and their work has become so expansive that they find it very difficult to supply the service because more and more work comes from hospitals.</p></speech>

They provide a 365 day a year service on a 24-hour basis.  They provide care in the home after discharge and sometimes pre-admission.  The problem we have always had is in expanding this very good service to areas outside the restricted areas in which they work at present.  There are not that many community intervention teams but where they exist their statistics demonstrate they make a major contribution to hospital avoidance.  By default, a person can stay in his or her own home and be provided with the care required.  In some instances where people attend an emergency department, there is a facility to have care provided through a community intervention team in the home.  It makes perfect sense.  It is the right model.  Again, these teams are staffed by staff nurses and clinical nurse managers and are covered in the recruitment pause.</p></speech>

They are extraordinary.  Anybody who interacts with a nurse or midwife at work would readily say that they are extraordinary.  They are very tightly scrutinised by professional bodies, HIQA, and their employers in an environment in which it is becoming impossible to guarantee safe care.  They do extraordinary work every day.</p> <p>  Morale is very low and there is absolutely no doubt that burnout levels are increasing.  The concern we have as a trade union representing nurses and midwives is that, despite the fact that all of the statistics and reports indicate this, the health and safety of the workers in the mix of a financial imperative for overspend in the health service is ignored and neglected.  This is not in accordance with any health and safety provision in our legislation.</p></speech>

The group's function was to review the Traveller Accommodation Act 1998 and other legislation affecting the provision and delivery of accommodation for Travellers.  Its establishment reflects a commitment contained in a Programme for a Partnership Government and confirmed in the Government&rsquo;s 2016 housing policy statement, Rebuilding Ireland, that the adequacy of arrangements for delivering accommodation for Travellers should be examined.</p> <p>  The expert group comprised three members.  These were Dr. Norton and me, along with Mr. David Joyce, then at the Mercy Law Resource Centre, who chaired the group.  I acknowledge his very important input to the report.  He is now on the staff of the Oireachtas and not eligible to participate any further but he played a critical role in the expert group.  The expert group presented its report to the Minister of State, Deputy English, and to the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee in July 2019.  We are pleased to be have this opportunity to discuss the report and its recommendations with the members of the Oireachtas joint committee.</p> <p>  The expert group was assigned the following terms of reference: review the effectiveness, implementation and operation of the Traveller Accommodation Act 1998 with a view to examining whether it provides a robust legislative basis for meeting the current and future accommodation needs of the Traveller community, which takes effective implementation into account in the context of the recognition of Traveller ethnicity in 2017; examine national and international best practice in the provision of accommodation for nomadic communities to inform the legislative basis for meeting the current and future accommodation needs of the Traveller community; review other legislation that affects the provision and delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation, including transient accommodation; consult all relevant stakeholders at local and national level, including Traveller representative organisations and other stakeholder groups represented on the national and local Traveller accommodation consultative committees; and draft and present a report and recommendations to the Minister within six months of commencement.</p> <p>  The expert group used several methods to understand the accommodation needs of Travellers and the issues and challenges associated with meeting these needs.</p><p>For instance, we reviewed the findings and recommendations made in key published reports and we examined data from key sources, including the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the census and the summary of social housing assessments.  We also reviewed policy and practice in selected European countries, we received written and oral submissions from key stakeholders and will also held a round-table stakeholder workshop consultation.  The group also met the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government in November 2018 and the Oireachtas Traveller Group on 16 April 2019.  Group members took great care to ensure that the issues raised by the Deputies and Senators they met on those occasions were taken into account in our analysis.</p><p> Our analysis was based on all of these consultations, evidence and data.  The report was prepared in a collaborative fashion, with all recommendations being agreed by all three of the expert group members.  It sets out an integrated set of recommendations intended to improve the effectiveness of the arrangements for providing accommodation for members of the Traveller community, which were established by the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998.  The recommendations address four key themes, which we identified as the key barriers to providing Traveller accommodation, including ensuring delivery reflects need, planning, as in land use or spatial planning, capacity and resources to deliver accommodation and governance of the delivery of it.</p><p> The review concludes that the arrangements established by the 1998 Act have important strengths and have enabled the delivery of significant amounts of accommodation for Travellers.  However, they have failed to provide enough accommodation to meet the full scale of need among this community.  This is evidenced by the extremely high rate of Traveller homelessness, the increase in the number of Traveller households sharing accommodation and living in overcrowded conditions and the uneven record of delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation among local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs.  It is time to overhaul the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 and other relevant legislation and policies that impact on accommodation provision for Travellers. </p><p> A fundamental problem identified by the expert group relates to the lack of a strong evidence base for policymaking.  The current system for assessing the scale and nature of Traveller accommodation need is not working effectively and this creates difficulty in reaching a consensus on the true level and nature of this community's accommodation needs.  </p><p> The first theme discussed in the report is how to ensure that plans for delivery of Traveller accommodation reflect the actual needs and preferences of Travellers.  The report sets out a series of recommendations intended to ensure that we have a more robust evidence base to inform planning for Traveller accommodation provision and implementation of these plans and monitoring of the outputs achieved.  Monitoring of the implementation of Traveller accommodation programmes is required because in the expert group&rsquo;s analysis there is an implementation gap between the number of accommodation units planned and the numbers delivered.  Several local authorities have met or exceeded their targets, but others have failed to meet delivery targets, in some cases for an extended period.  Opposition from residents' associations and councillors means that the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation is challenging, but the expert group's analysis indicates that the land use planning system is also a significant factor in delaying and blocking the delivery of accommodation. </p><p> The functioning of the Part 8 planning mechanism, which is used to deliver local authority social housing, gave cause for particular concern because the use of this mechanism requires the approval of councillors, which they regularly fail to provide. In addition, the acquisition and disposal of land by local authorities requires the approval of councillors and this is often not secured.  Declining funding for Traveller-specific accommodation was identified by the group as a barrier to provision.  Wider developments in housing policy over the past decade have inhibited Travellers' access to accommodation as well.  In particular, increasing reliance on housing allowance for private rental households, such as rent supplement and the housing assistance payment, HAP, to house low-income households creates problems for Travellers because they face particularly strong barriers in securing and maintaining private rented tenancies. </p><p> The expert group was also concerned by the low delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation by voluntary sector AHBs because these organisations have provided a large proportion of social housing in recent years.  Reforms to arrangements for allocating social housing, such as the use of choice-based lettings and allocation on the basis of time on the waiting list, also raised concerns because they have the potential to disadvantage Travellers.  The outcomes of these mechanisms, in terms of their impact on the Traveller community and other particularly vulnerable groups, therefore, should be monitored.</p><p> Reforming national and local arrangements for governance of Traveller accommodation provision is vital if the accommodation needs of this community are to be met.  At local level, the expert group recommends that local Traveller accommodation consultative committees, LTACCs, which exist in each local authority, be replaced with strategic policy committees for Traveller accommodation.  This is intended to ensure that arrangements for the governance of Traveller accommodation provision are more closely aligned with arrangements for the governance of local authorities' other functions.  At national level, the expert group recommends that the representative structure of the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee be maintained, but that its functions should be expanded, strengthened and properly resourced and it should be converted into a national Traveller accommodation authority.</p><p> We have provided all members of the committee with a copy of our report and we look forward to answering any questions on its contents. </p></speech>

I commend the group on turning around the report in a speedy timeframe given everybody was working in a voluntary capacity while also doing other work.  However, I will express a degree of frustration, although not with anybody presenting to us.  It is important to recall the origin of this expert group report was the report on the Traveller accommodation programmes produced by Professor Norris and others produced for the Housing Agency at the request of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and published in January 2017.  We were then told in 2018 that an expert group would be established to review that research and come up with recommendations.  The group was established in September 2018 and the report was published this summer.  As Traveller accommodation is an issue in which the committee has taken an interest and, as many members have been very vocal about it, in a good way, it is incumbent on the committee to send out the signal today that what we want now is speedy action from Government in the implementation of the recommendations.  We cannot allow two good reports to be left gathering dust awaiting action.  One of the key actions that needs to come out of this meeting, and our meeting with the Minister in a couple of weeks, is a commitment to a speedy timeline such that everybody knows what actions will be taken by Government, when they are going to be taken and in what way.  It is only in this way we will move this issue on.</p> <p>  It is worthwhile reiterating that there is still a chronic underspend in Traveller accommodation budgets.  There was a 45% underspend in respect of the 2017 budget.  In every other area of social housing, there was an overspend that year, yet the Traveller accommodation budget was underspent.  The underspend for the following year was 44% and ten local authorities spent nothing that year.  While we do not have updated figures for this year, at the end of the first quarter, only 18% of the Traveller accommodation budget had been spent.  The problem is chronic, and getting worse.  It is important to emphasise that the majority what is being spent is being expended on refurbishments rather than new units.  The refurbished units are important but the spend in this area highlights that the new units that are needed are not being provided, which is the reason homelessness among Traveller families is much higher than for others.</p> <p>  I support all 32 recommendations.  While I am uncomfortable supporting some of them, I will support them and I encourage the Government to implement them.  I also have some questions on them.  I believe the recommendations relating to building the evidence base and establishing need should be implemented immediately.  For example, there is no reason the identifier for allowing Traveller families to state a priority of preference-need in transfers from HAP and RAS could not be done immediately.  There is no reason the Minister could not have that implemented before the end of the year.  I am interested to know how the witnesses would like to see the legislation relating to Part 8, section 183 and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, work because if the Minister decides to enact those, which I hope he does, they will come before this committee.  It is important, therefore, that the committee would have a clear understanding of how they witnesses would like the legislation and the operation of those legislative changes to work.  These are the areas with which I am most uncomfortable because I am a strong advocate for allowing local authorities have maximum power.  However, the evidence that local authorities have abused those powers is strong and if they are going to continue to do so, we will have to take them away from them, even on a temporary basis.  I would welcome more detail on those recommendations.</p> <p>  On the strategic policy committees, SPCs, and Traveller accommodation, we are all former local authority and strategic policy committee members, I would welcome more detail on how the witnesses would like the SPCs to operate.</p><p>That would be useful because it might be something that would require a legislative change to the housing Acts that we can address.</p><p> On the State-wide agency and authorities for that transformation of the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee, could the witnesses give the committee more information on the exact role they would see it have?  The Traveller representative bodies have made strong representations to us that it would have executive functions and would become a delivery body, so to speak.  The witnesses do not go that far in their report but where would they like to see that body evolve?  What powers would they like to see it have to do the kind of things they referred to in their opening statement?</p></speech>

In respect of the rest of the questions, with regard to strengthening the evidence base for policy, that needs to be done immediately.  I acknowledge that academics always say "strengthen the evidence base" but in this case we found that it was very difficult to get to the bottom of this, not the overall scale of accommodation need for Travellers which, as the Deputy mentioned, is now an emergency situation, but particularly preferences for Traveller-specific accommodation, that is, halting sites, group housing schemes and standard social housing or social housing and other private forms of housing.  Those recommendations could be implemented immediately and that would strengthen the situation.</p> <p>  In terms of the funding, if the Deputy looks at the analysis of spending we put forward in the report he will see that the problem we face is that, overall among the local authorities, there is consistent failure to draw down all the funding allocated.  However, if we look at it in more detail we see that the problem is that the local authorities responsible for areas where the Traveller population is growing most and that have the highest proportion of funding allocated are drawing down the least amount.  Parts of the country where the population is growing are spending the least on additional Traveller accommodation.  That is a real blockage.  Other areas are spending more than their allocation.  That needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  We also know from the report commissioned by the Housing Agency referred to by the Deputy that a huge proportion of the spending is on refurbishment rather than new delivery, particularly of Traveller-specific accommodation.  Quite a proportion of Traveller-specific accommodation is being refurbished in the group housing scheme.  There is no additional supply coming on-stream.  That is another area we need to strengthen to see what exactly is being provided.  I refer to the monitoring side of that.</p> <p>  In terms of the timeline for implementation, we identified short-term, medium-term and long-term measures.  We agreed that homelessness among Travellers in particular and also the number of households camping on the roadside, which is approximately 600, is at emergency level so we are keen to see the recommendations implemented immediately or as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  On the recommendation about the strategic policy committees, SPCs, we noticed when we reviewed the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 that the Act itself is progressive legislation.  It was comprehensive and introduced on foot of the Task Force of the Travelling Community, which was very comprehensive.  One of the issues that has blocked its implementation is that there has been a range of other developments relating to planning law in the local government sector that superseded the arrangements in the 1998 Act.  One of them, for instance, is the establishment of SPCs.  Local Traveller accommodation consultative committees were set up under the 1998 Act.  They have only advisory status.  Local government was then reformed and SPCs were set up with responsibility for the local authorities' different functions.  The Traveller consultative committees just report to an SPC.  They are outside the current system, so to speak, and we felt that giving them the status of an SPC would bring them into the core of the local government system and ensure their recommendations were acted upon.</p> <p>  We also highlighted some problems in the operation of the committees, particularly in respect of supporting the Traveller community representatives.</p> <p>  On the national body, the entire report focused on the blockages to implementation of the Traveller accommodation legislation.  A key blockage is that nobody is enforcing implementation at the central level.  No one is monitoring effectively what is being done.  There is some monitoring but in our view it is not effective monitoring.  In respect of the funding not being drawn down and the accommodation not being provided, no one is monitoring that and enforcing implementation.  We felt that the authority would have this role in terms of reviewing the evidence base, ensuring it is strengthened, monitoring what is being done at local authority level and, if necessary, referring local authorities to the national planning regulator to ensure their implementation can be enforced.  The planning recommendations in the report reflect the fact that local authority managers have the power to bypass any vetoes on the implementation of the Traveller accommodation programme.</p> <p>  We had recommended a relatively small but properly staffed body to implement its functions, managed by a similar representative board along the lines of the current national Traveller accommodation consultative committee.  We did not recommend that it would do delivery centrally.  In terms of the reason for that, I wish to acknowledge that delivering Traveller specific accommodation is extremely challenging for local authorities.  It is not an easy function.  We felt that having it delivered at local level by people with local expertise who were aware of the local planning issues was the best way to proceed but where implementation is not happening, somebody needs to be monitoring and identifying that centrally and enforcing implementation.</p></speech>

I refer to longer-term and shorter-term recommendations.  In the longer term, we want to see systemic change in planning, the legislation, general guidance, policy and a better alignment of areas.  The Deputy can see those in the recommendations we make.  In the shorter term, however, we are recognising and responding to the existing need.  We are recommending a five-year period, which is really the end of the planning process - the delivery stage.  From reading the previous reports and the consultations we have had, one area that keeps returning is the section 8 provisions within the planning code.</p> <p>  There are two elements to our recommendation.  The first element is that in the short term, while we are putting in place the changes to the planning system, the decision-making on the Part 8 function would switch from a reserved function, which lies with the local representatives, to an executive function so it would lie with the chief executive for a temporary period.  </p> <p>  To balance that, we would draw attention to the fact that we would like to immediately see that reinforced, even in this period, and retaining the role of the local elected representatives in the Traveller accommodation programme, TAP, in the housing strategy and in the development plans, to ensure that any concerns about local democracy, local consultation, engagement, etc. can be addressed in that sense.  That is a short-term recommendation.</p> <p>  I would have a similar concern about shifting decision making from local authorities into the centre but in this particular instance, we would recommend that, for this shorter-term period, to address delivery we would have an alternative route for decision making to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and that that would be similar in nature, although not the same, to the provisions that currently exist for strategic housing development.</p><p>Obviously, we consider that there is a strong need for it in this instance.  I probably would not be in support of these provisions, in that as a planner, I am not generally in support of provisions that would move local decision-making out of the local arena.  </p><p> The Deputy asked what it might look like.  It would be ideal, were the proposals to be brought forward on foot of the TAP and the development plan.  The executive develops the proposals and brings them forward for local consultation and engagement.  At a certain point in time when decision-making is required, that provision is made to submit those proposals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  As with strategic housing development, a consultative process is available within the board to allow those who have made or wish to make representations locally to get engaged in that.</p><p> Some design would be required for this process.  Perhaps some of the lessons that have been learned regarding strategic housing development could be added to that, in respect of revisions, additional information and so on.  </p><p> I reiterate the point that those short-term measures are within the context of longer-term systemic changes to legislation and the very basic policy foundations in planning to deal with Traveller accommodation.</p></speech>

Like many of those in attendance, I speak with a certain amount of experience of the Traveller accommodation issue.  I was an incidental landlord and rented property to a Traveller family for a long time very successfully.  I have seen at first hand the intimidation and discrimination that takes place against families who are trying their best.  </p> <p>  As a member of a local authority who had quite an amount of Traveller accommodation in my direct home area, I never objected at all but actively encouraged and supported quality Traveller accommodation.  That leads me to a couple of questions, because we were able to get around many issues through the use by the county manager - or CEO in today's terms - of emergency powers to circumvent and build emergency accommodation and I note one recommendation is that these should be used more.</p> <p>  Where does best practice take place?  The review group has looked at all the local authorities in the country.  If one was to identify best practice, is there a local authority that has used the structures and supports that are there to a certain degree of success?  The overarching point is that nationally, we have a diabolical record in accommodating members of the Traveller community.  Can the witnesses give a good example in this regard?  As there are powers in place, where have they been used successfully?  While we absolutely need to bring in more powers where they are needed, there are powers available that are not being used.</p> <p>   Has the review group done any investigation - I have not read the report in detail - as to whether approved housing bodies have stepped up to the plate to a large degree with regard to their responsibilities?  Perhaps legislation is needed to ensure that a percentage of their work, and of the houses they allocate would be Traveller-specific.  I will start with those questions and may have a couple of follow-on questions afterwards.</p></speech>

There also have been a couple of other instances where they have been used but have failed following a court challenge.  I acknowledge that we met representatives of a large number of local authorities and of the County and City Management Association.  The chief executives of local authorities are in a challenging position in using emergency powers.  Their job depends on working with the councillors, the elected members of the local authority, as regards all the other local authority functions and in striking a budget.  Stepping in and using emergency powers is always difficult.  We feel that on occasion, it is necessary to address these blockages to delivery that we have mentioned.  </p> <p>  In the short term, these emergency powers could be used more widely before the legislation is amended to make Part 8 an executive function for a period, as we have suggested.</p> <p>  On good practice, another challenge we identified regarding the delivery of halting site and group housing scheme accommodation concerns the design of that type of accommodation, taking account of the need for the accommodation of horses and to support Travellers in their activities in gathering and selling scrap metal, for instance.  Trying to design and deliver such accommodation well in high-density settings like towns or cities is challenging.  Moreover, when local authorities or approved housing bodies deliver mainstream social housing, they also design and deliver it.  There is not generally a great deal of consultation with the people getting the accommodation.  People are accommodated from the housing list and then move into the accommodation.  It is different when Traveller-specific accommodation is delivered because it often is for a specific extended family group that is looking for halting site accommodation together.  There is a need for an extended period of consultation in working with that community, which can be very challenging and time-consuming.  It is a particular challenge for approved housing bodies.  Often, they do not have the wider staff to allow them to do that.  Under the funding model, they get the money for the project when it is let, that is, when they get the rent.  </p> <p>  One recommendation we made concerns a small organisation called CENA, a Traveller-led body that was set up as a housing association to provide accommodation.  It has done some valuable work with different local authorities and in consulting with Travellers who are seeking Traveller-specific accommodation on their preferences, as well as advising on the design.  Were this organisation centrally funded by the Department, that also would enable the delivery of more Traveller-specific accommodation.  A good example of that is Offaly County Council, where CENA have worked successfully with the council.  It is also working with Cl&uacute;id Housing Association separately, which is another good practice example.</p></speech>

The Senator is correct that the key problem, however, is with the drawdown of capital funding for the construction or refurbishment of the dwellings.  There is not so much revenue funding for these activities, compared with what is available on the consultation side of it.  We felt that a relatively small amount of funding to support CENA, the organisation we identified that is already doing this activity, could help a great deal.</p></speech>

We have figures in the report on Travellers' success in getting into mainstream social housing accommodation.  We acknowledged that Travellers get more mainstream council housing <i>pro rata</i>than the size of their community would suggest.  They are successful in getting into mainstream council housing; there is just not enough of it.  They are also successful in getting into approved housing body, AHB, housing, albeit not at the same rate as getting into council housing.  The specific issues we identified with the approved housing bodies is their role in the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation.  They are now major providers of social housing but the level of Traveller-specific accommodation provided by approved housing bodies is extremely low.</p><p>We identified only two or three sites.  As they are now major providers of social housing, we would like to see more of that.</p></speech>

Say that 15 houses are to be allocated, and the local authority give the approved housing body a list of 13 names, ten of whom are Travellers.  The Travellers still might not be allocated a house.  Has Professor Norris done any research on why that figure is so low?</p></speech>

It is impossible to know definitively how many Travellers get into mainstream social housing because there is no ethnic identifier on the application for social housing.  We base our estimates on other censuses and surveys of the population but we do not actually know the real figures.  One of the recommendations in the report is that Travellers should have the opportunity to identify their ethnicity when applying for social housing.  That would obviously be voluntary but that provision would be there and would allow us to monitor the numbers more closely.  Those figures on success rates are from our own analysis of the data.</p></speech>

The problem among the Traveller community is extremely acute, particularly regarding homelessness.  We discuss this in the report.  The number of homeless Travellers in Dublin indicates that their risk of homelessness is ten times higher than that of the settled population.  There is no doubt that leadership is extremely important.  While the policies at national level could do with some reform, they are generally strong.  The problem is with implementation.</p></speech>

In the context of our larger proposals, there are things we probably need to do now, as well as short-term recommendations.  Five years is considered short term for planning.  We then need to look at the longer-term fixing of the system.  Emergency provisions should be used to tackle the current crisis or emergency, but we cannot run a system on the basis of emergency responses.</p></speech>

I was taken by Senator Conway's remarks about leadership.  I have no difficulty with what he said but the reality is that all parties and none are represented on these local authorities.  We do not have to go far from Dublin and its suburbs to see the track record of people from all political parties and none.  It is all very well saying that they all need to be responsible but that must be echoed through parties' memberships and contacts.  I do not want to rehearse the issues D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, of which I am a former councillor, has had.  Some of those problems were very recent and related to the disposal of lands identified for Traveller accommodation, with the support of the political establishment.  That must be remembered.  I will leave it there because that matter will be revisited at some stage and there will be some questions around it in the next week or two.  We can talk about that again.</p> <p>  I do not agree with all of Professor Norris's recommendations.  I will be honest and tell her why that is.  I do not believe in the erosion of powers of democratically elected public representatives.  That is something for which I have always argued strongly.  The professor and her team will be aware that we have a revolving, five-year county development process and that there is extensive public consultation and engagement on the planning process, planning cost, etc.  The witnesses will also be aware that each local authority adopts a housing strategy and a housing needs strategy, which it puts in place.  The local authorities actively engage with the Traveller community about its needs.   Some are better at it than others, which is an issue.  The Traveller accommodation programme, TAP, is identified and marked with symbols on county development plan maps.  There is a sense of certainty there for the Traveller community, its advocates and everybody else in the community.  A county development plan is a contract with a citizen.  It gives a certain degree of certainty about the future of the sustainable planning of the area, which is to be welcomed.  For this reason, I do not support the suggestion that we could somehow suspend some of the critical powers and functions of the elected members of local authorities.  We should focus on, and come down heavy upon, local authority members who are discriminatory in their conduct, language or approach to Traveller accommodation.  I do not support any of that.</p> <p>  Good councillors of all parties and none have worked with the Traveller community and advanced Traveller accommodation.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has performed well in this area.  The local authority has adopted the TAP as part of its housing strategy and has identified Traveller accommodation on its development plan.  The problem is the delivery and execution, which rests with the executive - the crowd to which Professor Norris wants to give more powers.  She has suggested suspending the powers of the elected members and giving powers to the executive.  Has she asked questions of the executive?  I see from the back of the report that a substantial number of them have made contributions, which I welcome.  However, our focus must be on the executive because ultimately the policy of the council is adopted by its elected members.  It has reserve functions, as we know.  The executive needs to roll out the policy.  The sale of that site in D&uacute;n Laoghaire was supported and initiated by the executive.  We all know that.  The facts speak for themselves.</p> <p>  The report recommends that we request further research and a review from the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, of Traveller accommodation policies and objectives.  That is a very good proposal.  We should do that because we need facts.</p> <p>  On Part 8 guidelines and so on, could the witnesses provide the committee with some exact detail of where they found elected members to have strayed, erred or gone off course?  I want to home in on which local authorities we are talking about.  Where were there particular difficulties?  We know that some local authorities perform better than others.  We need to address the issue of where councils have abused or misused their powers or in some way frustrated the roll-out of approved TAPs.  We must get to the facts and cannot deal in generalisations.  Those are a few of my concerns but we need to focus on the roll-out of plans that have been adopted.  I have a number of them in mind.  I lived next door to Traveller accommodation.  I subsequently sold my house and I have bought a site next to another Traveller accommodation site where I intend to build a house.  I have no difficulty with that and work very closely with them.</p> <p>  I have a few more issues.  The ethnic identifier does not sit easy with me as I do not like when people talk of ethnic identifiers.  Professor Norris mentioned that it might be a voluntary code.  How is she engaging with the Traveller community on that?  I raised this issue of an ethnic identifier with a Traveller yesterday and it did not sit comfortably with that individual.  I now raise it with Professor Norris here today.  I wanted to flag that.</p> <p>  Page 4 of Professor Norris's submission refers to councillors and the acquisition and disposal of land.  Councillors do not approve the acquisitions of lands, which is one of the problems.</p><p>The executive can go ahead and acquire land without any consultation with the elected members.  Issues only arise in respect of how the executive is going to fund such acquisitions.  Councillors have no role or function in the acquisition of property, although they do, as was mentioned, have a role in the disposal of property.  I will not support any move to take that power away from those elected members.</p><p> Last, the proposal for a national Traveller accommodation authority is a good one but it must have real teeth.  Is it envisaged that such a body would have executive or non-executive powers?  Deputy &Oacute; Broin spoke on that but I ask the witnesses to address it.  This is a really good body of work and a good start but we should leave the powers with the elected members.  This has been a good exercise.  Traveller communities across the country work well with local councils on the whole and in the main.  The focus should be on why we not delivering on existing plans that are ten, 15 or 20 years old, plans which have been voted on and successfully approved.  Why is that not happening?  </p></speech>

I will deal with the ethnic identifier aspect first.  An ethnic identifier would have to be voluntary under the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  People always mention that, but it does mean it would have to be voluntary.  We had extensive discussions with local authority social workers who interact with Travellers and have detailed and in-depth knowledge of the Traveller community.  They told us that some Travellers did not wish to identify as Travellers and obviously that is their right.</p> <p>  We face the problem that it is difficult to monitor how many Travellers are getting into accommodation and the level of need.  An ethnic identifier would address those issues.  We also suggested other changes where Travellers could identify a preference for the type of accommodation they wanted as in standard housing at No. 1, a halting site at No. 2 etc.  The Traveller representative bodies in particular suggested to us that Travellers felt pressured into always identifying standard social housing as the first option, whether they wanted it or not.  That was because they felt their chance of getting halting site accommodation was so poor.</p> <p>  We had meetings with the Traveller representative bodies.  I do not wish to speak on their behalf but my impression of their views is that they support the ethnic voluntary identifier.  The data are so weak that it is hard to know definitively how much delivery there is.  Local authorities, which are not delivering, are able to hide behind the figures and claim there is no demand for Traveller-specific accommodation, when the Traveller representative bodies are stating there is such demand.  That was something we were anxious to address by ensuring we have robust data.  </p> <p>  Turning to the comments on the diminution of powers of elected members of local authorities, I share the Senator's view that the powers of those elected members should not be diminished any further.  In this case, however, we feel that the situation with Traveller accommodation is at an emergency level now.  I know many sections of the community face strong pressures in gaining access to housing, particularly people facing affordability challenges.  Travellers, though, face all those pressures too, being a population which generally has a low income, as well as the added pressures deriving from discrimination regarding access to properties.  There are also practical pressures, given that the average size of a Traveller household is three times the size of a settled household.  Trying to get accommodation for a family with a large number of children in the Dublin area is impossible with HAP because the properties are simply not on the market.  Given all of that, we believe there is an argument for suspending some of the functions of councillors on an emergency and short-term basis.  </p> <p>  On the comments concerning the quality of work being done in TAPs and their implementation, I again share the Senator's view that in many cases, good work is being done.  I acknowledge that.  This is a challenging area and one in which it is far from easy to work.  If these issues were easy, they would have been resolved by now.  Our analysis indicates that quality varies around the country.  Some local authorities have very good Traveller accommodation consultative committees that are working very well and have good relationships with the Traveller representatives on the committee.  In other areas, however, they are effectively non-functional and the quality of the Traveller accommodation programmes varies nationally.  </p> <p>  The key issue, however, is the implementation of those programmes.  The process is that a local authority publishes a Traveller accommodation programme, which is then sent to the Department and the Department allocates money based on the programme.  The local authorities, therefore, make the request for the money.  In the relevant table in the report, it will be seen that there is major variation in the level of drawdown.  The problem, in particular, is that the drawdown is weak in local authority areas where the Traveller population is rising.  Some of those areas identified in the report are Dublin city, Cork city and county and Longford.  We examined in some depth why drawdown was not happening and Dr. Norton can speak further on Part 8.  One concern we had, however, was that all of the effort put into devising the plans was not then matched by their translation into development plans.  Senator Boyhan mentioned the example of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, but it is not the case in every local authority that sites are identified in development plans.  There is often a disconnect and that is a problem.  </p></speech>

There is also the matter of agreeing to initiate Part 8 and getting planning started for Traveller-specific accommodation.  Looking at the figures for Traveller-specific accommodation, they are not great, as I keep mentioning.  What seems to be happening is that there is a great deal of spending on the refurbishment of existing halting sites.  That spending sometimes involves the demolition of a halting site and the building of a group housing scheme on the same site.  Little additional Traveller-specific accommodation is being supplied and that is where Part 8 needs to come into play.  Dr. Norton will answer in more depth on that aspect.</p></speech>

Looking at the local level process in a broader context, this report would hope, ultimately, that planning processes for the creation of TAPs etc. is strengthened in the short to medium term.  I refer to trying to harmonise the TAP, the housing strategy and the development plan.  We make recommendations in those areas.  It is our strong view that there should be increased involvement of local communities and elected representatives in the formulation of the TAP and the development of good policies locally.  Essentially, this entails providing a clear pathway for the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation.  In the short term, given the inconsistent delivery of accommodation and the emergency nature of the situation, I note some local authorities have been exemplary while others have not been in a position to deliver.  It is that inconsistency that concerns us in the short term.  The measures we are suggesting are only intended to be short term.  I refer to final decision-making on Part 8 and to the disposal, not the acquisition, of land <i>per se</i>.  We envisage that the role of local elected members will not be diminished in any way in respect of forward planning, preparation of the TAP etc.  We would like to see that role enhanced and further aligned with the housing strategy and development plan.  <br/><br/>Recommendation No. 5 is very important.  We are operating in a situation where we do not have good data or evidence.</p><p>There is no national register for us to draw on regarding Part 8 and delivery of housing for Travellers.  We have an imperfect knowledge base from which to work.  It would be useful to engage with the Office of the Planning Regulator, in its role in research and so forth in the planning area, to dig deeper into that.  That would be a fairly big piece of work.  One would have to look through each and every local authority or housing authority.  That is an important point and could be pushed on in the immediate term.</p><p> The Senator is correct in suggesting that the executive side has responsibilities in delivery.  It should not be seen that we are targeting local authority members.  The executive side has a great responsibility in the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation at local level.  Again, we see an important role for the Office of the Planning Regulator arising in this regard.  It will have a role in reviewing development plans and other such plans across the country.  It could have a role in looking at the specific arrangements and policies made for Traveller-specific accommodation, the local objectives etc.  More importantly, it could see if there some consistency across different local authorities in this area.</p></speech>

This is my first committee meeting.  Please bear with me as I try to formulate my thoughts and notes.</p> <p>  I thank the independent expert group for its presentation, observations and findings.  It is a welcome report.  I also appreciate and acknowledge that the Traveller representative organisations have also welcomed these findings and recommendations.  It is important to be cognisant that with no Traveller representation on this committee and on the expert group, the phrase &ldquo;nothing about us without us&rdquo; comes to mind.  It is vital we keep lines of communication completely transparent and open between the committee and its work, as well as any future work from the Department, and the Traveller community.  Otherwise, that is where many problems can arise.</p> <p>  Coming from County Offaly, I am well aware of the frustrations regarding Traveller accommodation both within the Traveller community and those outside of it.  During my short stint as a councillor on Offaly County Council, I was rather disappointed to find out there was a significant underspend of departmental funding for Traveller accommodation purposes.  Although it is not unique to Offaly, it needs further examination.  I am aware Professor Norris alluded to this in her answers already.  We need far greater communication among Traveller representative groups, local communities, local authorities and Departments.  Otherwise, I fear we will never see an end to this problem facing this particularly vulnerable section of our society.</p> <p>  I also appreciate that CENA Housing Association has worked well with Offaly County Council.  That is promising and progressive.</p> <p>  Some members brought up the issue of an ethnic identifier.  Is there a way of finding more information in this regard through the Traveller representative groups?  Have they details on Travellers in social housing?  Has this been explored already?</p> <p>  As I was prepared for a Minister to be present, I have had to slightly change my questions but can the expert group suggest a timeline for the implementation of its short-term recommendations?  Does the expert group envisage that each local authority should be instructed to have a Traveller unit in its structures, according with best practice guidelines in delivering that service?  It has been indicated to me that local authorities have used allocations for Traveller accommodation to hire security firms to assist in evictions?  Did this crop up with the expert group?  Given that a &euro;1.5 million increase was given for Traveller accommodation in budget 2020, mostly going towards refurbishments, what does the expert group believe the budgetary intention or the proposal under these new structures should be?  What is the shortfall in this regard?</p> <p>  The recommendations under the chapter on capacity and resources are crucial.  The practical concerns in terms of Traveller accommodation need more support.  Issues such as waste management and water services are relatively cost-effective ways of improving accommodation for Travellers.  Greater supports in those would assist greatly.  The expert group indicated how household size is different.  That practical aspect needs to be considered.  Some of those aspects are not particularly costly; it is just about providing a service.</p></speech>

He is a barrister and led on the legal recommendations of the report.</p> <p>  We suggested an ethnic identifier for applications for social housing because it is a means of tracking who is getting into social housing.  We raised some concerns in the report that there are new innovations in the allocation of social housing.  For instance, some local authorities have what they call a choice-based lettings scheme.  This is where one looks up properties available on a website and makes an application over the Internet.  This is valuable from the point of view of efficiency and avoiding vacancies.  For groups such as Travellers, however, who may have literacy issues and may not have access to electricity, let alone access to the Internet, we felt these schemes create risks that need to be monitored.  One way of doing this is through an ethnic identifier for applications.</p> <p>  We also included some recommendations on making the census of population more robust by working with Traveller bodies to come up with a more robust estimate of the size of the population.  We need to emphasise that this is voluntary.  It is up to people and families to identify themselves as Travellers or not.</p> <p>  On the security firms for evictions, we did not come with figures on that.  It was raised in some of the submissions from the Traveller bodies.</p> <p>  We also did not come up with specific recommendations regarding the increase in funding because it was challenging to come up with a specific figure.  Funding has fallen but there has been a failure to draw down funding.  Table No. 5.4 on page 50 of the report gives the record per local authority over the past ten years.  There has been a failure to draw down funding but the amount of funding has also fallen.  The main need for additional funding is for additional supply.  The evidence we have is that much of the existing capital funding is spent on the refurbishment of existing Traveller-specific units, which is valuable.  There is, however, a need to focus on providing funding for additional new supply of Traveller-specific accommodation and a proper monitoring of what is spent on supply and on refurbishment.</p> <p>  Some rural local authorities raised with us that they have much demand from Traveller households for rural social housing such as small cottages in the country.  This would be a valuable source of funding but they currently cannot draw from the Traveller-specific accommodation fund.  Instead, they are having to fund this from the mainstream social housing side.  They recommended that as an additional source of supply.</p> <p>  We did not make specific recommendations on local authority staffing because we feel the needs vary by local authority.</p><p>Some of the urban local authorities had large Traveller accommodation sections, and that is useful, but some of the rural local authorities did not.</p><p> We put one specific recommendation in place regarding spending on caretakers and on more robust management of halting sites.  It was our view and that of some of the local authorities and Traveller groups we met that there are problems with the management of Traveller-specific accommodation.  This is driving some of the objections and concerns from the wider community.  We felt that spending in that area would achieve a lot of dividends.  In the report, we mention the aim of making the estate management function more robust.  In response, some of the local authorities raised concerns with us that this would mean spending on anti-social behaviour but that is not what we meant.  We meant spending on proper management, on dealing with vacant units - which are a big problem on some halting sites - and on ensuring that any waste is dealt with quickly and that there is better maintenance.  A relatively small spend in that area across the local authority sector would improve things.</p></speech>

It is important that there is Traveller representation throughout the process.  I will sum up our recommendations across the different areas.  We are basically looking for more efficient and integrated practices at different levels, from involvement in a new national agency to greater and closer engagement within the SPCs, for example, at local authority level, in order to direct engagement in TAPs and development plans and in the preparation of individual proposals for Traveller-specific accommodation.  Those are critical matters in respect of which the Traveller community needs to be engaged.  That will form part of what was mentioned about the great need for integrated planning and design guidance for Traveller accommodation.  This is one of our medium to long-term recommendations.  Work could commence on that almost immediately.  That would look at what best practice is in forming policy and in preparing TAPs or housing strategies that have made proper provision for Traveller accommodation.  It would also include guidance on preparing and developing proposals.  Although a little dated, the design guidance that is in place would integrate everything and be responsive to the needs of Travellers in particular.  This is a key element of one of our long-term proposals and it would underpin practice throughout the planning system.</p> <p>  Members mentioned timelines.  We have not provided a matrix or anything of that nature.  We have tried to differentiate between immediate actions, short-term actions and the sort of actions we want to end up with.  If one takes the planning proposals and recommendations, we see five years as being the likely horizon for making all the changes so that we have a planning system that is fit for purpose, so that we have the policies in place and so that we produce plans that are in line with good practice, etc.  Five years would be an outside time period.  If we work back to that, circulars, which were mentioned earlier, could be initiated rapidly and we could start working on legislative changes and provisions that have to pass through the normal processes that would take 18 months to two years.  The members of the committee are the experts in that area.  It is a phased approach but it is probably fair to say we should see this as a five-year project.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.502" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1357" speakername="Pat Casey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019111300002#J00300"><p>I thank our guests for their presentation.  As previous speakers noted, it has taken a long time to get here and we appreciate how quickly the review group has acted in preparing its report.  We thank it for that.  A lot of this has probably been dealt with and we have spoken about many of these issues already.  One of those issues is the collection of data and how important that is moving forward.  Some of these are easy fixes in the sense that they could be done in a fairly straightforward manner, including that additional details such as those relating to the type of accommodation involved could be included on the housing application form.  These are all basic and simple issues that could be fixed quite readily if the will is there to do so.</p> <p>  I will move to the more complicated and controversial matter of the local authority members themselves.  Most people in this room do not want to remove powers from the local authority members.  In fact, we want to give them more powers if possible.  Failing to include local authority members in this process might have a worse effect in the long term when we try to integrate people into the communities or to deliver these projects at the end of the day.  To develop that point, I sat on a local authority for 12 years and we had to take some tough decisions.  Professor Norris mentioned objections from councillors and resident's associations.  Sometimes I question how much energy, from the point of view of administration, is put into Traveller accommodation and into resolving the problem relating to it.  Ultimately, the county council does not realistically get involved until something is put in front of it.  I sometimes question whether the will is there at the management level.  The report clearly indicates that the chief executive of a local authority has emergency powers to do this if he or she so desires.  How many chief executives of local authorities across the country have used the emergency powers to help resolve the Traveller accommodation problem?  How many part A planning processes for Traveller accommodation have members of local authorities voted down versus the percentage that have been voted through?  Do we know the statistics for that?  I am trying to be objective here.  I do not like to see powers of local authority members being taken away.  We need to look at other ways of trying to incentivise local authority members to be engaged in this process because they have a fundamental role in the integration of the Traveller accommodation problem at the end of the day.  If we remove those powers from them, we could be creating another problem.</p> <p>  I want to move on to the planning process.  Our guests referred to strategic housing developments, SHDs, and the board proposal.  We had a huge debate here on the SHDs only a couple of weeks ago.  A lot of us have a fundamental problem with the consultation process in the SHDs.  This is not a Traveller accommodation issue, it is an issue with planning itself because at this stage a number of communities in my county would not have had their local area plan reviewed for 12 years and then the next minute the SHD process is forced on them without them having had any engagement on it.  I have no problem with the principles of that process but I do have a difficulty with how we get there.  I would be fully supportive of the need for county development plans and local development plans to be developed to a much higher level of detail.  We need to clearly indicate what every piece of land will be used for and the type of design that will be used.  A great deal more effort must be put into the consultation also.  At that point and from there on I would not have a problem with the SHD process but that process involves more than Traveller accommodation.  It has a broader remit.  The SHD process has good points but one of the weaknesses was in the area of the consultation process.  I would like to get some feedback on those issues.</p> <p>  Professor Norris stated that the majority of the money is being spent on renovations as opposed to being spent on new deliveries.  We spent a good few years of delivering nothing, be it social houses or Traveller accommodation.  Do we have a percentage for the amount of money that is spent on new deliveries as opposed to renovation works?</p><p>I have not read the full report, only bits of it.  I have two charts in front of me: one on the spend and the other on the population.  Is there a correlation between the allocation of money and the population of Travellers in each county or area?</p></speech>

Professionally, I am a planner also and strongly agree with the sentiment expressed by the Deputy about making sure local decision-making takes place at a local level.  I am also a member of the Irish Planning Institute.  We are strongly in favour of returning the proposals for strategic housing developments back to local level.  I believe in local democracy.  From our perspective, this situation is unique.  It is perhaps an emergency.  Inconsistent delivery is an issue and a problem that has been highlighted repeatedly.  It was raised in the consultation on numerous occasions.  We produced a detailed report on our consultation and Part 8 kept cropping up.  What we are suggesting is that it is very much a short-term measure and that it be put in place, pending the fixes made to the planning system.  The critical point, on which Deputy Casey put his finger, is that there is a need for better local plans and local resourcing.  We need to be more specific in the plan-making process about what we mean in the context of the provision of Traveller accommodation.  The evidence must be available and we must be far more specific and give a clearer indication to the community, the elected representatives and others as to where we intend to develop Traveller-specific accommodation, how we are supposed to provide it and the timeline involved.</p> <p>  We have found that it is not consistently the approach across local authorities.  Therefore, we are suggesting it be a short-term measure.  In a situation where there is a fixed planning system, ideally, what we would have is planning and design guidance that would show the way local authorities could plan better Traveller accommodation in some consistent framework which would also provide backup guidance on design and other matters.  In the guidance one would also wrap methodologies for assessing demand and also perhaps consultation and dealing with other such matters.  There could be comprehensive and integrated guidance that would provide the basis for returning the decision-making processes to the local level, certainly at the end of the Part 8 process.  Some of the issues we have had in this area include that planning for the provision of Traveller-specific accommodation is a long-term process, at the very end of which is a decision-making stage under Part 8 involving the elected representatives.  We suggest there be a suspension of it for a short period and a review while we make the larger fixes to the planning system.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Casey.  We have lessons to learn from strategic housing development.  It might perhaps be extended for a further period of two years, but, like the provisions we are proposing for Traveller-specific accommodation, the processes will return to the local level, at which time we would have comprehensive and robust guidelines for how we would manage the planning and design of Traveller-specific accommodation.</p></speech>

I mentioned at the start that we had agreed a joint report.  All three of us signed up to the recommendations, but as the Deputy can imagine, it is fair to characterise the debate between the three of us on the various recommendations made as lively.  I share the concerns about the diminution of functions.  I agree that in ideal circumstances the accommodation to be provided for groups such as Travellers should be agreed to collectively within communities through the forum provided by the elected local authority.  That is one of the reasons I personally was not keen on the idea of having a central body for delivery because I felt it could be counterproductive.  Also, there are local issues of which local authorities know because they are active on the ground and with which a central body would spend years trying to catch up.  That said, there is evidence that the initiation, in particular, of Part 8 developments presents a problem.  it is also true that the emergency powers mentioned by the Deputy are underused.  I gave two examples, namely, Limerick City and County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, both of which have used them successfully.  Colleagues in the law department at NUIG law produced an interesting report on the use of emergency powers which was unsuccessful in the sense that they had been successfully challenged in the courts.  We can make the report available to the Chairman.  From memory, it identified about six occasions on which the emergency powers had been used in other local authorities.  They have been used rarely, despite the critical nature of the issue involved.</p> <p>  It is also true that often issues such as the location of sites are not mentioned in county development plans and that plans are not updated often enough.  There are general problems in the planning system that create particular problems in the provision of Traveller accommodation.</p> <p>  Deputy Casey referred to the point I had made about the spend on Traveller accommodation in each local authority area.</p></speech>

It indicates that 54% of the spend on Traveller accommodation in the past ten years was on refurbishment.  There is a lot of spending on items such as caravan loans.  The spend on the supply of halting sites was 14.7% and 18.4% on the supply of group housing schemes.  As I indicated, on some occasions the group housing schemes are to replace existing halting sites.  Does that make sense?</p></speech>

I do not wish to imply that there should be a cut in spending on the refurbishment of Traveller-specific accommodation, but it is critical that funding be made available for new supply.</p> <p>  The other point made by Deputy Casey was related to the allocation of funding to local authorities and whether it reflected the size of the local Traveller population.  To my knowledge, it does not.  It reflects what local authorities state they need in the Traveller accommodation plan.  The allocation they receive more or less matches what they have requested.</p> <p>  Also in the report we look at the differences in drawdown by local authorities.  The breakdown is to be found in table 5.4.  In table 3.2 we look at the growth in the Traveller population countrywide.  The population is growing and Travellers are also splitting in more separate households, just like the settled population, which means that the need for housing is growing.  If we compare the problems in drawing down funding to the increase in population, I have mentioned a number of local authorities where it is problematic, where their record is not strong and the Traveller population is growing.  They include Dublin City Council, Longford County Council, Cork City Council and Cork County Council.  In all of these areas the Traveller population is growing substantially, while the drawdown of the budget allocated is weak.  There are some others areas where the Traveller population is falling and the local authorities concerned are drawing down 100% of their allocation.</p></speech>

I apologise as I was slightly delayed owing to having to attend another meeting, but I have read the opening statement and looked through the report.</p> <p>  My colleagues have asked a number of questions.  I do not propose to go back over them, but I wish to make some observations.  I fully understand the problems in grappling with the recommendations made in respect of local authorities and considering how we can expedite the delivery of housing.  I represent the constituency of Dublin Fingal which has a sizeable Traveller population.  There is a real issue in providing Traveller accommodation.</p><p>We have been better than many other local authorities.  I know the drawdown might not show that.</p><p> I am very interested in the Part 8 process that Deputy Carey asked about.  Do the witnesses have recent data on how many times members of local authorities have voted against a Part 8 process for delivery of Traveller accommodation?  In all my time as a public representative, since 2004 - I was only three short years on the council, but I keep a close eye on it - I have not been aware of any in Fingal.  I am aware of one injunction that was taken very recently and the court ruled for that.  I do not think that is the issue.  Removing those powers &ndash; I know it is only a temporary recommendation &ndash; may have the unintended consequence of making the situation worse.  I believe local authorities need to remove the veil of secrecy around delivery of purpose-built Traveller accommodation.  The majority of Travellers who I interact with on housing issues want Traveller-specific accommodation.  The veil of secrecy covers purchase of land such that things are found out only after the event.  Particularly with the rural nature of some of the land purchases, more work can be done with communities.  For example, there is a very good Traveller accommodation scheme close to where I live and as part of that scheme the local authority brought the main sewer up the lane to deliver 15 purpose-built homes for Travellers, which is great, but it did not allow any of the local residents connect to the mains.  There are simple things like that, not bringing it further down the road, that are a question of consultation.  The executives and planners at local authority level need to carry the can for much of that.  It tends to be that when people find out that the land has been purchased, as in the recent case where the injunction was successful in the High Court, they do so only through the media.  Local authorities should treat citizens as adults.</p><p> There is a serious housing issue for the whole community and it is quite acute in the Traveller community.  Most people who I deal with want good sustainable, quality accommodation for all their citizens, including the Traveller community.  That is something that one of the witnesses might elaborate on, purpose-built Traveller accommodation versus integrated accommodation in existing settled communities.  What does their research show about what the community asks for?  I have received many complaints recently of certain members of the Travelling community who have been housed through approved housing bodies in existing estates where they never wanted to be and they cannot settle.  They let that be known at the time and the answer is take it or leave it.  It is that or nothing.  That poses problems then within the estate.  The Part 8 process would be of interest to me.  I do not know of any in my area that have been refused in 15 or 16 years.  I could be wrong, I stand to be corrected.  The development plan and local area plans are where to deliver and be very specific about it and identify it.  The only development plan I was involved in was the 2005-2011 one.  At the time very specific objectives for Traveller accommodation were delineated and noted on the maps in Fingal.  It was very clear to people.  Then we move through the Part 8 process, and try to deal with issues, some of which might be infrastructural, to try to have a planning gain as well for everyone in the area.</p><p> I thank the witnesses for their work.  This is a nettle that needs to be grasped.  Most of us are in agreement.  We are all committed to providing good, sustainable, permanent accommodation, and good homes for the Travelling community.  We want that.</p></speech>

There is no register we can refer to.  Apart from what might actually make it through to the Part 8 process, we cannot monitor projects that start and do not proceed.  I hope it does not come across like this.  We are not pointing the finger at the local elected representatives.  There certainly is a very significant responsibility with the local administration or the executive.  We certainly got that from our consultation.  Obviously, some of the recommendations we are making would improve the oversight and practice carried out at the executive level to support better local decision-making.  That is around proper planning guidance, processes that need to be put in place, consistent approaches to gathering data such as identifying the real demand, best practice in location, sustainable development, and managing services and infrastructure, all of which are points the Deputy mentioned.  There are issues, for example, around taking a more place-based approach to Traveller accommodation.  Maybe it is part of an area plan and there is betterment for the local community embedded such as infrastructure or a park.  There are many positives that could come forward from that.  We would like to see better guidance around the processes and a more area-based approach to that.</p> <p>  On oversight, our recommendations focus on two areas in the long term.  One is in respect of plan making, and this would be oversight of the executive and of the outputs, such as the adoption of plans etc.  That would be the Office of the Planning Regulator and we make recommendations on that in the initial term.  The second point is the new agency we are recommending that would have a broader role in monitoring delivery nationwide at some point.  We make initial recommendations on governance and what an agency might look like.  It is not very detailed and a great deal of work would have to be done on its architecture.  Principally in respect of planning, they are the issues.</p> <p>  I will hand over to Professor Norris to answer the question about demand and what Travellers want.  There are complexities here.  We are recommending that even within the TAP and the development plan we must have a much more sophisticated approach to considering what really is the local demand and how the TAP, the housing strategy and development plan respond to that.  There is an added complexity in that we are talking about a Travelling community.  It is a bit more dynamic perhaps than a settled community and we have to be able to plan for that.</p></speech>

It is not kept centrally by the Department.  Dr. Norton consulted very widely with planners in local government for the report, and they identified this as an issue, which is why it is in the report.</p><p>Now that the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR has been established, we believe it has the capacity to play quite an important role in improving the delivery of Traveller accommodation.  The problems we identify in the report of Traveller accommodation plans not lining up with what is in development plans and sites not being specified are issues which can be referred to the OPR and the office can go back to local authorities to insist they are addressed, which would improve matters.  Where there is non-implementation of measures, the regulator also has the power to recommend to the Minister that enforce implementation, which he is legally empowered to do.  That structure has been put in place and we believe it has quite a lot of potential.</p><p> Regarding secrecy around the acquisition of sites, the Deputy was previously a councillor, as he mentioned.  I have no doubt from his experience he found that is an issue.  The acquisition of sites was not an issue that was flagged with us but regarding the development of Traveller-specific accommodation where there has been non-delivery, we examined the potential for penalties, which is one of the issues the committee mentioned to us.  We decided against that option on the grounds it would penalise other vulnerable communities with, for example, cuts to social housing budgets for non-delivery of Traveller accommodation, and what is the argument for that?  Local authorities are also in large part self-funded through the property tax and there is less of an opportunity to penalise them.  Responsibility for the roads budget has been transferred from the Department with responsibility for housing to another Ministry.  Rather than penalties, the issue of incentives is one we discussed, although we did not include it in the report, but it would be worth examining.  The Deputy mentioned gains for areas that have Traveller-specific accommodation, for example, the water and sewerage infrastructure being augmented, but there are arguments for putting in place improvements such as the provision of playgrounds, which would benefit Travellers getting the accommodation but would also achieve benefits for the local communities in those neighbourhoods.  That is something that should be definitely explored.</p></speech>

The witnesses have covered that.  In my area the figure is 44% but in other local authority areas, it is 20%, 19% and 12%.  We need to find a balance.  Local authorities play a major role in this area.  I work with many members of the Traveller community in my area and Traveller accommodation is a major issue.  Looking at the big picture, perhaps workshops may be needed to ensure local authorities, agencies and everybody concerned work together.  There can be a lack of information or awareness of issues but information is the key.  It would be good if we could all work together because what service delivery is needed.  One of the greatest issues in my area is accommodation.</p><p>We know that poor living conditions are a major issue for the health of older Travellers in particular.  Do we always hear from them?  Is there a designated Traveller representative on each of the 31 local authorities, particularly through the SPCs?  When one is on the ground listening to people's concerns, that is where one will learn more.  That will be important when all the agencies and local authorities work together.  My local authority in Carlow made a submission.  Its officials are helpful when I engage with the council.  There were only 15 submissions from local authorities, which means 16 local authorities did not make a submission.  Is that a concern?  As was said, the 31 local authorities play a major role.  As we move forward, all the agencies need to work together.  One of the witnesses might respond to me on these concerns I raised.  Traveller accommodation is an important issue and we need to find a balance.  If funding is allocated for Traveller accommodation, it needs to be spent.<b></b></p></speech>

The percentage spend is based on the Traveller accommodation programmes that have been prepared, for example, their estimated cost, etc..  Funding is based on that, and it is a circular process.  There are issues with the methodology and identifying need.  We are not suggesting, for example, that even the figures presented encompass the sort of demand that there might be.  Those figures must be viewed as being indicative but they are very instructive with respect to the inconsistency in expenditure on the basis of Traveller accommodation programmes.  It very much highlights issues with inconsistency in delivery.  It is important in that regard.</p> <p>  Regarding Travellers' representation on SPCs, the emphasis has always been on LTACCs at local level.  Our recommendation on governance is that the Traveller accommodation SPC would bring in the local representative.  That governance would bring them closer to the decision-making of local authorities and then there should also be a direct connection to the local authority's own SPC on housing.  The existing arrangements were constructed in the late 1990s on foot of the Act in 1998 but there was reform of local government in the early 2000s, which superseded that and created the SPC structure.  We recommend a specific local Traveller accommodation SPC.</p></speech>

As Dr. Norton mentioned, that was the rationale for the recommendation on having a Traveller SPC.  We asked whether Traveller accommodation is a standing item on the housing SPCs for different local authorities.  We were informed it is in Dublin, but it varies.  We thought that having a formal SPC was a much better process.</p></speech>

It is important to tease out this stuff but it is also important to acknowledge the Minister and his staff are paying close attention to this committee because implementing this report will be tricky and the Minister will not put himself out on a limb if he does not think he will get support for these measures.  Much of our conversation has been about the Part 8 process, section 183 land disposals and the role of the regulator.  I am one of the minority Deputies who vigorously opposed the strategic housing development legislation for all the reasons we are discussing here in terms of not wanting powers to be centralised but we must acknowledge a number of basic facts.  Page 50 of the report refers to a 35% underspend in Traveller accommodation over the lifetime of projects.  What those figures hide is that in recent years the underspend has worsened.  There was a 48% underspend last year and that was higher than the underspend the previous year at a time there were finally some increases in budgets for local authorities.</p> <p>  In recent years some local authorities have not spent anything on this.  Last year, ten local authorities did not spend a cent on Traveller accommodation, upgrades or new accommodation.  A total of 14 substantially underspent their budgets.  If we want to send a signal to the Minister that we want to work with him to fix that problem, we will have to take some uncomfortable decisions.  I say this with the greatest of respect to Deputies Pat Casey and Darragh O'Brien and Senator Victor Boyhan because I am grappling with the same difficulties and we share views on this.  If we do not do something on section 183, Part 8 and the regulator, nothing will change.  With respect to the issue of how many Part 8 proposals have been refused, generally our difficulty is we do not even get to the Part 8 process.</p><p>We have a Traveller accommodation plan.  It is approved by local authorities with statutory responsibilities.  In some instances, councillors are responding to pressure from settled constituents.  In others, managers do not want to progress the project.  There is often collusion between those two elements and the project never gets to a Part 8 application.  Large numbers of people in the settled community do not want Traveller-specific accommodation beside them and will do everything that they can to convince elected representatives that if they support the projects, they will not be re-elected.  The level of underspending is incredible.  Last year and the year before, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government came to us to request additional expenditure for mainstream social housing because it was overspending.  That is at a time when we are not spending nearly enough.  I wish the Department would ask us to double its budget, which we would happily do.</p><p> We cannot say that we want to fix this chronic underspend and yet not at least find some way to do it.  If members are uncomfortable with what is here, I accept that.  I do not think this is straightforward.  We have then to find some other way to do it.  I started out not being in favour of taking Part 8 and section 183 powers away.  I just cannot work out any other way to fix the problem that the data show.  If the expert group tasked with dealing with this says that this is the best way to do it and I do not have an alternative, then I will defer to the wisdom of the people who are tasked to do this.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, needs to hear from this committee that whatever he brings forward to tackle this, we will work with him to try to get it through.  If we start to get political divisions, this will go nowhere, and we will be sitting here in another year or two with even more underspends.</p><p> Members will know that I am not prone to exaggerated language in this committee.  A consequence of not fixing this is that people will die.  Those of us who know the Traveller accommodation in our communities, who go to see the poor state of electricity connections and foul water sewage connections and who know what happened in Carrickmines have to be serious about this.  One of the reasons that those things happened is that allocated budgets were unspent and too small.  I appeal to members, if not necessarily to change their minds in the course of this meeting, either to support what is on the table or to come up with something else.  We cannot leave the planning and land issues as they are.  We can do the other good stuff, such as having ethnic identifiers, giving Traveller families the option of stating preferences, and having a much better evidence base.  The crucial thing is to make sure that every single cent that is allocated is spent within the year that it is allocated to improve existing accommodation and to provide good quality new accommodation.  This is too important for us to miss.</p><p> Senator Boyhan asked an important question.  If we temporarily move section 183 and Part 8 powers to the chief executive, that does not address the issue that arises when the executive is reluctant to progress a project.  How confident are the witnesses that the powers that they said the planning regulator has been given on foot of a communication from this new State-wide Traveller agency would be enough to force the manager to use those powers?  I presume that the logic is that the manager is given these powers to implement the democratically agreed Traveller accommodation programme.  If a manager chooses not to do it for whatever reason, this new State-wide Traveller agency can then say it is not acceptable and complain to the regulator.  Do the witnesses think that mechanism will work?  Will it be fast enough or do we need to think through something else?</p><p> I accept the point about choice-based letting.  Local authorities with good practice on choice-based letting have a drop-in facility on Mondays and Fridays where people with literacy issues can go in and use choice-based letting.  They have portals.  Pretty much every elected representative in those constituencies provides that service to people with restricted literacy.  As choice-based letting is rolled out for people who are not computer literate and have restricted letting, that should be made available in every local authority.  It is a sticking point that caused difficulties at the start in some areas.</p></speech>

Choice-based lettings have substantial advantages, especially with regard to the management of vacant dwellings.  That is a good suggestion.  I do not want to speak for the regulator but we met the regulator and discussed these proposals in much depth before putting them forward.  The regulator said to us that he is confident that this mechanism will work.  I mentioned that a theme in our analysis is that the 1998 Act was brought in and that various things have happened since then that undermined its implementation.  The regulator is an example of the opposite.  It is a new facility that was not there when the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 was introduced.  It has a mechanism to review plans and will do so for everybody.  We will have that expertise once it is properly staffed.  We felt that that was a very logical way to deal with the issues regarding planning for Traveller accommodation in a streamlined way along with any other planning issues that arise.  We are confident that the regulator can play that role.</p> <p>  One reason for the amount of material on evidence in the report is that academics love evidence and we felt that it was necessary for planning.  The advice of the regulator is that any regulator intervention will be subject to court challenge unless the decisions have been reached on foot of robust evidence.  That is one reason evidence is so important.</p></speech>

It is a matter of trying to move projects forward and in line with the TAP.  Traveller accommodation programmes are currently in place.  As perfect or imperfect as they may be, there is immediately potential to review what is in the TAP and to start to monitor that if it can be provided as a priority to the Office of the Planning Regulator, which has a lot of work to do at present.  Ultimately, we are talking about a national agency, which would have a specific role of monitoring plan-making.  It would not solely relate to plan-making, but in its interaction with the planning system, it would certainly monitor the plan-making and delivery across the country.  When the system is fixed, it would refer appropriate matters to the Office of the Planning Regulator, which has a legislative connection to the Minister, to be able to issue directives.</p></speech>

If legislation was in train, the Minister and Oireachtas should say that local authorities have a choice to do this in the way the legislation originally set out, that they should start to process their plans appropriately through Part 8 applications.  If local authorities do not do so, and there is clear evidence that they are not implementing the programmes, then this new State-wide agency will do its job and say to the regulator that because local authorities are not implementing new plans as appropriate, it is requesting that these amended Part 8 and section 183 powers be implemented.  If I were a chief executive or a group of councillors in South Dublin County Council looking at these new powers coming down the line, I would say that we might as well do what we agreed to because then nobody will ever propose utilising the executive section 183 or Part 8 powers.  That is how it would work in some senses.  It is not like we are saying that, tomorrow, all the Part 8 and section 183 powers will be taken off elected members, but that where they are not being used, the regulator would be requested to step in.  In those instances, new powers will be available.  Am I misunderstanding it?</p></speech>

Our second recommendation relates to five-year proposals.  While the planning system and policy are fixed, we recommend that the reserved function on the night of decision-making would rest with the chief executive.</p><p>We also recommend that an alternative route be available to the board during this period within which we are fixing the planning system, because it is very difficult to highlight performing or non-performing local authorities etc.  Sometimes, there is patchy performance but most, if not all, planning provisions apply at a national level and across the board and we are suggesting that for operational reasons, the provisions would apply for this short-term period.</p></speech>

I do not think this committee has worked very well together.  We do not wish to be a stumbling block but we have genuine concerns about removing powers from local authorities.  I was a local councillor for 12 years and in that time I was not aware of any Part 8 application being refused.  As we do not have the data available, this is not a discussion based on factual information.  A problem might arise before an application gets to the stage of a final decision, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin probably pointed out.  I am willing to consider all suggestions but I am unclear how the system would work if power was moved towards the centre.  To follow up on comments of Deputy &Oacute; Broin and Dr. Norton, would such a move improve the system?  How would the process work if decisions are made centrally?  How would the nuts and bolts of the system work?</p> <p>  I was involved in a scheme of four houses developed for the Travelling community in Ashford, a relatively rural part of County Wicklow.  It was through engagement with the community that we delivered that project in quite a short timeframe.  One of the landowners came up with an alternative suggestion regarding the layout and the council swapped some of the land.  The process of engagement through local authorities, local authority members and the community is fundamental in how this will succeed.  If we move the powers of decision to the centre or the chief executive, what will be the process?  What steps will be put in place to get to a decision?  The committee is not here to be obstructive but, rather, to find solutions.  The powers of local authorities are worthy of genuine consideration.</p> <p>  The sequence in terms of how Traveller accommodation plans fit in with county development plans has been reversed because of the national planning framework.  It was the case that plans progressed from local level to country plans, regional plans and national plans. All of a sudden, it is the other way around and everything is being dictated from national level down through regional and county plans to local area plans.  The whole thing has been reversed.   It is on a statutory footing, which was not previously the case.  County plans must follow within 18 months and local plans must follow thereafter.  It might be quite easy to fit Traveller accommodation plans into that cycle, although I am not sure where.   That is an observation on tying Traveller accommodation plans into local area and county plans.</p></speech>

The issue is that this has not worked in large parts of the country from the 1960s when the State first got involved in this area.  The situation in respect of Traveller accommodation has reached emergency levels.  There are approximately 600 families camping on the roadside.  The legislation provides eviction powers and, as such, any of those families could be instructed by the Garda to move on within 24 hours.  That is a big driver of overcrowding on halting sites, which we flag in the report.  None of the overcrowding on halting sites is authorised by local authorities, which devote much time to policing it.  Families simply have nowhere else to go.  They face their caravan, their only asset in life, being impounded by the Garda.</p> <p>  The data indicate that the situation in respect of Traveller homelessness is not superb.  It is a serious issue for Traveller families with children.  There are slightly more than 500 Travellers in homeless accommodation in the Dublin region.  They make up 19% of the homeless population in Dublin even though Travellers make up less than 1% of the national population.  It is an emergency situation which is getting worse.  As such, we believe an emergency intervention is necessary, namely, the suspension of Part 8 applications.  We make that proposal not because it is an ideal solution but, rather, because the situation in respect of Traveller accommodation is at such an emergency level that this intervention is warranted.</p> <p>  On how we envisage it would operate, the sequence of events is set out in section 6.3 of the report.  We recommend that the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee be strengthened.  It is currently an advisory committee.  A general theme in the provision of Traveller accommodation is that there are many advisory bodies doing much good work and coming up with recommendations but those recommendations are not implemented.  We recommend that the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee be strengthened, properly staffed and given responsibility for active monitoring of the planning and provision of Traveller accommodation.  That should include making the data more robust.  For instance, the compilation of data on failure to initiate Part 8 proceedings would be a big help.  Part of its role would involve monitoring local Traveller accommodation plans.  Those would still be put together by local authorities with input from elected members and local authorities.  It would also monitor the translation of local Traveller accommodation plans into local development plans.  We have recommended that the timeframe for the various planning stages be changed such that they occur concurrently.  Development plans currently happen over a different timeframe from Traveller accommodation plans etc., which creates problems that undermine implementation.</p> <p>  Crucially, we suggest the new authority would have powers in circumstances where it is of the opinion that a Traveller accommodation plan has not been translated properly into the development plan.  For instance, if sites for accommodation had not been specified, the authority would have the power to go to the Office of the Planning Regulator, which could intervene and require that to be addressed in the plan.  That is one particular blockage.  Elected members would still have a role in making these decisions but there would be the possibility for intervention at central level in cases of inadequate planning.  The authority would also monitor the implementation of plans locally.  Where there was non-implementation of plans, it could go to the regulator, which has the legal powers to review that and recommend to the Minister that he or she enforce implementation.  It would be a process where there is a body driving implementation.  It is not just about making plans and consulting.  Where there is no implementation, adequate intervention may address many of the problems.</p></speech>

With his significant experience in local authorities, the Deputy will know as well as I do that a manager is not going to bring forward a Part 8 application if he or she knows a majority of the elected members will not support it.  That is the way Part 8 provisions work.  In many local authorities managers often decided to move a social housing project from under Part 8 to a standard planning application by an approved housing body either because privately elected members had asked for it in order that they would not have to take a difficult decision or to prevent them from blocking it.</p> <p>  The Deputy is absolutely right that there is no research-based evidence to indicate the number.  Those of us who have been around for a long time and spoken to councillors in many local authorities know that part of the difficulty is that one cannot even get into the Part 8 process because the manager knows that good councillors under pressure from the electorate will feel under pressure to vote against a proposal, or other councillors who in my view are bad because they are taking the wrong decisions will also vote against it.</p> <p>  While there will still be a consultation role, a manager will be allowed to proceed, irrespective of a democratic vote.  I do not believe that is good and I am with the panel on the issue.  If, however, we do not remove the blockage-----</p></speech>

By definition, it is very hard to ferret out the cause of non-decision-making.  The planners, with whom we consulted widely, indicated that the failure to decide to initiate Part 8 proceedings was a problem.  The issue was also raised in many of the submissions we received, particularly from Traveller groups but also from local authorities.  It was mentioned that we had received 16 written submissions from local authorities.  We actually met many more local authorities than that number.  We also met social workers for Travellers and the County and City Management Association.  Some local authorities flagged an unwillingness to initiate Part 8 proceedings as a particular problem.  The job of a chief executive of a local authority is not easy.  Much of it involves deal-making with councillors on issues on which support will be obtained.  The make-up of councils varies based on the level of representation political parties and whether there is a majority.  Therefore, the challenges are not insignificant.</p> <p>  On the failure of the executive to do the job, about which Deputy Casey asked specifically, proper and robust monitoring by the local authority and a complaint to the planning regulator will help to identify where there has been a failure to provide enough Traveller accommodation to meet the needs of the population in the area in question and a failure to specify where the sites are.  That issue will be dealt with.  Where there is a failure to initiate enough developments on foot of planning applications, it will be dealt with in another complaint to the planning regulator.  Therefore, the non-decision-making aspect will be addressed.  The suspension of the Part 8 powers of elected members and their transfer to the chief executives really mean that the chief executives will have no opportunity not to act.  That was the rationale behind the decision.</p></speech>

We still have to get to the final Part 8 proceedings, but they will be undertaken by the manager.  That is where the blockage is.</p></speech>

One of the main issues is not quantitative but qualitative.  We need to engage in some research.  One of our recommendations is that there be more research in this area to determine the reasons.  We obviously have evidence of under-expenditure, but we need to bore down into it to really find out why and it will not be that simple.  There could be very good reasons for under-expenditure, but there are great inconsistencies associated with delivery and under-expenditure.  The point we are making is that this is very much a short-term measure.  We suggest a period of five years.  If it were possible to foreshorten that period, it would be ideal.  We envisage circumstances in which the local powers would be restored in the context of very robust guidance, procedures and practices associated with planning Traveller accommodation in order that there would be very consistent approaches to gathering evidence, preparing policies, identifying land and planning and design.  It is a matter of having a robust planning system that is able to deal with plan-making and decision-taking related to the provision of Traveller accommodation.  We have to get to that point.  What we are suggesting is that temporary measures be put in place.  We are suggesting a period of five years, based on our knowledge of what we regard as an outside timeline for acting on these measures, but if it could be done in a shorter timeline, that would also be ideal.</p></speech>

The Government approval included a request that this committee undertake pre-legislative scrutiny, and we are grateful that the committee has agreed to devote time to this today.<br/><br/>On the background to the proposed Bill, a review of economic migration policy carried out at the request of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation last year indicated that the employment permits system, while robust, lacked flexibility and was in need of some updating, making it less effective than it might be.  The review's recommendations included the drafting of a new Bill to adjust the legislative underpinning of the system to allow for swift responses to verified changes in labour supply and demand, or employment practices.  The implementation of the review's recommendations was committed to by way of an action point in Future Jobs Ireland 2019.  <br/><br/>This Bill incorporates both specific and general recommendations of the review while retaining the core focus and policy of a vacancy-led employment permits system oriented to meeting the skills and labour needs in the State.  The conclusions of the review endorsed the robust fundamental structure of the existing system.  The changes proposed are therefore concerned with increasing its agility and effectiveness, while retaining the key policy focus of supporting the economy and the labour market through evidence-based decision-making.  The proposed Bill therefore does not represent a change in overall Government policy.  The 2018 review involved widespread stakeholder consultation, and the key issues raised during that consultation are addressed in this general scheme.<br/><br/>Currently, there are two Employment Permit Acts and one amendment Act on the Statute Book, namely, the Employment Permit Acts 2003 and 2006 and the Employment Permits (Amendment) Act 2014.  These Acts will be repealed following the enactment of the proposed Bill.  <br/><br/>In addition to consolidating the existing legislation to make a more accessible statutory basis for our economic migration system, specific changes in this Bill include the introduction of a seasonal employment permit; extensive revision of the labour market needs test to make it more relevant and efficient; the introduction of a scheme to deal with occasional exceptional circumstances where an employment permit may be granted despite not meeting all of the criteria for the general employment permit; a number of housekeeping changes, including clarifications of particular provisions, the moving of operational criteria to regulations, and the streamlining of a number of requirements to make the grant process more efficient; and providing for additional conditions for granting an employment permit, such as training or accommodation support for migrant workers in some circumstances, or making innovation or upskilling a condition of a grant, where this may decrease future reliance on economic migration.<br/><br/>Ireland is an outlier both in the EU and among many developed nations outside the EU in not having made provision for granting seasonal employment permits.  There is evidence that some employers are disadvantaged <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>competitors in other jurisdictions by not having this form of permission.  Therefore, it is proposed to design a short-term employment permit to cater for short-stay and recurrent employment situations in sectors where this type of employment is common, such as horticulture.<br/><br/>Examination of systems of seasonal employment used by our international peers is under way so that an accurate sense of both risks and benefits of this kind of scheme will inform our structuring of the criteria for the permit type.  We would welcome any views the committee might have in this regard.<br/><br/>Apart from those occupations on the critical skills list, or for intra-company transfers, employers must demonstrate that they have made a genuine effort to recruit from within the State and across the European Economic Area, EEA, before they apply for an employment permit.  This is called the labour market needs test, LMNT.  Currently, the way in which employers are obliged to advertise vacancies is prescribed in legislation and includes an obligation to use some outdated methods, an example being the need to take out advertisements in national newspapers for a set number of days.  <br/><br/>The proposed Bill, while continuing to require an employer to carry out an LMNT before seeking to recruit from outside the EEA, will remove the detail of how this must be done, allowing for the setting out in regulations of the requirements needed to demonstrate real engagement with the jobs market in Ireland and across the EEA.  <br/><br/>Specifically, the intention is to remove the operational requirements from primary legislation and instead allow the media for advertising of vacancies to be prescribed in regulations and varied where necessary.  Some types of vacancies may be best advertised through social media, for example, while others may best be advertised in sector-specific journals or by a radio campaign.  Allowing leeway to employers to advertise as best fits their industry will improve the coherence and utility of the LMNT.  In tandem with this, it is intended to deepen the involvement of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in the LMNT process to maximise opportunities for resident and EEA jobseekers.<br/><br/>From time to time, an employer will seek a permit for a position that does not fall neatly within all of the usual criteria for granting an employment permit, but where the granting of the permit would clearly benefit the company and, by extension, the social or economic development of the State.  Up to the present time, when such a circumstance has arisen, we have generally had no option but to refuse the permit.  The circumstances in which such a permit might be granted will be clearly prescribed in regulations.  A limit to the number of such employment permits that might be granted in any calendar year will be considered.  Anchoring the prescription securely in primary legislation and setting the criteria precisely in regulations, so that this permit type cannot be used routinely to waive the requirements of the system, will be a priority.</p><p> The broad criteria we propose to prescribe are: where one or more criteria for grant of a permit cannot be satisfied, but no training for the occupation is available in Ireland, and where it requires an unusual skill set; for niche employments that do not occur with sufficient frequency to attract individuals into training or for which no formal training exists where the expertise is highly specialised and where training may not be replicated in Ireland, and where it is evident that the employment of the specific foreign national would benefit the competitiveness or development of the employing organisation and the economy as a whole; where a reciprocal bilateral agreement with another country may be made to allow for the employment in the State of a specified group of people for a particular purpose or for a specified period of time; and where an enterprise development agency has supported the application despite its failure to meet some of the criteria on the basis that the appointment of that specific individual will bring a significant benefit in terms of employment or competitiveness </p><p> There has been a general welcome from interested parties for this consolidating and amending legislation.  The development of this general scheme into a final draft Bill will be effected through further extensive consultation and in line with advice given by the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  We readily acknowledge that a number of the suggested changes currently set out in a general indicative format will require considered further drafting to ensure their parameters are in line with current jurisprudence, especially in the context of ensuring that the prescription of variables in secondary legislation, necessary to give the system the agility to respond quickly to changing conditions in the economy, should remain securely anchored in primary legislation. </p><p> I would like to address the issue of access to the labour market for spouses and partners of employment permit holders, as I understand the committee has an interest in this.  Generally speaking, the economic migration system focuses on the skills and labour needs of the State, and wider immigration questions, including that of family reunification, are matters for the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Those workers coming into the country on a general employment permit do not have an automatic right to immediate family reunification.  An exception is made, with the consent and support of the Minister for Justice and Equality, in the case of critical skills employment permit holders and researchers in the State on hosting agreements.  These permissions are granted to attract highly skilled individuals to migrate permanently to the State.  This exception is made to encourage these permit holders to settle here with their families. </p><p> While the spouse or partner of a critical skills permit holder was always permitted to seek work in Ireland, they had to first find an eligible job and then apply for an employment permit.  The system was cumbersome, unclear and caused significant confusion, and it needed to be changed. </p><p> Since March 2019, following agreement between our two Departments, the Minister for Justice and Equality has been granting permission directly to a critical skills employment permit holder's spouse or partner to reside and work in the State, obviating the need for him or her to apply for a permit.  This streamlining of the process benefits all concerned, as it brings absolute clarity to the matter and significantly reduces the administrative burden for all concerned.  The move was universally welcomed by all interested parties and got considerable positive media coverage at the time.</p><p> We appreciate the committee&rsquo;s attention, and would welcome any guidance prior to and during the drafting process which would support the policy objectives underlying the general scheme.  My colleagues and I are happy to answer any questions members might have on this general scheme.</p></speech>

Before opening it to the floor, I have a question about spouses.  She said that while the spouses or partners of a critical skills employment permit holders were always permitted to seek work in Ireland, they had to first find an eligible job and then apply for an employment permit.  Did that mean they had to apply for that before entering the country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.576" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Clare Dunne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019111300002#F00300"><p>No, they could do that while they were in the country, but while in the country if they came over with their spouses or partners and decided subsequently they wanted to find a job, they would first have to find eligible employment.  By that I mean they would not have been allowed to apply for any employment on the ineligible list of employments.  Once they found the job, they would then be eligible to apply for a permit and then by extension to apply to the Department of Justice and Equality for a change in their visa, their immigration status.</p> <p>  Therefore, a person used to find a job, apply for it, be fairly certain of getting it and engage with the employer.  However, the minute the prospective employer realised they did not have an automatic right to start work quickly, they were often reluctant to engage further with the spouse or partner.  In this policy, clearly the Department was at cross-purposes.  On the one hand we want to do everything possible to encourage these people to come to Ireland and settle here with their families and on the other hand we were making it very difficult for them to do so.  While they could apply for a permit, get a permit and work in the State, it was very cumbersome.  There was considerable misinformation going around.  We wanted to bring clarity and streamline the process.</p></speech>

This drew the committee's attention to it.  Many lower-paid employees were very dependent on their wages and in some instances they were laid off because there was no work.  They also had spouses with them.  We wrote to the Department because we were very concerned about how they would survive because they did not have any entitlements.</p></speech>

I am aware that there was engagement, including between my Department and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and between the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the employers and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine over that.  State benefits were extended to those who were very much in need.  I have it in my notes somewhere that an emergency payment was made payable to those people even though that would not have been anticipated when they came into the country.  Nobody could have anticipated what happened in that case.</p> <p>  Most employers did all they could to restructure jobs and move people from one plant that was not operating to a sister plant the might have still been operating.  They may have put them on other duties, such as maintenance or cleaning, for a while.  Some of them sent employees on training courses on things like health and safety, and maintenance.  I know the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection engaged and where appropriate it advanced payments to people.</p></speech>

The obvious one that springs to mind is horticulture.  The other thing that we are aware of, which became very apparent during the course of the review last year, is that Ireland is a clear outlier.  We are one of very few countries that does not make any provision for a seasonal permit, including a recurrent permit where migrant workers could come and work in the country for six, seven or eight months and come back again the following year.  The only other country that I am aware of that does not have a seasonal permit is Denmark.  Every other country has one.  Even when Greece was in the depths of its financial crisis, it still needed to bring in certain seasonal permits.</p> <p>  We will need to work closely with stakeholders and look at what is happening outside Ireland as we develop that permit.  The permit would apply to non-EEA nationals.  That non-EEA national would retain a legal domicile in his or her own country but would reside temporarily in Ireland for the purposes of employment.  We would have to look at the duration of the permit.  It could be five or six months, depending on the sector.  The permit holder will not have immediate access to State benefits.  Minimum remuneration thresholds will be applied.  As happens in other countries, we will look to employers to ensure that they support the employee with matters such as flights, access to reasonable accommodation and sometimes language courses or classes.  We would limit the permit to certain sectors and occupations.  We would look at potential risks because we are aware that potential risks attach to such a permit, such as overstaying the duration of the permit.  Those are the main criteria.  We have plenty of examples such as the scheme in the UK and we are looking at many countries, including New Zealand, Canada, Australia, the United States, South Korea and Japan.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the labour market needs test.  Currently, an employer is required to satisfy the Department that it has made every effort to get somebody.  We make no bones about it.  The Government policy is to give preferential treatment to local jobseekers and jobseekers across the EEA.  We need some assurance that some effort has been made to recruit somebody locally or from the EEA.  Employers are currently required to demonstrate to us that they have advertised for two weeks in Ireland and across the EEA.  Quite often, a criterion in Ireland is that an employer must take out an advertisement in a national newspaper for three days.  Quite frankly, how that ever ended up in primary legislation-----</p></speech>

Nowadays, people advertise on social media, across the web, in journals etc.  That is why we want to take the detail out.  We are moving to change the duration of the labour market needs test, for which we do not need to change legislation.  Two weeks is a very short time after which an employer can come back to us and tell us that it has tried its best to recruit across the EEA and in Ireland.

The proposed measures and changes seem very sensible.  I have a specific question which I think comes in under the 50:50 rule and labour market needs test.  It is a scenario that I encountered when meeting businesses, some of which were considering repatriating or moving significant numbers of staff to Ireland, some in a Brexit scenario and some that would have been looking at Ireland as a destination anyway.  One employer approached me to say it had a number of staff working in the UK, with a possibility post Brexit that it might bring them to Ireland.  It was a technology business and many staff were non-EEA and non-EU nationals.  The company came across an issue with the 50:50 rule where, if it tried to bring in all of those people in one go, it would fall foul of that rule and not be able to bring them in.</p><p>It said to me that this is an opportunity for Ireland to receive foreign direct investment by having a company come in <i>en masse</i>from another jurisdiction.  It would not be able to satisfy the 50:50 requirement immediately upon arrival but perhaps a scenario could be envisaged where it was given five years to ramp up.  In other words, if it moved the workforce into Ireland and brought 100 or 120 people into Ireland, many of whom are non-EEA nationals, it might give a commitment that within five years of operation, it would have a number of Irish or EEA employees to match.  That seemed to be something reasonable and positive that we should encourage.  I know there is a provision for certain start-ups but this is not really a start-up scenario, but one with a company that is new to Ireland but is not a start-up.  It is actually an established, successful business.  I do not know if that is something that could be considered in the Bill.  Perhaps it could be looked at in an amendment or in the early drafting stages.  I am interested in opinions on that.  It seems like a legitimate scenario and difficulty that should be tackled.</p></speech>

Migrant workers are often vulnerable, especially at the lower-paid end.  We already have a provision whereby for new companies coming into Ireland, not just start-ups, we operate a waiver system, especially if they are coming in with the assistance of Enterprise Ireland or IDA Ireland, which would know the company.  There is already a waiver of two years where we would allow companies to go beyond the 50:50 rule.</p><p>It is one reason we would allow them to go beyond the 50:50 rule.  We would look at that.  One reason we want to amend the legislation is that we do not want to build such an inflexibility into primary legislation.  We want to make sure that if there is a valid and verifiable reason to waive such a provision, it is given due consideration and, if possible, a favourable consideration. </p></speech>

Ms Dunne went some distance in assuring me when she spoke about an indicative wage, which I assume would be above the minimum wage, and that the Department would look at transport, accommodation and so on.  That is encouraging.  I assume the Department will engage with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in this regard.  I accept there are sectors - and outliers in those sectors - that would need this, and horticulture was referred to.  I am concerned that we would facilitate industries or employers who do not want to pay a fair wage and who would not want to give people their rights, and language is a consideration.  In fairness, Ms Dunne said a lot of things - without being asked - that were reassuring, but I would like to have more on that.  Ms Dunne referred to six to nine months' duration.  Nine months seems to be a long time for a seasonal permit, given that it may be getting renewed annually.  I would like some further clarity on that.  Perhaps I could get answers to these first and then pose another question later if that is okay.</p></speech>

We recognise that we are disadvantaging certain sectors and certain companies at the moment.  They are finding workarounds.  Many of them are working very hard to bring in seasonal workers from across the EEA, but this is becoming increasingly difficult, for example, with some of the Baltic states or the eastern European states.  We want to do something for them but we are very much aware that there is the potential for risks.  The Senator mentioned the nine-month permit.  I tend to agree that nine months is at the very outer limit of a seasonal permit.  We are engaging with the sector on an individual basis, such as with companies that are big employers in the sector.  From the meetings we have had thus far, I am reassured that most of the issues about which we have concerns already are being addressed.  They make the point to us that they invest a lot in these people, they train them when they come in and they invest in skills development.  The companies want those people to come back year in and year out.  Employers do not want the seasonal workers simply for four months and then be obliged to go back to the trough again next year.  The areas we are concerned about include access to suitable accommodation and the employer not being allowed to make any deductions directly from the salary.  Moreover, any remuneration package would have to be above the minimum wage.  We want to see provisions for these built into the scheme.  There will be extensive consultation with ICTU and the employers' side as we move to develop the scheme.  We will leave no stone unturned.  Initially, we might do something on a pilot basis.  I would not exclude that.  At the least, we need in the legislation the provision to allow us to be flexible.  At the moment we simply cannot, and our hands are tied in that regard.  This is just an example of the inflexibility of the system.  I accept all of the points the Senator has made.  We will be looking at all of those aspects.</p></speech>

One employer, for example, has told us that many of the people who come in on the seasonal employment permits come for a period of four or five months.  Generally, they are older workers, not students, and while they want to go home and spend part of the year at home they want to come back here the following year.  In that way a good employer will try to build up a good working relationship and a good rapport with the seasonal workers to get them back again.</p></speech>

I absolutely accept the rationale for these changes.  I believe this would apply to the more highly skilled end of things.  The Department has laid out some criteria already in that regard.  Ms Dunne will appreciate the concern that the employer has made every effort to attempt to give a job to someone who is in the country, and maybe even a person who is on the unemployment register.  The Department is considering a four-week period, using modern recruitment practices and working with the Department Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p></speech>

Previous speakers have referred to the need for seasonal work permits.  Ms Dunne said that there is quite clearly an obvious need.  Will Ms Dunne explain why she believes there is that need?  What are the underlying conditions that warrant us going outside Ireland and the EU to get people to work in seasonal jobs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.615" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Clare Dunne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019111300002#H01100"><p>There are a variety of reasons and I can only list some of them.  Some of this work is difficult work.  Fruit picking, for example, is not easy.  Employers here and in the UK are finding that many of the people living locally do not want to do these jobs.  The positions are not at the higher end of the pay scale and would be lower wage-type jobs.  As we have seen a pick-up in economic circumstances across the EU, many people do not want to travel from what would have been the traditional sources of migrant labour such as Bulgaria, for example.  Some of the horticulture companies still attract significant numbers of workers from Bulgaria every year but are finding it increasingly difficult to do so.  Having spoken with the sector and having engaged with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, there is sufficient evidence for us on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.616" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019111300002#H01200"><p>That is okay.  To be fair, I pre-empted the answer Ms Dunne was going to give, and I agree, but it is not just restricted to seasonal work permits.  Many other workforce sectors face the exact same challenges.  The hospitality sector is finding it next to impossible to get cleaning and housekeeping staff and in restaurants, it is front of house and waiting staff.  These are all necessary jobs to ensure our hospitality sector continues to grow and develop but, while I am open to correction, I understand those concerned are prevented from being able to recruit people to such positions because of the minimum wage threshold being implemented.</p><p>I am thinking of care assistants in the health sector.  There are many private and indeed public nursing homes that are having to employ nurses in the role of care assistant because care assistants do not meet the threshold in terms of qualification and remuneration.  If it is okay for one sector, why are we bringing in restrictions for other sectors where there is a clear, demonstrable need for people from outside the EU and Ireland?</p></speech>

The seasonal permit is going to be of short duration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.619" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019111300002#J00300"><p>It will up to nine months.</p></speech>

We will consider everything but I agree with the previous speaker that nine months is probably the outer limit.  We engage on an ongoing basis very closely with all of these sectors.  In terms of care assistants, we are keenly aware of the demands of the nursing home association - I cannot remember the organisation's name - and we are also engaging with the Department of Health.  We sit on top of the system, as it were, in terms of the policy around the granting of employment permits, but we are not experts in each of these individual sectors.  We rely closely on the knowledge of the lead Department in a particular sector.  In the case of horticulture or meat processing, that is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as well as the sector itself.  In the case of care assistants for nursing homes, it is the Department of Health.  We are engaging with them on an ongoing basis and the Department of Health officials are telling us they are not convinced at this point that there is a case made to open up the employment permits system to bringing in care assistants.  They in turn are engaging with the sector.  What they are saying is that the sector needs to do a bit more work here.  They believe the evidence points to issues around retention and that the sector is not paying these workers sufficiently to employ them locally.  Remuneration, hours of work and the possibility of career progression are all issues within that sector that need to be addressed to some extent.  That was a condition, for example, when we opened up the system to certain areas in agriculture.  We made sure that they looked at retention issues.  Rather than simply agreeing with a sector that it can continue to pay low wages and have long hours and poor working conditions, the sector itself needs an incentive to change to make it more attractive, as it were.  No sector can rely forevermore on bringing in cheap labour.  That is not a sustainable proposition.</p></speech>

We all want local Irish citizens to be employed and to spread employment to the EEA if there are people available in those countries to be employed.  We are acknowledging they are not available to be employed in the horticultural sector.  One of the reasons, as Ms Dunne said, is that it is a difficult job.  Another is the remuneration that is being paid which quite often is all that can be paid because of the margin that the employers are working off.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.622" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Clare Dunne" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2019111300002#J00600"><p>Sure.</p></speech>

I am merely stating that it is not a level playing pitch and that there are other sectors.  I referred to care assistants in nursing homes and also to the hospitality sector.  I understand 100 permits are being given to the haulage sector to employ people from South Africa and it is having difficulties meeting the numbers that are coming.  I am not for one minute advocating cheap labour but I am advocating for sectors of our economy.  The hospitality sector is most important and is our largest indigenous sector.  Employers in the sector are finding it extremely difficult to get staff in critical areas and the work permit system is prohibiting them from employing people from a wider field.  That needs to be re-examined.  This is an ideal opportunity to make that point.  Ms Dunne referred to the minimum wage moving upwards.  To what level does the Department intend it to move towards?  I think it is &euro;30,000 currently with a degree qualification and &euro;60,000 without a degree qualification.</p> <p>  We are talking about increasing the labour market needs test.  Will the new legislation impose a time limit on processing applications?  Private employers must, correctly, meet a threshold and certain criteria in terms of documentation and justification when making a submission to the Department to obtain a permit.  However, there is no time limit on the Department to reply in a timely fashion.  I know from replies to parliamentary questions that the time it takes to have permits issued is increasing.  This is creating a major difficulty, especially in respect of chefs.  Restaurants are closing down because they cannot get staff and employment permits.  I have no problem with refusals where insufficient information is provided with the application and so on.  That is the applicant's fault.  However, the process is taking to long, even where the applicant is used to making applications, does so correctly and provides supporting documentation.  Does the Department have plans to reduce the processing time?</p> <p>  On the trusted partnerships, is there any scope for having other sectors become trusted partnerships?  I am thinking of chefs or the hospitality sector, which has representative bodies.  Could the representative body become a trusted partner?  It would process the application initially, send it on to the Department with the bulk of the work done and hopefully it would be turned around in a fortnight or so.  </p></speech>

I also accept that it is engaging with the parent Departments of the various sectors.  I do not believe that there is full appreciation of the serious challenges that exist within the hospitality, haulage and private health sectors.  We know the challenges around retaining nurses in our public hospitals.</p><p>The challenges are twice as great in many private sector facilities.  The problem is compounded by the issue of less qualified staff working in these sectors.</p></speech>

As I understand it, the Deputy raised four broad areas.  The first related to other sectors such as hospitality and care assistants.  We review the ineligible list and the critical skills list under the employment permit system twice a year.  We do that in a very systematic and evidence-based way.  We engage in widespread consultation with all of the key stakeholders, including all of the representative bodies, individual employers and the relevant Departments.  We engage with the major data sources compiled by the likes of SOLAS and make use of the national skills bulletin and the national vacancy overview.  Wherever there is a clear demonstrable need to take an occupation off the ineligible list or add one to the critical skills list, we will act on that need but we need the evidence.  As I said, with regard to care assistants we are engaging very closely with the Department of Health and the other key stakeholders.  They are telling us that, as of yet, they do not believe there is sufficient evidence to take care assistants off the list.  We are guided by the lead Department, which is very close to the sector.  That is the case at present.  I am not saying it will not change in the future but that is what we are told now.  The Department of Health is engaging with the nursing home sector.  That is just an example.</p> <p>  With regard to the hospitality sector, again we engage very closely with the industry.  We are coming to the end of our second review of the list system this year and we will meet representatives of the hospitality sector shortly.  We engage with them on an ongoing basis.  If they have clear evidence that demonstrates that they cannot find cleaning staff or bar staff, and that is verified in the skills bulletin or the national vacancy overview, we will listen to that.  Our job is to listen to the needs of the economy.  We are not the work permits police, nor do we want to be.  We take a very measured approach based on evidence and engagement with the sector and the lead Department.  We engage regularly with the hospitality sector and the health sector.</p> <p>  We have an interdepartmental group that was initially set up to oversee the conduct of the review.  That interdepartmental group, which I chair on behalf of the Department, meets at a senior level across all relevant Departments, including the Departments of Education and Skills, Health, Public Expenditure and Reform, Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Transport, Tourism and Sport, and Housing, Planning and Local Government.  All of the key Departments are represented on that interdepartmental group.  We meet regularly.  SOLAS is also part of the group.  Decisions of this nature are taken collectively.  Where a sector can produce evidence, we will respond.  I want to make that clear.  With regard to seasonal permits, we have been provided with clear evidence over time and we have been persuaded that this is the way to go.</p> <p>  The second question the Deputy asked was about the minimum annual remuneration.  When legislation on work permits was introduced in the 2006 Act, it was decided to link the minimum annual remuneration to what was then the average industrial wage or average annual earnings as a benchmark.  We were mindful of the fact that we were trying to attract people with critical skills or skills that were in short supply in Ireland.  The wage levels have not been revisited since that time and are now way out of kilter with average annual earnings.  We are trying to gradually move the minimum annual earnings back up-----</p></speech>

It will be increased to bring it into line with the average industrial wage, which is about &euro;40,000, but we are going to do this in incremental steps.  From January of next year, the lower threshold of &euro;30,000 will rise to &euro;32,000 for those with critical skills.  The &euro;60,000 threshold will rise to &euro;64,000.  That is the explanation.  It is just a matter of keeping pace with the average industrial wage.</p></speech>

With regard to the sectors which I outlined, Ms Dunne mentioned the construction sector.  I also should have made reference to it because it faces many challenges.  If a need to widen the permit with respect to jobs within these sectors can be demonstrated, would these skills be regarded as critical?  What did Ms Dunne call the list?</p></speech>

Everything in between, which includes the vast majority of jobs, is eligible for a general employment permit as long as the employer can demonstrate through the labour market needs test that a person cannot be sourced locally or within the European Economic Area.  The vast bulk of employments within the State are eligible for an employment permit through a general permit or a critical skills permit.  We are moving to take occupations off the ineligible list.  Those that are on it are generally lower-skilled occupations where there are clearly people available within the domestic market or the EEA to fill positions.  Is that okay as an explanation of the minimum annual remuneration?</p></speech>

That level of detail will not be included in the legislation.  We are, however, acutely aware that processing times are not what we would like them to be and that they do not align with our own customer service commitments.  They are, however, decreasing because of the additional resources we are getting and the changes we are making to how we do things.  People are on overtime.  Trusted partner permits are currently being processed within three weeks, which is good.  The general employment permits are being processed within nine weeks, which is quicker than it has been for some time.  The difficulties exist because the demand for permits has increased exponentially in recent years.  The answer is not to keep throwing resources at processors.  Over the medium term, we are looking at developing an IT solution that will provide a digital end-to-end system.  We are trying to take people out of the day-to-day processing and to reduce the number just keying in details.  We want to move towards a digitised system.  That should speed up the process.  We are coming to the end of the first phase of that process, which started with a business process re-engineering exercise.  That is almost finished.  Already, without introducing any IT system, that process has shown us improvements that can be made to the current system which will help us to process applications more quickly.  As I have said, the processing times are currently at three weeks and nine weeks.  We are constantly working to reduce those times.</p></speech>

To become a trusted partner, one must be an employer because it is job related and related to a specific contract.  We only deal with employers.  We do not deal with federations or bodies of that nature.  It is not difficult to become a trusted partner and there is no cost involved.  If anything, it will save an employer a lot of time because he or she will do once for two years what currently must be done each time a permit is applied for.  I accept that if somebody is just applying for one permit every five years they will not qualify as a trusted partner.  If the employer is applying for two or three permits over a period, then we are not terribly stringent about that and would look favourably on that.  It means that one would fill out all the employer details once and we keep them in our system.  Any permits the employer needs over the following two years will be easier to apply for.  It is quite a simple process.</p></speech>

It is one person, and we had never heard of the particular skill set.  The company is small so it would not need 15 heart strings butchers, they were just going to have one.  It is for that kind of circumstance where we know the job is not going to be a constant vacancy and the skill set is almost completely unique but for some reason it falls foul of our system because it is ineligible or due to the remuneration level.  It is about being able to have a system that is flexible enough to recognise that there are circumstances which are unusual and which we should be able to deal with.</p></speech>

We are joined by Ms Caroline Counihan, legal policy director at the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, RCNI.  She is very welcome.  From the Law Society, we are joined by Mr. Robert Purcell and Ms &Aacute;ine Breathnach.  They are both very welcome.  I note some of their colleagues are present in the Visitors Gallery, including Mr. Ken Murphy.  I do not recognise everyone but they are all very welcome.  I ask our visitors to put mobile phones on silent.  I will shortly invite each of our guests to address us, starting with Deputy O'Callaghan.</p> <p>  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

As the Chairman mentioned, the purpose of this meeting is for the committee to scrutinise legislation I introduced last year.  It is a small Bill titled the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) (Amendment) Bill 2018.  In order for legislation to progress further through the Houses of the Oireachtas, we apply scrutiny through today's process.  Neither I nor anyone on the committee is particularly sensitive, so the witnesses should feel free to be very critical of the legislation and to outline how it could be improved.  This is a very important part of the process of ensuring that any legislation introduced is effective and works.  I thank the Rape Crisis Network Ireland and the Law Society for their opening statements, which we have received and I have read closely.  They are very helpful contributions to the debate.</p> <p>  I will give an overview of the reasons for the legislation and its effect, if introduced.  The reasons for the legislation derive from the fact that in Ireland we have low levels of reporting of sexual offences.  In recent years, the recorded crime figures have shown that reporting of sexual offences has increased but that is probably partly because we have had such low levels of reporting in the past and much of the increase is accounted for by historical reporting of previous offences.  Many people who are victims of sexual offences and rape find it a very intimidating process and they do not report those offences to the same extent as somebody who is a victim of an assault on the street or a burglary.  I know it is difficult to accumulate accurate statistics in this respect, but the One in Four organisation has estimated that only 15% of victims of sexual abuse make complaints to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Irrespective of the true figures in that respect, we as legislators have a responsibility to take legislative steps to improve those statistics and make it more comfortable for people who are victims of sexual assault to come forward and make complaints to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p> <p>  As I said, part of the reason for this is that many victims of these offences find the criminal justice system quite intimidating.  It is an intimidating system for many persons involved in it.  Its primary function is to determine whether a person accused of a particular offence is guilty or not guilty.  It is unfortunately also true in cases involving rape or sexual assault that the complainant very much becomes a party heavily involved in those proceedings.  The process by which the complainant comes before the court can have a very negative effect on him or her, and can also have a very negative effect on other persons reading about the experience complainants have had.</p> <p>  The purpose of the Bill we are discussing is to amend progressive and important legislation enacted by the Houses two years ago, the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017.  Specifically, this Bill seeks to amend section 17, which deals with special measures during investigations.  At present, the section contains provisions outlining the special measures which may be implemented in respect of a victim during the course of the investigation of an alleged offence.  One of the special measures available to the victim is that where the alleged offence involves sexual violence, gender-based violence or violence in a close relationship, the victim may be informed of his or her right to request that interviews are carried out by a person of the same sex as him or her.  That is a welcome addition to the protections available to a complainant, but the purpose of this legislation is to go further and provide greater protection and support to individuals who come forward and make complaints.</p> <p>  One often hears when speaking to persons who have been through the criminal justice process as a complainant, particularly in cases involving sexual assault and rape, that they did not realise at the outset the extent and nature of the process in which they were getting involved.</p><p> For instance, they were not aware that statements they provide to the Garda and the statements of other people supporting them would be provided to the accused, as they must be.  They are unaware that when it gets to court for the hearing of the prosecution that the complainant will be required to give evidence in respect of their statement.  They are unaware that the complainant will require to be cross-examined by the accused in the case or by counsel representing the accused.  They may be unaware of the extent to which their case can become an issue of public notoriety in the newspapers, notwithstanding that their identity will be protected.</p><p> The purpose of this short amending legislation is to provide that in such cases of sexual violence, gender-based violence or violence in a close relationship, where complainants go to make a complaint at the outset, they will be provided with relevant information and legal advice by a solicitor, funded by the Minister, advising the victim of the process involved and actions required for criminal proceedings in respect of the alleged offence to be brought and heard.</p><p> Currently, in many instances this protection and resource is provided by rape crisis centres, which have their expertise.  Individuals can be given advice by a solicitor as to what will be involved in the process.  However, it would be beneficial if we could enact that and ingrain it in legislation.</p><p> The Bill seeks to provide levels of support that I believe will not be costly for the State.  We propose that legal advice under the criminal legal aid scheme be provided to complainants.  It will not involve them being represented at the hearing of the process because laws exist for that to apply.  However, it will mean that at the outset, formal legal advice will be given to a complainant, telling her - as the case generally is - of what is involved in the criminal process and being present for the complainant as she goes through that process of the complaint leading up to the prosecution.</p><p> I am conscious that in practice this will require the State to fund legal aid solicitors who will be able to provide this scheme.  I will be interested to hear from the Law Society regarding the extent to which it believes this would be a burdensome process on any solicitor.  It would be beneficial if complainants knew before going to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that if they go down the process of making a complaint, they will have the support of a solicitor funded by the State, who will be able to advise them in respect of what is involved in this process.  Provision of such information would be beneficial because it would give individuals an overview of what is involved.  In a way it is a hand-holding exercise to make them feel more comfortable when it comes to the process of making the complaint.</p><p> That is the purpose behind the Bill.  We are starting off in the legislative process and amendments will be tabled in respect of it.  I am happy to hear any amendments that might be recommended by RCNI, the Law Society or any colleagues.  It would be a valuable addition to provide that level of support for complainants in what are very difficult criminal acts perpetrated against them and where they need the support of the State to bring the complaint.</p></speech>

I will make four main points.<br/><br/>There is a need for legal advice for victims of sexual violence in criminal proceedings.  The criminal justice system, though it has improved, remains daunting for these victims.  The intimate nature of these offences, their association with still powerful rape myths and the fear of being victimised in cross-examination all combine to make many victims reluctant to make and sustain a criminal complaint.  Having access to independent legal advice from early on can and does empower victims to make and sustain a complaint.  In our view, such access should be the right of victims of sexual offences and arguably other serious offences.<br/><br/>While RCNI can provide some legal support to individual survivors on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis because, thankfully, it is funded to do so by the Department of Justice, unfortunately this additional assistance is not adequate to meet the needs of all victims for legal advice from offence to conclusion of criminal proceedings and beyond.<br/><br/>As members will be aware, victims of sexual and other offences now have the right to have their legal representative present whenever they report an offence to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or make a formal complaint to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in addition to a person of their choice, subject to certain restrictions.  In our view, victims should be able to exercise this right without worrying about the cost.<br/><br/>My second point follows on from the first.  The current provision is not adequate to meet the needs of victims.  I stress that I mean no criticism of the Legal Aid Board when I say this.  In principle, RCNI welcomes any expansion of victims' rights to legal advice as they negotiate the criminal justice process.  At present, victims of sexual violence are entitled to free legal advice from the Legal Aid Board regardless of means, provided that a prosecution is in being and that the accused person is charged with rape, aggravated sexual assault, defilement, incest or one of a short list of trafficking and prostitution-related offences.  They are also entitled to free legal advice and representation from the Legal Aid Board, again regardless of means, in two limited situations: when there is a defence application for leave to introduce evidence into the trial of their other sexual experiences or when they wish to object to disclosure of their counselling records.<br/><br/>However, victims of sexual violence are not entitled to any free legal advice from the Legal Aid Board before anyone is charged with an offence.  Neither are they entitled to that advice if the accused person is charged with sexual assault, by far the most common offence reported and charged.  My experience is that the greatest demand for this advice is at two distinct stages: before the victim decides to make a formal complaint to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and later on, if the DPP decides not to prosecute in his or her case, and the victim must decide whether to look for the reasons for that decision and-or to seek a review of the decision.  That said, of course, victims also look for advice and support at any stage throughout the investigation and prosecutorial stages, and beyond.<br/><br/>It will be seen that the existing provisions are not adequate to meet victims&rsquo; needs for legal information and advice.  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is obliged to, and does, provide information about the criminal justice process itself and about protective measures, special measures and other rights specific to victims of crime, it is not its role to provide independent legal advice to victims of sexual violence, for instance, as to whether they should object to disclosure of counselling or other personal records, or whether they should request a review of the decision not to prosecute in their case.<br/><br/>Our third point is that while the Bill is welcome, it could go even further to improve legal support to victims.  It represents a good start, but it could be improved further.  For instance, RCNI would remove the qualification at the start of the section 17(1) of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, &quot;during the course of an investigation&quot;, as far as the right to legal advice is concerned, because so many victims in my 11 years' experience need detailed information and legal advice - perhaps more than once - before they decide to report the offence.</p><p>The RCNI suggests that, instead of using the word &ldquo;provided&rdquo;, the section should read &ldquo;be informed of his or her right to be provided with legal advice from a solicitor [whether funded by the Legal Aid Board or directly by the Minister for Justice and Equality] about the criminal justice process to be followed so that criminal proceedings in respect of the alleged offence may be brought and heard&rdquo;, or include something very similar in order that it would be clear that not only did the Legal Aid Board or another entity have responsibility for funding the provision of any advice requested but also that unwanted or unnecessary advice would not be provided.</p><p> RCNI also suggests considering amendments to section 26(3A) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 to the effect that legal advice could be provided by the Legal Aid Board free of charge, regardless of the sexual offence involved, from the moment the offence took place until the conclusion of criminal proceedings at least, subject, of course, to the overriding control of the case staying with the prosecuting lawyer.  It would also provide for attendance at the Garda station or other venue when the victim reported the offence or made a formal complaint, if the victim so wished.  It would provide for legal advice and support to be made available to a victim whenever a negative decision on prosecution was received from the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p><p> Victims of sexual violence need advocacy support, as well as legal advice and information.  The response of State agencies to victims of sexual violence has improved significantly in recent times.  However, when that response is inappropriate, altogether lacking or downright wrong, many victims find it hard to address the issue, even if they know what their rights are.  Rape crisis centres will do their best to provide advocacy support for their clients as far as they can within the limits of their training and expertise.  Garda and court accompaniment volunteers are given some general training in the law and procedures relevant to victims of sexual offences, thanks to the Department of Justice and Equality which funds the programme, while they also have access to some legal support from RCNI.  However, we would prefer to see a system in place under which each rape crisis centre would have continuous access to advocacy services for their clients from a dedicated and appropriately trained professional advocacy and support worker.  To that end, we are applying for funding for a pilot scheme to employ such a worker at one or, possibly, two rape crisis centres.  A scheme such as this is already working very well in Scotland and has been evaluated positively.</p><p> In our view, advocacy and support workers would complement the work of solicitors in providing legal advice and information for victims of sexual offences.  It would be the role of these workers to make themselves available to listen to victims&rsquo; fears and concerns, provide for accompaniment to Garda interviews, court appearances and, elsewhere as necessary, to ensure victims would understand what their rights were and to liaise with legal advisers and garda&iacute; and others, as necessary, to ensure the concerns of victims were heard and addressed.  There is no question of their giving legal advice.  Instead, they would refer victims to the appropriate sources to receive that advice.</p><p> We note that in his report on the law and procedure for serious sexual offences in Northern Ireland published in May Sir John Gillen recommended that general legal advice and information on the relevant law and procedure be made available to victims of sexual offences up to the commencement of a trial and that the Northern Ireland Department of Justice sensure the advocacy and support scheme, proposed to start there in 2020, be similar to the one already established in Scotland.</p><p> I am happy to answer questions about any aspect of this statement and on the issue of legal advice for victims of sexual violence more generally.</p></speech>

The Bill comes at an important time for Ireland, having just ratified the Istanbul Convention, that is, the Council of Europe convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.  Our obligations under the convention must be matched by clear actions, structural changes and necessary resourcing.  It also arises on the eve of publication of Professor Tom O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s review of the conduct of investigations and prosecutions of sexual offences.  The society, practitioners and others await the recommendations to be made in that review which we anticipate will further support the victim in these circumstances, while not compromising the rights of the accused.  I am joined by my colleague &Aacute;ine Breathnach.  Both of us practise in this area and are members of the society&rsquo;s human rights and equality and criminal law committees, respectively<br/><br/>As of today, the right to legal aid and representation for victims of sexual and gender based violence is <i>ad hoc</i>and piecemeal.  The Bill provides an opportunity for the State to develop a comprehensive legal advice and aid service for victims of sexual and gender based violence in a way that will support them throughout the criminal justice process.  The prosecution and successful conviction of sexual offences are necessary in a society that wants to protect and vindicate the rights of all victims of sexual and gender based violence, including women, girls, boys and men.  It is in the public interest for victims to be supported through the legal process as the victim is the primary and often only witness of these crimes which, by their very nature, strike at the core of their dignity.  It is also important that victims be aware of their rights to privacy on issues of disclosure of counselling, phone records, medical records and other personal information.  The witness, complainant or victim, depending on circumstances, is key to a successful prosecution and, as such, should be afforded comprehensive and continuous representation.  Currently, victims have no right to legal representation before making a complaint to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <br/><br/>I support the remarks made in the previous submission on this matter.  The provision of information on what could be coming down the line for a person embarking on this process is extremely important and forewarned is forearmed in this situation.  It would also attempt to avert the experiences relayed to Deputy O'Callaghan by somebody who had been through the process.  There is also no right to legal representation where the Director of Public Prosecutions decides not to prosecute, while there is limited funding to provide for a right to legal representation in the disclosing of counselling and medical notes.  <br/><br/>The Bill represents a lifeline and important public service for those affected and Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan is to be commended for advancing it.  Some of things to which I have referred are happening for practitioners, but they are being done without payment, generally because of the means of the individual concerned.  The Government's support for the Bill is welcome.  Its endorsement of the Istanbul Convention and the Domestic Violence Act in recent years provides practitioners with hope its interest in criminal justice issues is genuine and sincere.<br/><br/>I will address a number of issues dealt with in the Bill.  On the subject of providing clarity on the type of legal advice to be provided, there are many stages in dealing with a criminal complaint and prosecution.  The Bill will provide an opportunity for victims to make informed decisions throughout the process, provided that the right to funding for a solicitor and legal advice begins prior to making the complaint.  Use of a solicitor who is qualified and proficient in court procedures and criminal law is vital in navigating these boundaries.  The process involve a pre-complaint to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, an investigation stage, a prosecution stage, the decision of a jury or judge and the sentencing stage, as well as a consequential appeal stage.<br/><br/>The Bill is an important step in supporting victims of sexual violence through the very complex and gruelling process of a criminal justice trial.  It is submitted that a Bill such as this provides very necessary legal and technical support for victims of sexual and gender based violence.  Wider reform is, undoubtedly, needed in this area, particularly in the disclosure of sensitive details predating or unrelated to the prosecution, as well as concerning the rights of the victim.</p><p>The work and advocacy of supports services, such as RCNI, Rape Crisis Centre, and One in Four, as well as the genuine interest taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies, in the victims of sexual and gender-based violence must be commended and is vital.  <br/><br/>There will always be a need for comprehensive, timely and appropriately communicated information services.  The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act has been helpful in that regard.  However, legal aid and representation is distinct and particular to aiding a victim of sexual and gender-based violence through the complexity of the criminal justice process.  These cases are highly sensitive, legally complex, unique to the parties and with so much at stake that they demand a specific and bespoke representational role, that generalised information, however helpful, will not compare to. <br/><br/>In the life cycle of a case, from reporting to sentencing, a range of issues arise that demand a legal and qualified perspective, to protect the interests of the victim, and the credibility of the legal process.  On the delivery and management of this advice, there are a number of avenues the State could adopt to provide this service.  To date, the Legal Aid Board manages a number of <i>ad hoc</i>and specialised schemes in areas such as the Garda station legal advice scheme, and the international protection applicant legal aid scheme, as well as the limited schemes available for witnesses in rape trials.  It is likely that the provision of legal advice and aid as proposed under this Bill will require a blending of approaches in other schemes, however models exist and are operational that provide immediate and effective services in other areas that could be adapted for this service.  Most important, when designing this scheme continuity of service should be of primary concern to ensure that the victim does not have to repeat her account on a number of occasions to different lawyers and thus increase the risk of retraumatization.  <br/><br/>The question has been asked as to whether providing advice might delay criminal proceedings.  We do not believe that it would.  Criminal proceedings are likely to be more secure where the victim has representation and support and has an understanding of the process what is involved in the process and what they may have to go through in the future.  A well-considered scheme, such as those in place by the Legal Aid Board, and that safeguard continuous legal representation, are likely to speed up rather than delay proceedings.  Our vision of an appropriate scheme for the victim is one that runs in tandem with the case rather than part of the proceedings.  It is important to acknowledge that the accused's rights are no way diminished by improving the victims understanding of the process.  A fair trial is crucial.  We also wish to assist and aid any victim within legal parameters in respect of the trial process.  Our submission to the O&rsquo;Malley review identified a number of reforms that, hopefully, will be reflected in the final report.  These reforms are more likely to reduce delays, and include the introduction of pretrial hearings; specialist training for the Judiciary, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies; supports and information to victims throughout the process; the adequate resourcing of the aid and the courts; and case management by the courts. <br/><br/>The Government expressed concern that the scope of the Bill and the challenge of defining the offences.  However, current sexual offences legislation, in particular the 2017 Act, as well as the Domestic Violence Act 2018, provide assistance in identifying classes or categories of victims that would benefit from this Bill.  Broadly, legal aid is limited to those who are victims of aggravated sexual assault, rape, incest and child defilement.  A question that arises, which relates to our values as a society, is whether all people who claim that their personal dignity and privacy and safety has been violated should be afforded legal aid and representation.  <br/><br/>We urge the committee to appreciate Ireland's obligations under EU and international law and how this Bill plays an important part in it.  We urge it to fully engage with the O'Malley report that is due to be published, hopefully by the end of the year or perhaps by early next year.  Resourcing and specialisation are vital building blocks.  State agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Society, Bar Council and NGOs such as the Rape Crises Network all have a part to play.  A collaborative approach will be doing the State some service. <br/><br/>To conclude, the victim must be put front and centre, and how their interests are best protected, forms part of that obligation.  Ms Breathnach and I look forward to engaging with the committee on any questions it may have.</p></speech>

Sexual, domestic and gender-based violence are important issues and I am glad the committee is taking them so seriously.  I wish to note some points and then I will ask a question.  I welcome the Bill and offer it my strong support.  It is a short, concise Bill, which does not seek to move mountains.  It would secure greater information and support for people in difficult and vulnerable situations.  Given that we are dealing with highly sensitive complex cases, often involving a great deal of trauma and shame, it is only right that we make extra efforts to provide support.</p><p>Context is important.  Mr. Purcell mentioned how Ireland has just ratified the Istanbul convention on violence against women.  We need to ensure that it is not only aspiration but that we match the commitment with action and material support.  I have seen this with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, where words are not always followed by action.  Providing better and more inclusive legal aid and advice is an important step in this.</p><p>On improvements, the point made by Ms Counihan and the RCNI on when legal advice is needed is crucial.  I fully agree that people need this information and support before they contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or they might not make that call at all.  This is something we should consider for the Bill.</p><p>The Law Society presentation also sets out just how <i>ad hoc </i>and piecemeal the current system is.  That is the Bill's value as it would provide a framework for the State to put a clearer, simpler system together in one place.  If we did that, it would bring us closer to Deputy O'Callaghan's goal of increasing the number of people coming forward and would send a signal to women that if something awful does happen, there is a service that will support them comprehensively from day one.  That would be brilliant.  Currently, women can feel as though they are being passed around from service to service, which makes the entire process more daunting.  </p><p>I wish to ask Deputy O'Callaghan whether the money message issue might impact the Bill.  He will be aware that this is something on which I have worked closely over the past year.  I firmly believe the Government has been acting outside the bounds of the Constitution and abusing its power.  It seems possible if we finish this review and the Bill moves forward that the Government will argue that this will cost money and seek to veto it.  Is the hope that a money message will be provided?</p></speech>

Expenditure will be incurred under the legislation as the State will have to pay for solicitors providing the legal aid.  In contradistinction to other legislation with which the Senator will be familiar, the incurred expenditure is clear and it will require a money message but I would like to work collaboratively with the Government on this.  It has indicated a level of support for the Bill so I would not like to see it progress in an antagonistic way and just work with it with the Government.</p></speech>

Senator Black mentioned context.  I have read the Oireachtas Library and Research Service paper on this.  I always take the opportunity to thank them for their detailed work, which is tremendous.  In 2018, there were 16,994 disclosures of domestic violence alone.</p><p>The Bill seeks to cover more than domestic violence.  Reference is made to 19,089 contacts with Women's Aid.  The purpose of the Bill which I welcome is to bring about an increase in the number of people reporting sexual abuse, leading to successful prosecutions.  On page 10 of the Oireachtas Library and Research Service paper statistics are provided for a survey which are both fascinating and frightening.  The survey found that 22% of victims wanted to keep the abuse private, 18% feared reprisal and 16% cited shame.  If we add the three figures for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we get a total of 19%.  A total of 8% believed the police would do nothing about it, 6% felt it could not do anything about it, while 5% thought they would not be believed.  The legislation is welcome, but I hope amendments will be made to it.  It is being discussed in the context of dealing with an enormous problem.  In economic terms, we are talking about a figure of &euro;2.2 billion, which is a conservative estimate.  As a woman, I do not even want to use the economic argument, but it is really important for any Government that is serious about dealing with violence.</p><p> I have a number of questions for the delegates.  Has Mr. Purcell received information on the O'Malley report that the committee does not have?  He has said we are on the "eve" of its publication.  I have notes that indicate that it was to have been published at the end of 2018.  Then it was to be published in the first quarter of 2019.  Does Mr. Purcell know something we do not know?</p></speech>

Perhaps we might come back to that issue in due course as a committee as it is a vital piece of the jigsaw and was supposed to have been published by the end of 2018.  It has been quoted by the Government on numerous occasions.  We have been told that we should await the O'Malley review.  That is a very sensible suggestion, but for how long do we wait?</p> <p>  There is an existing Legal Aid Board scheme that covers a limited number of sexual offences, including rape.  The Bill seeks to extend the range of offences covered.  What concerns me is that there has been little uptake of the existing scheme, something on which I ask the delegates to comment.  Again, I thank the Library and Research Service for its paper on this issue which shows that the take up of legal advice is very low, with only one application being made in 2018 and four in 2017.  That begs the question as to what was the take-up prior to 2017 and 2018.  Why is it so low and what, if anything, has been done about it?</p></speech>

In my role in the past 11 years or so I have most commonly found that people want to receive advice prior to the point at which the Legal Aid Board provides assistance by way of legal advice, that is, before any prosecution is in being.  A lot of our work takes place before victims report to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and also when victims receive a decision from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions that it does not believe it is appropriate to prosecute.  Victims have to decide what to do about it, but, as members know, it is time-limited.  They have to make up their minds quickly.  So much of what we are talking about is sexual assault which is not covered by the scheme.  By far, that is the most relevant point.  By a factor of three or four, the sexual offence reported most frequently is charged as sexual assault which the Legal Aid Board's limited scheme does not cover.</p></speech>

Let us say, for example, that a person's sexual history is to be brought up during the course of a trial.  The defence will notify the prosecution which will then notify the Legal Aid Board which will brief a solicitor and a counsel who will attend with the victim or complainant and advise him or her in that regard.  If the court allows the cross-examination to take place, the counsel and the solicitor will remain in court and be part of the proceedings at that time.</p></speech>

The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 has assisted in the provision of information, but those lawyers do not give people specific legal advice tailored to them and their individual situations, as it is not within their remit to do so.  These people are victims, as stated in the legislation but, as Deputy O'Callaghan said, they are also witnesses in the State's case against the accused.</p></speech>

I thought that there was a system in place, under the legal aid scheme, to assist victims and provide them with independent legal advice in a limited number of cases.

We are anxious to have a much wider scheme in place.  The difficulty at the moment is that it is <i>ad hoc</i>and piecemeal.  Even as an expert, when I researched this issue prior to coming before the committee, it was difficult to find information on what was available, how to access it, who to ring, when the services were open and so on.  It was difficult to access information and find out what one was entitled to, even from a professional point of view.  A victim of an assault may not know what type of assault they have been subjected to, according to the legal definitions, and so they will not know where to look for assistance.  We would like a much more comprehensive service that would start with the victim at the beginning and continue all the way through.  That would limit any kind of retraumatization of the victim through having to retell their account to different solicitors or lawyers throughout the process.  Unfortunately, the service is currently very narrow and piecemeal and thus it is very difficult to assess what impact it has had.</p></speech>

There is an onus on the Government and the Department to conduct a review of that scheme and identify the issues in order that we can introduce proper legislation based on policy.</p> <p>  I fully support amending this area.  Could we amend the existing legislation, such as the 1995 Act, to broaden the scope?  Is that appropriate?  If we bring in a new Act, it would unfortunately be confined.

To put it in concrete terms, while I have no issue with including all sexual offences in Deputy O'Callaghan's legislation, if section 26(3)(<i>a</i>) of the 1995 Act was left unamended, there would be a contradiction there.  If one is amending the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act, perhaps one should also consider making an amendment to the Civil Legal Aid Act.

It would enhance the level of provision.</p><p> In the absence of the O'Malley review, it is regrettable the Department has missed another deadline in such an important area, particularly with regard to the politics of this.  The D&aacute;il is inching towards its end, as we all know, and I fear this legislation, now that it is in pre-legislative scrutiny, will, unfortunately, lapse with the D&aacute;il and have to be re-examined by a future D&aacute;il.  There would have been an opportunity if the O'Malley review had been accelerated, prioritised and published so that at least we could have a fusion of what it recommends, what is here and what the witnesses are stating as experts.  Officials from the Department came before us last week.  The committee should urgently write to the Department about missed opportunities with timelines.</p></speech>

The Department stated it does not fit with Government policy and that it will not propose changes in advance of the O'Malley review.  It is good to have this conversation and we can focus on future rights, provision and support.  This is my suggestion.

While it is welcome, it has limitations with regard to who can access the advice and when it will be made available.  I am not sure about the mechanics of how it would work, particularly prior to charges being brought.  It would be interesting and worthwhile to work it out and go through it.  An individual having to make even a small contribution could be a barrier because what might be a small contribution to us would be a large contribution to those who need the advice.  On the civil law side, victims of domestic violence must make a once-off payment of &euro;130 to access legal aid.  That would be prohibitive.</p></speech>

Will the witnesses elaborate on how this could work?  Who would be the best person to give advice prior to charges being brought?  How would it be accessed?  At what stage would it be accessed?  I imagine it would probably have to be a rape crisis centre.  Charges might never be brought.  How would that work?  Have the witnesses thought about it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.744" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Robert Purcell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019111300002#J01000"><p>There are a number of ways it could work.  There are approximately 400 solicitors who are experienced in criminal justice work throughout the country.  We have a certified list of solicitors who attend Garda stations.  They have front-line experience in these types of cases.  I also believe that some advanced specialist training may be necessary for people to be approved to give this advice.  If the NGOs were the first port of call and this list was available to them, they could refer to us individuals who require more specialist advice.  Most of the 400 solicitors to whom I referred also operate a 24-7, 365 day service so it is not limited.</p> <p>  The certification would have to involve a State agency, perhaps the Legal Aid Board, with an appropriate form and certification of means or something similar which could be verified before a particular claim is processed on behalf of an individual.  Would Ms Counihan say these generally involve emergencies?</p></speech>

Quite often when victims of historical sexual violence think they might report, there is no particular urgency because it happened so long ago but, at the other extreme, there are situations where people have been the victims of a recent and traumatic rape and they are absolutely at sea and do not know what to do but they must make decisions fast.</p></speech>

The act of reporting itself is significant.  Would a person be asked to report twice?  Doing it once is very difficult.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.748" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Counihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019111300002#J01400"><p>I do not think so.  The way people usually come to me is they approach a rape crisis centre because all of a sudden it has come to the surface in their lives.  I am thinking in particular of people who have been victims of historic child sexual violence or, at the other extreme, where there is a very acute need.  Generally, they do not find it very difficult to tell people in rape crisis centres who have specialist training in dealing with trauma.  By and large survivors do not find it an ordeal to talk to people at rape crisis centres.  The people who work in all our centres throughout the country and other rape crisis centres are good at working out what is a legal query they cannot answer or should not try to answer.  At that point they get in touch with me and I respond to the client.  Perhaps we might have a meeting, they might ring me or I might ring them.  We might email each other, whatever suits, and that is how it happens.</p> <p>  I hope and pray it is not a traumatic encounter for them.  The aim of what I say is to explain the system to them to address their particular concerns where I can, and to reassure them if they decide to report that somebody from a rape crisis centre can go with them at the earlier informal stage when they report what has happened.  They can also go with them to the Garda station or, more commonly nowadays, to the rape crisis centre itself, for their formal statement to be taken.  It is the idea of working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at local level to provide, as far as possible, wraparound support that addresses all of the concerns of the client.  I am the legal element of this.  I hope it is not traumatic for them to talk to me.</p> <p>  I have had some very upsetting conversations.  Sometimes I have had to tell people things that I know are legal facts and they do not particularly want to hear that, unfortunately, this is how far they can go in this direction and there is no further avenue of appeal.</p><p>That can be very difficult.  To move on to the formal interview with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in which a person's statement is taken, there is more and more awareness of how to deal with traumatised witnesses among garda&iacute;.  As members will be aware, we now have a certain number of divisional protective services units.  These units cover approximately one third of the country and I understand they will shortly cover a bit more.  The officers in these units have received intensive extra training in how to deal with particularly sensitive cases, which may involve sexual or domestic violence.  In any event, reporting to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is less of an ordeal than it was but it is, of course, still difficult.  No matter how sympathetic the garda is, this is a formal stage of the proceedings and what one says will be recorded and included in one's statement, which will form the basis of the prosecution case.  If the case goes to court, one will be cross-examined on that statement.  It is still very heavy and very serious and people need legal support.  It is no harm to have a lawyer present, particularly to deal with issues of privacy and disclosure.  If a lawyer is present, he or she can address those.</p></speech>

It may also involve advising clients as to whether they have to sign a consent form for the release of medical information or whether they have to hand over their phone.  What about their privacy and family rights?  It is about talking them through the legal process, including what their rights are and how to vindicate them at the earliest possible stage, rather than talking them through the trauma, which is the role of a specialised counsellor.</p></speech>

Is that okay?  I just wish to give Deputy O'Callaghan notice of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.754" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019111300002#K00600"><p>First, I commend Deputy O'Callaghan on the work he is doing in this area.  Any expansion of the rights of people in these circumstances has to be welcome.  It is the way forward.  The many of us who have had experience of dealing with people who have gone through the traumatic experiences of either sexual or domestic violence will understand what a huge trauma it represents to those people and those near to them.  This legislation is a start.  It moves us in a direction that will allow people to have more courage, which is what they need.  Any support we can give that would enhance that courage is important.  From that point of view, I commend Deputy O'Callaghan on introducing this legislation and moving us in the right direction.</p> <p>  I was out of the room for a few minutes but I was listening to the meeting on the monitor.  I know that many questions were answered and dealt with in that time.  One issue I have come across on a couple of occasions relates particularly to young people and teenagers.  I refer to sexual encounters or experimentation crossing the boundaries that most of us would set and becoming assault.  That can often happen a number of times before a young woman understands what has happened to her.  These women find it very difficult to report such cases or to find the courage to do something because it was not a case of being attacked; it was consensual up to the point at which it crossed over into something which was no longer consensual.  In the context of what we are doing here, how will support be given to people in such circumstances?  I have young teenagers myself and I listen and hear.  We have a very good relationship in the house and can talk about these things and I know that this is an issue for many people.  They feel they cannot report stuff which they really should.  They will not do so.  Do the witnesses feel this legislation goes far enough in supporting people in those circumstances?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.755" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Counihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019111300002#K00700"><p>What I have observed is that, when such situations arise, the first port of call is very often a rape crisis centre and a number of sessions with a counsellor to tease things out.  That is where, at a certain point, the light bulb goes on and people realise that they did not just think something was abuse, but that it was and that they had not seen the reality for what it was.  Most of the time, what I hear is either a counsellor or the parent of a young person asking what the next steps are or asking about aspects of the legal process.  They will have their list of questions but I am never really involved in discerning whether something was abuse or consensual.  That is more the role of a counsellor or another wise mentor who has helped a person arrive at this realisation.  Sometimes it just comes out of a conversation with a parent, an older wiser friend or even a contemporary.  A person's friend may say that what happened to him or her was rape and that he or she should do something about it.  Thank God, he or she then does.  Our hope is that such people will then find their way to a rape crisis centre because these centres have the expertise to help and support them in teasing out what happened, in working out where the abuse began and in clarifying what happened to find the point where, as the Deputy said, it went from the consensual to something more sinister.</p> <p>  It is only later on, if at all, that the Garda is involved.  People sometimes do not want to have anything to do with a formal report to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It should be borne in mind that if a young person is involved, a report will have to be made to Tusla.  As the Deputy will know, Tusla shares information with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, so the Garda will be alerted anyway.  Quite often, the young person does not want to have anything more to do with it.  Sometimes they do, and it is at that point that I would get involved.  The person may seek legal advice or help.  Sometimes, all that it is needed is an informal chat with a local, experienced, sympathetic, and well-trained person, usually a garda.  This is the right person to talk to and can often answer many of the person's questions.  </p> <p>  The extra bit I can offer is the independent viewpoint.  I am not aligned with the prosecution; I am myself.  I am essentially independent of the whole criminal justice process.  I am there to support survivors.  If a survivor, of any age, tells me that he or she absolutely does not want to go through with this, I will not say he or she has to.  I am survivor-led.  I will tell this survivor that it is up to him or her as to whether he or she decides to make a report.  In fairness, members of the Garda are not heavy-handed when it comes to persuading people to report either but sometimes people can feel that even contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is pressure and that they will have to report and there will be no way out of it.  That is not actually the case.  It is my job to reassure people that agency lies with them.</p></speech>

I also thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for their contributions.</p><p>We have learned much from this morning.  As Ms Caroline Counihan indicated, the fact section 17 only applies during the course of an investigation excludes many complainants.  When one looks at it from the point of view of legal aid for the accused, it starts at the beginning for the accused when brought before court for the first time.  For the complainant, the beginning is earlier than that.  It is from the date of the offence.  We will all have to put our heads together to think how we can draft it in such a way to ensure those events preceding the investigation can be the trigger point for the complainant to receive this aid.</p><p> I thank everyone and the committee will produce a report.  Hopefully, we will get this enacted before the D&aacute;il finishes, contrary to what Deputy Jack Chambers said that we are inching towards the end.</p></speech>

The six towns that have been identified for the initial pilot are: Boyle, County Roscommon; Callan, County Kilkenny; Ballinrobe, County Mayo; Banagher, County Offaly; Castleblaney, County Monaghan; and Cappoquin, County Waterford.  Last week we heard the bottom-up view from small towns and villages about what cental and local government can do to help.  We had speakers from Free Market, Cappoquin Community Development, Castleblaney Regeneration Committee and Clarecastle Community Development.  Today, we will hear the top-down view from both cental and local government.  The committee believes that this is an important initiative and we look forward to hearing the views of witnesses.  We will also look at information supplied by Free Market about Scotland's town partnership and the town-centre first principle.</p><p>I welcome the following witnesses: Mr. William Parnell, assistant secretary, and Mr. J.P. Mulherin, principal officer, rural development and regional affairs division, Department of Rural and Community Development; Mr. Peter Hynes, vice chairperson, County and City Management Association, CCMA; Mr. Peter Hynes, chief executive, Mayo County Council, who is wearing two hats today, and Ms Catherine McConnell, director of services with responsibility for planning, communications, human resources, information systems and corporate; Ms Mary Mulholland, director of services with responsibility for housing, community, library, arts, heritage and fire service, Kilkenny County Council; Mr. Paul Clifford, director of economic and community development, Monaghan County Council; Mr. Tom Shanahan, director of services with responsibility for planning, economic development, tourism, housing and Tullamore municipal district, Offaly County Council; Mr. Pat Murtagh, senior executive officer, community and enterprise, and Ms Nollaig Whyte, acting senior executive officer, regeneration team, Roscommon County Council; and Mr. Rupert Maddock, city and county architect, and Mr. Morris Conway, project architect, Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council.</p><p>It is proposed that any opening statements, submissions or other documents supplied by witnesses or other bodies to the committee relating to the topic of this meeting will be published on the committee's website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I invite Mr. Parnell to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The committee has taken a keen interest in this pilot since the outset and it has invited representatives from the local authorities participating in the pilot to the meeting to give a first-hand account of their engagement in the process.  I propose to give a short background to the initiative and then to hand over to the local authority representatives.</p> <p>  The town centre living pilot was announced by the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, in October 2018 to develop innovative proposals to encourage more people to live in rural town centres.  The pilot complements the town and village renewal scheme and the rural regeneration and development fund, both of which are administered by the Department of Rural and Community Development.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned the six towns that were identified initially to test the pilot approach.  The towns in question are Boyle, County Roscommon; Callan, County Kilkenny; Ballinrobe, County Mayo; Banagher, County Offaly; Castleblayney, County Monaghan; and Cappoquin, County Waterford.  These towns are of different sizes and in different locations.  We hope that the learnings from their involvement in the pilot will provide an indication as to what might work well for similar types of towns on a wider scale.  The issue of residential occupancy in many rural towns is not necessarily a need for new houses, but, rather, it is a question of how to the make best use of properties that are available and to encourage people to live in them even if they have to be renovated.</p><p> The reasons properties are not being used in town centres for residential purposes are complex.  I am sure the committee will hear more about this from the local authority representatives today.  Apart from issues that can arise relating to the property itself, other factors such as the availability of services, recreational facilities, civic space and a good retail mix all need to be part of the offering to encourage people to want to live in town centres.  It is also important to recognise that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to rejuvenating small towns and villages.  Each settlement is different, each with its own strengths, as well as issues that need to be addressed.</p><p> The pilot scheme was designed to allow the participating local authorities to examine the issues in their own particular towns and to develop blueprints to attract more people to live in the town centres.  The Department is making technical assistance of up to &euro;100,000 available to each local authority to support its work and to develop proposals to encourage town centre living.  The committee will hear how the local authorities have been using this money to identify the issues and solutions that influence the number of people living in their town centres.  It is envisaged that the lessons learned through this pilot will help to inform the approach to supporting and investing in towns and villages in the future.</p><p> The rural regeneration and development fund provides an opportunity to take forward the blueprints that emerge from this pilot by providing funding for strategic proposals that can rejuvenate towns and increase town centre living.  It is encouraging that some of the towns involved in the pilot have applied for funding from the rural regeneration and development fund, while others have received funding through the town and village renewal scheme.  I will leave my comments there for the moment to allow the representatives of local authorities to make their presentations.  Of course, I will be happy to answer any questions the committee may have later on.</p></speech>

I am chief executive of Mayo County Council.  The Mayo story will come through not because we think it is the best or only way to do things, but because it is the one we are most familiar with.  I will also attempt to make some remarks on behalf of the sector at large.</p> <p>  The problems of dereliction go back a long way.  I do not know if anybody here remembers Galway in the 1980s.  I am from Galway originally and my thesis was on the rejuvenation of Galway city centre in 1981.  In 1981 the core of Galway - one third if not more - was completely derelict with surface car parks etc.  Based on what it has become in 35 or 40 years, it is clearly possible to transform with the right effort and approach.</p> <p>  As every local authority chief executive and member will say, where one comes from and the local authority one works for or represents is the centre of the universe.  Therefore, for the next five minutes or so, Mayo will be the centre of the universe.</p></speech>

I wonder if that could be described as harassment by the Chair.</p> <p>  We would suggest that the role of local government is about two things: making better places and making better communities.  At the end of the day if we are not making better places and making better communities, we are not doing our job.  How we do it is a question of detail and debate but that is the core job.  Since 2014 we have been challenged by the Department in the main and central government to be a lead development agency.  That is about enterprise, investment and jobs.  We are also a delivery agency.  A report to be published reasonably soon indicates that local authorities pick up funding from more than 30 agencies and Departments, which brings its own challenges in what we do and how we do it.  We are definitely a delivery agency and see ourselves as such.</p> <p>  Regarding vision, when we talk about Mayo - those from other counties will have the same kinds of words - we talk about a county that is sustainable, inclusive, prosperous and proud.  That is our goal, and towns and villages are a big part of that.  Looking at the challenges that towns and villages pose, the first problem we have is the number of them.  There are 460 settlements of more than 500 people spread across the island based on the 2016 census.  They were developed for particular purposes.  Some are market towns, some are crossing towns and some are creamery towns.  By and large in most instances the purpose has moved on.  As I keep saying to our own people, Mayo has approximately 30 settlements of that size - above 250.  If we did not have them, we would not be building them.  Therefore, the status is in question.  Most of them are suffering decline and are under pressure.  For some it is an existential threat; it is that serious.</p> <p>  This initiative on vacancy is welcome because if we do not crack the issue of people living in towns than we are at nothing.  The challenges relate to commercial activity.  Commercial activity has moved to edge of town; it has moved to big box; it has moved to regional centres; it has moved to forecourts; and it has moved online.  I do not know how much of it will come back.  That change has led to environmental degradation and all the problems of anti-social behaviour that go with underpopulated streets that have no casual supervision.  Many of our smaller towns and villages are stuck in such a continual downward spiral.</p> <p>  Regarding responses from the sector, there is considerable knowledge, information and experience in this area.  The key response is about community engagement and empowerment.  The second relates to having a vision-led and achievable plan for what can be done.  The third relates to investment.  There must be some balancing of the advantages of investing in small towns and villages.  For residential purposes and every other purpose there must be incentives.  There must be collaborative implementation with local authority leadership.  We strongly contend that the local authority is the appropriate body to be challenged to provide that leadership and to provide the services to accompany it.</p> <p>  In our case, we use a form of community engagement and planning, called "community futures."  It is a Scottish model that we have been using for more than a decade.  Thirty communities have been through the process and we find it very good.  Other local authorities use other community planning and engagement techniques.  We follow that up with village design statements.  They set out, albeit not in a formal planning context, what we are trying to achieve in physical terms in the towns and villages.  That is delivered, in our case, by a municipal district, MD, team.  We watched last week's committee meeting and the suggestion from Free Market that there should be a town architect in every town.  There are many towns and I do not believe the resources are available to do that.</p></speech>

The suggestion from this side would be that we could certainly move to having one in every municipal district and that would be part of a MD team, which is what we have set up, so that the coalface is populated by a team including architect, engineer and planner working together.</p> <p>  There is dereliction everywhere.  We can fix some of it with housing.  Every local authority has done that and it is very beneficial.  We cannot turn all our towns and villages into housing schemes and there needs to be a balance.</p> <p>  I will go through the exemplar of Westport, which is the one I know best.  I am not saying it is the only one, but it is one that is reasonably well known as a town that has been turned around in 20 years.  It had a very good location and an enviable layout.  In the 1980s and early 1990s, however, one could have bought a big chunk of Westport for very little money.</p><p>One third of Bridge Street was derelict.  The town had its problems.  The turnaround was the preparation of a master plan in the early 1990s which engaged all the community and commercial groups in the town.  There were more than 90 such groups so it took a long time to put the master plan together.  It was not just a planning exercise but looked at urban design, what would fit in the back lands and gave guidance, not binding but illustrative, on that.  Then there was the seaside resort scheme.  It invested &euro;200 million, of which &euro;150 million was in the private sector and &euro;50 million in the public sector, including &euro;40 million on a sewerage scheme.  That kind of money makes an impact and is necessary in some instances.  Policies were developed on issues such as signage, quality materials in the public realm and public art.</p><p> When we summarise the project we show three illustrations.  One is Westport in the "good old days" of the 1890s which were not necessarily as good as one might think unless one is looking through rose-tinted glasses.  The picture shows a monument to a man named Glendenning, who was the landlord's agent and a deeply unpopular person.  The second image is a photograph of Westport as I remember it in the 1970s and early 1980s.  Glendenning had been shot off the column, having been used for target practice during the War of Independence - I will not say by whom - and the column was empty.  The whole of the Octagon, the central public space, served as a carpark.  As a result of the master plan, community engagement, the collaborative approach and investment, we see in this photograph a different Westport today.  The image shows the Octagon which includes a sculpture erected as part of the prize for winning the best place to live in Ireland competition in 2012.</p><p> We recommend that responsibility be examined as an issue.  Responsibility for towns and villages is spread over at least four lead Departments as well as other agencies.  That needs to be rationalised.  The methodology is reasonably well known and there is no need to reinvent the wheel.  There is definitely a need for residential incentives which is something that will emerge from the discussion later this morning.  We support the suggestion of a centre of excellence.  It should be located in a Department or another public body.  There is a need for communication.  We must change the narrative around small towns and villages.  The more we spread the story that they are dying on their feet, the more that will happen.  A little of the reality is about perception, and that needs to be addressed. </p><p>  I will pass over to Ms Catherine McConnell who represents the residential scheme in Mayo.   </p></speech>

Mayo County Council has identified it as a key town.  It is strategically located to the south of the county between Castlebar and Galway.  It is a long established market town in this part of south Mayo.  Ballinrobe has consistently functioned well as a market town and has a strong urban block of about 6 ha which is bounded and defined by a strong streetscape.  Consistent building frontages and relatively narrow street proportions emphasise the unique urban geometry.  It is rich in natural built and cultural heritage assets.  This has been enhanced by the town's success in attracting funding through various Departments under town and village renewal schemes, healthy town initiatives, the rural regeneration and development fund schemes and LEADER.  Historic structures and projects include the Market House, the bower&rsquo;s riverside walk and the library grounds, which have been enhanced.</p> <p>  When we engaged with the pilot project, our objective was to address the extent of dereliction and vacancy in the town centre because it has a major impact and affects perceptions and local confidence.  Lack of investment has resulted in the built heritage losing some of its intrinsic value and attractiveness.  Several areas are particularly affected and these are the ones we have focused on in the pilot.</p> <p>  The project looked at an adaptive reuse study of four different building typologies, three in private ownership and one recently purchased by Mayo County Council.  Proposals for reuse, including commercial uses on ground floors and residential uses on upper floors, were developed.  We examined how our approach to planning applications can affect these types of buildings.  We also examined how the obligations to comply with building and energy efficiency regulations and to obtain fire safety certificates and disability access certificates combine to impact on how a developer might approach the reuse of these buildings.  Preliminary structural surveys were carried out.   Comparative estimates were prepared for the reuse of three existing buildings compared with the cost of providing similar accommodation on greenfield sites.  The proposed use of the existing buildings extended across retail, office and residential accommodation.</p> <p>  The report has been circulated among members.  It found that in general the cost of refurbishing these buildings is higher and there are many more barriers to a developer engaging with the redevelopment of these buildings.  "Cost in use" is a term that we have used.  It means that if one were to build to current standards, no developer could economically achieve the refurbishment of the existing building and compete with the market.  This has had a major influence on whether people will refurbish or choose to move to new greenfield sites and build new developments.</p> <p>  Using the four buildings as case studies, we have held a workshop with businesses, residents, town centre property owners and previous town centre owners and-or residents and will continue to engage with them.  We looked at previous town centre residents who chose to move out and have engaged with people who recently moved in to establish what was behind the decision to move out our move back.  The workshop will aim to raise awareness of the extent and type of vacancy in the town.  It will consider the challenges of adapting vacant buildings for reuse for modern 21st century family accommodation or business, the options for the reuse of these buildings, and the proposed means of supports or resources that would make adaptation more achievable.  A second workshop will be held with our staff in the local authority to consider these means of supports or the resources Mayo County Council has at its disposal or are available through access to national funding schemes that could make adaptation more achievable.</p> <p>  We have appointed a consultant who will do a much more detailed analysis, explore the issues surrounding residential use and vacancy &ndash; the economic, social, environmental and cultural factors &ndash; and help us shape policies locally in our development plans and approaches to town centre redevelopment, which might inform national policy, both fiscal and otherwise, to encourage town centre reuse, both residential and commercial, and identify opportunities to guide and prompt public and private investment.</p> <p>  I will outline some of our preliminary findings.  While a wide variety of funding options is in place, all of them require significant skill and time, which can be confusing for potential applicants who are not professionals in the area.  A variety of complex reasons have led to levels of vacancy and dereliction, including land value, ownership patterns and the health of the local economy.  Ballinrobe is typical of many other Irish towns in terms of architecture and development.  Therefore, the solutions we may propose as a result of this study will be equally applicable to other towns.</p> <p>  A key issue facing Ballinrobe and other towns is that patterns of dwelling in recent years have tended to favour newly constructed dwellings in suburban multi-unit developments, or in one-off houses in hinterlands.  The three main reasons for this are statutory risk, cost, and changing patterns of how people live and work.  Increasing traffic through towns of the scale and size of Ballinrobe is a key issue.  While the issue is being proactively tackled by Mayo County Council, it remains a challenge.  Of the five towns surveyed by the consultants in Mayo, Ballinrobe was found to have the highest overall proportion of derelict structures and among the highest proportion of vacant units.  However, it should be noted that this finding does not distinguish between commercial and residential properties.  We used the opportunity provided by the pilot study to ask the consultants to develop a fully electronic geographic information system, GIS, database for each property which we have identified as vacant or derelict.</p><p>The properties will be geolocated and contain a full record of vacancy-dereliction status along with survey photographs and comments.  This will allow us to track the progress of buildings that we hope will be redeveloped through access to additional funding and changes to the regime under which towns must develop themselves.  The initial consultations with the owners of such buildings have indicated that the barriers are preliminary costs, those being, of renovation and repair.  They also raised the issue of anti-social behaviour that is associated with higher levels of vacancy and non-residential populations in town centres.</p><p> We were heartened by the willingness of the building owners to engage in bringing buildings back into appropriate use and back to life if appropriate supports are in place.  These would be a mixture of fiscal and other partnership approaches with the local authority.  We will continue to engage with the town team and the properties' owners to see where this project will end up.</p></speech>

We have put a great deal of time and effort into this pilot and learned much, so it is great to be able to show it off on this end.</p> <p>  Kilkenny's town in the pilot scheme is Callan, which is one of five district towns in the county and located just 16 km south west of the city.  The areas of scale in Kilkenny are Kilkenny city and smaller towns, all of the same population of approximately 2,000 to 2,500 people.  The population in Callan is increasing.  Similar to Ms McConnell's example from Mayo, it has been a market town for many years.  Its centre was designed with narrow streets for horse-drawn carriages, though, and is not fit for today's needs.  It has immense character and cultural significance, not just for Kilkenny but also for the south east.  Working with the community in Callan under the framework for town centre renewal, Kilkenny County Council held a stakeholder engagement session and carried out a health check on the town.  From that, we established a town team and a town plan, and the area of Bridge Street that the committee can see was identified as needing care, attention and change in particular.  The pilot project came from that process.  We wanted to get into the detail of the Bridge Street area and see what it would take to make it more attractive for investment, residential development and other forms of development.</p> <p>  The objectives that we set the pilot project were to identify the opportunities on Bridge Street, identify the owners and assess the individual properties to see where we could get engagement to bring forward worked examples of reuse, including adaptive reuse.</p><p>We wanted to improve the image of the street and people's feelings about the street.  To that end, a number of community arts projects have been located in Bridge Street, including a performance by the Abbey Theatre on the street during this year's Kilkenny Arts Festival.  People are re-engaging with the space.  We wanted to identify barriers to reuse and to develop proposals for specific properties to a high standard with detailed, worked-through design proposals for mixed typologies of buildings, including an energy-efficiency solution.  Energy was a big part of our pilot project.  We wanted bring high-quality energy solutions to old conservation buildings.  Our last objective was to identify financial supports that could bring those worked examples forward.  The engagement and assessment was very intensive.  Many of the buildings were found to be in particularly poor condition and to be deteriorating quickly.  Some of them had not been structurally assessed, or assessed from an engineering point of view, for quite some time.<br/><br/>The slide that is being shown to the committee shows the Bridge Street area in the context of Callan as a whole.  The bridge over the river is the centre of the town.  Bridge Street is the area just below the bridge on the slide.  Kilkenny County Council has secured funding under the town and village renewal scheme for some works to be done to improve the river.  Under the rural regeneration and development fund, funding has been secured for the development of the Callan Motte field, which can be seen to the top of the slide currently on screen, as an amenity area.  Both of those initiatives are seen as support measures for the attractiveness of Bridge Street.  As members can see, Bridge Street is very compact.  It will always be a challenge to provide open space for families and others who live there.  We have addressed that with supporting measures under the funding structures I have mentioned.<br/><br/>A great deal of information on the individual properties and on the overall context of the street within the town has been considered as part of the pilot.  We have assessed issues like traffic, access, sporting infrastructure, amenities and the public realm.  It is a twofold pilot.  It involves a detailed assessment of the actual street and the buildings within it, as well as completion and design proposals for three properties.  It also involves an assessment of the broader context of how the street interacts within the town.  An understanding of the barriers that exist has come out of all of those assessments.  Why are these buildings not being reused?  I will give a brief summary of the barriers we have identified.  The first barrier is the age and general condition of the buildings.  Some of these buildings are not suitable for adaptation.  Some of them need to have pieces of them removed.  The second barrier is the challenging space standards and general regulatory requirements.  It is very difficult to meet modern building standards, fire regulations and private rented standards, while providing for high energy efficiency and good conservation practice, without compromising the integrity of the buildings or of the street.  This challenge cannot be underestimated.<br/><br/>Another constraint is the size and shape of plots, many of which are in private ownership.  There are parking and traffic issues at this location because of the narrowness of the street.  This is not exclusive to Callan.  There are many county towns and villages with very narrow streets that are a barrier to redevelopment.  Another real issue is that many older residents are <i>in situ</i>, or own these properties and are in nursing homes or are living elsewhere.  It can be difficult to get them to engage with this process and to buy in to our plans to change things dramatically.  Many families who own properties in this area live elsewhere and find it difficult to engage with the prospect of redeveloping difficult buildings through a complex process at a high cost without any certainty of return on their investment.  The high cost of these interventions is a major issue.  As Ms McConnell said when she spoke about her town in County Mayo, the unit cost for the redevelopment or adaptive reuse of the properties we have looked at in particular detail is extremely high.  The cost is more than the social housing cost ceilings from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The interventions needed on the public side to turn these properties into public housing units would not be viable in this pilot.  The cost established to achieve the desirable energy, conservation and design standards exceed the return that can potentially be achieved from rent or sale in the private market.  We have found that the worked-through costs, which are there to be examined, cannot deliver a social or private outcome without an addition to the investment that is available.<br/><br/>We have learned an awful lot from our engagement with stakeholders and communities as part of this intensive pilot project.  I will summarise those lessons.  We have learned that engaging in singular interventions and piecemeal project development while meeting specific funding deadlines under a plethora of funding opportunities, all of which are welcome, will not deliver the strategic outcomes we want.  A strategic long-term plan is required for town centre redevelopment.  Plans must come from communities.  Community and stakeholder engagement is paramount.  The communities in towns are best placed to identify needs, barriers and opportunities and to put them in the order in which people want to see them delivered.  We have seen in Callan that the town team approach works, but implementation must support such an approach.  Public and private solutions are required.  Local authorities cannot, and in my view should not, engage in the compulsory purchase of vast areas of streets in towns and villages for public housing solutions or other types of projects, such as museum projects, that are unsustainable.  A mix of tenure is required in the interests of social sustainability.  Conditions must attract private investment.  There is a need for private and public solutions.  In the absence of interventions, these types of areas will not meet population and social needs into the future.  There is a social cost which is more difficult to quantify.  These areas will become much bigger problems for local authorities and for the State if they become more dangerous or fall into a worse state of disrepair.  Likewise, we cannot keep building new roads, sewers and footpaths to extend our villages and towns out into the countryside.  Policy and funding alignment is essential if outcomes are to be supported by the market or, where they are not supported by the market, if an intervention that will make them deliver is to be designed.<br/><br/>Our towns and villages, in Kilkenny and in every other county in the country, have a significant value.  They are our heritage.  They are great places to live, work and do business.  Callan, in particular, has a sizeable arts community.  It is thriving.  Many arts groups use vacant buildings from time to time, but they do not have the means to carry out capital works.  Arts programmes support programmes rather than capital investment.  Collectively, we have an opportunity to secure the vibrancy of towns like Callan.  We are hearing about other such towns today.  Current policy and market conditions cannot deliver what is needed and what each of these pilots is identifying as required.  Inaction will have a greater financial and social cost into the future.  We can use the information gathered from these pilots to inform policy in a coherent way while delivering real solutions.  As Mr. Hynes has said, local authorities are best placed to lead that.  We need a point of contact - an architect or a team - on the ground at municipal district level and at county level to tie all the different variables together in a way that communities can understand.</p></speech>

My colleagues from the regeneration committee in Castleblayney were here last week.  I would like to put our efforts in context.  There are five towns and over 20 small villages in County Monaghan, which has a population of 61,000.  The population of the county is split 70-30 between rural and urban areas.  It is a heavily rural-based county.  We liaise with four town teams and one chamber of commerce.  We have a programme for the development of 40 community plans in each of the settlement areas over the next five years.</p> <p>  Castleblayney, which has a population of 3,600, is a former rural market town but it is becoming a commuter town.  Although there has been a slight fall in the population of the town in recent times, it has generally been stable.  People commute from Castleblayney to work along the M1 corridor.  The town has good schools, residential facilities and recreational facilities and offers a good lifestyle.  As a Border town, it has suffered from being so close to the Border.  There was a certain amount of vacancy after the recession.  The commercial vacancy rate in the town centre is 22.5%.  There are former shops, offices and workshops that are vacant along Main Street and one or two streets off that street.</p><p>Following the abolition of the town council in 2014, we established town teams in each of the towns.  Castleblayney Regeneration Committee is the town team for Castleblayney.  The community engagement is high but the business participation in it is relatively low.  There is a lack of business confidence there for all the factors set out by Mr. Hynes earlier.  We had a particular challenge in Castleblayney as there are five derelict public buildings owned by Monaghan County Council.  They include former courthouses and the Hope Castle estate.  This is our challenge.  We are resolving it through the rural regeneration and development fund.  We have already tackled two of the buildings and are working on the other three.  Over time, we can resolve those with resources but we are talking about resources of the order of &euro;15 million to &euro;20 million.  </p><p> The challenge that the pilot town centre living initiative is attempting to address is the other side of the coin, namely, private residential development in the town.  Like the other towns described here, there is an abundance of vacant, derelict and poor quality housing - narrow terraced housing that is difficult to develop.  Some of it is over former shops.  We concentrated on a tight and compact area in Castleblayney.  The report is due at Christmas.  We approached it by approaching each individual property and looked at site aggregation, which is a problem in towns and developing towns and is an excuse for people and State agencies to move out of town.  I was conscious of last week's presentation where the "town first" policy was being advocated.  That is something with which we would concur but it is quite difficult to bring the other State agencies in on that.  We have identified owners and the status of each property within the area.  We carry out a land use survey and are looking at the barriers to redeveloping that area.  The report is expected next month.  We reckon that one of the key requirements is that we would have a dedicated person to work with the owners on the ground.  That is not necessarily an architect but somebody who would be familiar with the whole regime of building control, design, urban renewal and the economics of the town.  That was successful in the mid-2000s with the tax renewal scheme.  We engaged a person to deliver the tax renewal scheme in certain towns and it was pretty successful.  That is becoming one of the other key recommendations from the report that is due next month.  The good news is that we have another four towns in the county to deal with.  </p></speech>

Banagher is a historic town located on the banks of the River Shannon in west Offaly with a population of 1,760 based on the 2016 census.  Two cruiser hire companies operate from the marina, which is located on the edge of the town centre, so many people begin and end their cruise of the Shannon in Banagher.  One of the objectives of the community involves trying to get these people to spend some time in Banagher.  A primary school and secondary school together with the amenity of the Shannon and other services, including an open library, are located in or adjacent to the town centre making it potentially a very good town to live in with all services within easy access.  However, significant residential and commercial vacancies exist within the town centre.</p> <p>  The primary focus of this project was to investigate the reason for residential vacancy in particular and how it could be reversed.  The study focused on the town centre.  Among other things, we engaged in extensive consultation with the community and individual property owners.  We began with a survey to determine how much of the property in the town centre was vacant.  While there are 156 properties in the study area, we determined that more than 22 of these properties were vacant.  The community was very enthusiastic about the project and helped to find the owners.  The community helped to develop its town plan identifying the public realm and items that need addressing in the town.  Of the 22 properties that were vacant, we engaged with the owners of 16 of these properties to find out the reasons for the vacancy and what might motivate the owners to bring the properties back into use.  The reasons were predominantly financial and to a large extent, that revolved around technical issues as well.  On average, these properties were vacant for about eight years.  This varied from quite a long-term vacancy to a relatively recent one.  Many owners found the cost of refurbishment and modernisation, which has already been mentioned, to be prohibitive notwithstanding that the reason they became vacant in the first place may not have been financial.  This is complicated by the fact that the value of the properties are very low.  When one looked at the cost of buying such a property in the town centre with the cost of refurbishment and modernisation, one could see that it was much more expensive than buying a comparable property outside the town.  Of all the people we spoke to, none was prepared to take up the repair and leasing scheme for public housing as they felt it would not be viable for them or their properties.  </p> <p>  Essentially, all the property owners required an incentive to consider spending money on the properties and bringing them back into use.  Among the things we did was to engage one property owner to look at options for refurbishing a vacant unit; these are now in a detailed design process, which is visible on screen.  The unit was a shop with living accommodation and access to a large rear garden through an arch.  The design, which was done by our own in-house architect, demonstrated how a modern spacious family home could be created from a streetside property.  That said, the owner still considers it too expensive to move on with the project at this stage.  Nonetheless it showed that the particular reason for this was to demonstrate that a modern spacious property could be created from these vacant units.  Another vacant unit in the town centre was a multi-unit commercial premises that is for sale.  We are negotiating the purchase of that premises and hope to progress that project, which will convert it into a remote working unit with office space and possibly community facilities.  It could also allow us to extend our own library, which is adjacent, into it.  At an early stage in the project, we are fortuitous in that we worked with an approved housing body to bring a 14-unit vacant development into use that is now tenanted.  We work with the community to see if we can develop a model to investigate if another unit with ten accommodation units could be purchased to provide a community-operated tourist accommodation facility.  Again, this is to try to address the fact that many tourists come to Banagher for Shannon cruises but we do not necessarily get them to stay there.  </p> <p>  Essentially, the outcomes of this project have very much focused on what would motivate people to bring their vacant units into use again.  The big issues, as outlined here, are the cost and technical factors involved in bringing these units up to a standard that is fit for purpose for rental, sale or living in.  We feel that the financial incentives should be targeted at a designated town centre area to ensure the focus of these incentives is very much on bringing life back into the town centres.  We have further plans for the public realm to avail of the current funding streams.  We will continue the example used where we looked at the design of a vacant unit to bring it into use as a modern home.  We have a number of other units where we will engage with the owners in a similar exercise with possibly a less ambitious design to, again, demonstrate the options regarding how people can bring these properties back into use.  </p></speech>

Many members might associate it with Lough Key Forest Park, which is outside the town.  We are very lucky in the sense that it is renowned for outdoor adventure tourism and its historical assets.  Lough Key Forest Park gets approximately 270,000 visitors each year.  As one comes in towards Boyle Abbey, that number drops to around 20,000.  In the heart of our project, which is just at the end of the picture on the screen, members can see that approximately 11,000 people visit King House.</p> <p>  We are probably in a different position from most of the other towns in the sense that we had already done the framework plan for the town through Boyle 2040.</p><p>That looked at the urban core of the town, where there was a serious level of vacancy.  There was interaction with people in the town and the town team while reimagining the lands behind, as shown on the screen.  We have been very lucky in getting funding through a number of schemes of the Department of Rural and Community Development, including funding under the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF, to redevelop the old Royal Hotel site, which is a very obvious derelict site in the middle of town.  We also have funding to develop a cycle corridor with a link to Lough Key.</p><p> We were very grateful to be announced as part of this scheme and at the time we also applied for the historic towns initiative.  The first slide on the screen shows a very dull street and on the right side of the street there was a serious level of dereliction.  On the opposite side, there are a number of shops and it is quite a vibrant side of the street.  We used the historic towns initiative to work on the right side of the street and we can see a difference in the next picture, taken a number of months later after the historic towns funding kicked in.  That funding was &euro;140,000 and it was matched by both contributions from owners and Roscommon County Council.  It gave us a great opportunity, probably more than would have been available if we did not have this scheme.  We traced the owners and met them as a group.  We did a condition survey of the front-facing facade, looking at the roof, chimney and the street face of each building.  From there we identified what was achievable.  Unfortunately, &euro;140,000 for 19 properties could not cover the entirety of what was needed.  Of the property owners, 17 from the 19 engaged with us and we ended up with 11 continuing with the scheme.  They were asked for 30% of the funding available.</p><p> This has been a massive transformation and it is conservation-led architecture and regeneration.  We can see how some of the original features were brought back to doorways that had been previously painted over.  I got to know everybody on the street in the course of the project and there are only four residents on that side of the street.  The youngest couple are in their 60s with children in college.  All of the others live on their own.  There is no sense of succession, even for the one family left with a home on that street.  Many of the other premises are in probate.  In one case we had a house with seven siblings and they did not get involved with the scheme initially because they could not agree on what they were going to do.  It is difficult if the property is not left to one person.  Others who bought a property as an investment are in negative equity.  The costs of repairs are very high as this is an area of architectural significance.  There is much work to be done so it is not like going into an ordinary house.  We need to protect the existing structures and the street was set out at the same time King House was developed.  We found that one person had bought a house but was not living in the area.  His response was that he did not know where to start.</p><p> Ideally, we would like families to move here but some of the houses on the corner have no back gardens.  Others have significant back gardens but there is encroachment from other properties.  It is fortunate for anybody owning a house on the street to look over the Boyle river.  On the far side of that is the new Royal Hotel site currently being developed under the RRDF, so it will give them dual aspect.  We are working with a conservation architect to reimagine one of the houses where the person has the potential to invest.  As Mr. Clifford mentioned earlier, we agree it is not the role of the county council to buy a number of these properties.  We are developing a significant property at the Royal Hotel into an enterprise centre but it is not feasible to buy properties on the street.  We are lucky as a private person is willing to put in the investment.</p><p> We cannot overstate how important the historic towns intiative's small level of funding has been in our engagement.  It meant that people met us as we had something concrete.  It built confidence in the broader town.  We have had people from other towns in the county say they have looked at the work done on the Boyle's main street and it is influencing the work being done in Strokestown, for example.  It will carry through in the town and village projects we are working on elsewhere.</p><p> The barriers include a lack of capital.  Even 30% of what is a small sum of money was a challenge for some people.  Property succession was also a problem, as I mentioned.  Somebody mentioned earlier that properties are old, and that is also the case for us.  Equally, we do not have young people or families living on that street.  There are challenges arising with interior restructuring because of conservation aspects.  A much bigger issue is the lack of jobs in the area.  In order to get young people back in, we must get jobs of a certain level.  There is a high level of graduate transfer from secondary school to third level in County Roscommon but a very poor retention rate when it comes to graduates getting a first job.  It is the elephant in the room for many of these towns.</p><p> We need people to want to live in these locations so we must sell the potential of the time.  I am thankful that the Boyle 2040 framework and the investment we have been successful in drawing down so far has started to create a sort of hipster cool image for Boyle town centre.  People have started to buy on the streets adjacent to this site and two of the owners will put their properties for sale as a result of the work that has been done.  We need to realise the potential of the lands behind the area.  As we can see from the image on the screen, there is much potential for restaurants looking on to the river, especially when the far side of the river is developed into a very attractive public space.  We need a joined-up approach with a tailored grant scheme to cover essential repairs.  We were not able to repair the roofs under the historic towns initiative and these, along with the chimneys, are a major problem.  People cannot do this on their own.  Many of the people do not know each other so we must work with them even to facilitate the hiring of a cherry-picker once a year for essential maintenance.  As others have stated, we must also come up with an affordable design that is fit for purpose when it comes to modern living.</p></speech>

The town probably does not have the profile it may have had at one stage in the county and we would love to address that.  It is one of the larger settlements in west Waterford and it was once an important economic and social centre.  It serves a rich agricultural hinterland that required many services and on the main street there are signs of that.  There are buildings that were banks and hotels and there is still some retail spaces.  Many properties are now vacant.  It had quite a strong engineering and light industry sector, as well as food processing.  It was an important location for religious and educational institutions, and Mount Melleray and the Cistercian abbey are still there.  Along with that is Cappoquin House and gardens, an important estate house that has had a long association with Cappoquin.  This has resulted in a rich urban fabric, and to date over 70 buildings are listed on the national inventory of architectural heritage and 32 protected structures.  It is all set within a fantastic rural landscape containing the Blackwater river, which has a very unusual bend as it turns west at Cappoquin.</p><p>The town has been marked by population decline over the course of about 150 years.  The population in the mid-19th century was 2,000.  It is down to approximately 700 now.  Married with that, there has been an economic decline and the loss of local employment.  We had the closure of Cappoquin Chickens, which many people will know about, and the Cappoquin bacon factory also closed with the loss of 200 jobs.  However, the community has reacted by coming together and building a thriving community centre, the Cappoquin Community Development Company, which has many assets, including a childcare provider, a vocational education centre and a sports hall.  It is also an umbrella group for other community companies.  The town still has a primary school, which is active, whereas the two secondary schools have closed.  The exception in Cappoquin is that there is a lot of rental accommodation.  There is a desire to see more people living in the town, particularly families.</p><p> We found many causes of vacancy.  It is primarily caused by a loss of jobs, wealth and capital.  This has resulted in buildings not being maintained for a protracted period.  There has, therefore, been no improvement and this creates a vicious cycle in which it becomes more and more expensive to try to bring them back up to a habitable condition.  These buildings are unsuitable for modern living.  As mentioned earlier, the cost of refurbishment, that is, the soft costs of design, meeting building regulations, planning requirements, certification and so forth, added to the construction costs makes it uneconomic in terms of the final value of the building.  As such, there would be a negative return on investment.</p><p> We found there are many personal reasons for individual owners and properties not coming into the market.  The market in Cappoquin is not functioning.  There are very few properties coming to the market.  We discovered there is a vacancy rate of approximately 17% in Cappoquin.  It is much higher in the core of the town, at 40%, which compares with a county average of between 10% and 11%.</p><p> In terms of our approach to the project, we have included a number of phases.  In the start-up phase we collaborated with local stakeholders, including the community group I mentioned.  We have a philanthropic trust, Tomar Trust, which has committed to matching any public funding on a one to three basis.  We have the Waterford Leader Partnership.  As part of the start-up, we also assembled a design team to look intensively at some of the physical problems in the town.</p><p> We then engaged in a research and analysis stage.  A company, Prescience, was commissioned to produce a report on vacancy in the town.  The community company did an intensive survey of 500 properties in the town and we established a baseline of vacancy and dereliction.  We found that out of 505 properties, 108 are vacant or derelict.  Based on this, we looked at suitable sites for further investigation.  We established two or three sites but finally agreed, as outlined in red on the screen, on one particular block that had a very high vacancy rate, at 40%, and a great deal of dereliction.  It was in the heart of the town and we believed that aspects of it were challenging and would merit further investigation.  We then put a design team to work.  Our aspiration was always to try to develop principles that had broader application and a transferable model.  We did an inspection of the buildings and started to examine the constraints that would apply.</p><p> In terms of the next phase, once we had some designs we looked at delivery models.  We considered the idea of having a long-term horizon and a plan.  We have developed a pipeline of projects in Tramore that would have, say, a 20-year horizon.  In this case, in Cappoquin, we started to look at that, essentially looking at how it could connect with the natural hinterland.  We also looked at active recreation because we need to bring new activities and a new purpose to Cappoquin.</p><p> The next phase was to look at the built environment and the public realm, with the long-term aim of trying to bring people back into Cappoquin to live in the town.  We looked at some models of setting up a local regeneration entity that would simply focus on looking at regeneration projects.  That would have local knowledge and could then look for clients.  It would have knowledge of nitty-gritty areas such as title issues.</p><p> We looked at the concept of assembling properties.  That is a major issue because many properties would have serious constraints.  We would need to create proper and saleable properties to be assembled into something that is bigger.  We looked at the idea of a rolling scheme whereby, as properties could be done up, that could feed into a pipeline of new projects, and that could be adaptable.  We looked at efficient delivery models and value engineering to try to reduce costs on the supply side.  We approached the local credit union and an estate agent to try to evaluate what the market would be and find a price point for properties if we were to try to sell them.  As mentioned, we also needed to find the affordability gap between the price point the market would bear when a property was being sold and the cost of acquiring, designing, constructing and bringing the property up to standard.  We had to identify what might be needed to address the affordability gap, in other words, what type of incentive or support scheme would be needed, whether on the tax side or the supply side, for example, something similar to the affordable housing model.  In our phasing, we were very keen on doing a pilot to test the proposition.  The community group have been looking to acquire a site to try to test that out.</p><p> The slide on the screen shows the block we chose.  Members will see it is a very tight urban block.  What should be noted is that, over time, people have filled in the gap, the interstices, between the streets because the houses were inadequate in terms of their internal layout.</p><p> There is a slide missing but on the next slide members will see that there are typical constraints within those blocks, with the sites being very narrow and the layout unsuitable.  The standard of the property was very poor.  The aspect and the way it addressed the sun was poor and the gardens were in poor condition.  The overall area was too low for modern needs and for family living.</p><p> In terms of what our architects came up with to address that, we have amalgamated properties to make something that is more suitable.  Our estate agent told us that we need an area of 1,300, 1,400 or 1,500 sq. ft to attract families.  We also needed some sort of hook.  Our hook was that we provided a space attached to the property which has a flexible use.  It could be used as a workshop, summer rental or garage.  It is a space that could be used as a studio or for some kind of income generation.  Members can see from the section on the drawing that what we have now is a property that has space, light, flexible living and is highly insulated, warm and suitable for modern living, with a suitable open space.</p><p> The other point about this model is that we tried to deal with the different typologies in the block so that one or two designs could be applicable across the block.  That reduces the soft costs.  It also allows flexibility in delivery so that one, three or, in the most ambitious case, the entire block could be altered and brought up to a high standard.  That is the position.</p></speech>

The witnesses have given such eloquent presentations with some fantastic ideas.  I am hugely supportive of the town centre living initiative.  It is a great idea and one way of really getting a handle on the nub of the problem, which is the vacancy rates on our main streets and the lack of people living on them.  On the main street of my town of Bailieborough I think there may be three residents left.  It was once an old market town.  Three people live over their premises now, and the rest of the premises are lying vacant apart from perhaps business units on the ground floors of the buildings.  People are not living upstairs any more.</p> <p>  I have a few questions as much as observations.  Will the witnesses give us an idea as to how the six towns were selected?  I am really interested to know this because hundreds of towns could have been picked.  That would be very interesting to know.</p> <p>  My next question is general, and anyone who would like to answer it can do so.  Perhaps Mr. Hynes might have the insight into this.  Do the witnesses feel town teams are as effective as town councils?  I know that that was kind of the idea of the town teams and their introduction.  Are they as effective?  Are the local authorities able to deliver as much as they may have delivered with the town councils?  Do the witnesses think the town teams are a good replacement of the town councils?</p> <p>  Ms Mulholland talked a little about her observations of the disjointedness of all the various funding streams coming at the council.  Free Market and all the community groups we had before the committee last week made the same comment.  Free Market, which is a research-based group, said there are lots of funding opportunities, but local authorities are scrambling to try to meet the criteria and the deadlines and find suitable and appropriate projects.  Is there a better way?  Free Market's observation was that there should be a coherence and a better synergy between various Departments or various funding agencies or funding streams in order that people are not scrambling around.  Perhaps a more jointed approach could be taken in availing of the funding coming on stream and being able to make long-term plans.  The biggest problem for local authorities is firefighting almost to have the plan ready, to be able to draw down the funding and then to meet the deadline for it.  Is this prohibiting any long-term vision and strategic planning that local authorities may be trying to carry out for their towns?</p> <p>  Again, I think it was Ms Mulholland who talked about the arts community in her town and said it is a thriving aspect in the town.  As someone who has come from that background, I know the usefulness of vacant properties to community arts groups that may be looking for venues, including temporary ones.  Insurance is a massive problem for all sorts of industries, but how are community groups getting around that issue by using vacant buildings?  Is this becoming a problem?  Is it diminishing the ability of community groups to use vacant buildings?  All local authorities could learn from this and the extent to which the arts are intrinsic to town centres.</p> <p>  Mr. Hynes talked about Galway 30 years ago.  One third of it was vacant and derelict.  We see it today as one of the European Capitals of Culture for 2020.  The arts, particularly Galway International Arts Festival, have played a huge role in all that.  Is there something in that model that we can use to ensure we deliver for all the towns doing magnificent work in trying to bring people back to live in them?</p> <p>  It would be remiss of me not to refer to the terrific work Mr. Clifford does for Monaghan County Council.  He seems to know every aspect of what goes on within our local authorities and has been intrinsic in delivering for all our towns.  As he knows, I see this on the ground in Castleblayney, having a constituency office in the town itself.  I refer to Hope Castle, the Market House, the gate lodges - all these historically important buildings in our towns.  They have been lying vacant, and local authorities have not had the resources to be able to maintain them and their functions.  We must look at all these historical buildings, including courthouses and gate lodges.  Hope Castle was once a hotel.  It is another magnificent building in a town that could be a huge tourist attraction.  Mr. Clifford talked about the millions in funding it will take to have them as functioning buildings again.  We must ask, certainly in cases such as these, from where will the funding become available to allow us to carry out the strategic planning needed to see these buildings come alive again and be the attraction they could be to our main streets?  There is huge potential here, particularly in Castleblayney.  Mr. Clifford talked about businesses and their engagement, which perhaps has been difficult or, to use the word he used, "low".  Does he see a way of overcoming that challenge, particularly with this scheme, to try to bring people back into our towns to live in them?</p> <p>  Mr. Shanahan's visual aid was very impressive in terms of contemporary living.  Looking at the Dermot Bannons of the world today, I think that is where young people and perhaps the not-so-young are looking in that they want homes that are easy to maintain and that can be heated and convenient.  Mr. Shanahan provided something that all of us could look at: a visual aid and a plan that could be implemented in towns across the country.</p> <p>  I could say something about all the presentations but I will not.  I would like all the witnesses to comment on something Free Market said, which was that everyone is trying to do so much, and in many ways repetitively, because we are looking at towns individually and asking what the challenges are, what the populations are and where the opportunities are.  If we had one overall organisation or research team in place, we could perhaps replicate what has been done in various towns instead of trying to redo and rehash things.  We could look at models that work, that are strategic and that do what they set out to achieve, that is, bringing people back into our towns.  Is there an argument for having an organisation that has a national function such that if, for example, Monaghan County Council were to come out and ask for an example or model of something that has worked in a town the size of Ballybay, we could just do it rather than having to research it and to come up with a plan?</p> <p>  I am afraid I will have to leave because I am due to speak in the D&aacute;il on promised legislation.  I will try to get back.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.801" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1422" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019111300002#K00300"><p>I thank all the witnesses for attending and bringing with them their experience and evidence regarding the town centre living initiative and their wider experience as key stakeholders in trying to regenerate our towns in the various local authorities around the country.  I also thank the Department for its input in assisting people.</p> <p>  One recurring theme that came up from all the evidence was the cost and viability of the regeneration of town centres.  Identifying these barriers is the first step, but the biggest challenge we all face is how we actually address them to move beyond that.  We should work with the witnesses as key stakeholders, the voluntary committees, representatives of which attended last week and gave very substantial evidence to the committee, and this committee, which is trying to assist in providing recommendations on what is working and not working and how best we can move on regeneration of our towns and villages around the country.  I am conscious we are talking only about a pilot scheme today, but in the back of my mind I am considering all the towns around the country that need help and assistance.  I have some notes made.  If the committee can bear with me, I have some general questions and then some more specific ones.</p> <p>  The Department is represented today by two officials, Mr. Parnell and Mr. Mulherin.  I acknowledge the work of the Department and the Minister, Deputy Ring, in taking the lead on the regeneration of many of our towns and villages.  I am conscious it is a new Department and that it had to get up and running from a standing start only a short few years ago.  I acknowledge the substantial funds coming through the Department to assist towns and villages around the country.  Having said that, and this is partly the purpose of this meeting, we still need to identify how best those funds can be targeted to get the best outcomes for the various towns.</p><p>Whether it is rural regeneration, town renewal, town centre living initiatives, CL&Aacute;R areas or otherwise, substantial funds are coming through the Department, which I acknowledge.  Is it intended to extend the town centre living initiative beyond the pilot or is there more work to be done in it is reshaped, given the evidence we heard evidence from the voluntary committees last week, which I presume today's witnesses have read?  It is important information coming from the ground up.  There is also information from the local authorities today on how best we can retune that initiative and perhaps extend it for local authorities and towns throughout the country.</p><p> Local authorities have specific regeneration teams.  Where does the priority on regeneration lie within the local authority system?  I have specific questions on how that manifests itself.  For example, two quotes from the local authorities stood out.  The first was that councils are not responsible for buying properties, which I accept.  However, it depends on why properties are lying vacant and derelict, and there has to be a reason that is happening.  Who will take the lead with regard to moving on those properties?  Is it the council or is it somebody else?  The somebody else is the private investor and if it is not viable, private investors will not come in.</p><p> It is the responsibility of the local authority to buy the property.  Local authorities have good tools and mechanisms available to them, and I refer to three in particular.  The derelict sites legislation gives local authorities good functions and powers to address dereliction on main streets.  The vacant sites levy, which was introduced only a short few years ago, is another important tool that local authorities can use if properties are not being moved on.  Of course, the long-standing powers under CPO are another.  I understand local authorities can be cash strapped and that funding is an issue.  However, if there is strategic thinking and priority thinking, and if we  mean what we are saying about prioritising our town centres, then we need to put funds into them and that needs to be matched by State funds to move everything on, using the levers and the tools that are available.</p><p> I have a question for the CCMA and perhaps for the departmental officials.  Is there a measurement of the success among local authorities in how those tools are used to move on sites that are vacant or derelict in our town centres?  If there is a measurement, how does the performance of local authorities compare?  While understanding the barriers and costs, we do not want inactive local authorities.  I want to qualify this in that all of the voluntary committees that contributed last week spoke highly of the local authorities in respect of their action and support.  However, there are many reasons these properties are lying vacant, for example, economic reasons and the very reasons towns were formed in the first place, such as to be market towns and so on.  Society has changed and the economy has changed, and the need for jobs to keep people living in towns is important.  However, we need to measure what is working and what is not, and that is one way of doing this in respect of local authorities.</p><p> The statement that commercial activity has moved to the outer areas of towns was attributed to Mr. Hynes.  That did not happen by chance; development plans and planning policy allowed it to happen.  I will not blame local authority officials as the elected members of councils who adopted development plans have a significant responsibility in that regard.  However, if that has happened and it is negatively affecting our town centres, surely we need to learn from that and change that mindset.  This is going back to the strategy that was proposed last week in that we need to have improved priority thinking and strategic thinking for our town centres.  We need to point to where mistakes have been made and to good examples.  I gave one good example last week and, luckily, it is Dungarvan in my county of Waterford, where the planning authority insisted that a new supermarket be established in the heart of the town, which has rejuvenated the town centre as a result.  There are good and bad examples.  Are we going to move on and learn from our mistakes to bring vibrancy back to the centre of our towns?  I am practical enough to understand we cannot put supermarkets where we have streetscapes.  However, there are opportunities where brownfield sites present themselves in towns and that should be the priority.</p><p> The third issue of concern regarding local authorities, which I presume is down to financing and funding, is the location of social housing.  I have seen this in Waterford, where the easy option is taken, and the greenfield site at the edge of town is taken by the council as well as by private developers, because the more difficult option of addressing dereliction, ownership issues or CPO is not tackled.  It is easy to parcel up a greenfield site at the edge of town and make a submission to the Department for funding, and build the ten or 12 houses there, whereas it might take much more hard work to acquire the properties on a streetscape, regenerate them, and make the argument for additional funding to get those houses lived in again.  Mistakes have been made in that regard.  I believe there are opportunities for local authorities, the Department and elected representatives to address that anomaly.  There are bad examples of this around the country but there are opportunities to correct that.  What are the views of the councils on that issue?</p><p> I have listened carefully regarding the cost element, in particular that it is more costly to regenerate properties due to conservation, legal and ownership issues and the building standards of older properties.  On the other hand, there are savings to be made where existing services are available such as where sewerage, water, roads and lighting are in place and we have vacant properties sitting beside them.  We need to square that one off.  This is why we need to focus on these areas and see what we can do better to make regeneration happen.</p><p> With regard to Cappoquin, which I know well, it is a problem when one block of the main street has a vacancy rate of more than 40%.  There have been difficulties in the town in terms of employment and change of use, which is recognised.  I welcome the fact this pilot initiative has focused on residential areas and Mr. Maddock outlined what he hopes to happen.  He said a philanthropic organisation, Tomar Trust, is supporting the community in Cappoquin and it has stated publicly that, where it provides funding, if the Government matches that, it will provide more funding, although I stand to be corrected on that.</p><p> I have a question for the departmental officials in this regard.  Philanthropy contributions are noted specifically in the rural regeneration fund model and, where such funds exist, we are all agreed it would be very beneficial to match them with State funds because there would be a better outcome.  What is the Department's position on such contributions?  Perhaps they should be prioritised in order that additional funds could be accessed to make these projects happen.  That might sound like a loaded question but it is not; it is a genuine question.  Where private investment and philanthropy steps up to invest in community initiatives, the State should stand by to support them.  Cappoquin is a perfect example of that.  The town was supported under the town renewal programme, which is welcome, but it was not successful under the rural regeneration programme and I hope it will be in the future.</p><p> I have touched on many questions.  I compliment the local authority officials who are present and who are working on regeneration.  I know it is not easy.  There are many aspects to it, including legal, ownership, cost and viability aspects.  However, we need to come up with a model that works so we can convince officialdom and whatever Government is in place at the time that it is worth investing in our towns and villages in a co-ordinated way.  I support Deputy Smyth in that we should consider the establishment of a national centre of excellence for town renewal.  We do not want an architect or an engineer with specialties and expertise in every town.  However, we want it to be possible for local authorities to go to such a centre and get that expertise to assist them in regenerating towns.  I know every town is unique and has its own selling points and assets.</p><p>Something like that would certainly help local authorities where they are stretched for funds or resources.  It might be something at which the committee would look in making recommendations to the Departments.  I mention incentives.  I have heard about the cost and viability of regenerating old properties in towns, even of the architectural work involve, for example.  Even if the work of the assigned certifier in signing off on the regeneration of those properties was provided and funded by the State or local authorities, it might make it attractive for young couples to develop a property because it would take out a lot of the cost element.  We will have engage in that type of thinking and initiative because the private market will not do it.  I have heard today that the local authorities state it is not their responsibility to do it.  That means that it will never happen if something does not change.  I would like these angles to be addressed, if possible.</p></speech>

This morning's session has been really informative.  I also acknowledge the local public representatives from Roscommon who are in the Visitors Gallery and familiar with the initiative in Boyle and the challenges and opportunities that arise in the rejuvenation of the town centre.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions, some of which have been asked.  It is evident that all of the local authorities involved in the initiative have tried to be proactive, constructive and practical in trying to deal with the issues surrounding vacancies, dereliction and the regeneration of town centres.  As others mentioned, the cost of redeveloping houses in town centres is a major, fundamental and core issue.  The other point alongside it concerns employment.  Ms Whyte gave the good statistic that 65% of young people attended third level education.  However, the challenge in places such as Roscommon is to attract them back.  The cost of redevelopment for the purposes of providing housing and employment is for me the core issue.  It is important that there be a vision-led plan that is both realistic and practical, but I am getting the message from the presentations made that cost and employment are two of the issues involved.  Mr. Hynes mentioned the need for incentives to encourage investment.  I imagine they focus on the two key issues of incentivising employers to set up in rural areas and providing incentives to encourage the regeneration of residential properties.  I would like to hear more about that matter because they are the two core issues.</p> <p>  This is an informative discussion.  However, it is evident that there are a lot of common issues.  Have the six local authorities been working together on this initiative?  How has that process worked?  I ask the officials from the Department where we go from here.  Information and evidence gathering, working across communities and gathering and building a bank of evidence can only take us so far.  Where do we go from here to provide support in dealing with the core issues of employment and the redevelopment of residential properties?</p> <p>  I am most familiar with Boyle, County Roscommon.  No more than in the example of Westport given by Mr. Hynes, we need to try to build on the assets within local communities.  Lough Key is located on the edge of Boyle and a positive for the area.  The long awaited cycleway between Boyle and Lough Key will be important in trying to bring people from the outskirts to the town centre, King House and Boyle Abbey.  For a lot of communities, the core issue is building on their strengths and assets, but at the end of the day it all comes down to two fundamental points, on which I am interested in hearing the comments of the delegates.  We need to be practical and realistic in how we deliver the initiative, but significant investment will be required.  We must invest to encourage people to live in town centres, but it has to be linked with employment creation.</p> <p>  I am very involved in the team in Ballaghaderreen.  It is positive that there are town and village rural regeneration schemes coming into play.  Part of the initiative in Ballaghaderreen which has the same challenges emphasised by the delegates involves a painting scheme, but that can only do so much.  We want people to have confidence in their towns which we want to look well.  We want people to have pride in their areas, but we also want them to have the option of living in a town centre should they so wish and in so doing being able to access employment.  </p> <p>  They are my thoughts which I share with the delegates.  As I said, I am also involved at local level.  I thank them for their presentations which have been really helpful.  I hope that as a committee we can take them on board.</p></speech>

I will then go back to the officials before taking the next batch of questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.806" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1341" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019111300002#M00400"><p>I will get straight to the point.  I welcome my colleagues from Roscommon County Council.  Mr. Hynes talked about incentives.  Providing money is one incentive to encourage regeneration, be it for footpaths or to make a town look well, but private property is owned by someone.  Is Mr. Hynes talking about providing tax incentives to encourage people to live in certain areas?  That was the model used by Se&aacute;n Lemass many years ago in the case of Shannon Airport.  It was also the mode used in the case of Knock airport in Mr. Hynes' county.  Is he talking about the provision of similar incentives to encourage people to move back to the middle of towns?  </p> <p>  My second question is for all of the delegates.  I knew Ms McConnell in a previous life in Galway through her work in the planning process.  At the planning end, there might have been five pubs in a town, two of which are now closed.  Efforts might be made to turn them into something else without having to jump through all of the hoops in the planning process.  I know that legislation was passed to help in that regard.  Have its effects yet been felt, or are there still problems in implementing it to make the planning process easier?  </p> <p>  What we call change of use is living over the local shop, but I am talking about a situation where someone wants to live where the shop was to be found in order to keep the town alive.  Ms Whyte talked about employment opportunities.  She is 100% right in that in a lot of places throughout the country, including Boyle, the lack of bed spaces is a problem.  For the purposes of tourism, more bed spaces are needed.</p><p>Are incentives needed in that sense?  They would help kick on and provide employment.</p><p> Mr. Hynes spoke about more than 470 towns with 400 or 500 people in them.  In many areas where the bigger towns have no housing available, people will rent in the small towns and villages nearby.  Creggs and Athleague took part in the Pride of Place competition, which showed how a town can be brought up when a few quid is put into it.  That is the nub of the issue.  Three new businesses have now opened in Creggs.  At the end of the day, private people are the ones who open businesses and provide employment.</p><p> I will say one thing to the people from the Department.  I do not know whether or not they would agree with this.  There are many different funding streams available for politicians and council staff.  It is like going through a maze trying to work out when one thing or another is coming.  Could we put a calendar together showing the different schemes coming up from January to December?  That way, we would know when everything was coming.  There are volunteers in many of these towns trying to do their best, aided by their liaisons with councils around the country.  Some of these people are working every day and are liaising with councils.  They need something like this, starting at the beginning of the year.  Either the local representatives or the Department could announce the schemes, after which there might be a window of opportunity of a month or two to apply.  Is there something we can do to help communities and councils in that regard?  They would then know what was coming in January, what to apply for in February, and so on.  It is nearly like an explosion at the moment, and people could miss out on something if two different schemes are announced at the same time.  We are hearing that a lot from ordinary people.</p><p> Much great work is being done in many areas.  We have to provide incentives, such as giving people living in rural Ireland bigger tax breaks, for example.</p><p> My last question is for Mr. Hynes and the county managers.  Is there a danger that under the 2040 housing strategy, which emphasises larger urban areas, the smaller towns might be left behind when one crunches the numbers on the number of houses allowed in certain areas?</p></speech>

Senator Coffey and Deputy Smyth asked about the town teams, which either Ms McConnell or Mr. Hynes referenced.  Someone also asked about visual aids and County Offaly.  Senator Coffey asked the Department's views on what will happen beyond this pilot.  Mr. Hynes was asked about the city and county managers and the responsibility of buying property, which must be led by them as they have those powers.  Senator Hopkins asked about the cost and what kind of incentives might help, which Deputy Fitzmaurice also mentioned.  Senator Hopkins also asked where we go from here.  Deputy Fitzmaurice asked Ms Whyte, the Department and Mr. Hynes some very targeted questions about planning.  I ask the witnesses to try to avoid repetition when answering those questions.  I call Mr. Parnell from the Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.809" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. William Parnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019111300002#N00300"><p>I will start with Deputy Smyth's questions.  She asked how the towns were selected for the pilot.  At the beginning of 2018, the Minister established a steering group to examine the most effective way to encourage increased residential occupancy in our towns and villages.  Some schemes operated by the local authorities, for example, had not generated the levels of uptake necessary to have any real effect.  That steering group included the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Finance, and a representative from the County and City Management Association, CCMA.  The steering group suggested that the best way to proceed was through the development of a small number of well-planned pilot schemes that could be delivered relatively quickly by the local authority, working with the Department and other agencies.  Arising from that process, those six towns were identified on the basis of a number of factors.  First, we wanted some spread in the size and populations of the towns, as well as their locations.  Towns from the west, the south east, the Border region and the midlands are all represented here.  It is a mix of towns, some of which we would have worked with previously through other schemes such as the town and village renewal scheme.  This was building on that scheme to some extent.  Boyle is a good example, as it has its 2040 plan in place.  These towns also had their own particular challenges, which would enable us to test them or give them an opportunity to identify challenges and solutions.  It is also a mix of historic towns, market towns and towns that might be attractive to tourists.</p> <p>  Deputy Smyth also asked about how to achieve replication.  The objective was to use these six towns as a pilot to identify the common threads.  We are now seeing some of those common threads and themes coming through very clearly, and we hope we will see solutions coming out of it as well.  We hope to use the learning from this pilot to advise us in designing schemes or policies around town centre rejuvenation.  This touches a bit on where we go from here, about which Senator Hopkins and others asked.  The intention is to put together a final composite report, and we have commissioned someone to help us with that.  By the end of the year, a draft composite report will be put together and presented to the Minister.  It will summarise all the key issues, including those we have heard about today and more.  It will also look at international experience to see whether there are any learnings from other countries that could be applicable here.  If committee members would like to make any suggestions to the Department on that, based on these meetings, we would be very happy to receive them.</p> <p>  Senator Coffey asked whether we intend to extend the scheme.  Ultimately, that is the Minister's prerogative.  We are seeing many similar themes which are probably applicable right across the board.  The question is how to take learnings from this scheme to help other towns and develop master plans.  The importance of having a master plan and stakeholder engagement was one of the strong messages I heard today.  It is interesting that a number of these towns are looking at clusters of houses.  When we started this initiative, we thought it would be about renovating single properties.</p><p>Based on our engagement and what we have heard today, it is very interesting to hear about the potential to have clusters of houses.  That is an important message.  There is a great amount of learning that will prove very valuable.  As I stated in my opening remarks, the intention was always that the RRDF would provide an opportunity not just for these towns but also other towns to come up with proposals and develop plans to support town centre regeneration, including residential occupancy of vacant buildings.  In fact, in the announcements made by the Minister last week on the RRDF, it was quite interesting to see that a number of towns were addressing the issue of vacant properties and premises.  Towns such as Tulla, Virginia and Loughrea come to mind, where a vacant property, probably a public property, is being taken to try to create a civic space, community-based attraction or facility.  I am very encouraged to see that happen, not just in the towns mentioned but in others that are recognising that the RRDF is a vehicle that can be used to provide multi-annual support, rather than simply an annualised pot of money.</p><p> Senator Coffey also asked about philanthropic contributions.  We deliberately wrote into the terms of the fund that there would be an opportunity to provide philanthropic funds to contribute to projects.  Without naming any, we have had conversations with a number of philanthropic organisations about what the Department is doing to try to revitalise rural towns.  I am aware that some organisations were involved with the LEADER programme in the past in providing funding for local development companies.  As a Department, we are keen to explore the development of the philanthropic sector.  We are aware that there are organisations that are, and have been, willing to contribute.  This is something on which we are also working.</p><p> Senator Hopkins asked about the extent to which local authorities had been working together.  The Department has chaired a group involving representatives of all of the towns represented here.  It has met regularly, on five or six occasions, since this initiative was established last October, including at a facilitated workshop in September that drew a wider group of interests, including some of the people the committee may have met last week.  The local authorities have been working together and we will continue to try to facilitate engagement to learn lessons from it.  </p><p> The Senator's comment about employment is apt and important because from what we have heard in the presentations today, there is a need for an holistic approach.  Ultimately, we are trying to renovate properties and encourage people to come back to live in town centres.  To do this, facilities need to be in place, as well as employment opportunities.  Ms Mulholland gave a good example of how Kilkenny County Council has used other sources of funding, including the town and village renewal scheme, to build facilities to support families who might eventually move in, including recreational spaces, but the employment issue is also important.  It is important to remember that funds such the RRDF and schemes such as the town and village renewal scheme have placed a focus on stimulating economic activity in rural towns.  Some practical examples include investment in digital, enterprise and food hubs.  Within the Department, we engage closely with the enterprise development agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, as well as the local enterprise offices.  We are increasingly engaging in such work.  The Atlantic economic corridor is a good example of an initiative where we are all working closely together, with a view to attracting investment and jobs.  The point has been well made point and it is important to keep an eye on it.</p></speech>

At the beginning of the year, the Minister drew up a calendar of schemes, which he shared with the local authorities.  He also met the chief executive officers to discuss it.  We may need to think about how we can go a step further in order that local communities will have access to the calendar at an early stage.  We recognised the need for the local authorities to be able to cope with schemes throughout the year.</p></speech>

I will talk to him directly about it because the issue is hugely important.  Responsibility for delivering on the renewal of smaller towns and villages lies, unequivocally, with local authorities, about which there is no question.  We need Departments, agencies and a great many people to be involved with funding, but in the heel of the hunt, it is a matter for the local authorities to deliver.  We accept this and absolutely prioritise the matter, although some have it higher on their list of priorities.  The position in each county and local authority is different.  Priorities vary across local authorities.  That is why, as the committee will be aware, they are independent, but we absolutely accept that the responsibility to deliver on the renewal of towns and villages is ours.</p> <p>  The second point I wish to make, about which I will also speak to Senator Coffey directly, is that there is a model in place.  We are suggesting there is enough learning and that the scheme will provide further learning.  We do not need to look outside the country or at other places as much as we think we might need to do.  The CCMA suggests the following elements, which I have included on a slide are essential to the model in place: community engagement at the start which must include everyone in the town or village; a vision or plan, that is, some notion as to where one wants to go, as otherwise it will be haphazard opportunism; and investment, which is related to the point I was making about the description of Westport, which was transformed under the seaside resort scheme.  The scheme receives a lot of bad press, which is sometimes deserved, but in the case of Westport, partly because there was a plan before the scheme was put in place, partly because there was engagement with stakeholders and partly because there was a very good town council - I will come to the question about town councils - to oversee it, transformed the town.  It is about implementation and leadership given by the local authority.  This is a common theme which should come across in all of the submissions made.</p><p> I believe Deputy Smyth asked about town councils.  It is fairly clear that it is better to have a small number of councils with local representation, local control and local resources than if that is spread.  Having said that, we had three town councils.  We have 30 towns that are of magnitude.  Deputy Fitzmaurice talked about towns with a population of less than 500.  We have 800 settlements with a population of more than 250, each of which is important.  The flip side of the town council amalgamation into the municipal district model is that more towns are getting a fairer share of the cake and places such as Newport and Mulrany in our case - there are others throughout the country - are doing far better than they would have done in the old system and I think that is recognised.  There are balances in it.</p><p> On setting up a central agency or a centre of excellence, there was a centre of excellence under the National Building Agency, NBA, back in the 1980s.  It dealt with urban design and its first CEO was Derek Tynan.  That worked very well for some time.  I am not sure why it moved on.  There is certainly a case to be made for having a centre of shared knowledge and shared expertise.  We suggested in the presentation that that should reside in a public body or a Department.  There are pros and cons over which Department it might sit in.  The learning from this scheme might influence where it might sit.  I would strongly argue that a base level of skills is required in each local authority to be able to deliver for all of those 400 or 800 settlements.  Whether it is located in Athlone, Castlebar, Westport or Dublin, the whole of the country cannot be tripping to one place for guidance.  They must have the capacity to do some of their own and that is about capacity building.</p><p> I am aware of time and I do not want to hog this but I want to deal with some of the questions put.  I think I speak for all local authorities in saying that having incentives to guide investment back into the core towns and villages is crucial.  I am not from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but I would guess that with 800 settlements, 400 of them reasonably large, and the kind of investment needed, it will be very hard to find the resources from the public purse.  The only other option is some kind of tax-driven private investment scheme.  That debate will arise from the findings of the pilot scheme.</p><p> On out-of-town shopping, would we do it again?  Perhaps we would do it differently.  It was not all about planning.  Many small towns and villages just cannot accommodate the size of unit that consumers are demanding.  In some towns we have been successful in keeping that focus in the centre of town and in others less so.  The move to online shopping will change all that radically anyway.  Perhaps in the not-too-distant future, we will be looking to repurpose edge-of-town, big-box shopping outlets because of where Amazon, Google and the drone world have taken us.  That may be a question for another day.</p><p> On the question of the arts and creativity, that is an extremely important point that we would all take on board.  Not all cheap space is bad space.  Sometimes it is an advantage to have space that is slightly less used and slightly less in demand because it can accommodate fringe activities and it can accommodate an arts and creativity aspect to towns and villages, which is really important.</p><p> When saying that it is not our responsibility to deal with dereliction, I believe the point being made is that it is not our responsibility to deal with all dereliction and there is a balance.  Every local authority has used CPO and derelict sites legislation to facilitate either private development or to build our own developments, much of it housing.  However, we cannot have the core of every town and village dominated by public housing; it just will not work.  It is about balance and I think that was the point being made rather than shirking any responsibility.</p><p> On incentives, we will need to use grants, subsidies, supports, which are and will be limited, or tax breaks to try to incentivise private development.  I believe Senator Hopkins talked about confidence.  Confidence is a big part of it which is why we talked about changing the narrative.  If we could get a "Grand Designs" or Dermot Bannon-type programme around living in small towns which actually shows how good it is and can be, then I think that narrative might start to change.  It has worked.  One hears about Clonakilty, Kinsale and other places, but it is a 20-year programme and this is a very important step in it.  We could go on for a very long time because it is a very big priority for local authorities.</p><p> I will allow others to make some contributions.</p></speech>

I welcome Mary Mulholland.  I am from Carlow, and Carlow and Kilkenny work together.  The scheme needs to be promoted more.  I was going to ask how the six towns were picked and that has already been answered.  Was a specific allocation made to each of the six towns picked?  Is there special funding for them and if so how much?</p> <p>  There was considerable discussion of vacant properties.  I have great concern about vacant properties.  It is great that we will work with these six towns, which I welcome.  However, my town of Carlow has vacant property levies.  Those levies are very substantial irrespective of the local authority.  In the last budget we went from anything over 6,000 which was originally a 5% levy it has now gone from anything over 6,000 to a 30% levy.  That is not an incentive.  The bigger picture here with all local authorities together with this is the fact that we need to give incentives, even in these small towns but also in Carlow itself.</p> <p>  I have another issue about rates and I do not know if that was brought up.  A revaluation was done between 2014 and 2018 and I believe only 20% of the properties were actually visited.  I believe 80% of them were done through maps.  These are issues the witnesses might take into consideration in the plan they are doing because these are major issues.  For example, Carlow does not get half the capital funding we should get.  It all boils down to money.  We need to ensure that smaller towns and villages, like Carlow and others, get the capital funding they are not getting.  I have many more questions but I know I have to be respectful.</p> <p>  Overall, I think it is good, but on a bigger picture there are major issues that need to be looked at in the 31 local authorities, certainly in my own area.</p></speech>

We have had a very constructive meeting.  I thank all the witnesses for their work on this very important issue of regenerating our village and town centres, making them a more attractive place in which to live and work.  Considerable work remains to be done.  I highlight Mr. Hynes's contribution.  What he said is key in terms of getting community engagement as a start, getting that plan in place and then drawing down the necessary resources to implement that plan.  That is exactly what we heard last week from the community organisations.  Westport is put up there as the poster child and it has won national awards.  It would not have achieved those objectives if it did not have that master plan back in the day.</p><p>As has been said, it was a 20-year project and it is reaping the rewards of that.  The resources followed as well, which is key.  </p><p> The job of work done by each local authority is important.  There is certainly a crossover between Castleblayney and the Waterford experience.  There is so much overlap there.  So much must, and should, be learned.  I compliment the Minister for coming up with this initiative and the officials for working closely with the various different groups but we need to learn the lessons from this and enable local authorities to work more closely with communities and provide the necessary resources to bridge the gaps that are there.  </p><p> Mr. Hynes said that we do not need to look outside this State.  In his initial contribution, he said that Mayo County Council has adopted the Scottish approach to community futures.  This ties in with what Free Market said last week because it is pushing the Scottish approach, which seems to have been adopted by the county council.  What is his thinking on that?  </p><p> Deputy Stanley has just returned.  I understand the pressure he is under.  We are trying to wrap the meeting up but I know he wants to make a contribution.  Could he make his contribution and I will then ask every organisation represented here to give a one-minute wrap-up?  We will then adjourn.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.832" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1232" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RCJ2019111300002#Q00200"><p>I had to pop in and out of the meeting.  Regarding the range of funding, one of the previous speakers mentioned a calendar so that one would know when the scheme opens and closes and that would provide a brief on the scheme.  I find that one can get fazed by the whole thing.  I know from talking to people in the various towns who are trying to access funding for groups, villages and towns that they find this to be a problem as well.  One local authority official told me that it is &euro;30,000 here, &euro;27,000 there and &euro;60,000 somewhere else.  It tends to have little impact.  It is a bit like the decentralisation scheme in 2003 to which there was a scattergun approach that did not have as much as an impact as it could have had.  Perhaps the departmental officials will address that point.</p><p>My next question is for Mr. Shanahan.  I am familiar with Boyle and was interested in the contribution on that town because if I go to Donegal, I always stop in Boyle.  I have noticed in recent years that the town become very dilapidated.  Some work is now being done and it is looking a lot better.  It is typical of a lot of towns.  In the area in which I live in - Laois-Offaly - one could pick out ten towns that have suffered the same fate but Boyle was particularly badly hit.  Could Mr. Shanahan address the question of Banagher?A couple of things strike me about it, one of which is the use of the old convent, which he mentioned in his statement.  What kind of use could this be put to because I know Mountrath had a similar building?  Most of the towns around had a quarter where the schools and religious buildings were located.  Many of them are now derelict.  What use could they be put to?  </p><p>Regarding vacant premises, town centres have been hollowed out for a number of reasons.  They contain dilapidated buildings that are difficult to bring up to any kind of modern living standards and the bungalow blitz means people live two or three miles out of town and nobody lives in the town centre.  The buildings are old and dilapidated, and this is replicated in different towns and counties.  In some cases, these buildings have large back gardens.  In the case of many of them, should we not just face reality and accept that what is needed is a ball and chain, knock them down, build new streets off the main street and get people living in the town centres?  There are signs that this is happening in some towns, though not through any great master plan.  It is happening on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis, which is not the best.</p><p>Perhaps we would be better off accepting the fact that some of these houses will never be lived in again.  I worked in a town that had 21 pubs.  Four of them remain and I think a fifth one is struggling.  It might come back to life but it might not.  Circumstances have changed.  People shop differently.  There used to be halfway houses such as the pub and the grocery shop, which are now gone.  It used to be the case that there was a pub on one side of the building and a grocery shop on the other.  Would we be better off in some cases being more radical and saying that what is needed is people housed on the streets because the town centres are deserted?  The housing estates in Monasterevin were built in fields almost as if pieces of Lego were dropped from a helicopter.  They are all outside the town.  This has happened in a range of towns throughout the country.</p><p>I agree with Mr. Shanahan that there are many good services on the main street in Banagher with which I am very familiar.  There is a fine monument up on the hill to Peter Barnes and James McCormack, which is a lovely feature at the top of the town.  Listed buildings come into play when it comes to a ball and chain.  We need to recognise reality.  I was a county councillor and questioned this several times with regard to our county development plan.  It listed buildings where the owner did not have the money to maintain them; where in some cases, we did know who the owner was; or where nothing would ever happen and nobody would ever live in them again.  If one drives into any town in the middle of the day, one can see that in many of them, the main streets are deserted.  We have to get people living in them to create businesses in them again, and provide childcare facilities.  Banagher is lucky, as Mr. Shanahan pointed out.  He identified pretty well that it has schools.  What about listed buildings and demolition?  </p><p>Sometimes other factors come in play.  An estate in Banagher earmarked for a housing association was mentioned.  One of the estates built back in the noughties on the right hand side past Corrigan's pub flooded in recent times.  The statement said that the bottom half of the town had the greatest amount of dereliction.  That is very pronounced.  Is it not the case that some of that relates to flood risk because the bottom of the town is prone to flooding?  Are there other reasons apart from dereliction that people are reluctant to go in and spend money in those areas and live in them?</p></speech>

Deputy Stanley asked about a calendar.  Deputy Fitzmaurice had just raised that issue.  A calendar was circulated by the Minister to the chief executive officers at the beginning of this year.  We were talking about the need to ensure that this information gets down to local communities so it is something we will work on with the CCMA.</p> <p>  Deputy Stanley said that small amounts can sometimes have little impact.  What we have done over the past two years since the Department was established is establish a range of different schemes.  Schemes such as CL&Aacute;R or the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme that provide small amounts can have a significant impact on those areas.  We have a range of schemes up to the rural regeneration and development fund, where the minimum amount we pay in a grant is &euro;500,000, so we have provided a range of different services.  </p> <p>  Senator Coffey asked about funding for each of the projects here today.  It was outlined earlier that each project has been provided with up to &euro;100,000 just to develop the ideas from here.  </p></speech>

The process is that the Valuation Office took samples and then valued properties based on those samples.  If anyone affected had a problem or an issue, they had a right to appeal.  It was a sample-based process. </p><p> To respond to the Chairman, we are not suggesting that we do not learn and continue to learn from outside.  Senator Coffey posed the key question, which is when we can have a model.  We are suggesting that, communally, with further learning to come from this welcome scheme, we have a model that is about community, vision, investment and implementation, and it is the responsibility of the local authority.  My point is that we do not need to look outside much more.  We can get started and roll it out. </p></speech>

There is a huge willingness and appetite for this among communities and the local authority sector.  The leadership that is needed, as Mr. Hynes explained, is well established in the local authorities, with the support of the Department and the communities on the ground.  It then comes down to how we make that happen.  Engaging the private sector through incentives is key to this.  The moneys that have flowed through the various schemes have been hugely valuable but until the private sector is fully engaged in this through incentives, we will not see the kind of impact on the ground that we are hoping for.  It is about selling our town centres as places where people want to live, and that is about two issues, the quality of life and the return on their investment.  They need to see that what they spend on their home will be over and above what they had anticipated.</p></speech>

My point is that we are identifying from this pilot a need to have a strategic plan on a page and that the valuable funding streams available to support all the different initiatives need to be aligned to match that plan on a page, which is the ultimate objective.  They all have significant value individually but, cumulatively, they would have more.  It is about lining up the strategy with the funding streams, which all have significant value in their own right.</p> <p>  Mr. Hynes dealt with the issue of the arts.  The arts community also has separate funding streams and it is about integrating all of those objectives.  Culture makes a place, especially in small communities, so it is about aligning them.  That is not necessarily to say there is anything wrong with them being piecemeal but it is about aligning them with a plan on a page.</p> <p>  To clarify, the objective is to have living, vibrant town centres and mixed tenure is essential to achieve that.  It is certainly the responsibility of the local authorities to co-ordinate and formulate the strategic plan.  However, the delivery has a public and a private requirement or, otherwise, it will not be sustainable.  I agree with Ms McConnell that there is an appetite in the communities.  The recent investment under the various schemes, such as the town and village scheme, the RRDF or the outdoor recreation scheme, and the plethora of smaller investments that have been made, are increasing the public appetite to engage in this type of strategic approach.  We need to grasp that opportunity and maximise its impact. </p></speech>

It has to be local authority-led.  Community involvement is critical to that, as Mr. Hynes outlined.  Once we have the community engaged, we need incentives and they need to be ongoing, not just short-term.  There are two areas of focus, the public realm and public buildings, and we can lead the way on that.</p></speech>

Many authorities have ownership of old courthouses and former public buildings in need of renovation.  The second element relates to the private sector and the conversion of former retail outlets into housing, and regeneration of old terraced housing or substandard housing to get people back living there.</p></speech>

The building I referred to in the presentation is another building in the town centre which we are looking to purchase for development into a community-remote working hub.</p> <p>  I take the Deputy's point on the challenge in regard to listed buildings.  With regard to demolishing these and looking to a type of greenfield development, these streets are very much the character of the town and we risk losing the town centre character by setting back the streetscape, which is not always possible given they are listed buildings.  There is an example in the presentation where we look at how decent sized back gardens could be used to extend and modernise these units into modern-type houses that would be more attractive to family living. </p> <p>  In general, the key point is incentives for the individual property owners in these areas because of how expensive it is to develop these buildings.  The community engagement stakeholder element is important and the local authority is best placed to lead that.  There is a palpable sense of optimism out there to develop and try to regenerate these towns.  The funding schemes in place for town and village regeneration are certainly acting as a catalyst or a seed to get this going and it is that good mix of public realm and public funding, along with the private property owner piece and the incentives, that is needed. </p></speech>

First, we have just set up a multidisciplinary team to cover the entire county.  Second, the largest catalyst in Boyle was the purchase of the Royal Hotel site.  Through having that site and getting the planning ready, we were ready for the RRDF funding that has stimulated the rest of the work we have done.  There is an interest and a passion from people on the street.  In June, some of the people who had lived on the street came back to the works and told us their story.  Additional properties began to be done up as a result of the historic towns initiative.  Sometimes, it is just a question of seeing a bit of confidence.  However, the added incentive of having a financial contribution towards doing the work makes a big difference.  It needs to be sustainable so we need a three-way partnership between the local authority, the community and property owners, and the employers to provide jobs in the area.</p></speech>

The long-term objective is to change the mindset regarding living in towns and villages.  Particularly in rural areas, there is this concept of having a front and back garden, and we want to try to swing that across to something that makes towns and villages attractive, for example, where people are close to services, the buildings themselves can be very attractive to live in and people do not need to be a taxi service driving their kids around.  In that regard, we had a meeting with an auctioneer who gave us grounds for optimism that there would be a market for residential units in towns and villages.</p> <p>  The other point is that the only realistic option for use in Cappoquin is primarily residential in the long run.  As was mentioned earlier, the pubs are going and a lot of the commercial sector is leaving, but if it was largely residential, that would drive some local services.  Our study has shown that affordability has to be addressed.  We largely found that the sale price of the property only covers the development cost and when this is added to the acquisition cost of the property, it does not match the sale price of the property. </p></speech>

Give Us The Night is an independent volunteer group whose primary purpose has been to achieve fair conditions for night time venues.  Night time is about bringing together communities, enjoying unique experiences and in many cases being inspired to create challenging art and music.  Night time is a magical time that so many of us live for.  We want to live like the rest of Europe, but instead we are living in a no man's land, where in order to open, venues must apply for nightly special exemption orders rather than being granted their own specific annual licence.  We are still operating under this bizarre legislation from the last century that does not meet modern requirements.</p> <p>  The infrastructure supporting venues in Ireland is wholly inadequate.  The system is set up to penalise any venue that wants to operate beyond standard pub hours and the costs are extortionate.  It is &euro;410 per night, plus legal fees, for any venue, regardless of size, to open.  This price was fixed in 2008 by Fianna F&aacute;il and has been continued by Fine Gael.  Venues have been priced out of the market.  Special exemption order applications are down 55% since 2008 and dance licences are down 46%.  Ireland, famed for its dancing culture, is for the most part prevented from dancing after dark.  This is an issue that has been neglected by the Department of Justice and Equality and needs to be rectified.</p> <p>  This is not just about dancing.  It is about opening our main urban centres later to move us into line with other European countries.  Why do theatres, galleries, coffee shops, restaurants or even markets not open later?  Why is there not a business model for them to open, considering that gyms open 24 hours and bus routes are now beginning to operate for 24 hours?  Despite having record levels of tourism, we are ejecting people from our towns and cities at artificially early times, also putting excessive pressure on transport services and garda&iacute;.  No other European country does it like this.</p> <p>  Licensing is unavoidable in the conversation about music and night-time culture.  The knock-on effect to performers and staff is catastrophic when a venue has to shut down.  Many talented people around Ireland, young and old, do not have anywhere suitable to perform or work anymore.  The vast majority of qualified sound engineers do not have regular work and would currently be lucky to find any work in this country.  We once had working showbands becoming stars around Ireland, when there was a nationwide venue circuit worth talking about.  We can have that again, and more people can earn a living here and will pay more taxes here.  Instead the primary focus of Government, councils and tourist boards is event tourism, in the shape of large-scale concerts and festivals.  This results in a gig economy that is sporadic and unpredictable.  Supporting local venues and ongoing community-led events will lead to a more vibrant night-time economy.</p> <p>  Once upon a time we built dancehalls, we had cinemas next to our local shops, and we had various places for young people to come together and create real-life communities.  Multi-purpose spaces are now commonplace around Europe.  These spaces are not just a pub or a club, but operate as different types of facilities from day through to night, for the local community as well as for visitors.  These spaces can operate as an art gallery or coffee shop by day and transform into a performance space or dance club by night.  The licensing system for venues is mean-spirited, anti-business, anti-music and anti-culture.  It is a form of censorship, which is not surprising, since the legislation relating to venues was more or less written by the Catholic church in the 1930s.</p> <p>  We propose the reintroduction of the theatre licence for late night cultural and music events, or a variation of this licence to be called a culture licence or a night-venue licence.  We also suggest the introduction of a multi-use licence for all types of cultural, artistic and business activities under the same roof.  We cannot underestimate the value of the night-time economy.  The UK values its nightlife at &pound;66 billion per year, while Berlin values its club industry alone at &euro;1.5 billion per year.  Similarly, we should value the creative minds and entrepreneurship that emerge from the dance floor.  Electric Picnic was spawned from an internationally-renowned Dublin nightclub and became an essential Irish cultural event like no other.</p> <p>  Local development plans need to follow through on what they say.  The Dublin City Council development plan states &ldquo;there is a need to facilitate the concept of the 24-hour city, particularly in the city centre and other key district centres".  It also states that it seeks to "promote and support a vibrant night culture in the city centre that attracts a diverse range of cultural activity and is attractive for a wide range of age groups".  Given the vast number of key venue closures recently times, does Dublin City Council believe that the city has a vibrant night culture?</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Josepha Madigan, and her Department are in the early stages of developing a policy on night-time culture.  She has cited different areas where changes could be made, such as licensing and planning, and has also discussed the creation of a night mayor to manage night-time activities.  Given the growing lack of access to cultural and music-based activities at night, we would like this committee to do all in its power to get behind this initiative.  We also propose that the Government commission a report on the night-time economy as soon as possible, that can forecast the potential impact on local economies around the country, should we reform the structure around nightlife.</p> <p>  We are at a critical point.  An important cultural change must take place that recognises modern culture and communities and what they expect going into 2020.</p></speech>

We look forward to working with members of the committee this afternoon.  Earlier this year, the Minister, Deputy Madigan, convened an engaging forum for stakeholders and we are encouraged to be this far in the process.  There are more than 200,000 hospitality jobs in Ireland and the industry is worth an estimated &euro;9 billion to the economy each year.  This is especially the case in the west of Ireland where culture and tourism are often the main sources of income for many communities.  There is no harm in saying that this is a challenge at which we excel.  The Wild Atlantic Way has become an important initiative and local people have been the engine behind this success.  Small businesses, arts companies, community groups and workers have helped to drive the west as a destination for food, culture, heritage and a unique experience.  People can enjoy art, music, and drama to a standard on par with anywhere else in Europe.</p> <p>  However, challenges remain.  There is great concern about Brexit and any outcome that would place the Irish economy at a disadvantage.  The Government works hard to ensure that sectors such as agriculture or finance can do their business on a level playing field with counterparts elsewhere.  Our cultural and night-time industries have been struggling with one hand behind their back.</p><p> In an age of budget travel we are competing with cities and events on the Continent that operate in much more favourable conditions.  Irish nights out are world-famous, but it is often more attractive to residents of Ireland to leave the country for the weekend.  Thousands of euro go abroad each week because as Ireland closes its doors at night Europe carries on doing business.</p><p> People's habits and lifestyle and the country in which we live have changed dramatically.  The hours people work and how they socialise have changed.  There are more options than ever but all this is happening against the backdrop of laws from the 1930s such as the dance halls Act, dating from a time when Ireland was a very different place.</p><p> At the workshop the Minister organised earlier this year there was a policy suggestion to map venues in curating events of cultural significance.  Giving such venues an opportunity to promote musicians and artists for extended hours during festival periods such as the Galway International Arts Festival would be extremely beneficial to the local economy and the cultural life of the town or city.  This is of particular significance as Galway city and county will host the European Capital of Culture in 2020.</p><p> The prohibitive costs of the special exemption process are one of the primary reasons venues are closing their doors around the country.  What can cost over &euro;125,000 in fees for late licences here costs just over &pound;1,000 in the UK.  Even with these exemptions Ireland has one of the earliest curfews in all of Europe.  To keep trading with such high costs we have evolved into a multipurpose event space.  We have opened our doors to the Galway Jazz Festival, the C&uacute;irt literature festival, Galway Theatre Festival, TULCA Festival of Visual Arts and the Above the Fold design festival and have become a temporary home for Theatre57, a collective of 90 independent theatre artists making work in Galway city and county.  In the current licensing legislation, however, there is no clear distinction between a bar and a venue.  A bar can apply for the same exemption order and trade for the same hours.  When the extra costs and higher risks associated with promoting an event are added, it is understandable why many venues around the country have closed.</p><p> Without these performance spaces, artists have no avenue, and we are all poorer for it.  A one-size-fits-all approach has not served us.  Previous Ministers have spoken of their intention to modernise the laws and streamline the licensing process, but reform has stalled on a number of occasions.  In this respect we welcome the development of Ireland's first nighttime cultural policy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.858" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ciara O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22019111300002#E00300"><p>Having been asked to present, and not wanting to speak from my own experience in isolation, I reached out to select colleagues in the arts and entertainment industry to get some of their thoughts and ideas on the current state of Irish nightlife.  As a business owner, I am entrenched in making my business work and until recently did not have the time to stop and look beyond my own patch to see how our nighttime culture is doing.  Dishearteningly, it appears the answer is "not well".  Those to whom I spoke reported finding it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to do business, with many talking exit strategies.  I strongly feel, however, that all is far from lost and that with the right supports we can turn this around.  We are faced not with a crisis but with an opportunity to capitalise on what we have, bring real Irish culture to the fore and allow a nighttime economy that can be among the best in the world to flourish.  Ireland is a unique mix of cosmopolitan and traditional.  Our people are well travelled, multicultural, broad-minded and always welcoming of new experiences.  Our nightlife should and could reflect this, provided it is given the opportunity to grow and thrive.</p> <p>  I am representing my company, Central Arts, and my city, Waterford.  I feel in some sense that I am representing our smaller regional cities and towns as well.  There is a commonly held belief that Dublin nightlife culture is not doing well.  While this may be true, the committee should know that this is happening all over Ireland and we have all been feeling it for a long time.  In 2014, during the darkest days of the recession, austerity and job losses, my partner and I decided to reinvest our savings and some redundancy money in an alternative venue that offered something different but something for everyone - an alternative nighttime space.  I come from a social work background and my partner is a theatre producer and artist.  With our eclectic mix of skills we decided to give it a go.  So Central Arts was born.  Our venue is small but perfect for what we do.  Our ambitions are modest and our expectations scaled.  We have only 50 seats and are far from a commercial venture; we are somewhere between a small family business and a social enterprise.  It is safe to say that without the support of our local council we would not be where we are today.  We are a venue - a black box theatre - and an arts company.  At the heart of what we do is breaking down the inherent exclusivity of the arts and making the arts and culture accessible to everyone.  We strongly believe in inclusivity, opening up the general understanding of what culture is and creating a space for contemporary and traditional entertainment offerings.</p> <p>  As our company has grown, so has our remit: it now includes festivals, workshops and mentoring programmes that help young people find their way into careers in the arts and events and performance areas.  We are a home and performance space for artists, musicians and theatre makers, and our own productions have toured nationally and internationally.  This broad remit has meant we have an offering for all our community.  Thousands have crossed our threshold over the past five years to perform, engage in and enjoy a diverse offering of modern and traditional Irish culture.</p> <p>  Sadly, however, after five years hard work to make this idea a success, we now find that the space in which we exist is being squeezed and that the freedom to provide an alternative to mainstream, alcohol-based nightlife culture is becoming increasingly elusive.  This August we were informed by the Garda that to continue our electronic music offering we would have to apply to the courts for a public dance licence or to cease these nights immediately.  We were subsequently told by our insurers that to afford the necessary insurance cover to hold such a licence, we would need to have turnover well in excess of &euro;1 million, which is clearly out of the reach of a small, 50-seat arts venue.  We never wished to serve alcohol in our premises or to have alcohol central to our model but are now being forced to do so to be able to continue providing a programme of entertainment at nighttime.  We must now become a licensed venue to continue existing.</p> <p>  Central Arts has a business model that is unique and has proved successful; however, as an alternative venue there is no protection or support for us.  Grassroots music and arts venues are becoming a thing of the past.  We were born of the recession and wanted to make something happen in our city when there was so little.  Now, with the green shoots of recovery growing around us, we wonder whether there is any room left for us to exist.  Where and how will young people get their start in the entertainment and nighttime industries if there is no infrastructure to support them?  I feel that our idea of Irish culture is narrowing.  We need to re-examine it to include contemporary art forms, new cultures and alternative ideas and forms of performance.  Not only that, but we need to allow these to flourish as part of a nighttime culture that allows opportunity for every alternative.  We have been unable to access any funding or support at a national level.  There is a commonly held belief in regional Ireland that arts and culture funding does not trickle down past the capital.</p> <p>  What can be done to encourage alternative nightlife, and nightlife as a whole?  As the Give Us the Night campaign has stated, the legislation that dictates our nighttime economy, certainly the application process, is outdated and needs to be re-examined and overhauled, with allowance made for venues outside the mainstream licensing system.  We need to look to Europe to bring our nighttime offerings into line with its more successful examples and we cannot do this while constrained by the current licensing system.  As we have found in Waterford, the Garda has a lot of power to dictate the nighttime economy, which has resulted in a national inequality in respect of closing times.  Likewise, the insurance industry and the claims culture are having a huge effect on nightlife, with runaway premiums single-handedly pushing small independent venues and festivals out of business.  There needs to be more support for grassroots organisations, those who provide diverse offerings, and smaller venues such as ours that may never turn over &euro;1 million in a year.</p></speech>

Today has already been a huge success, given the fact that the Departments of Justice and Equality, and Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht are surely listening at this point.  Judging from people I speak to, young people in our towns and cities right across the country are looking for sustainable places in which to dance, staggered opening hours and closing times, and public transport home.  I thank Mr. Sharpe and Mr. Kitt for bringing my attention acutely to the policy areas on this issue.  I attended their public meeting a couple of months ago.  I think there were more than 300 people there.  That shows the demand and shows that young people are politicised on this issue.  I laugh when the <i>Irish Independent</i>or <i>The Irish Times</i>suggests what the next big social issues are and overlooks this issue.</p><p>It should not be overlooked.  The work being done by all of the delegates and Give us the Night is progressing this issue.</p><p> I visited the former technical school in Amsterdam a few weekends ago.  It is now a nightclub, but it is also a concert venue, restaurant, caf&eacute;, exhibition space and gym with a 24-hour licence.  Mr. Finan has said people are more likely to go away for a long weekend and if they only go out to socialise or party once a month, they might save it to pay for the Ryanair flight to Lisbon, Amsterdam or Berlin.  We need to keep them here.</p><p> I am also concerned that friends and people I meet leave clubs early to go to hugely unregulated spaces about which we do not know much and which are possibly dangerous.  They might also go to casinos to have another drink.  This is not about drink, but if someone wants to have another drink after 3 a.m., he or she will go to a casino.</p><p> In the committee's second session we will meet officials from the Department of Justice and Equality to discuss licensing issues.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is in favour of reforms, but there are no immediate plans in place to discuss them.  The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, has said the same.  Consultation will be needed.   What is the next step in dealing with the issue of licensing?  Do we need a wide consultation process that will take in the views of all concerned?  What will happen in nightclubs and venues if the current licensing system continues without reforms?</p></speech>

It has disappeared from some rural areas.  It is diminished greatly in cities outside Dublin and has now taken a very bad turn in Dublin.  There are almost no venues in the centre of the city anymore.  There are a few, but the city is now dominated by pubs and restaurants.  It is great that those places can do business, but that is the only offering available at night and it seems to be a trend throughout the country.  As Ms O'Connell and Mr. Finan noted, the offering at night is becoming more and more narrow and I think the problem is going to get worse.  It is certainly not going to get any better.  This issue was also discussed almost 20 years ago and at the time the Government was criticised for not going far enough with its changes in licensing.  The Chairman of the committee at the time, the current Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, also showed frustration at what had happened.  Before the Minister leaves office, he should stick to his word and do something about this issue.</p></speech>

The licensing system is restrictive when running a large venue, owing to the cost of entertainment and the limited hours during which we can operate.  The system promotes the selling of alcohol because there is only a small window in which to do business.  The system in place here is not comparable to that in any other city in Europe, even when it comes to putting together a programme of entertainment.  Sometimes an agent or manager will laugh and ask why his or her clients are going on so early if they are the headline acts because they are so used to playing later.  It is really hard to continue with this model.  Many venues are closing both in Dublin and rural areas.  It is an economic decision.  If it is not possible to run a business successfully, one changes the business model and that is what is happening.</p></speech>

Changing the licensing system would not mean people would have more money to go out to socialise.  We would probably not choose to stay open until 4 a.m. most nights, as we would still have to pay all of our staff and so on.  As the change would not line the pockets of everyone going out at night, nothing would really change in that sense.  However, it would mean that when an event or festival such as the Galway International Arts Festival was held, with 6,000 people attending, we could carry on entertaining them throughout the night.  It would not add to the level of anti-social behaviour either.  The way we operate forces everyone out of venues at the exact same time, which puts a strain on Garda resources and transport services.  If the times were staggered, some of the pressures might be alleviated.</p></speech>

Surely we have moved on a little since.  We and our businesses are being governed by an outdated law that needs reform in some way or another.  We are not looking for instant reforms.  We are looking to start the conversation and process, as which we have done today.  The venue I run is small and focused on the arts, but it also has a night-time offering.  We would never stay open very late, even if night-time licences were to be extended.  I run a small family business, but it is complementary to what my colleagues are doing.  A scene must offer everything, but that is not currently an option in Ireland because businesses such as mine which want to offer something different do not have the space in which to do so.</p></speech>

Both Mr. Finan and Ms O'Connell are talking about the need for flexibility and the lack of it under the current system.  Mr. Finan alluded to artificial closing times.  I acknowledge that the Department of Justice and Equality is concerned about issues such as maintaining public order and alcohol consumption.  It should be noted that the current system incentivises the sale of alcohol in order for businesses to actually operate.  The other things businesses such as Ms O'Connell's can offer are not facilitated under the current licensing system and arrangements.  Regarding public disorder instances, the Department is very concerned about the disturbance caused to residents.  The current system, with its artificial closing times, pushes people out of venues at the same time and creates artificial concentrations.  It is testament to the Irish public that there are not as many public disorder instances as there could be because the licensing system, as it stands, does not create very safe or favourable conditions.  I encourage any member of the committee to come with me on any payday or weekend in Dublin when he or she will see what happens on the streets when all venues close at 2.30 a.m. or 3 a.m.  It is testament to those on the streets that there are not as many problems as there might be and to the Garda that these issues are policed, but it is not sustainable.  The current licensing system works against public safety and ordinance, rather than providing any protection for residents or the public in these settings.</p></speech>

There is a perception that Dublin is a dangerous city.   People write about it all of the time.  Can the witnesses address that?  That needs to be counteracted because they know what they are talking about because they run the venues and participate in this environment.</p> <p>  I have this notion that Temple Bar is open 24 hours a day.  I agree that we need to get back to the small entertainment venues because we have become a Tesco of entertainment.  Even with the opening of Wetherspoons, with which there is nothing wrong, but it is as if we are going to the same venue and we "Tescoise" everything.  I use that description to reflect the bigness and that everything has to be on that scale, as opposed to the unique small venues that can be found in Edinburgh at festival time in little alleyways where there is theatre, dialogue, debate and art. </p> <p>  The very thing that Ms O'Connell is trying to do is so important but it is being closed down by what is attributed to the big venues.</p> <p>  Mr. Sharpe referred to food.  I refer to international cities.  For example, I had the privilege once of be in Taipei, it came alive at 12 midnight but everything quietened down by 4 a.m.  There was a live sense of people shopping or having food, which is very important.  </p> <p>  Is it that we have less control than in other cities?  People come home from Amsterdam, including my sons, and say that it is a wonderful city, full of life but with a police presence, where everybody is having a wonderful time and there is no violence.  What the witnesses are asking for is completely right.  We can have the Wild Atlantic Way but we must also have the physicality of city life.  In Limerick and Galway, and not just during festivals, what they are saying is completely right.  If we can assist in amending the legislation, I am totally on their side.</p></speech>

They feel they have to cram their night in.  We have a lot more power to police ourselves than we are given credit for.  Should there be later offerings, people will be able to police themselves and go for the night.  With the 2 a.m. finish, people feel that they have to put everything into this certain small space of time.  That creates an issue.<br/><br/>The venue I run is complementary to the likes of the Electric Garden and Theatre in Galway.  There has to be space for all these venues.  I talk a great deal about a scene.  We need a scene where our culture and who we are as people can be shown to visitors, be it a small venue like mine or the bigger venues.  There is space for everybody to coexist.  At the moment the legislation is not allowing that to happen.<br/><br/>Venues like mine are starting to disappear.  If we disappear, it will be hard to get us back.  Much of what we do in our venue is because I come from a social work background.  One of the mentorship programmes we started was connected to electronic music.  That is how I met these gentlemen.  We brought in young DJs, aged 16 and 17, showed them how to put on a night and aided them in graphic design.  A couple of those DJs are now touring all over the world.  They came up through my venue, found their way into an artist performance space, and are making a career out of it.  We need to provide these spaces for young people so that they can find their feet and cut their teeth in the arts world.  This world can be very exclusive and unattainable for certain demographics of young people.  If we do not have venues like mine, which are stepping stones into the arts world, it is not going to happen.<br/><br/>My partner will talk about the insurance issue, as he is more <i>au fait</i>with it.</p></speech>

Having such a licence would have increased our insurance costs from &euro;20,000 a year up to &euro;60,000 a year.  We would need to turn over &euro;1 million to &euro;1.5 million a year to afford the insurance premium that would cover that.

I played in Maastricht earlier in the year where the promoter apologised for the club having to close so early at 5 a.m.</p> <p>  Irish venues have the earliest closing times by a long chalk.  Socially, people have changed.  There is a more cosmopolitan spread of people in Ireland now who expect different things as well.  Many people coming here to work travel from other cities where have a night life worth speaking of.  What has to change, which may take a little while to happen, is that the ideal scenario is someone, probably within the council, would operate similar to a licensing board.  Officials could make considered and more democratic decisions on night life issues.  That could involve deciding on what venues could stay open a little later or obtain that kind of licence.  Obtaining licences probably should be under the remit of the District Court once a year.  We do not believe that having to go to court once a month is a good idea.  I could say a great deal about that system but none of it would be positive.  We need to get rid of the system or at least let it sail away.  It has no place in modern times and we need to create a couple of new licences but with more management.  That could mean a night time commissioner or night mayor or whatever one would want to call that person, that is, somebody who would oversee night life and give it the love it deserves.</p></speech>

This is the type of arts investment that can happen not by looking for funding but more by structuring the system in a fair way that can allow for these types of cultural venues.  These can, as Ms O'Connell has said, give young artists their initial platform.  Going back to the dance hall era and talking about social spaces for people to come together, we have great institutions in this country such the GAA that are sports institutions on the face of it, but also act as an important community fixture in so many places.  We can be doing this with this kind of art spaces that can self-sustain themselves through these licensing reforms and allow these spaces to exist in a positive way for their communities but also as a business.  This is something that can allow creative people to contribute towards the economy in a positive way.</p></speech>

The arts can be very exclusive.  Not everyone has access to the arts.  For those who do, that is fine but a person who comes from a council estate might not go to IMMA or somewhere like that.  He or she might never consider crossing that threshold.  A venue like mine provides a stepping stone into these spaces.  It makes the arts more accessible.  We hold a variety of events, including open mikes and so on.  We also hold electronic music events.  We have seen a huge crossover within our audience.  When young people come to the venue to DJ and so on, it provides them with a start.  They attend the talks, the open mikes and our productions and then they go to the Theatre Royal to see our other productions.  It is about breaking down the exclusivity.</p></speech>

Culture night is a great showcase of what can be done over the course of a night using underutilised venues.  This is creating a model for a certain portion of the evening that we should be aiming for on a more regular basis.  The irony of an event being hosted in the Department of Justice and Equality was not lost on us.  We need all types of other spaces that one would not expect to see being used in this way opened up on an ongoing basis.  I accept this would require ongoing co-operation between the Government and councils.  We are running out of suitable spaces because the commercial model no longer exists.  In Dublin in particular we are losing all of our key venues, with many of them now converted into hotels.</p></speech>

Over the years, there has been a great deal of collaboration between the late night scene and theatres.  At one point, they were both operating on the same licence.  In 2008, former Minister, Dermot Ahern, imposed further restrictions on the use of theatre licences such that they are now only operable up to 1 a.m., which does not serve the needs of late night venues.  I believe a small modification would bring it back to where it was.  As a short-term fix, consideration could be given to that, perhaps under a new name, and with a wider ability to change for different type of venues.</p></speech>

When the move to allow them to remain open until midnight or 12.30 a.m. there was no corresponding shift for any other licence, which might have addressed some of the problems.  The distinction between both disappeared or became blurred.  There was, at least, a recognition of a venue licence by a theatre licence.  I have seen, in this city in particular, venues disappear.  Most of this is related not to the venues not being viable but to property values.  More and more of them are being squeezed out.  In my own area, old cinemas and halls have been replaced with hotels.  There is no space even within those hotels for what would have been a disco venue in the past, albeit the disco finished at 2 a.m. and everyone was turfed out on the roads at the same time.  This issue has never been fully addressed.  I agree with the witnesses that in other European cities, the closing time of pubs and venues is staggered.  Venues are allocated a set number of hours during which they may be open or in some cases, there are no set hours, in that a venue can remain open for as long as is viable.  We have never addressed that issue here.</p> <p>  Some of my questions may have been already addressed.  If we move towards a more enlightened examination of how we regulate venues, will it be a 24-hour licence?  In the next session, we will meet representatives from Dublin City Council representations.  Over the past three decades, the council has encouraged the repopulation of the city centre.  This has resulted in the establishment of venues in conflict with residents.  I agree with the witnesses' remarks regarding the challenge of insurance.  This challenge is present not only in relation to venues but in every walk of life.  Businesses, small shops or venues of the types mentioned are being squeezed out of existence because of rip-off insurance costs in this country.  Is there opposition from the Licensed Vintners Association to a shift in terms of the licensing of venues, be that theatre or other venues? Vintners are experiencing their own struggles in respect of their equilibrium.  Do they see this another challenge to them?  </p> <p>  I congratulate the witnesses on their vision.  I have three brothers who are musicians.  They regularly complain to me about licensing laws in venues and about not being able to continue when everybody is in a good space.  This is not about people being able to drink more alcohol.  Often, people are enjoying themselves when suddenly the lights come on and everybody is told to leave, killing the atmosphere that has been created, whether by music or dance.  This can create tensions, which then spill out onto the street.</p></speech>

I would see this more as an opportunity for them.  Their industry has been shrinking over the years but I would like to think that it will stabilise and we will not see the end of the Irish pub.  Nobody wants to see that happen.  At the same time, they need to modernise.  One great advantage they have is that they are still sitting on spaces that are at a premium.  If they have the vision, they can better utilise their spaces.  It is entirely up to them.  As I said, I cannot speak on their behalf.<br/><br/>I have met one of Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's brothers.  We used to stock his CD, <i>T&oacute;g &Eacute; go Bog &Eacute;.</i>It was a bestseller.  <br/><br/>In terms of musicians, we are based in the late night industry.  I am also an educator.  I teach in the Bray Institute of Further Education, where I teach many upcoming musicians and DJs.  In the last five years, they have had no outlet for their music.  They are being told, a lot of the time by pub owners who are the ones who have function rooms and space, that it is prohibitively expensive to hold music events.  In addition, people who want to hold a small party or an event for their friends must place an expensive charge on the door and if they do not get adequate numbers of people in, that is their dream finished.  We need to keep the focus on young people.  It is easy for politicians to focus on their constituents if they are pub owners or nightclub owners and to forget about it when they get a bit older and no longer have an issue arising.  This is also about young people and our creative communities.  We have to hold them highly in all of this.<br/><br/>On the 24-hour licence, the only place that I could see that working right now would be in Dublin.  Twenty-four hour licensing is like having a blank canvass.  It does not mean that everywhere will remain open for 24 hours.  We can provide the committee with greater plans in terms of our mixed venue licence idea.</p><p>It would be close to a 24-hour model but that does not mean 24-hour licensing for alcohol.</p></speech>

If there is no reason for a venue to open, it will not open its doors.  Demand will vary from city to town and around the country.  It is the idea that we have a one-size-fits-all system at the moment is the issue.  Mr. James Finan and Ms Ciara O&rsquo;Connell can talk about restricted closing hours outside of Dublin where in some cases it is restricted to 1.30 a.m. and 2 a.m.  We are talking about having some flexibility within the system which can allow businesses to make their own decisions with regard to those options.</p></speech>

We are not at a crisis point but we are fast heading towards it.  It is time to take the reins and take control of it.</p> <p>  We are not looking for a fast fix.  We know there is no fast fix around changing legislation.  What we are looking for is the start of change.  We are looking at the offerings across the board from the small 50-seat venues like mine to the much larger scale venues.  There is room for everyone.  In contemporary Ireland, we should have a space for everyone where we can thrive and do business.</p></speech>

We can recognise this in every city and town.  In Cork, there were well-known venues which closed over the years.  There was a long tradition in Cork of electronic and house music at venues such as Sir Henry's.  More recently, venues such as The Pav have closed down.  At this stage of my life, I am more nights in than nights out.  A few years ago, one could see serious restrictions in choice and it was getting more restrictive.  That is an issue which concerns and frustrates many people.  There might be more flexibility in Dublin.  However, in Cork one could see the impact of everybody coming out on to the streets at the same time with going to the same takeaways, public order issues and taxis.  The taxi drivers themselves would have said that they were reliant on a brief period and then suddenly it was over.  That does not suit anybody.</p> <p>  There is need for change and the arguments have been articulated.  We will have a discussion with the Department of Justice and Equality after this session and with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in a fortnight.  This is relevant to the Department of Justice and Equality from the point of view of licensing.  However, this is also a cultural and an artistic issue.  This is about people's ability to dance, to enjoy music and to perform.  That is a vitally important part of it.  There is a debate in Dublin and across the country about how attractive our cities and towns are as places in which to live.  The ability to enjoy culture is a big element of how attractive our cities and towns are.</p> <p>  Can anyone give an estimate as to how many people are working in this sector?  The witnesses gave data on dance licence applications and special exemption orders.  Both of them have been decreasing quite dramatically.  Will this continue?  Obviously, insurance is an element of that as well as licensing.  Are there other factors involved?</p> <p>  I was interested to note that Central Arts Waterford stated that Waterford City and County Council has been quite supportive.  There is a role for local authorities in this.  I would hazard a guess that not every local authority is as supportive.  What did Waterford City and County Council do right in this regard?  Aside from the point about licensing committees, what can local authorities do?  There is a proposal around a night mayor, for example.</p> <p>  Should there be three new additional forms or a single one for licensing?  Are specific forms of licences required?</p></speech>

The reason clubs and pubs went for that was that it meant they could stay open later and serve alcohol late.  The underlying reason one gets a theatre licence is because one is providing performance and entertainment, performance being the main one.  Committees or individuals appointed to grant these licences should see the venue is actually undertaking its responsibilities by providing entertainment.  The theatre licence was abused by many venues to just serve alcohol until late.  There would have to be more rigid control of that if it was reintroduced for late-night venues.  This is why it needs more personnel working on it.  One judge and a garda cannot keep on top of all this.  That is another reason we need more people working on this.</p> <p>  We have already seen the example of a multi-use space.  Central Arts Waterford is an example of it.  On another level, Bodytonic, even before The Bernard Shaw, created the prototype with the Twisted Pepper.  It is now working on a larger scale with Jam Park, along with District 8, the event promoter.  They are putting on all types of daytime, evening-time and night-time events.  Again, they are restricted and they need a separate type of licence under which they can operate.  Otherwise, they could close as well.</p> <p>  Councils need to protect our spaces as well.  The Tivoli Theatre was bulldozed.  It was an important cultural space in Dublin for many communities and generations.  It was thriving but it was knocked down.  The amount of potential that place had was incredible.  We talk much about artist studios.  Upstairs in the Tivoli there was much space.  Somebody with a bit of vision could have done something to it.  I understand the owner&rsquo;s reasons for wanting to sell and I know councils are short of money and cannot necessarily throw it away on venues.  Maybe we need to think about this before we allow these places to be bulldozed as easily as they are.</p></speech>

At our venue, we employ 113 people, most of whom are part-time workers and students.  I got into the industry via a part-time job.  It gives opportunities to many people who, unfortunately, need to work while studying.  It provides convenient, non-full-time hours for them to sustain the high cost of accommodation associated with going to college.  Four or five venues in Galway have closed since I was in college, and the opportunities for part-time jobs they provided are no more.</p></speech>

We do a summer-long festival called Summer in the City, which Waterford City and County Council provides the funding for, where we employ up to 80 people every weekend.  It is an arts and music festival that we have tried to grow slowly over the years.  Sometimes, things can start but be gone within a year if they are not successful.  We need to consider a more sustainable approach to the arts and culture that gives them the opportunity to grow and thrive.</p> <p>  Our council has been wonderful to us.  We rent our property privately at &euro;15,000 per year and get &euro;10,000 in funding from the council, but that is the only funding that Central Arts gets.  We have not been able to access any funding from the Arts Council despite trying numerous times.  There is a commonly held belief that Arts Council funding does not trickle down past the capital and, if it does, it is to much more established venues.  For young venues like ours, which has only been going for six years, it is like hitting a brick wall.  We might be told to prove ourselves, but even if one proves oneself time and again, it is difficult to get national funding.</p> <p>  Our local arts officers and arts officers nationally have been meeting over the issue of insurance.  Festivals are finding it more difficult to get insurance.  The festival culture is starting to die off.  It is in a tenuous position.  We are at risk of losing some of our smaller cultural hubs and offerings.  If we do not protect them, they will be gone.</p></speech>

T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm a bheith anseo chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  Like any city official I have two roles, one is developmental, the other statutory.  While we want to encourage everything that people want to do in the city, culturally, artistically and economically, we have to be guided by our statutory responsibilities and that tension will recur in the presentation.  The Minister of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, convened a workshop of stakeholders to examine the area of the night-time economy.  Representatives of the arts office and economic development sections represented Dublin City Council.  We have stayed in touch with the relevant Government officials on this matter.</p> <p>  As the first impressive presentations mentioned, the night-time economy refers to social, cultural and economic activity occurring between specified night-time hours.  For example, in London this is between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m., the broadest definition of any city we have studied so far.  We need to start by understanding Dublin's economy at night and replacing myths and perceptions of night time in the city.  A tremendous amount of the things we have to deal with on the council are anecdotal rather than evidence-based and that is probably the theme of what we will say today.  We want to replace those anecdotal perceptions with evidence of how Dubliners and visitors use the city at night.  This would highlight the opportunities and indeed the threats or pitfalls involved in further developing a night-time economy.  However, at present there is little in the way of research or information on Dublin in this area.  What we can do is look to the experience of other cities, and in particular London where the Independent Night Time Commission has carried out extensive research, for some insights.</p> <p>  The Mayor of London appointed the independent Night Time Commission, NTC, in October 2017 to provide advice to the Mayor, support their night-time tsar in dealing with London's night-time economy, and ultimately help realise a vision of the city as a 24-hour city.  It has commissioned extensive quantitative and qualitative research to gather a strong evidence base to inform its work.  One of the things it found is that partnership with local authorities, businesses and residents is crucial to creating a successful night-time culture which benefits residents, businesses and visitors.  What is being sought by various stakeholders is an innovation in the work of the city.  This is going to require a balanced navigation by the officials, interagency, national and local, with residents, taxpayers and ratepayers</p> <p>  Research estimates that a third of all workers in London work evenings and nights, including health professionals, emergency services, office workers, technicians and drivers.  This rises to 50% of all workers in the cultural and hospitality sectors.  However, London research found that many of the workers in the night-time economy are low paid.  As of quarter 2 2019, Dublin had a total of 717,000 workers, 56,000 of whom were employed in accommodation and food services activities.  If we were to extrapolate London's experience, and this would be a very rough guide, this implies that about a quarter of a million people work in Dublin between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m., with about 10% of these employed in hospitality.  To establish these numbers for Dublin further research would need to be carried out.</p> <p>  We also know that average hourly wages in the accommodation and food service and the arts and entertainment sectors are lower than the overall average.  Hospitality workers earn around 56% of average hourly earnings while culture workers earn about 80%.  As in London, evidence shows that the existing night-time economy in Dublin is concentrated in the lower-paid sectors.  That is an important social point. </p> <p>  In terms of transport, night tubes, trains and buses, there is very little available in Dublin at that time.  This has been well described in earlier presentations.  There are limited public transport options for those enjoying and-or working in the city at night who are reliant on own transport or taxis.  Little is known about the levels of demand for being active at night in Dublin and indeed, what the barriers are to enjoying a night out in the city.  Are they cost, lack of choice, early closing hours or lack of venue?  Without information on the demand-side dynamics, formulating policy or strategy is hampered.  We are now in the area of formulating policy which is a long and painstaking process.  Getting a very quick fix could produce a lot of unintended consequences, no matter how much good will is involved.  On the supply side, the most documented issues facing venue operators are primarily related to licensing restrictions.  There are many other challenges from a city's point of view, limitations in the transport, safety concerns and night working conditions all require careful consideration by a wide range of stakeholders.</p> <p>  From the arts office point of view, and for me as city arts officer, it would appear that audiences at cultural events ending at 10.30 p.m. and particularly visitors to Dublin have very few options after 11 p.m.  This provides many opportunities for the arts community to extend their activities beyond 11 p.m. that could be beneficial to audiences and businesses alike, subject to economic viability.  In addition, much like during the day, where there are clusters of cultural venues, there could be opportunities for retail.  We might pause and reflect on the relationship between venue availability and night-time culture and day-time culture.  I receive phone calls and emails daily dealing with the absence of cultural venues or the demand for them in Dublin.  Just as the housing crisis took ten years to develop, the cultural venue crisis has taken just as long and probably will take half or just as long to remedy.  This cannot be fixed in a short period.  We will have to build venues and transfer certain unused buildings into cultural use.  We cannot, for example in the case of the Tivoli, interfere with the rights of a private property owner and cut across their ability to sell their venue.  That is a very difficult thing for government to do, given our laws.</p> <p>  A recent Your Dublin Your Voice survey carried out by Dublin City Council found that the George's Street vicinity had risen in popularity to become the second most popular shopping district, albeit during the day, due to its vibrant mixed offering of retail and entertainment.  However, that same survey identified in open questions that the two most important factors when it came to shopping were range and value.  Longer opening hours did not feature either as an influencing factor or as suggested improvement.  Dublin City Council will carry out a further Your Dublin Your Voice survey to gather more information to gauge appetite and interest in the night-time economy</p> <p>  Research from earlier this year, again from London's Night Time Commission, found that making the most of underused spaces with exhibitions, live performance and pop-up markets could boost the high street.  Indeed, we have seen the success of Culture Night, which is part of my office's responsibility but that is an annual programme of free events and so not directly comparable to opening night-time venues.  It must be stressed that this is a new area of policy and expertise where Dublin City Council is in a learning mode.  I recently attended, with my colleague, Mary McSweeney, the world cities culture summit, which was organised by the World Cities Culture Forum, where 38 cities shared learning on all aspects of culture.  There was a long session on the night-time economy.  Several cities, notably London, but particularly Sydney, have been engaged in the development of the night-time economy for several years and they set out the priorities involved and the challenges they faced.  As a first step in informing Dublin City Council, I have written to the cultural agencies I met at the conference seeking papers or research they engaged in.</p> <p>  In recognition of the potential of the night-time economy, the chief executive of Dublin City Council, Owen Keegan, received a request from Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan, to set up a local committee for the consideration of night-time culture in Dublin City by 29 November.  The night-time economy was discussed at length by the city council at a special meeting on 23 September.  Based on London's experience, where an extensive period of research preceded the establishment of a stakeholder group, Dublin City Council decided that it was not possible to set up the committee within the timeframe suggested.  It would be our preference to adopt a similar model commencing with research that should be carried out by relevant sectors and stakeholders in Dublin before setting up a committee. </p></speech>

Planning in Dublin city is informed by the Dublin city development plan for the period 2016 to 2022 which is the statutory framework which guides physical development and land use in a sustainable manner.  The plan contains a core strategy which is to provide for a vibrant mixed use environment in which people can live, work and participate in the cultural life of the city, while minimising the use of carbon based transport.  The plan also emphasises the need for density quality and safe, active streets.  In implementing the plan we work closely with other agencies to enhance walking, cycling and public transport infrastructure to serve the growing city, including the National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland in the case of the Luas lines, for example.</p> <p>  The population of the city between the canals grew from a low of 91,000 in 1996 to 142,000 in 2016 and continues to grow.  We are pushing on with the development of the North Lotts in the docklands and Poolbeg West in the east docklands.  Between them, these areas will add an extra population of 12,000 in the next five years in that part of the city.  The work continues in attracting population into the city, in addition to what Mr. Yeates said about employment in the city, to further a policy of ensuring people can walk and cycle, as a first preference, and use public transport, as a second preference, as close to each other as possible.  Culture is part of that mix.  Paragraph 16.32 of the development plan recognises the importance of Dublin as a thriving and multi-dimensional capital city and the need to facilitate the concept of the 24-hour city, particularly in the city centre and key district centres.  "Key district centres" is planning jargon for urban villages such as Rathmines and Phibsboro.  The plan also states Dublin City Council will encourage entertainment, culture and music uses which help to create an exciting city for residents and tourists alike and are capable of attracting people in key employment sectors, including the high-tech sector.  There is a need, therefore, to strike an appropriate balance between the role of these entertainment uses in the economy of the city and the following aspects: maintaining high quality retail functions on the primary city centre streets and ensuring a balanced mix of uses.  There are vacant units above these shops, as well as in retail areas of the city.  </p> <p>  We have a living city initiative which offers tax incentives to bring people into the city to contribute to the vitality of its street life and make it a safer place and to protect the amenities of residents from an over-concentration of late night venues.  However, we recognise that there are concentrations of such venues on George's Street, Camden Street and Harcourt Street as part of the city.  Noise emanating from and at the boundaries of such establishments are issues that will need to be addressed in planning applications. There are measures to deal with issues such as noise insulation and reduction measures and, possibly, staggering the closing times of clubs.  They all require to be considered within any planning application process.  Currently, the development plan discourages superpubs to encourage smaller venues and pubs in the city.  The concentration of superpubs will be restricted in certain areas of the city where there is a danger of over-concentration to the detriment of other uses.</p> <p>  The successful development of a night-time economy and cultural life requires a multi-faceted approach from the top down and the bottom up which will build on the character of Dublin.  We do not necessarily want to replicate what is in place in other capital cities.  As such, it cannot only be about relaxing drinking licensing hours, it must include other aspects such as appropriate night-time governance, a safe, active and tolerant public realm, a vibrant mix of residential and cultural uses, together with good public transport for all citizens, including night-time workers.</p> <p>  The city council will start a review of the city development plan in mid-2020.  As part of the review, there will be an extensive consultation process which will include consultation on the night-time economy.</p></speech>

From that perspective, the statutory provisions providing for the sale, supply and consumption of intoxicating liquor in licensed premises are set out in the Licensing Acts, 1833 to 2018.  This body of legislation specifies the opening and closing hours of licensed premises.  There are no specific provisions in the Acts for the operation of nightclubs, late bars and other late-night entertainment outlets.  This means, for example, that in the absence of a specific nightclub licence or permit, nightclubs and late bars operate on the basis of the special exemption order mechanism referenced earlier in the meeting which allows, subject to conditions, for longer hours for licensed premises with on-licences, for example, a public house licence or hotel licence.</p> <p>  With regard to special exemption orders, section 5 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1927, as amended in several subsequent intoxicating liquor Acts, defines "special exemption order" as an order of the District Court exempting the holder of an on-licence from general licensing hour restrictions on special occasions.  These occasions include dances held in a ballroom which is licensed under the Public Dance Halls Acts, 1935 to 2003, and forms part of the licensed premises, in respect of which the special exemption order is being sought.  The applicant for a special exemption order must serve on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, not less than 48 hours before making the application, a notice of intention to apply for the order, setting out the applicant's name and address and the special occasion, the premises and the extended hours, in respect of which the order is being sought.</p> <p>  The District Court may make a special exemption order if it thinks fit to do so, having heard the officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for the licensing area concerned and having taken account of other relevant conditions.  The court fee for each application for a special exemption order is &euro;300, as prescribed in the District Court (Fees) Order.  An excise duty of &euro;110 per application is also payable to the Revenue Commissioners.  In 2018 approximately 42,000 licensing applications were made to the District Court, of which over 80% were applications for special exemption orders.  The revenues obtained are used to defray the cost of operating the system and contribute to the funding of Garda policing activity associated with the prevention of public disorder and related anti-social activity following late-night events.</p> <p>  Under current law, a special exemption order expires on any Monday that is not a public holiday at 1 a.m. or, in any other case, 2.30 a.m., unless the District Court, for stated reasons, including any reason related to the need to maintain public order, considers it expedient to grant the order for a shorter period.  Drinking up time of 30 minutes is permitted on expiry of the special exemption order at 2.30 a.m., or at an earlier time if the District Court has exercised its discretion, but no dancing or entertainment is permitted during this further 30-minute period. </p> <p>  The granting of discretion to the District Court in respect of the expiry time of special exemption orders is a necessary safeguard that allows the court to take account of any Garda objection arising from previous instances of disorder or disturbances in or at the premises concerned.  It also allows the court to take due account of any objection from local residents arising from instances of undue inconvenience or nuisance such as noise or car parking on private property in the area.  The task of the court in such cases is to seek to balance the respective rights of all of the concerned parties.  The expiry times for special exemption orders were last adjusted in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000.  Many of the reforms enacted at the time were based on recommendations which had been made by a sub-committee of the then Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Women&rsquo;s Rights in its report entitled, A Review of Liquor Licensing.</p><p>On the shorter duration of special exemption orders for Sunday night-Monday morning, the subcommittee recommended that there should be no change to the existing law, that is Sunday night special exemptions orders should expire at 1 a.m. on Monday mornings.  That remains the current position in law. </p><p> The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 introduced a new provision that confers a role on local authorities concerning the expiry time of special exemption orders.  It provides that a local authority may, following consultations with the Garda and other relevant persons, adopt a resolution concerning earlier expiry times for special exemption orders within the whole or a specified part of its administrative area.  The District Court is required to have regard to any such resolution before making a special exemption order for any premises within the area concerned.  A resolution to extend expiry times beyond the statutory limits is not permitted.  While this provision was intended primarily to empower local authorities to take account of the concerns of local residents in areas that might be adversely affected by inconvenience or nuisance, or increased risks to public order, the extent to which local authorities have used it is unknown to the Department. </p><p> Further statutory changes were introduced in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 in order to improve safety and security standards.  In response to public concerns, this Act introduced a requirement for a closed circuit television system in certain cases,  and a requirement that persons providing a security service as a door supervisor be the holder of a current licence issued by the private security authority under the Private Security Services Act 2004.  The District Court must also be satisfied that the premises concerned complies with fire safety standards under the Building Control Act 1990. </p><p> As regards any future reforms, including any changes that this joint committee may consider desirable in the context of protecting and promoting vibrant nightlife, economy and culture, the Minister for Justice and Equality has outlined his views on such a possibility in response to a number of parliamentary questions on the subject earlier this year.  While stating that he is, in principle, in favour of enhancements to current arrangements, he does not have immediate plans to amend the law in this area.  Indeed, any such changes to the law would require proper consultation with relevant stakeholders, including representative bodies, groups representing local residents, the local authorities and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p><p> The Minister said that he is mindful that any change would need to be organised and managed in a manner that will not cause undue inconvenience or nuisance to local residents nor create an undue risk to public order.  Moreover, any proposed changes would also need to have regard to the preservation of a fair competitive environment for competing businesses. </p></speech>

I have worked with him in the past and know him to be an excellent purveyor of the arts.  Was he frustrated in having to wear one hat here when his passion is under another hat?  Did the situation frustrate him greatly?  I got the impression that he was massively frustrated from what he said because he wanted things to move on but was caught in a thousand different ways.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. Yeates to outline for me three threats and three pitfalls as I did not find out what they were from the generalised comments.  </p> <p>  Is anybody who has a partnership with a local authority doing just what our previous speakers would like to be seen done in a village or town?  Is there any local authority that has surpassed itself? </p> <p>  Why is the research not ongoing now?  Why are we waiting to think about the research?  Are we thinking about it?  I know there was some in 2008.  Is there anything that is ongoing now?  Where is the result?  When can we expect the result?  When I hear the phrase "we have a policy and research" I know there is an impasse and nothing is going to happen.  Why have we not found out more readily before now?  We have kicked this matter around now for a good few years, and kicked around the whole matter of the inner city and the development of the city.  </p> <p>  I understand what was said about the Tivoli Theatre.  I mean if somebody who owns the theatre and the land wants to sell it we cannot come in and say, "look at me, I am dancing".  Where was the county council with its money?  The millennium clock cost &euro;870,000, I think.  The clock was supposed to count us down to the year 2000 but it sank in the River Liffey.  Was there no funding to enable the county council to have a conversation about preserving the Tivoli?  We should have learned a lesson from the Metropole Cinema, which became British Home Stores displaying brassieres and knickers in its windows.  </p> <p>  Can Mr. Yeates explain what was meant by the following?  He said that Mr. Keegan was told by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Josepha Madigan - well done, Minister -  to set up a local committee for the consideration of night time culture in Dublin city by 29 November but Dublin City Council decided, due to a lack of research or however it decided, that it was not possible to set up the committee within the timeframe suggested.  I no more believe that than I believe I am going to paint this room.  I ask Mr. Yeates to talk to me about the matter.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. O'Hara, city planner for Dublin City Council, for his attendance.  One of the issues that he discussed was the discouragement of superpubs.  About an hour ago I talked about Wetherspoons that has taken over a big quarter here in Dublin.  We seem to be contradicting what he talked about in planning.  I do not know how Wetherspoons got planning since we are against superpubs and I am sure it is the biggest, super duper pub one can find.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Hara said that the Dublin City Council was in learning mode.  We are beyond that and must have talent.  If the people on Dublin City Council do not have the talent then they should not be there.  For some of the people I met earlier, it might do them justice to stand because they seem to have far more talent than what is on the city council if it is in learning mode.  </p> <p>  Mr. O'Hara also said that we do not want to replicate other capital cities.  Will he outline the capital cities that we do not want to replicate?  What is it about them that we do not like?  Does he have a capital city in mind that we do want to replicate?  I have a few suggestions.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Colville for being here.  I know she had to go through all of the legality that certainly sent me to sleep but I understand that she had to do so.  I wish to refer to the last two paragraphs where she said that the Minister for Justice and Equality is open to consultation.  Being open to consultation and having a consultation are two different things.  The phrase "he does not have immediate plans to amend the law" worries me greatly.  Were the five or six earlier speakers wasting their time?  I need a serious answer because we may be wasting our time trying to change legislation, which is the way to go to get them out of the milieu that solidifies them into licensing laws and insurance laws that they have nothing to do with.  I ask Ms Colville to address that matter and maybe leave us with something positive that the earlier speakers might be able to work around and take up.</p></speech>

I reciprocate my admiration for her and her efforts in the area of culture over the years.</p> <p>  The Senator's question was slightly personal.  She asked if I am frustrated by my position here.  Not at all.  Working as a city official means one works in reality and not aspiration.  The area of cultural venues, for example, have been very successful.  Let me say to these people that they are not wasting their time at all because the lobby group for the visual arts around artist work spaces has been particularly successful.  It has lobbied at every opportunity and has elected members speaking for it.  It has spoken a lot in the community of public participation network, PPN.  Its representatives come into my office quite a lot and developed partnership.  We have started feasibility studies under the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, for two sites in Dublin 8 and are looking at two major buildings to bring into cultural use.</p><p>It is hard, not frustrating, because reality is hard.  We can say we want something.  However, desire means ones does not have it.  How does one get it?  It is the practical aspect in which city officials are involved.  It is actually doing it, not just talking about it.  I am not frustrated because I am in the place, along with planners and economic development planners, where we can work to produce results.  That is not frustrating at all.</p><p> As regards three threats and three pitfalls, there will be objections to every innovation.  By definition, as soon one makes a proposition of something new, one could have residents object to a cultural venue or a lack of balance in the market.  We have to deal with those objections.  These are not objections with which the proposers will have to deal.  We will have to give proper answers, do them under the law and answer solicitors&rsquo; letters.  It is not that we are not positive about increasing or enhancing cultural life.  The question is how we do it, not why we do it.  Those are the big pitfalls.</p><p> Gaining the partnership of the officials involved is important.  Rather than all of us hanging around, doing nothing only trying to obstruct, it is quite the opposite.  As regards partnership with local authorities, the whole idea of boosting the night-time economy is not big on my radar.  Lack of cultural venues and artists&rsquo; workspaces is at the centre of my radar.  I work on that every day.  How to develop the night-time economy has been brought forward successfully by the lobby.  Now it is time to respond to that as all local authorities must.</p><p> Why are we not doing the research now?  It is because we were not doing it before.  It is only now that we are getting into the idea of doing this.  Speaking from my office&rsquo;s point of view, we were not moving in the area of the night-time economy.  When I was younger, shows would begin in the Peacock Theatre 11:15 p.m.  They fell out of use, however.  It was not just because of licensing but because of transport, demand and other issues.  I would love to see cultural venues open and working but only if it works for everybody.  If it does not, it will be opposed.</p><p> The Tivoli Theatre was interesting and I produced many shows there in previous careers.  Nobody is talking about the venues which opened as well.  There are venues such as the Complex Arts Centre and Smock Alley.</p></speech>

I am just saying there is some good news and not just bad news.</p> <p>  Regarding the Dublin City Council chief executive wanting to set up the committee for the consideration of night-time culture, we could set up a committee in which we just talk to each other.  However, we would still have to commission research.  That is the reasonable position that we are trying to take up.  It is not to block this.  If we have good data, we can actually get people like the planning department to pay attention.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.953" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Hara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22019111300002#O00400"><p>With regard to super pubs, I do not want to mention any particular pub.  Our primary philosophy is to encourage mixed-use in the city.  When we receive a planning application for a public house, such as the one referred to by the Senator, we look at the restoration of the street, the upper floors and protected structures in the area.  Several of those boxes are ticked with regard to that.  In the overall balance, we must consider that, on some occasions, a large pub, as a part of the overall mix of improving an area, is acceptable.</p> <p>  The development plan does not state large pubs are refused in every case.  They are refused where there is an overconcentration to the extent that they are deleterious to the area.  That has to be taken into consideration as well.</p> <p>  With regard to city council and learning mode, we are in learning mode all the time.  It would be bold and brash of us to say we know the answer to everything.  We have looked at places like Sydney, London, Lisbon and other European cities.  We are beginning to collect the evidence at their experiences, good and bad.  In my reading of the experience of London, that has been a two-year project of learning.  As Mr. Ray Yeates  said, it would be wrong to jump to an instant solution, particularly when we have heard good points that merit investigation and discussion.</p> <p>  On the third point about why we do not replicate other capital cities, the point I was making is that Dublin has a unique character.  We do not want to become, as far as possible, a globalised type of city with the same product such as coffee shops.</p></speech>

We have a certain character and culture.  While we are willing to learn from other cities, it is not to replicate them.  That was the point I was making.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.956" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Martina Colville" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22019111300002#O00700"><p>I understand that the term &ldquo;no immediate plans&rdquo; suggests we are not willing.  That is certainly not the case.  The Minister would not be keen to change the licensing laws unless it was in a structured and managed approach.  Rather than tweaking the existing laws, as was said by earlier speakers, the Minister would be open to a structured approach, through consultation, to changing the licensing laws that could cover some of the aspects raised today.  The consultation piece, however, where one could get the views of the multiple interests and stakeholders would be important.  There is a range of interests across the area.  The wonderful thing about diversity of culture also means that there are many different approaches and different ways of looking at it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.957" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1427" speakername="Marie Louise O'Donnell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22019111300002#O00800"><p>I worked in the arts most of my life.  I am not outside reality, neither do I think the arts are outside reality.  If one went to &ldquo;Death of a Salesman&rdquo; one would know where reality is and where we have got it wrong.  I am urgent about it because one has a start with a passion and urgency.  I know Mr. Ray Yeates has both.  My question to him was whether he is trying to walk both those lines.  I understand that but maybe my passion would come first.</p> <p>  I think this is somewhat vacuous.  I am not a great believer in thousands of committees because it is an excuse for not getting things done.  However, there is a moment of communication about it with stakeholders, young people and young vibrant communities.  These are urgent.  I am not saying Mr. Ray Yeates is not doing that individually.  There would be a moment where even a sub-committee of three or four people could act as a conduit.  The fact that they just did not do it is not good enough.</p> <p>  Maybe it was phrased incorrectly but Mr. John O&rsquo;Hara said there are certain things in cities he does not want to replicate.  He is right about that.  We want to bring our uniqueness to the fore.  There is no comparison between London and Dublin.  We are 1.4 million people, for example.  However, we have homogenised the worst of American culture, as well as the worst of awfulness from other buildings, and have not preserved as well as we should.  Maybe we are learning now but we have not in the past.  We have been disappointing in our main streets and thoroughfares.  I have done much research on this for radio and TV, so I know what I am talking about.  We have also done it in our towns and villages.  I am not suggesting it is happening just in Dublin.</p> <p>  We are aghast sometimes when we have preserved something well.  We do much right but we are not here to praise ourselves but to find better ways forward.  We could be more definite in our moments of Joyce and I do not mean that particular building which has been in the news recently.  I mean it in preserving a sense of ourselves.  We are quick to come with the hammer and we do not even paint our towns.  I understand Mr. John O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s point generally.</p><p>If one is in Barcelona and certain other cities, things are magnificently preserved compared to the greatness we have that we do not.  I will not get into cycle lanes.  I thank Mr. Yeates and the assistant secretary.  I will keep him to his word.</p></speech>

I will take stakeholders' emails before I leave today, contact them and work within the council along with everybody to learn more.  There is nothing wrong with us meeting.  I assure the Senator that their voices will be heard.</p></speech>

It would be welcome, were the Department of Justice and Equality to make that commitment too, if possible.  I understand that if I bring forward a proposal, it will have various sometimes unintended consequences.  I am concerned about something Mr. Yeates just said about having to deal with it.  I hope that is not to suggest that the people who promote and organise nights, events and the creativity of our city do not take those into account as well.  Ms Colville has gone through a whole host of requirements that someone has to go through to organise a night event, taking into account residents' concerns and paying the fee for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to police the city that night.  It must be the first time I have ever seen ring-fenced funding in this regard in Ireland.  I hope it was not to suggest that others do not have to deal with those issues too.</p> <p>  I was a bit concerned about what Ms Colville said from the outset to the effect that the arts are not her remit.  We hear time and again that Creative Ireland is an whole-of-government initiative.  Has Ms Colville or has the Department met Creative Ireland in respect of licensing laws?  The Department has a remit over something crucial to the culture of this island.  It is important that we acknowledge the Department's impact on the arts.</p></speech>

I think there is a lot of opportunity here.  That is why I would be careful about how we go about it.  If there is great potential for something, we must be careful about how it is set up.  As somebody who has run many events and whose background is in venue management, I was not at all saying that people who run events and venues do not have to deal with all of these objections and difficulties.  I was talking about the area of policy formulation.  The first thing one has to deal with is many clich&eacute;d responses about alcohol, public order and other matters that people spoke about.  We are still in the early days in the development of this policy.  There is much socialisation to be done with people outside of the culture area.  Most of my job involves talking about the arts with people outside the arts.  People feel it is quite exclusive and that they do not get access to the arts.  It takes a while to socialise an idea such as opening up the city until 3 a.m. or 6 a.m.  It will take quite a lot of time and understanding on the part of all the stakeholders.  That is what I was talking about.  The council would be quite involved in dealing with that communication.</p></speech>

It is always a matter of hotels versus clubs.  I do not know all the clubs around Dublin.  One club I used to go to in the past, near Dame Street, has closed and will open as a hotel.  Does Dublin City Council know how many clubs, which essentially are entertainment art spaces, have closed and been turned into hotels?</p></speech>

In the past three years, we have granted permission for 30 to 32 new hotels in the city.  Of those hotels, the majority are on brownfield sites or sites that have been vacant for a generation or more.  An aparthotel is planned for the Tivoli Theatre site.  Andrews Lane Theatre is closed and I think a hotel is proposed for that site.  The vast majority of the 30 or 32 hotels have been on brownfield sites.  Hotels bring in visitors to the city.  Each hotel of 200 beds generates nearly 100 jobs.  The hotel fills brownfield and vacant land in the city, brings jobs to the city and brings visitors to the city.  I am sure that after those visitors go to the sights during the day and have a meal or go to the theatre, they want to experience night time as well.  We would fully support a night-time economy that creates that virtuous circle of bringing more visitors to the city to experience it, while using the hotels.  It is not a matter of hotels being bad and culture being good.  As I said in my presentation, at all times, we pursue a mixed-use philosophy for the city but what we have to try to explore all the time is how that mix of uses interrelates to the mutual benefit of one another.  Hotels and cultural life are a part of that.</p></speech>

We have 32 new hotels in Dublin.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland reckons that Dublin is the gateway to Ireland.  Are those 32 hotels targeting the tourist market?  Are they visitors who will stay for a long time?  Are they visitors who will leave Dublin?  Are they businesspeople on short-term visits?  Will they really visit the city and contribute towards the culture?</p></speech>

I know F&aacute;ilte Ireland has done research into the type of visitors that the hotels bring to the city.  We can certainly find that information for the Senator.  In a broad response, my feeling is that the hotels attract a huge variety of people.  Our civic offices are just across from one and, anecdotally, we can see the range of tourists in the street, including American retired tourists and young German tourists.  There is a great variety of tourists in the city with regard to age group, social class and their search for experiences.</p></speech>

It seems a strange business choice that 32 hotels want to open despite the concerns about Brexit.</p><p>Is that because Dublin to London is one of the busiest flight routes in the world?

We could have a committee that did not function very well.  We want the committee to be energetic and we are reticent about rushing into its establishment.

I might revert to Ms Colville on the legislation.</p> <p>  On local authorities, some of my questions might be a bit dry.  I will direct them to Mr. O'Hara.  Two of the three members present were members of local authorities and, at least, have minor experience of planning, zoning and so on.  The development plan falls within the hierarchy of the national planning framework, regional plans and the city development plan.  Leaving aside the night time economy, does the broader issue of cultural space feature in the regional planning framework under which Dublin City Council falls?  Is that something the council must consider?</p> <p>  What is the general zoning for cultural spaces and night time venues?  Are they zoned commercial or retail?  Do we need to consider additional types of zoning such the city is broken down into local areas or wards, for example, whereby one can get a sense of which areas are well catered for, which have scope to grow and which could form cultural spaces?  My first question relates to the existing zoning for cultural spaces and night time venues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.987" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Hara" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22019111300002#Q01500"><p>The vast majority of night life activities in the city fall under Z5 zoning, which is a city centre zoning.  The city centre zone is to promote a mix of uses with quality architecture, public domain and civic uses.  It is the highest tier of mixed-use zoning.  Pubs and nightclubs are permissible uses within it.  There is no objection in principle to pubs, night time cultural activities or nightclubs within the Z5 city centre zoning.  The concern arises on the detail of a planning application with regard to the specific location on a street, nearby residential amenities, the type of street and the proximity of similar uses.  That is not to say that such activities or premises would be pepper potted around the city.  As I stated, there are areas such as George's Street where the concentration is acceptable to us because of the synergies there.</p></speech>

The local zoning seems flexible, which is positive.  However, does it restrict the ability of council planners to identify gaps in the provision of cultural space, for example?  Does it restrict their ability to identify that the south west of the city is well catered for but the north east is not?</p></speech>

We are working on local strategic development plans underneath the development plan.  For example, there is a strategic development zone plan for the docklands and Poolbeg west.  Through the public consultation process and together with Mr. Yeates's section, local councillors and local residents, we identified the need for 20 cultural spaces in the Poolbeg area, which are to be provided as part of the roll-out of that new residential neighbourhood of 3,500 homes.  It is identified at local plan level underneath the development plan.</p></speech>

It can be difficult to get a case heard.  If one wishes to obtain a special exemption order, one must go to court on multiple occasions.  One must also renew one's standing licence annually.</p><p>Perhaps the Department of Justice and Equality might return to this issue.  There was a proposal from Give Us The Night that involved a possible role for local authorities not in respect of the recurring standing licence but in respect of special exemption orders, extensions and late night openings.  I know that the point was made by the Department that there was a role for the courts in seeking feedback on noise levels and anti-social behaviour, which is fair enough.  We must take all of those factors into account in the considering the many uses of buildings, but are the local authorities not well placed to undertake that role?  Do the delegates think there is merit in the proposal that the local authorities have a role in that regard.  Will the officials from the Department also answer that question?  Is there some role for the local authorities to play, with possibly a licensing committee?</p></speech>

Again, we must drill down into the Irish experience to see how it would work.  From our perspective, there is a slight difference in the licensing requirements which involve An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, etc.  Our concerns about night-time activity arise in that context.  They centre primarily on residential amenity.  I am willing to explore areas in which there commonality and an overlap to reduce bureaucracy.  The Department may have a different view, but we are willing to explore that issue with it.</p></speech>

However, there was a consultation process with the community in which people expressed various views on buskers, some of which were very positive, while some were very negative.  The idea of a one-stop-shop is always a good one, but, again, I know how the local authority participates in court in giving a view, for example, on singing licences.  The local authority officer gives a view, as does An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Anything that would speed up the licensing process for anybody and decrease the level of bureaucracy is to be welcomed.  The question concerns how it would work and whether it would fulfill the requirements of the law.  That would require a great technical study to make sure the process would move swiftly.  Of course, in principle, I would be in favour of it.</p></speech>

I do not want to give a glib or easy answer because it is quite complex, but I will be happy to discuss it with the local authorities.  To be fair to earlier delegates, it was something they had suggested in the context of a licensing board and the local authorities, but we would need to be able to explore it.  The Courts Service would be delighted if somebody took pressure off the District Courts, but that would mean somebody else taking the pressure of the District Courts; therefore, we need to take an holistic approach.  That is not to try to back up the issue into the next century.  That is the reality, but we would certainly have to look at it in the context of other authorities to see what would be feasible, reasonable and effective.</p></speech>

However, there is concern about the vibrancy of night life not only in Dublin but across the State.  There is a feeling venues are closing and that after a certain hour, not much goes on in the city, that the offering is limited and that there is a lack of choice.  It is fair to say there is a sentiment that it has made Dublin less attractive.  Is Mr. Yeates aware of that concern and, if so, does he share it or any element of it?  Does he have any response?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.1031" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ray Yeates" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG22019111300002#R03300"><p>In doing so I might stray into the political arena, not just the official arena.  I would, therefore, very definitely make a demarcation line.  It is not simply a matter of venues.  We are talking about the role and importance of the artist in the city.  Traditionally, we have prided ourselves on being very welcoming.  Our international reputation is based on our Nobel Prize winners, etc.  When I was in New York last week, I met two people, one of whom had run the Seventh Avenue Playhouse, while the other had run the Perry Street Theatre, both of which had been closed owing to the excessive rents charged.  This is not a new phenomenon worldwide.  The absence of off-Broadway venues is significant for anybody who wants to put on a show in a venue with 100 to 190 seats.  There is a value split because a culturally vibrant city will have great long-term and short-term economic value.  These are values society must debate.  It is not for a Dublin City Council official to set out what the right way is.</p><p>People need housing.  If one is discussing cultural venues, one is talking about people who are, perhaps, providing sites for housing.  Everything has to be balanced and debated.  There are no simple easy answers to what are complex questions.</p><p> With no offence to anybody, but the arts are thriving in Dublin.  I was not asked for many meetings on the whole idea of extended hours until recently.  That is not an anecdote but a fact.  It needs to be built patiently.  I accept that people were running venues for 20 to 30 years.</p></speech>

One should be careful what one wishes for.</p></speech>

I would go to 20 meetings and engage fully.  I would work it through the system.  I understand how it works.  It is naive to think that in some way or other one can have this amazing quick win.  Slowly but surely is how one builds something of long-term value.  I would be concerned about having short-term wins which would have unintended consequences which one would then have to unravel at some other time.  One must work patiently, well and in partnership.  It is also time for us to talk about the fact that artists cannot afford housing and are fleeing Dublin city.  We cannot choose them as a grouping.  Why would we not choose nurses or security workers?  How would they build co-ops to provide housing?  How do we work in completely different ways?  We also have to debate within the system what will happen in the short, medium and long term.  That is what we do with my colleagues involved in planning.  As Mr. O&rsquo;Hara pointed out, new artist workspaces are embedded in every new city development.  It was a three-year piece of work, but it will be a three to five-year piece of work that will yield the results people will want to see.</p></speech>

We will have hearings, on foot of which there will be recommendations.  We have had two sets of hearings today and will have representatives of the the Department before us next week.  The committee, obviously, does not have an executive function.  It is in place to make recommendations and influence local authorities, the Department of Justice and Equality and, in particular, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I hope the report will succeed in doing so, although we are conscious that there are complexities involved in dealing with this issue.  As a public representative, I know that there are instances where, if extended hours were applied in a particular place, people might have something to say about it.  We have to achieve a framework in which this can occur.  Some of it is related to planning and licensing.  Once a framework is created, individual decisions can be made on a local or sectorial basis and so forth.  We have an objective.  It is clear when one steps back from it, that much of the legislation and the structures in place are antiquated and need to be reviewed.</p> <p>  I am grateful to the delegates for attending.  It has been a useful session.  I hope it has been productive, added to the conversation and helped to influence policy at national and local level.</p></speech>
