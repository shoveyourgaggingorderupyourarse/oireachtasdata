Is that agreed?  Agreed.We are holding two sessions this morning.  In the first session we will hear from representatives from the Irish Farmers Association and officials from the Department of Health as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the nursing homes support scheme (amendment) Bill 2019.  It is proposing amending legislation intended to change the treatment of family farms and businesses under the nursing home support scheme, also known as the fair deal scheme.</p><p>I welcome from the Department of Health, Mr. Niall Redmond, principal officer, Mr. Karl Duff, assistant principal and Ms Helen Simon, administrative officer.  From the Irish Farmers Association, I welcome the president, Mr. Joe Healy, Ms Caroline Farrell, chair of the farm family and social affairs committee, Mr. Martin Stapleton, chair of the farm business committee and Ms Geraldine O'Sullivan, farm family and social affairs committee executive.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise that any opening statements made to this committee may be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Mr. Redmond to make his opening statement. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Redmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019111300002#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak on this draft legislation.  I am joined by my colleagues Mr. Karl Duff, assistant principal and Ms Helen Simon, administrative officer, from the services for older people unit in the Department of Health.</p> <p>  I hope to provide this hearing with the background to the Government decision to approve and publish the general scheme of the nursing homes support scheme (amendment) Bill 2019, and to briefly outline its main provisions.  The general scheme of the nursing homes support scheme (amendment) Bill 2019 will create an additional legislative framework implementing a policy objective whereby family farms and family businesses will be better safeguarded for future generations.</p> <p>  The nursing homes support scheme, NHSS, was developed in the late 2000s and built on the existing nursing homes subvention scheme.  There was an identified need to regularise payments through legislative underpinning, and to remove financial hardship from many individuals and their families who, under the previous system of subvention, had to sell or re-mortgage homes to pay for the cost of nursing home care.  The nursing homes support scheme has been very successful to date, supporting nearly 100,000 people to avail of nursing home care since its commencement just ten years ago.  The scheme has proven to be robust and fair, reflective perhaps of the legislation having remained largely unchanged since its introduction.</p> <p>  When the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act was developed and commenced in 2009 it was done with the proviso that a review of the scheme would be initiated following its first three years of operation.  This review, published in 2015, examined a wide range of issues.  A public consultation process was initially undertaken to inform the work of the review, with some 61 submissions received from a range of individuals, nursing homes, statutory and private organisations, voluntary bodies and organisations representing the interests of older people, including the Irish FarmersAssociation and Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, among others.  The recommendations received and the themes identified through that consultation informed the review.</p><p>A recommendation arising from the review was that consideration should be given to whether a cap should be applied to the charge for nursing home care based on non-residential productive assets passed on to a direct family member after the death of a NHSS participant, and where the new owner carries on the farm or business as their principal livelihood.  The existing programme for partnership Government committed to introduce these changes to the assessment of family businesses and farms in the context of the financial assessment of means under the scheme. <br/><br/>Farms are traditionally passed down through generations and it is recognised that it is important for rural communities that farms can continue to operate within the family unit and be maintained as sustainable productive assets.  The same may also be said of businesses such as family businesses.  Small farms, in particular, play an important role in supporting rural employment and maintaining the social fabric of rural areas and thus contribute to the objective of balanced territorial development.  In a wider context, the general scheme proposes to help ensure the continued viability of family-run farms and businesses, especially for those for whom early succession planning has not been possible.  The general scheme aims to give effect to the recommendation of the fair deal review and to deliver on the programme for Government commitment in that regard. <br/><br/>It is also important that we are cognisant of the wider situation with regard to ageing in Ireland.  Our population is living longer than ever, and our older population is consistently growing in size.  It is, therefore, important that, in any change to the NHSS, we ensure the longer-term sustainability of the scheme and ensuring continued and timely access for those who need it. <br/><br/>The NHSS is a financial support scheme that provides State support towards the cost of long-term residential care for adults in Ireland, irrespective of age.  The amount of State support provided is dependent on the means of the applicant, where those with least means receive the most support and those who can afford to cover a greater share of the cost of their care, do so.  This helps to ensure the sustainability of the scheme, ensuring that finite resources are targeted at those most in need. <br/><br/>Having regard to that, the stated policy objective of the general scheme is to introduce further safeguards in the NHSS to further protect the viability and sustainability of family farms and businesses that will be passed down to the next generation of the family to continue to work them as productive assets to provide for them their livelihood.  Under existing conditions, applicants or participants to the scheme who experienced a sudden illness or disability that necessitated long-term residential care have their contribution based on their farm or business assets capped at three years in line with the treatment of the principal residence, subject to certain conditions.  This general scheme aims to broaden the application of this three-year cap by removing the requirement to have suffered a sudden illness or disability resulting in the need for care and instead introducing revised criteria.  This amendment will extend the application of the cap to family-run farms and businesses that satisfy the prescribed criteria, thus extending the sense of certainty to all farm and business owners for whom a family successor will succeed the concern. <br/><br/>The general scheme comprises two parts.  Part 1 deals with the normal standard provisions such as interpretation and commencement.  Part 2 includes all other provisions for the amendment.  The criteria required to qualify for the three-year cap on farm or business assets is set out in head 4.This introduces the requirement that the farm or business was actively worked by either the NHSS participant or applicant or a qualifying family successor for a minimum period of three years in the five years prior to nursing home admission and that the farm or business will be actively worked, as per the requirements in the amendment, by a family successor for a period of not less than six years following nomination of the said family successor. <br/><br/>Given the complexity of the scheme, a significant consideration has been given to how to amend existing provisions and introduce new provisions that will satisfy the policy objective in question.  Where possible, we have endeavoured to build on existing provisions.  However, there is need for changes in the operation and administration of the scheme, changes to the obligations on family successors in respect of their undertakings and associated reporting structures, and all other necessary changes to ensure the policy objective is implemented equitably and that existing participants in the scheme are not unnecessarily disadvantaged. <br/><br/>The general scheme provides for robust verification requirements in the continued active working of the farm or business in question, as well as the introduction of obligations on the family successor to comply with the verifications required and other criteria, as set out, such as commitment to continue working the farm or business and engage with the HSE on that matter.  These requirements are included to ensure that the public policy objective is met as intended.  <br/><br/>Heads 6, 7, 10, 12 and 13 set out obligations of both the NHSS participant and their family successor.  It should be noted that a number of these provisions are in operation in the existing Act but their application is being extended to facilitate the three-year cap.  <br/><br/>I draw the committee's attention to head 10, in particular, which is entitled &quot;Special Provisions&quot;.  This head has been included recognising that plans may not always work out as intended.  In this instance, these<i>force majeure </i>style provisions recognise for example, that the family successor may not, through no fault of their own, be able to meet the requirement to work the farm or business for the required six years, and rather than an immediate obligation to repay the relief enjoyed arising from the cap, there is an opportunity to nominate a new family successor who will continue to meet that obligation. <br/><br/>The proposed amendment will also require a change to how elements of the scheme are operated, namely to include processes on the nomination of the successor, to allow for application of a cap on contributions, to calculate the value of said cap, and to set out how the criteria associated with the cap may be satisfied.  <br/><br/>Heads 5, 8, 9, 11, 16, 17, 18 and 20 provide for the necessary changes in operations and powers of the executive, the HSE, in that regard.  <br/><br/>As noted earlier, the existing legislation provides for those who have experienced a sudden illness or disability that requires long-term residential care as a result, as early succession planning may not have been feasible in such instances.  Participants who have entered the scheme under this provision will not be required to adhere to the new conditions that are being introduced.  <br/><br/>Head 14 includes provisions for current participants to whom the sudden illness or disability clause may refer. <br/><br/>Where an NHSS participant or applicant is deemed to not have the capacity to make a decision in respect of certain matters under the 2009 Act, a care representative may be appointed by the court to act on these matters.  Head 15 proposes the introduction of an additional power for the care representative, to allow for the nomination of a family successor in the case where a participant, at the necessary time, does not have the capacity to make such a nomination.  <br/><br/>This overview gives a flavour of the Bill.  I thank the Chairman and the committee for undertaking this pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme.  We look forward to receiving the committee's report, which will make a valuable contribution in the further development of the legislation, and we are happy to answer any questions in that regard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Healy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019111300002#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members.</p> <p>  I am joined by the chairman of the IFA's farm family and social affairs committee, Caroline Farrell; our farm business chairman, Martin Stapleton; and social affairs executive, Geraldine O&rsquo;Sullivan.</p> <p>  I would like to acknowledge the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and his officials who have at all stages recognised the contribution of family farms to maintaining economic activity and employment in the sector.  They have worked constructively with the IFA to remove the uncertainty in the NHSS in order that farm families can plan appropriately for the cost of care.</p> <p>  The IFA supports the scheme and recognises its important role in providing financial support and security for people going into long-term nursing home care, as well as their families.  The scheme operates under the principle of the ability to pay, which means that a person&rsquo;s copayment is calculated based on 80% of their assessable income and up to 7.5% of the value of their assets.  Under the scheme, the principal private residence is capped at three years and following this period, it is disregarded from the financial assessment.</p> <p>  A key concern for the IFA since the introduction of the scheme has been the potentially uncapped liability on the farm business asset.  Farm business assets are productive assets and are required to generate income.  They are not a measure of additional ability to pay.  Significant uncertainty and anxiety has been created for family farms, with fear that the viability of the farm will be undermined or lost while attempting to meet the costs of care.  This has led to the introduction of a three-year cap on farm business assets in circumstances of sudden illness.</p> <p>  It is also important to note that assets transferred for less than five years are included in the assessment of means.  As members can imagine, this has proven to be a barrier to the next generation taking over the family farm due to the debt owing on the farm business asset.</p> <p>  At this stage, before I go into detail on the draft heads of Bill and the proposed changes to the scheme, it would be useful to give a brief overview of the agricultural sector in Ireland.  It is the backbone of the economy and is our largest indigenous industry with a turnover of &euro;26 billion annually.  The family farm is at the heart of the agricultural sector.  There are 137,500 farms in Ireland, of which 99.7% are classified as family farms.  The 2018 Teagasc national farm survey showed that 30% of farmers are aged 65 or over, while only 7% are under the age of 35.  This steady erosion of farm incomes threatens both the viability and sustainability of the family farm and the sector&rsquo;s growth prospects.  This can be clearly seen in the survey findings with only 34% or 47,000 of farms classified as viable.</p> <p>  A farm is economically viable if it can remunerate family labour at the average agricultural wage and provide a 5% return on non-land assets.</p><p>A total of 32% of farms are classified as sustainable because of off-farm income and 34% are classified as vulnerable.  It is critical to understand that farm assets are productive assets, which are required to generate income.  They are not a measure of an additional ability to pay.  If the farm asset is reduced, the income earning potential will decrease and the viability of the farm can be put in question.  The agrifood sector, which employs more than 7% of the working population and is responsible for approximately 8% of GDP, is vital to the economy, but especially to the rural economy.  Farming provides the raw material that underpins the success of the agrifood sector and it is vital that the future viability of family farms be protected.</p><p> The importance of the agrifood sector is clearly recognised and has been prioritised as a major economic driver in the programme for Government.  It is acknowledged there are significant challenges facing the sector and that a number of important structural deficits affect its competitiveness.  In particular, issues such as farm size, fragmentation, low land mobility and an ageing demographic profile are believed to affect negatively the efficiency of primary production.  In the 2014 agri-taxation review, there was consensus that such structural deficiencies needed to be addressed and the report proposed a 50% increase in the income tax relief for leased land.</p><p> Long-term land leasing has operated in Ireland since the mid-1990s.  As a farm business structure, land leasing is growing in importance, not least since the increase in the income tax relief on long-term leases introduced in budget 2015.  The income tax relief rates and the tiered structure have encouraged farmers to enter long-term leases.  Since its introduction, the changes in the income tax relief rates have resulted in a near doubling of the number of long-term leases and are an important policy driver that encouraged and incentivised farmers to enter long-term leases with third parties.  The latest available Revenue figures show that the number of long-term land leases has more than doubled since 2013, rising from 4,370 to 9,790 in 2017.  The rate has continued apace in 2018 and 2019, meaning that the number is now far higher than 9,790.  It is important to stress that the income tax relief on leased land is not eligible to close family relatives and, therefore, Government policy has actively encouraged farm families to enter long-term leases with third parties.</p><p> In the draft heads of Bill to amend the nursing home support scheme, it is proposed to extend the three-year cap to farm business assets where the farmer, partner or spouse, or a family successor has worked a substantial part of the working day on the farm for three of the previous five years, prior to the person receiving care, or where a family successor is appointed and commits to continue consistently and regularly to apply a substantial part of his or her working day to farming for a period of not less than six years.  Under the proposed changes, family farms leased to third parties are excluded from the three-year cap, as they are classified as an investment asset rather than a productive asset.  The proposed changes and the classification of leased farm assets under the draft heads of Bill are inconsistent with other Government policies that actively incentivised and encouraged farmers to enter long-term leases with third parties.  Crucial to the success of the income tax relief and the incentivising of long-term leases is the confidence farmers have that in leasing their farms, they will not be negatively affected in the future transfer of their asset.  If the proposed changes were introduced, it could threaten the future viability of such farm businesses and undermine the progress made to address deficiencies in the sector.</p><p> The IFA proposes that the precedent set out under the agricultural relief, a relief available on farm land transferred either in one&rsquo;s lifetime or on death, be applied under the fair deal scheme to qualify for the three-year cap.  To create cohesive Government policy that continues to protect the competitiveness of the agricultural sector, the IFA proposes that the qualifying criteria under the fair deal scheme would be similar to agricultural relief, which states farm land must be farmed on a commercial basis for at least six years or the property must be leased to someone who farms the agricultural property on a commercial basis for at least six years from the date of transfer.  The rationale behind the relief is to encourage the productive use of agricultural land and prevent the sale or break-up of family farms.  Introducing a similar qualifying condition under the fair deal scheme for leased farm land would strengthen existing Government policy to address structural deficiencies in the sector and improve competitiveness.</p><p> Protecting the sector&rsquo;s competitiveness has never been so important, when the uncertainty of Brexit and the increasing production costs are considered.  The IFA proposes that the eligibility criteria for the three-year cap are that the farm is farmed on a commercial basis for three of the five years prior to the person receiving care, by either the farmer, partner or spouse, family successor or leasee, or that the farm is farmed on a commercial basis for at least six years from the date the person receives care, by either the farmer, partner or spouse, family successor or leasee.  Amending the draft heads of Bill to include the leasees is vital if the future viability of the family farm is to be protected.</p><p> Another condition not addressed in the draft heads of Bill is the clawback on farm assets transferred for less than five years.  The IFA is fully supportive of and encourages lifetime transfers of farms.  It is fundamentally opposed to a financial burden being placed on a transferred asset and is unclear how a third party could find itself responsible for the previous owner&rsquo;s cost of care.  There is no doubt this has proven to be a barrier to the next generation taking over the family farm, as the viability of the farm business may be undermined by the impact of an unknown cost of care on the future value of the assets.  Furthermore, farmers face a challenging credit environment and would be unable to secure credit to make the necessary investment in the farm business to increase efficiencies and production.  The clawback mechanism is grossly unjust and must be reviewed.  In other support schemes for elderly people, such as the non-contributory pension, when ownership of the farm asset is transferred, it is no longer included in the means assessment.  If a transfer has taken place, the person is asked to supply a copy of the deed of transfer stamped by the Revenue Commissioners, or if the deed has been lodged, a letter from the solicitors confirming that the deed of transfer has been lodged with the Revenue Commissioners is supplied.</p><p> The document, Review of the Nursing Home Support Scheme, A Fair Deal, was published in July 2015, three years after the IFA&rsquo;s submission to the consultation process.  It recognised the IFA&rsquo;s position that income generating assets should be treated differently.  In July 2018, the Government approved proposals to change how farm assets are treated under the fair deal scheme.  At the time, the Minister stated the draft heads of Bill would be progressed in the Oireachtas in the autumn session.  It took a further year, however, before the draft heads of Bill were published in June 2019.  The significant delays in the legislative process have had a negative impact on the viability of family farms.  The Government has given a commitment that the changes will be applied retrospectively, which means that once the Act is amended, it will apply to existing nursing home residents as well as new entrants.  The IFA proposes that the retrospection be applied from July 2018, when the Government approved the proposal, and that the existing nursing home residents who satisfy the three-year cap as of July 2018 be refunded their contribution from the farm business asset.  Farm families should not be financially penalised as a result of the delays progressing the drafting the legislation.</p><p> In conclusion, the IFA welcomes the opportunity to share its concerns with the committee, and present constructive and realistic recommendations that, if enacted, would enable farm families to plan appropriately for the cost of nursing home care and positively affect the future viability of Ireland&rsquo;s family farm model</p><p>We would very much welcome any questions members may have and thank them for their time and consideration.</p></speech>

I am glad we are discussing this issue today but regret that we were not discussing it a couple of years ago.  It has been on the long finger for far too long.  Many of us, particularly those from rural constituencies like mine, have been dealing with this issue in our clinics and in real life with our neighbours for some time because of the current inequity that must be addressed.</p> <p>  I want to acknowledge at the outset, and I am not always in this space, the work of the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, in respect of this issue.  To be fair to him, he took it on when others would not.  I acknowledge that across politics because he progressed it when others did not.</p> <p>  The fact that this issue has not moved on is affecting decision making across families.  I see it; I live on our family farm.  There are many people close to me, geographically as well as personally - they are my neighbours - and the fact that this has not been dealt with is impacting on intergenerational issues.  It is impacting on decision making.  It is changing people's lives and careers.  It is affecting diversification.  As a Government and a country, we are encouraging diversification in farming but because this decision has not been made, this is impacting on investment, credit and a range of other issues.</p> <p>  I have a number of questions.  I would say that, in the main, they are the same questions most members will have for the witnesses.  They are the ones people raise with us in our clinics.  These questions are for the Department officials rather than the IFA.  On the issue of leasing to third parties and excluding them from the three-year gap, what are the plans to deal with that?  This cannot go forward without this issue being dealt with in some way or having some form of criteria that will change the interpretation.  The witnesses might explain why they are not willing to examine this, or are they willing to look at it?  Perhaps they have changed their minds about it.  As has been outlined, and as I have said, it contradicts Government policy in numerous other areas.  We could cite many examples.  Only one has been cited here in respect of agricultural relief but if I went far enough I could pull out examples across other areas.  How will that issue be dealt with?  It will have a significant impact as regards this scheme because on the one hand many farmers, dare I say it, of my generation have been encouraged to go in a certain direction in respect of leasing but the condition here will impact on the scheme.  That is my first question.</p> <p>  The second issue is one I have juggling with for some time because I do not know how it will work.  It relates to the clawback.  I refer to the penalty in respect of the clawback for less than five years of assets that have been transferred.  I have no idea how this will work, and it is not outlined.  How does the Department put a condition on a third party who has received the asset?  How will that work legally?  The witnesses might outline that.  There needs to be some form of criteria in respect of that because the way the heads of the Bill are written is puzzling.  I have no way of knowing how this will work.</p> <p>  The third issue relates to the actual timing of this Bill.  As I said in my introduction, many people are being conditioned as regards its timing.  We will have to bring in some form of retrospective application for those who are in nursing homes and new entrants in respect of this Bill.  In some cases, people have had to make decisions in a rushed way.  Some families had been holding out but could not hold out any longer.  We will have to apply this legislation retrospectively in some way.  I am open to discussing the dates.  I have no fixed date in my head.  The Department could look at the date it was published and other dates but the likelihood is that in the current political environment the passage of the Bill through the legislative process could go on for some time.  I would like to see it done before this D&aacute;il is due to conclude by next March, April or May.  Do the Department officials intend having this scheme legislated for by then?  We will have to retrospectively insert something in the legislation to make it applicable to those people to whom I referred.  Those are my three questions, all of which are for the Department officials.</p></speech>

In terms of the length of time it has taken us to get to this position, it is probably fair to say, and it is not news to anybody in this room, that the scheme and the primary legislation that underpins it is complex.  It contains many complex and competing issues that we have to examine, not just in terms of looking out to farms and businesses but also the impacts any changes to the scheme would have in respect of the sustainability of the scheme going forward.  Next year, the scheme will reach over the &euro;1 billion mark in terms of budget.  It is a very significant scheme in terms of expenditure for the State and we will have to think carefully about any changes to it that could impact on its longer-term sustainability.  That is part of the reason we spent so much time trying to identify the issues and the legal complexities and trying to address those in the heads of the Bill.  We would like to have done it quicker but, unfortunately, the nature of the legislation and the background to it did not permit that.  However, we are making progress now.</p> <p>  To deal with the Deputy's last question on our intentions around progression of the Bill, we have no desire to hang around in terms of moving this forward.  We have drafters appointed now who are working with us and who will start drafting the Bill soon in respect of that.  The sooner we can get that finished and into the Houses for debate and to progress it, the better.  We have no reason to delay it any further, other than dealing with any issues that may arise that may need to be examined.  By and large, however, we are as ambitious and as anxious to move it forward as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  In terms of the specific questions, on the issue of leasing, which the Deputy and the representatives of the IFA outlined, we have looked at it in great detail.  Part of that was in respect of the complexities involved.  When we look across Government at different policies it is important to get to the hub of the intent of any policy.  The policy intent behind the agricultural tax relief relates predominantly to land mobility.  This amendment to this scheme is about the protection of the family farm within the family unit as a source of employment and income going forward.  It has a different policy intent.  I do not believe it is incompatible necessarily with land mobility policy.  The reason land mobility policy exists to some extent is because the farm, by and large, had not been worked.  This is about keeping the farm that is being worked working and providing safeguards to protect the viability in respect of the financial debt that may run up in that regard.  I do not believe they are compatible.</p> <p>  The issue here is that we have to think about all other classes of assets that may be part of the financial means assessment in the scheme.  To move away from the policy intent that the farm would be protected for the next generation in terms of working the land would depart from that policy intent.</p><p>It would potentially have a domino effect in respect of other assets that people may have and create discrimination in the equitable administration of the scheme.  It probably brings us all the way back to the subvention scheme that the fair deal tried to replace by undoing some of the inequitable principles embedded in that scheme.  We do not want to take a retrograde step.  We cannot include third parties in this because it does not meet the policy intent, which is to protect the family farm for the next generation who will farm the land.  That is why those conditions are in the scheme and the conditions around sudden illness and disability provisions which are currently in the 2009 Act also cover that in respect of the requirement to be working the land.  </p><p> In terms of clawback and the heads of the Bill, we have tried to improve the situation and in the head dealing specifically with transferred assets we tried to recognise that for a variety of reasons, including retirement, the farm may have been transferred to a family member already before the nursing home care is required.  To address that we have allowed for the cap to be applied to such situations which currently is not the case.  We have also allowed for the fact that under the existing provisions there is a hard cut-off of five years.  We have introduced here a possibility for the land to be worked in only three of the last five years.  We have moved to try to improve the position.  The five-year transferred asset period has been a feature of the scheme since day one.  Part of that is a particular safeguard to protect the scheme bearing in mind that it is based on means.  The majority of people are honest and work with what is there but the safeguard put in place in 2009 was to stop people putting assets beyond the scheme nefariously rather than by accident.  We have tried to recognise what happens on the ground in respect of succession.  We have introduced what I think is a positive amendment in that respect to try to apply the cap to those situations as well.</p><p> Retrospection of the changes creates a difficult precedent in that we are trying to reach back legislatively to apply conditions to people who did not know those conditions existed.  I suppose they did not exist at the time in respect of what is being proposed here.  That is a challenging precedent to try to introduce to the scheme and it has knock-on effects irrespective of whether we talk about seven days or seven years ago.  We have examined that in detail.  We think the challenges and the risks are quite high for potential knock-on impacts.  In our assessment it is not possible, particularly in the retrospective application of conditions that did not exist at the time.  </p></speech>

Such people will have to make that contribution and if they cannot, it will have to come out of their assets.  That is the current set up under the scheme.  Here we are giving an option, where there is a family successor in place who is working the farm or the business, to agree to continue to work that, enter into a legal agreement and we can apply the cap in that situation.  Under the current situation, the cap does not apply in those circumstances.</p></speech>

In general I would agree with Deputy Kelly's remarks on the legalities likely to emerge and the extent to which the courts could well be full of issues arising from this.</p> <p>  Mr. Redmond has evaluated how the clawback will or will not work.  However, over the past few years has the Department carried out any audit directly to familiarise itself with the way the scheme has worked to date and the snags it threw up?  Are its proposals based on what happened during that period?  For example, I am sure we all know of several cases where the farmer's business had to be liquidated before payments could be made because, especially in the case of a long stay in a nursing home, the bills are colossal.  In some cases that creates a problem if there happens to be a member of the farm or business family who has a disability, which imposes a double penalty on them.  They have the problem of the disability and of an extraordinary bill that they cannot afford to pay other than by disposing of the assets and then there is a problem which falls back on the State eventually.  The legalities of it in the way the Bill looks to be heading could well tie them up in such a way that there is no resolution.  It could be passed onto the next generation or to the person who leases the property.  I do not know how that is going to work out.  I would be very worried because while there of course will be cases before the courts to determine how the legislation will work, that should not be unnecessary.</p> <p>  The first question I would like answered is the extent to which the Department has examined the way the scheme has worked to date, the snags it threw up and how they have been resolved.  Not all cases are dealt with in the same fashion, some are dealt with more sympathetically than others, depending on who the person is dealing with.  The important point at this stage is to realise that we are dealing with a vulnerable group of people in the very precarious situation of no longer being in control of a situation they had control of previously during their working lives. </p></speech>

The 2015 review considered the operation of the scheme from top to bottom and how all aspects of it worked, not just on this particular issue but all aspects.  That came up with a range of recommendations, one of which was on this issue.  The Deputy used the word "audit" but the Department of Health does not audit the scheme, so to speak.  We engage on a monthly basis with the HSE.  We have a specific structure set up with it to monitor implementation and not just the financial aspects but emerging issues coming up from the ground around policy and operation.  We do have a good understanding of how it operates and where issues may arise.  By and large many of them can be addressed on an ongoing basis.  We do have that ongoing dialogue because it is a very complex scheme and does provide a lot of value to people.  We are conscious of that and anything we can do in respect of examining its operation we do on an ongoing basis.  The review was the formal period when all aspects of it were covered.</p><p>Off the top of my head, I think the review came up with recommendations for 32 administrative reforms.  Almost all of those have been implemented.  We are looking at a number of other reforms that required further work, relating to farms and businesses and to other matters, which required a deeper review, which is ongoing.  That was probably the formal milestone of the review of the scheme in a nutshell.  We have constant ongoing engagement with the HSE and other agencies of the State about the operation of the scheme.  We keep a close eye on that and related issues that arise.</p></speech>

Mr. Redmond mentioned the viability of the scheme.  In the course of those exchanges of views with the HSE, what has been to the fore?  Has the concern been primarily for the viability of the scheme, with the necessity to get more funding from whatever sources are available?  Has the concern been to make it workable, accessible and functional?  What is the primary issue in that debate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Redmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019111300002#H00300"><p>I do not think that any specific issue takes primacy with regard to what we look at.  We try to look at it from every angle.  We have to put our minds back to the first principles of the scheme, namely, what it is about, why it was set up, what it intends to do and what it does.  It is to provide financial support.  As I outlined in my opening statement, it is a means-assessed scheme, so those who can afford to do so pay more and those who cannot get more State support.  That is the basic tenet of the scheme.  We have to understand that and protect that basic tenet of the underlying policy of the scheme.  That means that when we look at making changes to the scheme, especially changes to the financial means assessment, we have to try to understand what the consequences of those changes may be, not just for the type of change that we are trying to make but for the cohort of people to whom we are trying to introduce additional safeguards.</p> <p>  If we make a change to the treatment of a specific kind of asset for a policy objective, we have actually to meet that policy objective and the question of proportionality and relevance comes in.  We do not want to create a scenario where effectively every asset that anybody could have would suddenly be fair game in the financial assessment.  We would then be moving away from a financial means assessment of the ability to pay to this being just a payment scheme, which is not the intention of this scheme.  That poses significant financial challenges with regard to the scheme going forward if the doors are thrown open to all assets being excluded from the financial means assessment.  That has a significant impact on budgetary issues and the ability of people to access the scheme.  The reality is that the scheme is set up so that people can get access to nursing home care when they cannot afford to do so themselves.  Our primary objective with the legislation is to ensure that people can access nursing home care when they need it and are supported to do that.  Anything that risks that would be a significant problem for us.</p></speech>

Are the possible resolution or elimination of issues that have arisen and a means to resolve them primary concerns?  Have the number of situations where individuals have been placed in financial jeopardy as a result of the scheme and the manner in which it has been operated heretofore been brought to the Department's attention?  I am sure that everybody here knows a number of such people.  What degree of urgency arises as a result of identification of issues of that nature?</p></speech>

Some submissions that were made to the review group during that process are being used, such as those from the Irish Farmers Association.  Our primary aim in this has been to try to address the recommendation of the fair deal review regarding farm and business assets.  We have to be cognisant, when addressing that, that we do not create a difficulty for the scheme and undermine its sustainability.  We do not look at it on the basis of an approach to revenue raising.  This change increases the cost to the scheme itself and we have had to take that into account in our discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and in our own assessment of how this might work in practice.  Those considerations have to be part of any good policy assessment process.  Our primary concern has been to address the review findings in a way that protects the scheme and delivers on the policy intent and recommendations of the review.</p> <p>  The HSE is largely able to manage issues that arise within the existing framework.  Various safeguards are built into the scheme as it currently stands.  The Deputy has mentioned cashflow and the potential of people having to sell assets to meet the cost of their nursing home care.  A mechanism built into the scheme is the ability for people to take out ancillary State support, the nursing home support loan, which allows people's contribution based on their assets to be covered through a loan from the HSE, which means that they do not necessarily have to sell property when they go into care.  Other safeguards are built into that, especially regarding the family home.  When somebody leaves the scheme and the loan has to be repaid, there are mechanisms for where there is a partner or child, and some other conditions when people are living in the family home, such that repayment of the loan can be deferred for the time that that person lives in the home.  That safeguard protects against the family home being sold from under somebody.  Aside from the work that we have done on the heads of Bill, going back to 2007 and 2008, then the eventual introduction of the Act in 2009, there was much consideration of safeguards.  The nursing home loan provides an opportunity for people to be able to continue to avail of nursing home care if, for example, they have a high-value asset without having to sell that asset.  That important safeguard has existed since the beginning of the scheme.</p></speech>

I will talk to Mr. Redmond first.  I commend the work done by my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and the Department of Health.  Why is it taking so long?  Mr. Redmond mentioned it at the start.  There have been a couple of announcements.  The impression was given that this was a done deal, if the witnesses will excuse the pun, and we were all systems go.  Farmers' lives are on hold.  I know of many families who are holding off on making a decision about their future, waiting for this Bill to pass.  Why is it taking so long?</p></speech>

The Bill is complex.  We cannot look at the issue in isolation.  We have to look at the whole picture of the scheme, where we are going, ageing, the budget for the fair deal scheme in the future and all the legal complications.  Without having to cast our minds back to the situation that existed prior to the introduction of this scheme, with the old subvention scheme, part of the reason for the fair deal scheme being introduced and for that pseudonym being given to it was to try to correct some of the issues that existed previously, particularly with inequity in the scheme.</p><p>This can get very complex but one of the issues we have had to look at very closely is the constitutional element around equity, equal treatment and policy objectives or intents behind change in the level of treatment.  Treatment may no longer be necessarily equal but it would still be fair.  We have had to look very carefully at all those issues.</p><p> I do not want to bring up too much but, unfortunately, when we were in the depths of some of the very close engagement with our legal people in the Department and officials in the Attorney General's office, there were issues around the legal response to Brexit and all of that.  It did not help, in truth, and we lost a bit of time with it.  I do not want to put that up as a primary reason for this taking so long.  It is just very complex and we are trying to work our way through the issues as best and as quickly as we can.  We also have a duty to ensure that what we bring forward does not undermine or break the scheme in future or create difficulty for the people who need to access it.</p></speech>

My colleagues have asked the nitty-gritty questions that I was ready to ask but I ask Mr. Redmond to examine retrospection again.  It is very important.</p> <p>  I wish Mr. Healy well as he comes to the end of his tenure and say "well done" on a great few years as he represented the IFA very well.  The Teagasc survey indicates that 30% of farmers are over 65.  That is a large percentage and it may indicate that people are slow enough to pass assets to children in any event.  We cannot blame it all on the delay in the Bill, although we may like to do so.  Does the IFA advise farmers on how to do things legally or ease the process of passing on assets?</p></speech>

Mr. James Staines is our legal adviser and he is available to any of our people.  As the Deputy correctly says, 30% of farmers are over 65 and over half our farmers are over 55, with just 6% under 35.  There are a number of problems.  The first is the very low levels of income from farming and the Teagasc farm survey pinpoints that, particularly in the dry stock sectors where the direct payments account for over 100% of the average farm income.  Mr. Martin Stapleton is our farm business chairman and much of our lobbying is focused on trying to ease the burden of the transfer of farms.  This is one example but there are also inheritance tax and stamp duty incentives that we seek on a yearly basis.  All the members have attended our lobby days on such matters as it can be a very costly time for farmer families.  When people take over farms, other members of the family may need to be educated.  If a person takes over a farm now, it must look after two families, namely, that person's family and his or her parents.</p> <p>  We could say that everything we do is about improving the farmer's lot, income and making a farm more attractive to the next generation.  It is about easing the burden and cost of transfer.  Much of that involves providing advice through our staff network of offices around the country and people like Ms O'Sullivan being made available to these farmers.  This is a case in point where there is such fear.  I repeat our very clear requests.  I take Mr. Redmond's point that he hopes the drafting of the Bill will start soon but how long is a bit of string in that context?  With all due respect, "soon" can mean next week to some people and next year to others.  We would prefer a more definite period.  This has been going on for so long now and it has caused so much anxiety.  It was one of the key issues in my election campaign this time four years ago.  I went into houses where people were hamstrung by the cost of care.  We want the Bill to be drafted immediately because this has been going on for long enough.  If there are issues which are not clear now, I am not sure another four or six years will clarify them either.</p> <p>  Deputy Murphy O'Mahony has correctly highlighted the issue of retrospection and we want that to be applied from July 2018, when the Government approved the proposal.  We also want the leasee to be included in eligibility criteria and for the clawback issue to be sorted out to avoid undermining the impact of an unknown cost of care on the future value of the assets.

Will Mr. Redmond jog our memories with an overview of the cost of the fair deal scheme when we factor in what is taken in through the financial contribution of persons availing of nursing home care and the money received from the 7.5% deduction over three years or longer where the cap does not apply?  What is the net cost to the country?  Will he give an overview of the average stay of a person in nursing home care?  How many people does this policy measure that we are awaiting affect?  How many people on an annual basis and overall will benefit from the measure?  I address this to Mr. Healy and Mr. Redmond.  It might be helpful to have the figures but I apologise if this was raised before I came in.</p></speech>

The net full-year cost of the scheme for 2018, not including the individual contributions from people in the scheme, was &euro;972 million.

A number of people are still on previous arrangements so the average time for people who are only on the new scheme would, I imagine, be slightly less than three years.  As for who will be affected by this amendment, the HSE captures quite high-level information on the people coming in and the nature of their assets, specifically their interest in productive farm and business assets, and there are some 700 people in the NHSS with a farm asset at the moment.  A total of 23,300 people are being supported under the fair deal scheme and that represents approximately 3%, which is along the lines of the representation of the general population.  If we take out the people who are currently availing of the sudden illness provision, there will be an immediate impact.  People in long-term care under fair deal, and who have an interest in a farm or business asset and have been in the scheme for in excess of three years, will be immediately impacted and they will be able to avail of the cap if they nominate the family successor and meet the conditions.</p></speech>

The cap takes immediate effect for them.  We also imagine a cohort of who, for whatever reason, have an interest in a farm or business asset but are not supported under the scheme because they may be wholly private and self-funding.  We imagine they might be attracted into the scheme, though we think they are a small cohort.  If they were to come into the scheme, there would be a cost as they would immediately be able to avail of the three-year cap.  We estimate 50 or 60 people in this category.  We also feel there is a cohort of people holding off on entering the scheme.  They may be availing of home support but now that they understand this proposal, they may be attracted into the scheme if they have some assurance as to the sustainability of their productive assets.  The cap will not take effect for another three years but there is an immediate cost if we attract that cohort into the scheme.  Three years from now, there will be a further cost when the cap is realised.</p></speech>

Approximately 3% of the client base have an interest in a farm but the number of farmers we believe to be in need of long-term care is slightly higher than 3%, at close to 3.4%.

It dovetails with the earlier presentation by Mr. Joe Healy.  The IFA made a valid proposal, which is that the test relating to farming replicate what is already in primary legislation in the way of agriculture relief.  It is of fundamental importance that there be consistency across government in this area because otherwise confusion will be created.  The objective of the provision before us is to remove current anomalies in the fair deal scheme and, therefore, it should not create other anomalies but if we do not take the agriculture relief as the definition, that is what we will do.</p> <p>  In his response to colleagues, Mr. Redmond stated that this was a land mobility policy, which should not be looked at in terms of the NHSS.  I appreciate where he is coming from but he is creating a further anomaly in the system and we will have to come back to amend this again as it will undermine the clear objective and policy of Government to provide for land mobility.  If the legislation is drafted as currently proposed, many people who would wish to go into long-term leasing will not do so because they will be discriminated against if they do.</p><p>In his defence of not moving from this position, Mr. Redmond stated that it would threaten the equity of the scheme and that there is a constitutional issue in terms of equity.  I am glad that he raised the issue of equity.  Taking the example that Mr. Healy gave, can Mr. Redmond explain the justification for the current proposals regarding the lease of land for the first three years?  We can argue about what should happen after three years, but I would like to tease out the position in regard to the first three years.  First, 3.5% of the capital value of that farm is taken into account under the NHSS.  Second, the rental income from the land is also considered income under the scheme.  Third, if that money goes through the older person's bank account, which in all likelihood it would, that money is considered capital on deposit.  This means the same land is charged for three times under the scheme.  I ask Mr. Redmond to explain to me how that is equitable, constitutional or fair.  </p><p> This does not only happen in regard to farm land.  It is also the case in regard to a private home.  Currently, there are five vacant homes in the ownership of elderly people in long-term nursing home care for every homeless family in this country.  The dots do not join up.  There are 9,000 vacant homes in respect of which the owners have gone into long-term nursing home care and in a bizarre twist of the current policy under the fair deal scheme, we are effectively banning the rental of these homes because they will be hit on the treble under the penalty system that is currently in place under the scheme.  This penalty is such that in the case of a house owned by an older person in long-term nursing home care, the capital value is taken into account at the rate of 7.5% per annum.  On top of that, if the house is rented, the income generated is also taken in account.  As I said, that money is likely to go through the older person's bank account, which is considered capital on deposit subject to charge at a rate of 7.5%.  </p><p> There are 9,000 vacant houses, some of which - it may only be a small cohort - families are prepared to rent out but the difficulty is that they would be subject to a charge three times.  This is not equitable.  It is even more bizarre that under the national broadband scheme 1,000 Mbps high-speed broadband is being provided outside some of these vacant homes that could accommodate families.  Infrastructure is being installed yet these houses remain vacant, with weeds growing around them.  This penalty is undermining the stated Government policy of trying to reopen vacant houses.  </p><p> Following on from Mr. Healy's submission, and as set out in my own submission, what we need is equity, fairness and transparency.  A property should be charged only once under the means assessment.  Under the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection non-contributory old page pension mechanism, where a capital asset generates an income, that income is taken into account.  For example, if a farm is leased out, the lease income is taken into account.  If the land is farmed, the income generated is taken into account.  If the farm is not being farmed or leased, the capital value of the land is taken into account.  A house that is the principal private residence is excluded under the social welfare scheme.  In the case of any other property, the capital value of the property or any income generated from it is taken into account.  I have no difficulty with people paying their fair share.  I am not seeking a sweetheart deal for farmers or older people; rather, I am seeking equity.  A property should be means assessed only once, not twice and definitely not three times.  This is the fundamental anomaly of the NHSS as currently applied in terms of the lease of farm land and the rent of houses.  </p><p> The argument will be made by the witnesses and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the way forward is to progress with what has been proposed and to revisit the issue another time.  The difficulty is that this scheme has been under review since 2012.  I had a commitment written into the programme for Government that this would be fast forwarded because of the failure to progress it over the four years prior to the drafting of the programme for Government.  Thanks to the support of individuals such as Maura Canning of the IFA, we have made progress.  I accept that the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has done a lot of work and each of the witnesses has done a lot of work in that regard.  I am aware of the barriers and bottlenecks they have dealt with in terms of other arms of government because I was involved at Cabinet in pushing through them.  Now that we have the opportunity to take anomalies out of the system, to introduce an element of fairness and equity into the system, we should do so.</p><p> I ask the witnesses to incorporate the definition of "agricultural relief" in the Finance Act 2019 into the provisions of this scheme and, in terms of capital assessment, to treat property equitably, as provided for under primary legislation for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  All we are looking for is equity in this area.   Conservatively, there are more than 50,000 vacant houses throughout the country.  The fair deal scheme boycott is one element in that regard.  Another element in regard to the blockage of these homes is the issue of probate.  People in County Roscommon and the adjoining county of Galway have to wait, on average, three and a half months for it to be processed.  If one is unfortunate enough to live in County Kilkenny, the process takes four and a half months.  In Cork city, it takes two and a half months and, in Waterford city, it takes three and a half months.  These are areas of the country where there is demand for housing yet the probate system is blocking the release of houses onto the market.  There are 1.75 million houses in the country.  We need to utilise them in the best way.  We need to work with older people and their families to unblock any blockages in that regard.  I hope committee members and officials of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will examine the blockage that has been created by the fair deal scheme and address the anomaly in respect of farm leasing.</p></speech>

On equity, as I have mentioned, it is important to take into account the purpose and the policy objectives of the fair deal scheme, including in the context of the heads of Bill that we have developed, and the situation prior to the introduction of the scheme.  I have read some of the Oireachtas debates on the introduction of the Act in 2008.  One of the main aims of the fair deal scheme was to correct the situation whereby people of similar means were paying different levels of contribution.</p><p>Part of what the fair deal scheme attempts to do is to provide a situation where a person pays a contribution towards his or her care based on the means he or she has.  Effectively, that boils down the more means a person has, the more one pays, and the less means one has, the less one pays.  What is being suggested would fundamentally move away from that, irrespective of the other policies that may exist and those other policies that exist in relation to other aspects of Government.  They have a particular policy intent and a particular policy objective.  I am not necessarily convinced that this undermines any of those.  I think this is a different policy intent.  The fundamentals of the nursing homes support scheme being based on financial assessment of means would be significantly undone if we were to do anything else in relation to that and would actually create a situation where we are back to a position again that we were in previously where one resident in a nursing home has more means than another but contributes less to the scheme.  That is the situation that the scheme tried to fix.  We have done well in terms of doing that and supporting 100,000 people in the past ten years.  Any move backwards in relation to that would create significant difficulties with the scheme.</p></speech>

I do not disagree with it.  I wholeheartedly agree that if one has more means, one pays more.  That is a fundamental tenet of the scheme, and should be a fundamental tenet of the scheme, but I vehemently oppose the fact that if one has a single asset that one pays three times for it.  Let me make it clear to Mr. Redmond.  The Department is drafting the legislation at the moment.  I do not know what the formulation of the House will be when this legislation goes through, but whoever the Minister of the day is bringing this primary legislation through the House, he or she will not be in a position to defend a situation where one pays three times for a single asset.  That is inequitable.  It is unconstitutional.  It is unfair.  I urge the Department to reconsider exactly what I have said while the legislation is being drafted to ensure that it provides the equity we all believe should be part of the scheme.</p></speech>

Deputy Naughten raised the issue of rental income.  That is a particularly difficult one, for the same principles I have outlined.  Currently, there is no income within the scheme that is treated differently from other types of income.  It would be difficult to try to segregate rental income and treat it differently and not have a situation where there is inequitable treatment.  That is a major issue.  I do not think that will work, in terms of the way the scheme is set up and what it is intended to do.  That goes back to the issue of the cap and the precedent that exists in that regard.  It has been a feature of the scheme since day one.  We are working with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to look at, for example, the possibility of capping the proceeds from the sale of the home at three years.  It is an anomaly that can be addressed.  Currently, the situation with the scheme is that if one has the physical property one pays 7.5% of the value of the property for three years and then it is capped.  If one decides to sell the property either before going into care or when one is in care the cash proceeds from the asset are not subject to a cap.  If someone was in nursing home care for ten years, one would pay 75% of it.  There is definitely an issue in that regard.  That would be a barrier to people selling on the property.  We are committed to having a look at that.  It is unclear how quickly we can get through it, but it is our intention if people are in agreement that we could try to piggy-back an amendment to the scheme when the Bill is eventually debated.  That is something we can do.  One of the issues, more broadly, is trying to get good evidence and a good methodology in place.  This goes back to the issue of proportionality.  The rational process for delivering a policy objective is trying to understand realistically how many vacant homes are out there that are a direct result of a person going into long-term care.  Some data came out of the 2016 census.  The CSO has highlighted the difficulty in its disclaimers, for want of a better word, in that it was a small process that was done on an experimental basis.  We are working with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to see what we can do to try to get a better handle on what the figures might be and have a more robust methodology for looking at those.</p> <p>  The second part of the equation is trying to understand what is the realistic benefit in terms of freeing up homes by making a change to the scheme.  That is a difficult one in itself because if one takes something like, rental income, for example, just because something is a possibility does not mean that people will follow through.  There may be a whole host of reasons for that, not least because what we are talking about are people who themselves may not be vulnerable but who are in vulnerable positions in terms of being elderly in a nursing home with various medical and other needs, but I am not sure how likely it would be to happen on a large scale that they would take on the role of landlord and all of the legal implications and responsibilities that has.  That is an important aspect when we look at this issue.  The more important piece is trying to segregate a particular type of income and treat it differently from every other income and have the situation we had previously where people of different means were paying different contributions but not based on paying more because they have more means but paying less because they have more means.  That would create a very fundamental unfairness in the system.</p></speech>

The statistics I have given in terms of the 9,000 are from the HSE and relate to the nursing homes support scheme.  They are on foot of a reply to a parliamentary question.  I believe many older people and their families do not want to rent out their properties.  That is fair enough.  That is their own decision.  It is very hard to know what the impact will be until one does something.  However, the fundamental issue is that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection has a very equitable, fair and defensible system of calculating income but in the nursing homes support scheme we are saying that if one has a particular type of income, then one pays for it three times.  That is wrong.  That is inequitable.  It is immoral and needs to be changed.  All I am asking the Department to do is to look back over what I have said this morning, look at the legislation in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and bring a bit of fairness into the fair deal scheme.</p></speech>

Following on from Deputy Naughten's comments, there has been much talk back and forth and the point has been laboured.  I do not think anyone is suggesting that anybody should be treated in an unfair manner.  The point is that it is the assets that are being treated differently.  I do not think anyone is suggesting that someone from a farming background should be treated more favourably than somebody coming from an alternative background.  The point being made is that the asset has potentially been targeted three times as part of the calculations.  I want to make sure that we do not have to go back over it another three times.  The point is very clear.</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Healy's four asks.  I do not think they are too much.  The cost for people in farming communities of the lack of mobility and paralysis on this issue cannot be overstated, as it has had real-life impacts for people who are trying to succession plan as part of their lives in rural Ireland.  I agree in particular with the back-dating of any proposal as compensation for the stagnation that has occurred with the progression of this legislation.</p> <p>  I do not wish to go back over the exact same points as anybody else, but I know the Department is in contact with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government about leasing or renting properties.  I have a slight concern with Mr. Redmond's assumption that everybody that is in a nursing home is not of sound mind or that there is a vulnerability there.  Many people have extensive support networks and, with all due respect, it is their families that stand up for them and their communities.  I do not think we need to classify them as a particular type of vulnerable person here this morning.</p><p>The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government was mentioned.  I have been informed by the Minister that it is considering this as an option to free up the supply of stock.  I imagine that there may be issues of suitability.  For example, many rural homes might not have insulation or be retrofitted and, consequently, might not be fit for rent.  That is a decision for the family, though.</p><p> In terms of the all-of-Government approach to climate action, has this matter been considered?  The witnesses might think I am being a bit out there in this, but there is supposed to be carbon checking or a climate response from every Department.  Some years ago, there were initiatives to incentivise the leasing of land to improve land mobility so that younger or more progressive farmers would not need to go to a bank and seek funding that they might not get.  I am sure that the departmental officials are fully aware of those tax incentives to encourage the leasing of land.  It has been referred to as income, given that the leased asset is considered in the calculation.  Without making broader statements, and perhaps Mr. Healy will agree, a younger farmer tends to be qualified in the areas of the beef genomics scheme and all those other progressive actions we are taking in agriculture.  The role that rural Ireland and farms in particular have to play in our decarbonisation is so important that we cannot do anything that in any way disincentivises people.  The number of leases that have been taken up has doubled to 10,000 as a result of the policy of encouraging land mobility.  If we do not make the modifications that are being asked for today, we will not be climate proofing this policy and it will make moving into the farming sphere less equitable and fair.  The younger, more progressive farmers will be penalised and, therefore, we as a country will not get the benefits that we should from their progressive methods and standards.</p><p> I am concerned about the five-year clawback.  There have been a couple of instances of people not meeting the five-year threshold.  A line must be drawn somewhere, but is there an appeals system?  If something happened in a family four years and 360 days ago, would a sliding scale apply or would it be completely black and white?  Is any compassion shown if people are in a difficult situation with, for example, a sick family member?</p><p> I am informed by the IFA that 86% of farmers have no succession plan.  That is worrying, given that they are the custodians of most of the land that will trap the carbon.  As such, the issue under discussion is being looked at in a silo rather than as part of the overall solution for the country.  Has the Department considered this matter in its planning on the legislation?</p></speech>

Everyone with a broader stake in farming and agriculture recognises that.  The IFA mentioned its recognition of it at this meeting.  In the context of the fair deal scheme, a major solution to many of the issues around the continued viability of farming is to plan ahead, plan well and effect that succession planning as early as possible.  This important point needs to be made.  It has been an in-built incentive in the scheme from day one.</p> <p>  The five-year period is black and white under the primary legislation.  In that light, I do not know what allowances would be made in practice if someone was at four years and 364 days.  I can check it out with the HSE.</p></speech>

They might prop mammy up at home until they reached it.  That is not good policy.  The older person should be the focus.</p></speech>

Looking at it from a different angle, though, if people can divest themselves of all assets before they enter the scheme, the scheme will cost whatever it costs and people will not get access unless we find a pot of money that can live with that additional cost.  There are issues in that regard, so it is a question of trying to strike a balance.  The five-year period was decided on in 2009 to strike that balance and give people an opportunity.</p> <p>  Regarding the Bill's head on transferred assets, the three-year cap can apply to transferred assets on the condition that they have gone to a family successor.  We have tried to move that forward a little while also protecting the integral part of the scheme and the sustainability of what it is trying to do.</p> <p>  To be honest, we have not given climate action consideration.  This is a financial support scheme and I understand that-----</p></speech>

Everything is supposed to have that consideration.  There was a concerted effort to reduce fragmentation - pockets of land - and make things more efficient, but some of this Bill will have a negative effect on that policy.  I cannot see how it is not a consideration.  I would like the Department to consider it.  The people who are taking over these farms are the people with the hedgerows, the grasslands, the land that will be planted, GLAS and so on.  They are the ones on whom we will be dependent to decarbonise our economy and to cool the environment.  There are positive benefits to efficient, progressive farming, larger farms and making it possible for younger farmers to afford to get land without buying it.  We must consider all of that if we are serious about the climate issue.</p></speech>

To qualify for the cap, one must have a family member who is working the farm.  The basic policy objective is to protect situations where the family farm is passed on to the next generation to work the land and to avoid the uncertainty of an open-ended contribution towards nursing home fees.  What we have proposed addresses that.</p> <p>  If people for whatever reason do not want to or cannot work their land, there is an opportunity to transfer that asset in good time and have it in someone else's productive use.  The scheme does not undermine that.  An important aspect is how it presents people with a range of choices about how to manage their land and affairs.  We must also consider the scheme in a broader context than just farm and business assets.  If we make it the case that one could have any asset, be one working or not-----</p></speech>

If the land is not leased and is left fallow, there will be an issue.  Active farming of the land and the maintenance of biodiversity and so on that farming communities do are important.  The point of the incentives some years ago to promote leasing and land mobility was to make the farm an equitable business.  In consideration of the leased land as an asset, and for the purposes of calculation, it almost undoes the good of the previous policy objective.  </p></speech>

As we are all well aware, this matter has been ongoing for several years.  I call the fair deal scheme for farmers the lousiest deal in the world.  They are being militated against and a bush has been put in their way to access the fair deal.  So much wrong has been done to them that it is unbelievable it is happening in a democratic country such as Ireland, and that it is being allowed to continue.</p> <p>  I call it a debacle.  We thought we had brought it to a head in July 2018.  Our Rural Independent Group, of which the Chairman is a member, called a vote in the Chamber on the matter at the time.  The Government and its supporters voted against it and Fianna F&aacute;il abstained, but I am glad to say Sinn F&eacute;in and small groupings of parties ensured that we had a majority and the Government would have to address it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, seemed to be receptive but it is clear that other forces within the Government are resisting it.  The finance of the fair deal scheme, for this year alone, has been under threat.  People qualified for the scheme and submitted their application but were then told they would have to wait until funding became available.  It is clear that what is happening is the funding is not available for the fair deal scheme and, therefore, the crowd will block it or try to extract as much as they can from farmers.  It is ridiculous.</p> <p>  We had a notion that a three-year cap would be put in place for farmers accessing the scheme.  The position that obtains, whereby the applicant must pay 7.5% of his or her assets, applies in cases where he or she is the sole owner of the farm.  In rural Ireland, it may be that one person owns the farm even though he or she is married, or in a couple or whatever, and it is often the case that the other person's name is not on the farm.  A figure of 7.5% is charged, which, multiplied by five in the case of a &euro;500,000 farm, is &euro;37,500, although, as Mr. Healy will be aware, one would not buy much of a farm for &euro;500,000 in today's world.  A young farmer, who might be a woman or man trying to continue on his or her own, will be liable for that payment each year.  That is totally unfair and undemocratic.  In the case of everyone else in the country, if he or she has a house, it is only the value of the house that will be assessed for the scheme.</p> <p>  I met a man in west Cork a few months ago who had just bought a farm.  We all know that one must increase production even to stand still in respect of one's income.  The farm's value will be taken into consideration.  The man's wife has motor neurone disease.  She accompanied him to a wedding I attended.  She did not know exactly where she was but she was able to move around.  The man told me that in six months, she would have to move to a nursing home.  They have a young family and he will have to contend with that.</p> <p>  That is what is being doled out.  It is a matter of like it or lump it, and one must pay the rate of 7.5% for as many years as possible, until someone caves in somewhere and agrees to the cap.  One matter the IFA may not have pushed hard enough, which I resent, is that the full value of the farm is assessed but it should not be.  It is very unfair.  In most other instances, only the family home is assessed.  Someone suggested that farms be passed on in good time but when is a good time?  People get sick when they are 30 years old, in their mid-20s or when they are 40.  Should one pass on the farm 20 years early?  Most people believe they should retire in their mid or late 60s.  Should people hand over their farm before they turn 40 years of age?  That is ridiculous to entertain.  The matter is simple.  The Government can keep putting bushes in the gap and say farmers cannot qualify if they will not farm the land for six years after the owner has gone into care or has accessed the fair deal scheme, or that the person in charge of the farm at the time cannot rent it out.  It is ridiculous.  Take, for example, a man who is seriously injured.  Farming is a physically demanding occupation.  If something happens and the man must move to a nursing home, his wife may have a young family who must be minded and she may have to get a part-time job to try to keep food on the table.  If she is told she cannot access the fair deal scheme because she leases it out, that should not be entertained.  If that is shoved down people's throats, they will not take it because it is just not fair.</p> <p>  I have nothing against Mr. Redmond or any of our guests.  I accept that it is a combined effort of the Government, which resists giving farmers a fair deal when they get sick or must access a nursing home.  It is a combined effort of the Government and, perhaps, Department officials, although I do not suggest it was the fault of any of our guests.  When a chairman or member of a company becomes sick, is the value of all the parts of the company or business taken into account in the same way that a small family farm is hit when someone wants to access the fair deal scheme?</p><p>I hope it is not just farmers who are being hit by this.  I ask for an answer to my question.</p></speech>

The Deputy's point is well made, as were the points made by all the other speakers.  I have repeated our asks.  They are simple and straightforward for a number of reasons.  We have given examples, and Deputy Naughten repeated them, of the rules that apply in other Departments and parts of Government.  We look at the inequity of excluding farmers who lease their lands when it is a measure recommended by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in a number of other areas, as I outlined in my opening statement.  From a Government point of view, we need to see consistency through the different Departments.  If consistency were applied, it would solve many of the problems we have been discussing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.87" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Redmond" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019111300002#P00700"><p>I will not go back over old ground in respect of what we discussed, the different intents and rationale for different policies and how they are set up for different purposes, and all the unintended consequences that can arise.  We have looked at these issues in great detail and it is not as simple as just applying the measures suggested.  Deputy Healy-Rae raised the issue of sudden illness, which is an important point.  In 2009, when the original Act was being developed and debated, that was an issue that came up in great detail.  A clause was included in the scheme at the time providing that, in circumstances where a farmer or business operator, through no fault of their own, experiences a sudden illness or disability, for example, as a result of an injury, the three-year cap could apply provided he or she has been operating the farm or business and a family successor continues with it in his or her stead.  That has been a feature of the scheme.  What we are trying to do with the amendments is to build on that feature and broaden it so that the sudden illness and disability clause is not required.  We have moved on that position.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about companies.  This goes back to a current that runs through this morning's discussion, namely, the issue of equity.  One of the challenges is to segregate a type of asset for a particular policy purpose and to treat it differently from other assets.  That is what we are doing here and that effectively exists already in the scheme, with the sudden illness clause.  That also has to be consistent in terms of businesses and companies that are not farm-related.  That will continue to exist in the scheme under this proposal.</p> <p>  Somebody who is operating a business will also qualify for the three-year cap if he or she meets the same conditions that would have to be met if he or she was farming land.  One thing that differentiates businesses is that where a business is a limited company, the assets of the company are not the assets of the person.  By and large, these assets are not taken into account in the financial assessment, although the person's share in the company may be taken into account.  The assets of a limited company may not be taken into account because it is a separate legal entity.  All of that exists in the scheme and we are broadening it with this amendment, particularly in removing the requirement to have suffered a sudden illness or disability.  That is the angle we have taken in trying to build on that.</p> <p>  There are other safeguards built into the scheme as well, some of which we have discussed and some of which we have not discussed.  For example, the Deputy mentioned couples and farming families.  There is an asset disregard of &euro;72,000, which means that in the case of a coupe, the first &euro;72,000 is not included in the financial assessment.  There are other safeguards in the scheme to try to create a level of fairness around issues such as that.</p> <p>  To return to the discussion with Deputy O'Connell on the issue of people's vulnerability, I was not suggesting that because someone is in a nursing home, he or she has, by default, some level of vulnerability.  That is not the point I was making.</p></speech>

Is the value of that borrowed farm taken into account or will it continue to be taken into account and assessed if new provisions are made for farmers?</p></speech>

However, there are a range of allowable deductions in the scheme, one of which is interest on a mortgage in the purchase of an asset.  The interest can be discounted from the financial assessment.</p></speech>

It is wrong that this will be calculated as part of the assessment.  We know farmers have done their best through the generations to hand the farm on to the next generation in as good or better condition as when they got it in the first place.  Insisting that someone who accesses the fair deal scheme must pay back &euro;7,500 on each &euro;100,000 of the value of the farm land would mean that &euro;35,000 per year would be paid for three years in the case of a farm valued at &euro;500,000.  That would place a burden of &euro;105,000 on a young farmer trying to take over a farm who would be behind as soon as he or she starts out.  Credit is hard to get from banks and the other lending institutions.  What this will most likely mean for young fellows who find themselves in this situation is that they will have to walk away and sell the farm that was handed down to them.  The farm may have been in the family for five or six generations.  Is that what the Government will allow to happen in this day and age?  It is not fair and should not be the case.</p></speech>

Any asset that has been transferred over five years before someone goes into nursing home care is disregarded and not included in the financial assessment.  I have said already, as have others, that I would strongly encourage all those who are involved in farming or a farm business to plan ahead, consider their succession options and put in place mechanisms for succession.  If they do that, much of this conversation will have been unnecessary.  We know that for various reasons and through no one's fault, that is sometimes not possible but, by and large, it is possible with good planning.  I encourage as many people as possible to do that because we will not have to consider the asset within the financial assessment.  It comes back to the purpose of the scheme, which is to provide financial support.</p><p>The State provides financial support to avail of nursing home care which is based on means.  Those who have income and many assets pay more.  That is the basic principle of the scheme.</p></speech>

Alternatively, does one allow the income in the other two to be offset against the higher assessment figure, say, of 7.5%?  That would mean that the rental income would be offset against the settlement figure of 7.5%.</p></speech>

Iincome and assets are treated differently under the scheme.  Income is treated at the 80% rate, while assets are treated at 7.5%.  While there may be linkages, they are separate sets of means.  Income is treated in one way and assets in another.  There is no choice for anybody as regards how they are treated under the scheme.</p></speech>

However, we do not know at this point how it will shape up.</p> <p>  Part of the funding we secured in budget 2020 was to allow us to commence a programme of rigorous testing of different approaches to the statutory homecare scheme and the delivery of homecare under the new scheme in 2020.  The testing programme is being developed between the Department and HSE and some of these issues will be looked at in that context.  There are probably some issues that are quite natural and which may not have an impact.  I cannot say for definite until the process is completed, but the expectation that somebody will pay 80% of his or her income while still living at home, compared to somebody living in a nursing home in which a certain amount services are provided, including bed and board, is not likely to be compatible.  It is a key feature that we will have to examine.  It will all start to become more apparent next year as we work through the testing programme.  My understanding is we will test slightly different approaches in different areas to build a profile of what will actually work under the new scheme.</p></speech>

I am conscious that this has been a long session and that they have been here for longer than I have.</p> <p>  On the question of vulnerability, we should not hesitate to acknowledge the fact that we will all become vulnerable as we grow older.  People are in nursing homes precisely because they are vulnerable.  That is why this is an important debate.  Mr. Redmond was kind to acknowledge and clarify this, but it was probably not necessary for him to do so.</p> <p>  I return to the question of extending the eligibility criteria to include a situation where land is leased.  I apologise if I am cutting stubble.  On the one hand, the tax incentives for long-term leases are to achieve the particular policy objective of promoting land mobility.  Mr. Redmond considered the different policy objective of ensuring families could be enabled to continue farming a productive asset.  He stated these were two different policy objectives and that he was considering them together.  Speaking about family vulnerability, I am somewhat close to this problem, but I do not know how extensive it is.  However, it seems that families sometimes lease land in order to be able to continue farming a productive asset.  I am thinking of people who are caring for a person in the home.  While it might become a more challenging task, they might want to continue to do so for as long as is possible.  It might be in contemplation of the possibility that at some point in the future nursing home care might be required.  One might have a situation where a family would prefer to lease land for a period to allow them to focus on the provision of care and cope with something that could be challenging.  However, they are prevented from doing so because if they have leased land, at some point in the future when they seek to avail of nursing home care, they will not be able to avail of the cap.  Is that not an anomaly?  Is it not very unfair?  Does Mr. Healy agree with me that it is one of the possible range of scenarios that might arise?  Is it correct that there may be cases where people want to lease land precisely to postpone the day when they will need to avail of nursing home care?  This is an issue that needs to be taken into account.  What is the fundamental objection to extending the eligibility criteria to include leased land?</p></speech>

To recognise certain situations, we have introduced a measure whereby one only needs to have been working it in three of the past five years.  The reason for this is to address some of these issues but also to be clear on the fact that one has to show some intention.  The real plan is that one will work the land or that one&rsquo;s family successor will.</p> <p>  Again, it is one thing to look at one policy and its objective and another to look at another policy and its objective.  We have to look at all of the consequences in dealing with these issues which are necessarily directly related.  If one is talking about leasing, one is talking about something which is passive in terms of a person's involvement.  A person leases land, but by default he or she does not have to do much with it.  The issue is that potential applicants have a range of assets such as stocks and shares.  All of their assets become qualifiable under the conditions of the scheme.  That is one of the major dangers.  One would end up getting to a situation where all assets would be capped.  That would have a significant impact on the sustainability of the scheme.</p> <p>  Part of what we are trying to do is recognise some situations and deliver on the recommendations made in the 2015 review.  At the same time, we have to be cognisant of the need to protect the scheme for what it is and its basic principles, as well as ensuring people can continue to be supported into the future.  As I stated in my opening statement, we are conscious of the ageing demographics and what lies ahead.  Anything that undermines the sustainability of the scheme is not good for citizens in a general sense.</p></speech>

Leasing has become an integral part of succession and is recognised by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Finance and across government.  It is incredible that there is a reluctance to treat it in the same way for the good of the scheme, agriculture and succession, as well as in ensuring land is well looked after and put to productive use.  That is the argument we are making.  We have the Bill, the leasing issue, the clawback and the issue of retrospection.  They are the four key issues.  There has to be an acknowledgement that leasing is a central part of succession.  That is what we are asking for as part of our four requests.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman and all public representatives.  Deputy Danny Healy-Rae referred to the IFA.  When all is said and done, it is a lobbying organisation.  Public representatives have the power to ensure it will be pushed at the various levels.

We have submitted our written statement, which we have been advised is very lengthy.  Therefore, we will endeavour to condense it in our presentation.</p> <p>  The issue of staffing in the health service is one on which we have been campaigning for more than a decade.  It involved us taking strike action earlier this year.  The issue still remains a major one for our members both in the hospital sector and in the community sector.  The main issues particular to nursing and midwifery are that nursing and midwifery as professions have a worldwide shortage.  We set out in the submission that the issues we face here are not unique to Ireland but, unfortunately, we have to work much harder to maintain our level of staffing and particularly to retain our graduates once they qualify.  We qualify 1,850 graduates a year and we will manage this year to hold on to approximately 900, which is good.  That is an improvement on previous years but, obviously, it is not good enough.  We have set out the turnover rates in our submission and there is considerable detail on that, which I would like to go through with the committee, if that is okay.  In the submission, we go through the global shortage and set out exactly what that means, which is that each country that requires nursing and midwifery is basically recruiting from the same pool.  We are largely dependent on the non-EU workforce made up of nurses who come from the Philippines, India and Nigeria.  They are the three top countries and are the countries on which the American countries, Canada and Australia also rely.  The recruitment costs are quite expensive for obvious reasons.</p><p>We must send teams to interview and then ensure that when we recruit, we provide accommodation for a period of time.  A stipend salary is also provided, estimated at a cost of &euro;11,000 per person, prior to taking up a job in the health service.  In the meantime, a recruitment pause was introduced in May, although the HSE continues to deny there is a pause.  In fact, it is very evident, including in the front-line workforce, and presents a real problem.  The circular issued by the HSE to service providers on 20 June states:</p><blockquote>- No new posts [other than those approved and funded developments via the existing national control process] or replacement posts can proceed to offer stage or be put onto the payroll in any CHO, HG or [section] 38.<br /><br />- No career break returnees or any other returns which are at the discretion of the employer can be allowed to take place during the period [this control] is in force.  Also, no increases to weekly hours of staff who are not already working full time can be allowed to take place or approved during the period that [this control] is in force.  Reductions to weekly hours can proceed.</blockquote><p>This means that we have applications from nurses to return from a career break and that they are being denied and that they are sitting at home.  Under the career break scheme, the employer has the right to postpone the return date by one year but must then lawfully take the employee back.  Unfortunately, we are absolutely crippled by the recruitment pause.  Our members report daily that they are working with completely inadequate numbers, that they cannot provide the required care and that conditions are unsafe.  Their physical and mental health is being affected to an absolutely unprecedented and unacceptable level and no one can be recruited because of the introduction of the pause.  It affects one third of the workforce and the turnover within the nursing and midwifery professions will be higher than in any other profession because of their numbers.  Therefore, they will be affected by the pause to a greater extent and that is what we are witnessing.<br/><br/>We cannot open additional beds.  We have had the overcrowding of hospitals reported this week at a figure of just over 100,000 people who are sick enough to be admitted to hospital and who require hospital care but for whom there are no beds.  It is an absolute scandal.  The figure is increasing week on week and we have been reporting it daily.  We view that reporting as a very important part of our role.  We do it in order to highlight that the health service is not working in the way it should be.  It is now a dangerous place to which to be admitted.  We have recently met groups that have reported to us that the admission of the elderly population, that is, those who are over 75 years of age, is at a higher rate than for those under 75.  They have nowhere else to go in certain circumstances because community step-down services are not available.  As there has been a decrease in palliative care services, people are being admitted to emergency departments and dying on trolleys.  That is not the service in which our members want to work and provide care or for which they want to apologiese continuously.<br/><br/>When we talk about workforce planning, we say there are a number of solutions.  In 2017 we presented all of these arguments to the Government and exhausted the machinery of the State through the WRC.  We reached an agreement which required an annual service plan and a workforce plan to be developed and funded by November each year.  The only year in which this was actually achieved was 2017.  It was ignored in 2018.  We met representatives of the HSE yesterday evening and it does not have a workforce plan for the professions of nursing and midwifery for 2019.  That makes it two Novembers for which we do not have a workforce plan.  What we have is a very serious restriction on the ability to recruit.  The memo of instruction, dated 20 June 2019, from the financial officer of the HSE requires that for any post that becomes vacant for whatever reason, for example, if someone retires, resigns or takes a period of leave, the replacement to be sanctioned by the chief officer or the head of the hospital group.  That is one person who must sign each form that eventually reaches that level.  Can the committee imagine the delays in this process, considering the size of the workforce in the health service?  There are approximately 70,000 staff in the acute hospital division and there is a turnover of staff.  Obviously, this introduces significant delays.  As late as Tuesday of this week, we were receiving reports from the directors of nursing in Cork University Hospital which is extremely overcrowded that they had been waiting for nearly three months for a response to the request that posts be advertised that had become vacant.  We had to intervene again this week in the matter of unfilled public health nurse posts in east Galway.  Services for the public are affected.  For example, when patients receive chemotherapy at home, they require a public health nurse.  The directors of public health nursing are saying such a service will have to cease because we cannot replace nurses.  <br/><br/>These are very real issues for citizens who are dependent on the public health service.  Until someone is in an overcrowded emergency department or ward, it is difficult to understand how serious the problem is and how serious the consequences are for those being cared for in areas that are overcrowded, with staff who are absolutely stressed and trying to provide a service that is safe.  It is simply not possible to do so.<br/><br/>We are delighted to be here to highlight these issues, but we believe a number of very practical solutions can be introduced immediately.  We ask the committee to make representations at the highest levels of government in that regard.  We must immediately bring an end to the current recruitment pause, particularly in the nursing and midwifery professions.  Once it ceases, there will be a ripple effect in recruitment for approximately six to eight months.  That is how long it takes to recruit to the professions of nursing and midwifery.  We also need to consider in the medium term increasing the number of undergraduate places.  We need to train more nurses and midwives at undergraduate level in order to have a steady supply.  As I said, we train approximately 1,850 across all disciplines.  We could accommodate a greater number.  We know, for example, that the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland registered 1,750 non-EU nurses in the last calendar year.  That is how many nurses are coming into the country to register to work in both the private and public sectors.<br/><br/>As part of the recent settlement of our dispute, we obtained agreement from the Government that it would fund the measurement tool to determine how many nurses and midwives were needed in hospitals in surgical and medical wards.  We have never had such a tool and it is Government policy to fund it.  It is called the framework for safe staffing and based on patient outcomes.  It was measured by a team of researchers led by University College Cork over two years in six wards in three hospitals.  What they concluded was that when the correct number of nurses were employed, the level of patient mortality and length of stay decreased, patient outcomes and retention of staff improved and the level of sick leave reduced, while there was a dramatic decrease in agency costs, all of which is good news and accepted by the Government.  The Minister for Health launched the policy, but it was not funded.  Therefore, as part of our strike settlement, we sought funding to be made available in this year's service plan for the nurse staffing framework.  As late as yesterday evening, we sought confirmation that this part of our settlement would be honoured because it is a huge plank and everyone agrees that it is right to base staffing levels not on funding but on patient outcomes.  Unfortunately, we have not yet received confirmation of the service plan, but we remind the HSE that the Labour Court recommendation that settled our dispute clearly sets out that funding has to be made available as part of this year's service plan, as well as the plans for 2020 and 2021, to fully roll out the framework over a three-year period.</p><p>This annual funding for the workforce strategy on which we had agreement in 2017 must form a normal part of business for the HSE annually.  Otherwise, we will continue to be reliant on agencies and an <i>ad hoc </i>filling of posts and there will be an inability to open new beds to relieve the pressure on the acute hospital system.  The working environment of our members in hospitals and the community, particularly in overcrowded hospitals, is such that their health and safety is being deliberately interfered with by the policy that has been introduced by their employer.  That cannot continue.  We are happy to answer any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

The answers I have received have all been rubbish.  One gets a standard reply stating that there is no recruitment freeze but, rather, a process through which the HSE is managing its funds.  That is rubbish.  It is a recruitment freeze aligned with a lack of retention planning and other matters on top of administrative burdens that have been put in place to slow down recruitment.  That is what is happening.  Nobody can tell me otherwise.  So many people have contacted me on this issue that I could probably take out my phone and get the details of 15 or 20 cases without having to check too hard.  The issue of those returning after leave is incredible.  I have had to contact hospital managers regarding cases where they stated they lacked nursing specialists in certain areas and I had people who were returning and wanted to go back to work.  In some cases, I had to embarrass the managers or argue that the staff needed to be taken on to fill the vacancies the hospitals are publicly stating exist.  In some cases, they were taken on.  It is a significant issue.  A modular unit in South Tipperary General Hospital will have to open in two tranches because the management cannot recruit sufficiently to staff it.  If the hospital manages to stick to its plan, 20 beds will be opened in January and another 20 will be opened five or six months later.</p> <p>  I have carried out a comparative analysis of statistics for two hospitals that are of the same scale and model, namely, UHL and Beaumont Hospital.  The Chair is well aware of my work on this issue.  There are 1,294 nursing and midwifery staff in Beaumont and 1,016 in UHL.  UHL has 349 health professionals compared with 527 in Beaumont and 228 support staff compared with 459 in Beaumont.  This matter is of such seriousness that it goes beyond politics.  I have never seen a situation like that in the hospital in Limerick this November.  I have no idea what it will be like there in January and February.  Several members of my family who have recently been in the hospital were left on trolleys for days or weekends.  Very elderly people have been left on trolleys.  Infection control is a significant issue there.  Patients have been moved to Nenagh Hospital to avoid infection.  That is not on.</p> <p>  The recruitment freeze must be lifted.  We need to deal with this issue immediately.  It has gone on for too long.  We need to address the recruitment freeze, the administrative burden and the lack of planning and so on.  I know the HSE and the Department of Health are watching these proceedings.  I am begging Mr. Paul Reid to deal with this issue.  I have written to him, spoken to him and questioned him.  My pleas have fallen on deaf ears.  I acknowledge he must try to meet his targets and do what he must do, but there must be other ways to reach those targets.  People are suffering badly.  The situation in Cork hospitals has escalated.  It was not too bad in previous years but the situation has been aggravated by a lack of specialist nurses in certain areas, in addition to other issues.</p> <p>  I have significant understanding of the issues and sympathy for those involved,.  My questions relate to details that could help us to formulate the necessary arguments.  I agree with the remarks of Ms N&iacute; Sheaghda.  Does she have statistics regarding geographical areas and specific hospitals that have the biggest issues?  She referred a slight increase in retention of graduates, which is to be welcomed.  What is behind that increase?  Is there a specific reason for it that we could push on a little more?  Does she have more information on the lack of places in step-down care?  Are there areas where particular issues have arisen?  It is definitely a problem in my area.  Has the INMO been consulted on the winter plan that is meant to be announced this week?  I have no idea what magic the Minister will come up with, but it will need to be magic.  If the INMO has been consulted on the plan, what is its opinion thereof?  Ms N&iacute; Shealghdha referred to a decrease in palliative care services, which is very disturbing and disheartening.  Have specific areas been affected in that regard?  I referred to the fact that beds in South Tipperary General Hospital cannot be opened because of a lack of nursing capacity.  The new modular unit should open in the first week of January but that seems doubtful.  I hope it will.  Are there similar situations elsewhere?  The workforce planning strategy was published in 2017.  Who initiated it?  Was it of benefit in the grand scheme of things?  I presume it was.  What has changed such that it has not been carried out in the past two years?  Is Ms N&iacute; Shealghdha aware of an example of its being of assistance?  I presume it was of assistance.  Why has it not been carried out since?</p> <p>  My hope is that the more we can focus on the areas, hospitals and policies that are not working and how they are affecting people, the more political traction we can get to deal with them.  Given where we are headed early next year, we need to deal with them urgently.  I am not being dramatic.  The statistics back me up.  This will be one of the worst periods in Irish healthcare.  A hospital clinical lead told me that the trajectory of overcrowding is such that he or she expects catastrophic events this winter.</p><p>What they mean by that is that people are going to die unnecessarily.  Would Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha agree with that statement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.120" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019111300002#V00200"><p>To answer the last question first, there is research that demonstrates that the period of time spent on a trolley causes the patient to have poorer health outcomes and unfortunately that means the patient is more than likely to have a very poor outcome.  That clearly is not good enough.</p> <p>  We sought the workforce plan as part of a dispute on the numbers of nurses and midwives employed in Ireland.  We have a maternity strategy that determines how many midwives we should have per birth.  We should have one midwife for 29.5 births.  That is the science and that is to ensure safe delivery of care to the mother and the baby.  We are now 220 plus midwives short of that target in all of our maternity units.  It is a national figure.  We know this.  The plan was put in place to recruit 90 in 2017 and the remainder in 2018.  The latest figure we have is that we are even further behind the 2017 figure than when we started because we have an inability to retain and to recruit.  This year when midwives graduated, we had to argue with employers to give them permanent jobs in Limerick, Galway and Letterkenny - throughout the country - despite the fact that the Minister for Health at our conference guaranteed that every graduating nurse would have a permanent contract.  That did not happen.  We recruited 900 because post strike, we concentrated on the low salary for the new graduates.  We have improvements to that, we explained that to new graduates.  We told them the salary is increasing; it is improving and the Minister for Health has guaranteed publicly that they would get a permanent job.  That led us to a situation in September where we had to argue, in many instances site by site, for the retention of our graduates, which is beyond comprehension.</p> <p>  The workplace plan does make a significant difference because those posts are funded and therefore the arguments about whether we can put the advertisement on the HSE website or whether we can recruit disappear.  The funding is there in advance, there is a set number and one's concentration is on filling the numbers set out in the workforce plan.  We had a very modest 1, 270 odd as a target for 2017.  The numbers who leave versus those who are recruited always leaves approximately 67%, onto which one must add.  If 1,000 nurses are needed, one needs to recruit 1,670 to reach 1,000 because the turnover through resignation and retirements requires that.  Very disappointingly, in the staff nurse grade according to the recent census, the numbers recruited since last December are down for that very reason.  The HSE will say it is recruiting nurses but what it will not say is how many left during the same period.  The margin is quite significant.  Consequently, one cannot take one's foot off the pedal for recruitment and retention in nursing and midwifery.  It is just too difficult to recruit without obstacles that an employer puts in.  If that is coupled with a moratorium or a pause, one will be going backwards for several years.  Unfortunately, we will be going backwards.  </p> <p>  As for the geographical areas, we have a lot of information from various hospitals.  There is no doubt but that the HSE sites are affected to a greater extent.  The voluntary hospitals, the section 38 agencies - the Mater, Beaumont, St. James's - use a much more sensible approach.  They try to recruit and retain and have a bit more autonomy in doing that.  In respect of the statistics comparing Beaumont and UHL, Beaumont's argument has always been that it is a tertiary referral centre for neurosurgery in particular, which requires a higher staffing level in some of its intensive care units etc.  It does a good job of trying to recruit and the committee will notice from the trolley figures that it has also done a good job in respect of trying to reduce the trolley count by ensuring, lobbying and getting additional capacity in the community in various units around north Dublin and that requires funding. </p></speech>

It is very simple.  If additional beds are required, as the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Sl&aacute;intecare report tell us we need, staffing needs to be planned around those and getting to that point.  We are not doing that.  In fact, we are doing the opposite.  We are closing the lid firmly on recruitment.  It is simply counterproductive.  The staff in our grades, nursing and midwifery particularly, are not hanging around.  They are going to the UK, and particularly now, with the emphasis on Brexit, the UK has become extremely active in recruiting from the Republic of Ireland on the basis that it is not getting nurses who will travel to work from other European countries.  We have a real problem.  The Deputy said that he has written to Paul Reid, we have written to him also.  We believe that the solution is very simple.  One should look at the 2017 workforce plan and do what is supposed to be done in accordance with the agreement we have under the Workplace Relations Commission, that is, an agreed, funded, workforce plan for nursing and midwifery.  If there is a need to pause, then one pauses but one makes sure those posts are filled because they are essential.</p></speech>

What has the HSE said about the recruitment pause?  The Minister has said there is no pause.  In Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha's opinion, what are the reasons for any slowdown or pause?</p> <p>  She mentioned that insufficient staff were available to staff wards and that there were beds available.  She said many beds are available that cannot be used due to lack of adequate staffing.  That is a simple question.</p> <p>  We had a meeting with the heads of services in our area in the past few days.</p><p>They seem to be optimistic about getting to grips with the situation in a much better manner than they had been able to do previously, for a variety of reasons.  Can Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha tell us about the extent to which and the manner in which staffing levels are affected by career breaks?  As she said, it has not been possible to allow people returning from career breaks to take up their permanent positions.  To what extent has that affected the delivery of services?  Where have such effects most often been recognised?  Which region has been most affected in this fashion?  On the question of recruitment and retention, can Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha give us an indication of the people who are most likely to be difficult to retain?  Are they people who have been indigenously recruited or people who have been recruited through overseas recruitment?  How does that affect the delivery of the service?  Does Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha find that it is more difficult to retain those who have been recruited from overseas?  Obviously, they may want to go back home.  Where do they go?  Has any of this been researched?  Do they go to other overseas countries?  I have some other questions that I would like to ask after Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha has answered the questions I have already asked.</p></speech>

There is a pause.  The memo of 20 June 2019 sets out the particulars around it.  No job can be offered and no recruit can be put on the payroll unless the correct process has been followed and the relevant form has been signed by the single national official who is in charge of this area.  That is a fair bar when we are talking about over 70,000 people in a service.</p></speech>

The point we are making is that a pause of this nature will have an effect on those grades that comprise a third of the workforce because the turnover happens more regularly.  The budgeting is the reason.  We are told that last year's overrun cannot recur this year.  All recruitment is being stopped as a very crude instrument until the budget is brought down.  I understand the relevant number at the moment is approximately 350.  That is what the target has become.  I will explain how the pause, which is affecting the front-line service, is manifesting itself.  Some of the bed numbers that currently exist have been reduced.  More importantly, we now have extra capacity on wards.  We record that on a daily basis.  As well as having additional trolleys in accident and emergency departments, there are additional trolleys on wards.  I will mention an example of the reduced volume of workers that was given to us as late as last evening.  Four nurses were supposed to be going on night duty, but instead there were just two.  They should have had 28 beds, but instead they had 32 because of additional trolleys.  It is simply not possible to provide any level of safe care in that environment.  That is not an isolated incident.</p></speech>

The staffing of those beds known as "surge beds" is a mixture of agency staff, which is very costly, and very poor staffing numbers.  According to the last figure we had, just under 460 beds are closed throughout the country.  We know from the Sl&aacute;intecare and ESRI reports that we are down approximately 2,000 acute beds, based on the projected need and the fact that community services have not been developed to provide an alternative to acute hospitals.  The Deputy asked what happens when people on career break are refused the right of return.  Invariably, they will work as agency staff.  In some instances, they will be employed through agencies.  In other instances, they do not work as a nurse for a period of time or they go to the private sector.  The point is that all of this is nonsensical.</p></speech>

We know that since December 2018, the number of staff nurses working in the public health service has decreased by 395.  We know the levers and we can measure that.  The last statistics in that regard are from 2017.  The number of overseas nurses working in Ireland is continuing at a pace.  Approximately 1,700 are being registered.  That includes the private sector.  We get those statistics from the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, which has to register people who request to work here.  We continue to be very dependent on our overseas colleagues to provide services.  The Deputy also asked about where nurses are being recruited to.  Nurses in general are being recruited to England first and to Australia second.</p></speech>

It does not matter whether they trained in Ireland or they trained in a different jurisdiction and have experience of working in the Irish system.  The Canadian health service looks to Ireland.  When I attended a conference in Canada recently, I met a nurse who worked in the Mater hospital for six years.  He is originally from the Philippines.  He was recruited from Ireland to Canada along with six other people from his community with whom he had been recruited to Ireland in the first instance.  Many recruitment agencies look at the Irish market with a view to recruiting nurses who were trained in Ireland and nurses who have experience in Ireland.  It is seen as a good place to recruit from.  When we introduce a pause, we make it more difficult to retain.  It makes absolutely no sense.</p></speech>

We will take it up again.  We will take it up with the HSE as well.  I would like to ask Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha about the need for more undergraduate places.  What is her view on the wisdom of increasing the number of undergraduate places here, bearing in mind the extent to which they tend to go abroad afterwards?  It is generally accepted that it is not rewarding, from the point of view of the delivery of health services in this jurisdiction, for large numbers of medical and nursing graduates to go abroad, perhaps after staying at home for a year.  A pattern must be identified as we look at what will happen if we end up handing over our graduates to the highest bidder after we have trained them.  That is where we are going.  We have dealt with this matter here.  At a meeting here not so long ago, we were told by the HSE that we have to compete with Canada, Sydney, New York and the Middle East every time a post is advertised.  In some of those jurisdictions, tax-free salaries of up to &euro;120,000 are available.  We cannot compete with that here.</p><p>In order to retain a reasonable staffing level and thereby provide a secure health service, how can we encourage graduates to remain here or encourage graduates from abroad to come here?  Must we train staff from overseas in our training schools to try to provide the service expected and, in the course of doing so, improve the quality of life for staff at all levels in the health service?  It is a convoluted way to ask the question.  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha has heard it before.</p></speech>

I am not mixed up at all; I am quite clear on this.  We have had representatives of the HSE here, asked the questions and got the answers.  We keep asking the same questions and getting the same answers.  How can we arrive at a situation whereby, by one means or another, be it recruitment at home or recruitment overseas, we can have an adequate level of staff, including nurses, medical staff and consultants, in our hospitals?  I appreciate that Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha has no function regarding medical and consultant staff.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.160" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019111300002#X00600"><p>The issue this year and last year was not that people are not interested in working when they graduate; it is that they were prevented from getting jobs because there was a recruitment pause or because jobs were not available to them to apply for.  As I stated, we had to work very hard as a trade union to ensure graduates  were offered posts this year.  That was following a commitment from the Minister for Health that they all would be.</p> <p>  There are two fairly simple solutions.  There is oversubscription in respect of school leavers applying to do nursing, which is good.  Therefore, we know that students in school who are considering their career choices still consider nursing.  Although the CSO figures indicate a drop, there is still oversubscription.  The point is that if we provide more undergraduate places, they will be filled.  We need to train more nurses and midwives but we also need to make sure that when they qualify, there will be jobs made available to them.  That is simply done.  We have put our proposal in this regard to the HSE in the past.  When nurses and midwives are trained, they become employees in their fourth year.  The get a contract of employment for 36 weeks.  That contract needs to be extended to include the first year after qualification.  It is simple.  It cuts out all the bureaucracy of recruitment.  The point is that the individuals are qualified and trained.  Once they pass their exams, posts should be made available to them in order to consolidate their training.  This would guarantee that they would stay.  If they do not, they will have a reason other than one we are currently battling, which is that posts are not being offered to them.</p> <p>  In the context of existing places, there are 920 for general nursing, 140 for general and sick children, 420 for mental health, 210 for intellectual disability and 140 for midwifery.  That amounts to 1,830.  As stated in our submission, the conservative estimate from the workforce planners involved the development of the new children's hospital is that we will need 300 sick-children nurses over and above the current number.  We are training 140 for general and sick children, which means some of them will remain in the general service after qualification.  That is a four-year programme.  Accounting for resignations, retirements, etc., we know this end that we will not have enough.  Therefore, we need to increase the number significantly in order to staff the hospital.</p> <p>  We stated in our submission that much of the debate has been on the capital expenditure on the children's hospital.  The workforce planning has not got an airing.  It needs to because, although a very expensive hospital may be opened, it may not be possible to staff it.  Therefore, some of the wards will remain closed.  Those responsible for staffing must be cognisant of the fact that each of the rooms in the wards will be different.  Being single rooms, a higher number of staff will be required.  This is particularly the case for a children's hospital.  That is a genuine issue.  There are two ways of dealing with that.  One is to recruit intensively now and do everything possible to retain every graduate within the discipline.  That includes removing all obstacles of a procedural nature that are introduced by the employer, including a pause in recruitment.  The second way involves increasing the number of undergraduate places to ensure supply will meet the need.</p></speech>

For as long as I can remember, no new institution that ever opened had an adequate supply of staff at the time even though the staffing requirement was well anticipated.  This goes back as far as the opening of Beaumont Hospital, which was a long time ago.  Beaumont was not open for about a year after it was built because of a lack of staff.  At least that is what we were told at the time.</p> <p>  The aspect that irks me most is the pause.  When it came, it affected all staff, even though this committee was raising time and again the need for medical and nursing staff to be prioritised.  I refer to front-line staff.  I do not expect Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha to answer this question but she can give me a hint if she wants to.  Who made the decision?  Was it the Minister, the HSE or somebody at mid-management level who believed it would be a good idea?  Has anybody been identified as the culprit in failing to prioritise recruitment to ensure the required levels of nursing and medical staff?</p></speech>

It is Government policy to stay within budget.  The HSE has issued the recruitment pause and all its properties by memo to the system.  It is not a secret.  Clearly, however, the HSE has to answer to the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

From our perspective, the most important point we are trying to make at this committee is that there is a ready-made solution.  There is a pre-existing agreement indicating there is a need for a workforce plan that is funded to cater for the numbers of nursing and midwifery staff required to provide a public health service that is safe.  We are aware, although we do not like reporting it, that people are now afraid of going to public hospitals.  They are afraid of the waiting time and they are afraid that they will not be seen on time.  That is very unfortunate.  It should not be happening in 2019.</p></speech>

We are trying to keep St. Joseph's Shankill dementia care centre open so we had a big rally outside the gates.  I needed to be there.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the work of the INMO's members.  The current system is extraordinarily difficult.  Almost every interaction I have had with public hospitals and some of the community-based services - the nursing services - points to extraordinarily dedicated nurses and midwives working in what are becoming impossible conditions.  The circumstances were very difficult and demanding, leading to demoralisation and burnout, but I am now seeing conditions that are inhumane.  Ms N&Iacute; Sheaghdha used the word "inhumane" recently.  I acknowledge the work the nurses and midwives are doing to keep the system going in what are inhumane conditions.</p><p>I read through the INMO opening statement last night with a mixture of despair and frustration that the INMO needed to come here asking for something as basic as a workforce plan.  There are something like 30,000 nurses and midwives in the system and we have thousands of doctors in the system, and the idea that there is not a plan for training, recruitment, retention and promotion of nurses and midwives in our hospital system beggars belief.  As the INMO lays out, there was a Government commitment to do so.  Is it the case the HSE does not have a workplace plan for nurses and midwives for 2018, 2919 or 2020?  Is that essentially what the INMO is saying? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.170" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019111300002#Y00200"><p>In 2017, we negotiated through the Workplace Relations Commission a funded workforce plan for nursing and midwifery and the numbers were set out within each of the categories.  That was to be repeated in November 2018 and November 2019, and it has not been.  A workforce plan is grand in theory but it has to be funded, so the key is that we get a funded workforce plan.  The funded workforce plan for 2017 was fairly modest, considering our turnaround.  We know how many nurses we need to recruit in order to just replace those who retire and resign.  The workforce plan was designed in that year with the assistance of the WRC to ensure we at least broke even at the end of the year.  However, as I reported earlier to the committee, we know now that we are further behind in 2019 than we were in 2017.  For example, the maternity strategy required an increase of just over 240 midwives to maintain a safe level of care, given 1:29 births is the threshold.  Dr. Peter Boylan was on radio this weekend describing what it means for situations in maternity hospitals and general hospitals when there are two midwives looking after a very large volume of very seriously ill patients, and the consequences of that.</p></speech>

I apologise to the Chair if I am covering ground that has already been covered.  Given it is obvious a workforce plan is needed, given we are looking at one-year, five-year and ten-year thinking and investment in training, in graduate courses and in recruitment and retention, and given there is a commitment in place for that, and it is plain as day that we need it, what is the INMO's view as to why these commitments have not been honoured by Government?  It is something the Government committed to and something we obviously need.  What is the INMO's sense as to why the Government has reneged on these promises?</p></speech>

We can overrun in our capital spend but we cut back on the workforce because that is the only easy method of reducing the annual cost.</p> <p>  We are still running our health services on an annual budget.  We have challenged both the political system and the HSE itself on this.  The Sl&aacute;intecare report clearly states we cannot plan on a yearly basis when we have a service like ours, which has a growing elderly population and an increased cost of pharmacology.  We are very proud to work in a health service that develops and is developing new, innovative ways of looking after and improving population health.  Unfortunately, we cannot do that and then cut the workforce.</p></speech>

I said I am being contacted by nurses who are telephoning hospitals around the country, and I named various hospitals, and they are being told there is a recruitment ban in place.  I put it directly to HSE management and they said unambiguously there is no recruitment ban in place.  They then caveated that by saying that, of course, if they do not have X, Y and Z in place, they may not be allowed to hire anybody.  It is certainly my contention, but is it the INMO's contention that there is essentially a recruitment pause or ban in place at the moment for nurses and midwives?</p></speech>

It states that the mandated interim controls provide that no new posts, other than those approved and funded developments via the existing national control process, or replacement posts can proceed to offer stage or be put onto the payroll in any community health care organisation, hospital group or section 38.  That is a pause.  In fact, it is a moratorium - that is exactly what it is.</p></speech>

I thank Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha for that.  Some really good progress was made by the INMO over the last two years in terms of getting agreed safe staffing levels.  When I go into the acute hospitals, what the doctors and nurse managers say is that they do not have the nurses on the ward.  I was in a hospital recently and one nurse seemed to be doing all the work in two wards.  I looked and I thought that she looked very young, so I went and had a chat with her.  Of course, she is young; she is a student and not a qualified nurse.  The INMO made good progress in terms of the research and then, I thought, agreement with Government to get to safe staffing levels.  Certainly, I know my own anecdotal experience of our healthcare system and while it may be I am wandering into the least staffed wards around, I bet I am not.  Has there been any progress on getting to safe staffing levels for nurses and midwives?</p></speech>

The progress we made, which is Government policy and which we were very supportive of, was the policy framework on safe staffing on surgical and medical wards for nurses and healthcare assistants.  This is a measurement tool that determines how many are needed.  When this framework was piloted in Beaumont, Loughlinstown and Our Lady of Lourdes in Drogheda, it proved to do a number of things.  The main one was that it cut the spend on agency staff significantly - from 100 to 30 was one of the examples given.  It improved the patient experience significantly, reduced the length of stay in an acute hospital, which is the most expensive part of our healthcare provision, improved retention of staff and improved and reduced burnout and sick leave.  It ticks all of the boxes from a patient perspective and from an economic perspective because it saves money.</p> <p>  The agreement, as part of our strike settlement, was that that would be funded in 2019 outside of the service plan to the tune of &euro;5 million and that, in the service plan for this year, which covers 2020 and 2021, there would be sufficient funding available to roll it out across all of the remaining hospitals.  We met the HSE last evening and we asked what is the progress, where is the service plan and how much is being assigned to the framework.  Clearly, if, in a strike settlement which covers from May to the end of the year, one is allocating &euro;5 million, one will need to allocate a minimum of &euro;10 million for a full year.  They were unable to tell us.  It is still, they tell us, a dialogue between the HSE, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We are very clear this is part of the strike settlement and it has to be funded and implemented.  Otherwise, it is a breach of the agreement. </p></speech>

That is being rolled out and nine co-ordinator positions have been advertised across the country.  Nine co-ordinators at nursing grade will oversee that.  The uplift at the pilot sites at Beaumont, Loughlinstown and Our Lady of Lourdes in Drogheda to meet the safe level of staffing has been maintained in the large wards and areas.  However, in some instances it has not been maintained because of the normal recruitment issues.  When the emphasis on the pilot was reduced, shall we say, funding then had to be found within the hospitals' budget.  This requires national funding.  It is national policy, agreed by Government and it was launched by the Minister for Health as a policy that will ensure good patient outcomes, safe levels of care and an economic way of staffing wards.</p></speech>

She loves her job and loves being a midwife.  She has undertaken all sorts of extra study, training and education, including completing a master's degree in midwifery.  She works in one of the Dublin hospitals.  She said that her job has gotten so difficult, the cost of living has gone up so much, congestion has gotten so bad and the conditions in which she is trying to treat mums and their babies are such that, with a very heavy heart, she is currently looking for a job in the local supermarket.  I talk to nurses on the wards and I keep hearing stories of nurses being burnt out.  This is particularly true in certain areas like emergency medicine.  We know there is pressure on the entire system but are there particular pressure points where it is becoming more difficult, where INMO members are under even more pressure than is the norm?  Are there pressure points in particular areas like emergency medicine, paediatrics, oncology or in certain parts of the country where, as a matter of urgency, we need to act immediately?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the pressure exists throughout the system.  The statistics that we have show us that there is an increase in resignations at nurse manager grades.  Nurse managers are now finding it extremely difficult to manage in a system into which they have no financial input and over which they have no control in terms of who is recruited, how recruitment takes place or even whether recruitment can take place, despite the clinical need.  The lack of autonomy of nursing managers is causing an increase in resignations, as evidenced by the statistics.  That is hugely problematic.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, because of the staffing levels, that is not always possible.  In fact, it is the norm for nurse managers to take a patient caseload as well as carry out their management functions and that is simply not possible.  That causes burnout.  Nurse managers tell us that in some cases nurses, some of whom are not even trained, are taking charge of areas.  Employment controls are in place and there are not enough staff working.  This means that nurse managers go on duty to find that instead of the six nurses required, there are only three.  Patient volumes have increased because the emergency department is overcrowded and there are additional trolleys on the ward.  What do the nurse managers do?  It is impossible.  If the nurse manager makes a mistake or if there is an omission of care, he or she will be referred to the registration body to determine fitness to practise.  That is the strain under which nurse managers are working.  It is inhumane.  That is the only word that describes it adequately.  The employer's health and safety obligations are being completely ignored in these circumstances.  The employer is obliged to provide a safe place of work for nurses and midwives.  They go to work with the aim of doing a good day's work but they are being prevented from providing safe care because of the moratorium.  The system does not discriminate positively towards front-line staff, which it should do.</p></speech>

I could also say thanks to the members of the INMO but everyone says that.  There is never a bad word said about nurses.  I do not know how many times people in my clinics in Swords, Balbriggan and elsewhere say that they do not know how nurses put up with it or how they do what they do.  However, it is getting beyond the point of being reasonable at this stage.  I was thinking earlier of the last moratorium on recruitment, of which Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha would have been aware.  She and I would have worked together at that time.  Again, it was the same story from Government in terms of denial.  As Yogi Bear says, it is like <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>all over again.</p><p>It is right that we focus on patients, 603 of whom are on trolleys today, according to the INMO.  We have already hit the 100,000 mark this year, which is an absolute shame on this Government, its policies and those who support it.  I am interested in the impact on front-line staff.  If one goes back to 2007, one of the issues that we would have raised at the time was the potential long-term impact of the moratorium.  Has there been any recovery from the 2007 moratorium?  I do not recall a massive uplift in recruitment in the interim that would have buffered us against this new moratorium.  It is not just this year's moratorium but also the historic impact of the previous moratorium that we are dealing with now.  If my memory serves me, the Government imposed a moratorium on the health service first and then on every other sector about two years later.  </p></speech>

The census figure for August 2019 was 37,998.  Of that figure, 882 were students in training.  That leaves us with about 37,116 qualified nurses, so we have not recovered.  That is the point we are making.  Introducing a pause to nursing and midwifery has a longer-term effect and it is very much an expensive game to be in considering the global shortage.</p></speech>

It is clear that there have been implications and we are living with them.  Regarding the impact of this on staff, my understanding is that there are a number of implications where there has been a failure to recruit and the staffing levels are low.  One is the cost of agency staff.  We know that this is only going in one direction.  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha might outline the figures if she has them.  If not, she can send them on to us.  The second implication is around the issue of the workplace becoming a dangerous place for workers.  There is a direct relationship between the levels of staffing and the levels of assault, so if Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha has some information that, I would appreciate hearing it.  I would like not just to find out the figures, because I know that there is an issue with healthcare professionals.  I know from my previous work that there is significant under-reporting of assaults.  We know that is happening.  Will Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha outline the numbers and types of assaults and their impact on the workplace, not just in terms of time lost but in terms of morale and the work environment for nurses and midwives who are up against it and indeed all healthcare workers?  Would that it were exclusive to one particular grade group or category of workers, but we see a lot of shortages among front-line staff.  Will Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha outline the impact this has on the workforce?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.208" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019111300002#AA00400"><p>Again, the Deputy is correct.  The correlation between assaults and staffing levels is well documented in nursing and midwifery across European and international studies that have proved that when staffing levels are reduced, unfortunately, assault numbers go up.  HSE assault figures are recorded by hospital group.  Traditionally, they would have only been recorded for the HSE hospitals with the voluntary hospitals being left outside of that, so we do not have a full figure but we know that 60% of all assaults are perpetrated against nursing, are recorded as being perpetrated against nursing and midwifery staff, and are on the increase.  The issues are that assaults are not confined to what we would have traditionally viewed as areas of concern such as psychiatry and emergency departments.  We see an increased incidence in locations such as children's hospitals and care of the elderly.  Again, there is no excuse.  It is a requirement of the employer to provide a safe place of work.  In particular, with regard to emergency departments, we have an agreement dating back nearly six years where security personnel must be employed.  Our members report to us that there are incidences when that is not the case, which is unacceptable.  Assaults constitute a problem that is increasing.</p> <p>  In addition, we have significant cross-infection in hospitals with which staff must cope.  Staff are becoming unwell themselves because of the incorrect overcrowding and all that goes with that when there is a contagious condition.  These are the well-documented consequences that are well known to the employer and the Health and Safety Authority.  The employer is obliged to notify the Health and Safety Authority when somebody is absent for three days as a result of an assault at work, so all those figures are available and known.  No more than anything else, the pause does not stipulate that the grades of nursing and midwifery be treated in a manner that is any different from any other grade employed in the health service.</p></speech>

To be fair, his response is that they prioritise the health and safety of staff.  Is it common for a security guard not to be physically present?  The response I sometimes get is that there will be a security presence in the hospital but it will not necessarily be in the emergency department.

Regarding the winter plan, and I know this was raised previously, will Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha outline best practice because we love that?  It involves best international practice and looking at somewhere where they are getting it right, where they are getting their winter initiative and planning correct and are bang on the money.  I assume they would publish their plans much earlier than we do.  My understanding is that it is expected next week.  I apologise if this question was asked previously but will Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha outline the level of negotiation that has taken place and the funded element of that if there is one for workplace planning?</p></speech>

We have requested that the winter plan be published towards the end of August.  The response we get from the HSE is that it is planning all year for the winter.  I am not being flippant about it but we know that the overcrowding figures have increased significantly this year during the summer.  They are moving towards 100,000 and it is early November, so we know that whatever plan is there is obviously not working.  We are advised that the winter plan will be published this Thursday, which is tomorrow.  We expect that there will be some announcement in respect of the additional provision of home care packages and services through the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  If there are announcements around additional beds at this point in the year, it will be impossible to staff those beds because the pause will remain in place and the pause has caused people who graduated in Ireland to make decisions around where they work.  We managed to increase the number of graduates who were employed, but not all of them were offered jobs and they do not hang around.  This is the point we made earlier.  Likewise, when a service is working short-term continuously, people do have choices and there is a really active recruitment campaign from the UK and the private hospitals in Ireland.  If the announcement indicates that additional beds, which we know are needed in community settings and in long-term and step-down care, will be made available, our fear is that it will be impossible to open them because the staffing crisis is such that we do not have staff to recruit to staff those beds.</p></speech>

There is the obstacle of making the job available, plus we know, thankfully, that school-leavers still consider careers in nursing and midwifery to be attractive.  The numbers applying for courses still exceed the numbers of places available.  Therefore, if the number of places is increased, there will be applicants.  The trick is, as we have said on a number of occasions, to make a contract of employment available in the fourth year when they become employees that will expand the initial period post-qualification.  That seems to be entirely sensible to us.  It would give us a ready and guaranteed stream of graduates every year.  The numbers of college places and the clinical placements have increased slightly since 2017 in specific disciplines.  There is a need to increase numbers, particularly, as we said, in children's nursing, intellectual disability and mental health services, as well as the general sphere.  The overall intake can and must be increased.</p></speech>

I note the discussions with the private educator, but I am not convinced that it will shore up the gap in any meaningful way.</p> <p>  I thank the representatives of the INMO for coming as I know that they are busy, but it is very useful for us to get the picture from the front line.  I thank INMO members for the work they do day in and day out.  We need to be able to get to grips with this problem and this is an opportunity to highlight the issues.  We need to start to hear about the Government's plans to deal with it as we are caught in a very expensive spiral.</p></speech>

Sl&aacute;intecare makes a proposal which is accepted for a regionalisation of the HSE into six regions based on hospital groups.  Will that make recruitment and retention easier?  Will it reduce the number of steps required to recruit somebody in the organisations?</p> <p>  On limiting recruitment, a moratorium or a pause, does the INMO believe the Department of Health and the HSE understand it is a counter-intuitive move?  Limiting recruitment will have knock-on effects.  There will be an increase in the levels of unmet need and waiting lists and poorer outcomes for patients.  Patients do not tend to go away.  If they are not receiving a service in one location, they will seek it in another, unfortunately, in emergency departments.</p> <p>  Is there still a pay differential for nurses?  If so, what effect does it have on recruitment?  Does the INMO believe nurses are valued within the system or are they seen as a resource, rather than employees?  Are they encouraged to advance their careers by increasing their professional education to gain extra qualifications which can be fed back into the system?  I understand there is very little financial support in that regard, as well as limited opportunities to take leave to attend education courses.</p> <p>  Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha spoke about the recruitment of overseas nurses.  Did I understand her correctly that it costs up to &euro;11,000 to recruit an overseas nurse?  Surely that is-----</p></speech>

Are theatres closed because hospitals cannot recruit sufficient numbers of theatre nurses?  It feeds down through the system, with a backlog of surgical cases backing down into emergency departments.  What is happening in emergency departments is just a symptom of what is happening in the health service.  Because of what is happening elsewhere in the health service, community services and the supply of beds and recruitment, people end up in emergency departments unnecessarily and inappropriately in some cases.  Their progress through the emergency department is then limited because of the lack of bed capacity and recruitment.  I ask Ms N&iacute; Sheaghdha to comment on these issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.223" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019111300002#BB00700"><p>I will deal with the final point first.  Theatre time is not being utilised largely because hospitals are admitting a large number of medical patients to beds through the emergency department.  The majority of patients admitted through emergency departments are medical patients.  Therefore, the post-operative beds are simply not available.  One will often hear stories from patients who are taken directly from the emergency department to theatre and then to the recovery room in some instances for two or three nights because no ward bed is available for them.  That is impacting on patients booked in for elective procedures.  If no bed is identified, obviously they cannot be asked to come.  Many patients talk about elective operations being cancelled repeatedly because of the lack of availability of beds.</p> <p>  Theatre nurses are highly trained and skilled and in short supply.  While we have managed to keep numbers sufficiently above the threshold, the requirement to provide an on-call service impacts significantly on them.  As well as working a 39-hour week, they also need to provide an on-call service which in many instances takes them out of the service.  We need to staff theatres inclusive of the on-call commitment.  Basing it on a 39-hour week is not helping to determine the correct number because every single night of the week an on-call team needs to be available and in some instances two, depending on the specialty involved.  In some hospitals where maternity services are also a feature, if there is an emergency, the hospital might only have one on-call team to deal with an emergency and it might have an emergency obstetrics case.  It has become a significant risk in some hospitals, particularly those outside the maternity specialism.  Some hospitals cater for general admissions, maternity services and paediatrics all under the one roof and have one theatre on-call team, which is not safe.</p><p>With regard to the pay differential, the settlement of the dispute, which was delayed but has now started to be implemented, will see a big difference in salary at staff nurse grade.  The second part of this is the expert group on the management grades.  We are disappointed in the length of time it has taken the Department of Health to revert to us on the terms of reference and the parties to conduct it.  The Labour Court has instructed that it has to be concluded by next May in order to feed into the next round of public service pay talks.  Despite numerous requests, we have not received the terms of reference.  We have submitted our draft terms of reference and the parties to conduct the expert review.  We are awaiting this from the Department and it is well overdue.</p></speech>

Placing difficulties in the way of recruitment would be viewed by other countries as nonsensical.  They will probably take advantage because if we are hampered in recruiting, it will be to their gain, particularly that of the UK, our close neighbour.  Britain is short of nurses and has reduced payments and bursaries for undergraduates, which saw a drop-off in its training places.  It has a huge interest in recruitment from the Republic of Ireland.</p></speech>

The Chairman is correct that it is not supported.  We have best practice that states advanced nurse practitioners should make up 2% of the overall workforce.  This would require us to have 700 advanced nurse practitioners, of which we have approximately 247.  These nurses can provide services that have proved to reduce waiting times in emergency departments and the need to admit.  When advanced nurse practitioners work in emergency departments they reduce the length of time patients wait and can assist in getting the patient home as opposed to being admitted.  Likewise, in all other services where they work, and international studies demonstrate this, they improve the patient's journey considerably and they provide a very safe service.  Unfortunately, in this country we have had a real problem in getting the Government to fund places for advanced nurse practitioners to the point that we are still well below the recommended 700 mark for these grades.</p> <p>  We have met the leads on Sl&aacute;intecare who accept that advanced nurse practitioners add to the efficient use of bed time.  They also accept that advanced nurse practitioners can and should be extended more broadly into community services.  There is an idea that management of chronic disease in the community should not be led by advanced nurse practitioners but everybody knows they have a great deal to add.  The same applies with regard to clinical nurse specialists.  However, this requires investment in educating nurses and midwives to these levels.  That would give us a service that actually has a chance of delivering primary care in the community in a very safe manner and in remote areas where advanced nurse practitioners could lead services.  We can have nursing-led services in these areas.  The plan needs to be approved, the availability of education needs to be fast-tracked and we need to look at models of healthcare delivery that are not solely based on the medical model.  Advanced nurse practice and clinical nurse specialism are well established but they need to be funded.</p></speech>

We hope the legislation will bring about the regional authorities being devolved so the financial authority, recruitment and retention is decentralised.  The centralisation of these, particularly with the pause at central national level, makes absolutely no sense.  The regional authorities should have and must have the right to recruit and manage their budgets based on their geographical patch.</p></speech>

They keep people out of hospital and allow people to come out of hospital quickly.  My experience of community intervention teams is that they are now being restricted.  There is a recruitment difficulty and their work has become so expansive that they find it very difficult to supply the service because more and more work comes from hospitals.</p></speech>

They provide a 365 day a year service on a 24-hour basis.  They provide care in the home after discharge and sometimes pre-admission.  The problem we have always had is in expanding this very good service to areas outside the restricted areas in which they work at present.  There are not that many community intervention teams but where they exist their statistics demonstrate they make a major contribution to hospital avoidance.  By default, a person can stay in his or her own home and be provided with the care required.  In some instances where people attend an emergency department, there is a facility to have care provided through a community intervention team in the home.  It makes perfect sense.  It is the right model.  Again, these teams are staffed by staff nurses and clinical nurse managers and are covered in the recruitment pause.</p></speech>

They are extraordinary.  Anybody who interacts with a nurse or midwife at work would readily say that they are extraordinary.  They are very tightly scrutinised by professional bodies, HIQA, and their employers in an environment in which it is becoming impossible to guarantee safe care.  They do extraordinary work every day.</p> <p>  Morale is very low and there is absolutely no doubt that burnout levels are increasing.  The concern we have as a trade union representing nurses and midwives is that, despite the fact that all of the statistics and reports indicate this, the health and safety of the workers in the mix of a financial imperative for overspend in the health service is ignored and neglected.  This is not in accordance with any health and safety provision in our legislation.</p></speech>

The group's function was to review the Traveller Accommodation Act 1998 and other legislation affecting the provision and delivery of accommodation for Travellers.  Its establishment reflects a commitment contained in a Programme for a Partnership Government and confirmed in the Government&rsquo;s 2016 housing policy statement, Rebuilding Ireland, that the adequacy of arrangements for delivering accommodation for Travellers should be examined.</p> <p>  The expert group comprised three members.  These were Dr. Norton and me, along with Mr. David Joyce, then at the Mercy Law Resource Centre, who chaired the group.  I acknowledge his very important input to the report.  He is now on the staff of the Oireachtas and not eligible to participate any further but he played a critical role in the expert group.  The expert group presented its report to the Minister of State, Deputy English, and to the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee in July 2019.  We are pleased to be have this opportunity to discuss the report and its recommendations with the members of the Oireachtas joint committee.</p> <p>  The expert group was assigned the following terms of reference: review the effectiveness, implementation and operation of the Traveller Accommodation Act 1998 with a view to examining whether it provides a robust legislative basis for meeting the current and future accommodation needs of the Traveller community, which takes effective implementation into account in the context of the recognition of Traveller ethnicity in 2017; examine national and international best practice in the provision of accommodation for nomadic communities to inform the legislative basis for meeting the current and future accommodation needs of the Traveller community; review other legislation that affects the provision and delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation, including transient accommodation; consult all relevant stakeholders at local and national level, including Traveller representative organisations and other stakeholder groups represented on the national and local Traveller accommodation consultative committees; and draft and present a report and recommendations to the Minister within six months of commencement.</p> <p>  The expert group used several methods to understand the accommodation needs of Travellers and the issues and challenges associated with meeting these needs.</p><p>For instance, we reviewed the findings and recommendations made in key published reports and we examined data from key sources, including the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the census and the summary of social housing assessments.  We also reviewed policy and practice in selected European countries, we received written and oral submissions from key stakeholders and will also held a round-table stakeholder workshop consultation.  The group also met the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government in November 2018 and the Oireachtas Traveller Group on 16 April 2019.  Group members took great care to ensure that the issues raised by the Deputies and Senators they met on those occasions were taken into account in our analysis.</p><p> Our analysis was based on all of these consultations, evidence and data.  The report was prepared in a collaborative fashion, with all recommendations being agreed by all three of the expert group members.  It sets out an integrated set of recommendations intended to improve the effectiveness of the arrangements for providing accommodation for members of the Traveller community, which were established by the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998.  The recommendations address four key themes, which we identified as the key barriers to providing Traveller accommodation, including ensuring delivery reflects need, planning, as in land use or spatial planning, capacity and resources to deliver accommodation and governance of the delivery of it.</p><p> The review concludes that the arrangements established by the 1998 Act have important strengths and have enabled the delivery of significant amounts of accommodation for Travellers.  However, they have failed to provide enough accommodation to meet the full scale of need among this community.  This is evidenced by the extremely high rate of Traveller homelessness, the increase in the number of Traveller households sharing accommodation and living in overcrowded conditions and the uneven record of delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation among local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs.  It is time to overhaul the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 and other relevant legislation and policies that impact on accommodation provision for Travellers. </p><p> A fundamental problem identified by the expert group relates to the lack of a strong evidence base for policymaking.  The current system for assessing the scale and nature of Traveller accommodation need is not working effectively and this creates difficulty in reaching a consensus on the true level and nature of this community's accommodation needs.  </p><p> The first theme discussed in the report is how to ensure that plans for delivery of Traveller accommodation reflect the actual needs and preferences of Travellers.  The report sets out a series of recommendations intended to ensure that we have a more robust evidence base to inform planning for Traveller accommodation provision and implementation of these plans and monitoring of the outputs achieved.  Monitoring of the implementation of Traveller accommodation programmes is required because in the expert group&rsquo;s analysis there is an implementation gap between the number of accommodation units planned and the numbers delivered.  Several local authorities have met or exceeded their targets, but others have failed to meet delivery targets, in some cases for an extended period.  Opposition from residents' associations and councillors means that the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation is challenging, but the expert group's analysis indicates that the land use planning system is also a significant factor in delaying and blocking the delivery of accommodation. </p><p> The functioning of the Part 8 planning mechanism, which is used to deliver local authority social housing, gave cause for particular concern because the use of this mechanism requires the approval of councillors, which they regularly fail to provide. In addition, the acquisition and disposal of land by local authorities requires the approval of councillors and this is often not secured.  Declining funding for Traveller-specific accommodation was identified by the group as a barrier to provision.  Wider developments in housing policy over the past decade have inhibited Travellers' access to accommodation as well.  In particular, increasing reliance on housing allowance for private rental households, such as rent supplement and the housing assistance payment, HAP, to house low-income households creates problems for Travellers because they face particularly strong barriers in securing and maintaining private rented tenancies. </p><p> The expert group was also concerned by the low delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation by voluntary sector AHBs because these organisations have provided a large proportion of social housing in recent years.  Reforms to arrangements for allocating social housing, such as the use of choice-based lettings and allocation on the basis of time on the waiting list, also raised concerns because they have the potential to disadvantage Travellers.  The outcomes of these mechanisms, in terms of their impact on the Traveller community and other particularly vulnerable groups, therefore, should be monitored.</p><p> Reforming national and local arrangements for governance of Traveller accommodation provision is vital if the accommodation needs of this community are to be met.  At local level, the expert group recommends that local Traveller accommodation consultative committees, LTACCs, which exist in each local authority, be replaced with strategic policy committees for Traveller accommodation.  This is intended to ensure that arrangements for the governance of Traveller accommodation provision are more closely aligned with arrangements for the governance of local authorities' other functions.  At national level, the expert group recommends that the representative structure of the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee be maintained, but that its functions should be expanded, strengthened and properly resourced and it should be converted into a national Traveller accommodation authority.</p><p> We have provided all members of the committee with a copy of our report and we look forward to answering any questions on its contents. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.251" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019111300002#C00300"><p>I thank Professor Norris and her team for the report.  I commend the group on turning around the report in a speedy timeframe given everybody was working in a voluntary capacity while also doing other work.  However, I will express a degree of frustration, although not with anybody presenting to us.  It is important to recall the origin of this expert group report was the report on the Traveller accommodation programmes produced by Professor Norris and others produced for the Housing Agency at the request of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and published in January 2017.  We were then told in 2018 that an expert group would be established to review that research and come up with recommendations.  The group was established in September 2018 and the report was published this summer.  As Traveller accommodation is an issue in which the committee has taken an interest and, as many members have been very vocal about it, in a good way, it is incumbent on the committee to send out the signal today that what we want now is speedy action from Government in the implementation of the recommendations.  We cannot allow two good reports to be left gathering dust awaiting action.  One of the key actions that needs to come out of this meeting, and our meeting with the Minister in a couple of weeks, is a commitment to a speedy timeline such that everybody knows what actions will be taken by Government, when they are going to be taken and in what way.  It is only in this way we will move this issue on.</p> <p>  It is worthwhile reiterating that there is still a chronic underspend in Traveller accommodation budgets.  There was a 45% underspend in respect of the 2017 budget.  In every other area of social housing, there was an overspend that year, yet the Traveller accommodation budget was underspent.  The underspend for the following year was 44% and ten local authorities spent nothing that year.  While we do not have updated figures for this year, at the end of the first quarter, only 18% of the Traveller accommodation budget had been spent.  The problem is chronic, and getting worse.  It is important to emphasise that the majority what is being spent is being expended on refurbishments rather than new units.  The refurbished units are important but the spend in this area highlights that the new units that are needed are not being provided, which is the reason homelessness among Traveller families is much higher than for others.</p> <p>  I support all 32 recommendations.  While I am uncomfortable supporting some of them, I will support them and I encourage the Government to implement them.  I also have some questions on them.  I believe the recommendations relating to building the evidence base and establishing need should be implemented immediately.  For example, there is no reason the identifier for allowing Traveller families to state a priority of preference-need in transfers from HAP and RAS could not be done immediately.  There is no reason the Minister could not have that implemented before the end of the year.  I am interested to know how the witnesses would like to see the legislation relating to Part 8, section 183 and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, work because if the Minister decides to enact those, which I hope he does, they will come before this committee.  It is important, therefore, that the committee would have a clear understanding of how they witnesses would like the legislation and the operation of those legislative changes to work.  These are the areas with which I am most uncomfortable because I am a strong advocate for allowing local authorities have maximum power.  However, the evidence that local authorities have abused those powers is strong and if they are going to continue to do so, we will have to take them away from them, even on a temporary basis.  I would welcome more detail on those recommendations.</p> <p>  On the strategic policy committees, SPCs, and Traveller accommodation, we are all former local authority and strategic policy committee members, I would welcome more detail on how the witnesses would like the SPCs to operate.</p><p>That would be useful because it might be something that would require a legislative change to the housing Acts that we can address.</p><p> On the State-wide agency and authorities for that transformation of the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee, could the witnesses give the committee more information on the exact role they would see it have?  The Traveller representative bodies have made strong representations to us that it would have executive functions and would become a delivery body, so to speak.  The witnesses do not go that far in their report but where would they like to see that body evolve?  What powers would they like to see it have to do the kind of things they referred to in their opening statement?</p></speech>

In respect of the rest of the questions, with regard to strengthening the evidence base for policy, that needs to be done immediately.  I acknowledge that academics always say "strengthen the evidence base" but in this case we found that it was very difficult to get to the bottom of this, not the overall scale of accommodation need for Travellers which, as the Deputy mentioned, is now an emergency situation, but particularly preferences for Traveller-specific accommodation, that is, halting sites, group housing schemes and standard social housing or social housing and other private forms of housing.  Those recommendations could be implemented immediately and that would strengthen the situation.</p> <p>  In terms of the funding, if the Deputy looks at the analysis of spending we put forward in the report he will see that the problem we face is that, overall among the local authorities, there is consistent failure to draw down all the funding allocated.  However, if we look at it in more detail we see that the problem is that the local authorities responsible for areas where the Traveller population is growing most and that have the highest proportion of funding allocated are drawing down the least amount.  Parts of the country where the population is growing are spending the least on additional Traveller accommodation.  That is a real blockage.  Other areas are spending more than their allocation.  That needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  We also know from the report commissioned by the Housing Agency referred to by the Deputy that a huge proportion of the spending is on refurbishment rather than new delivery, particularly of Traveller-specific accommodation.  Quite a proportion of Traveller-specific accommodation is being refurbished in the group housing scheme.  There is no additional supply coming on-stream.  That is another area we need to strengthen to see what exactly is being provided.  I refer to the monitoring side of that.</p> <p>  In terms of the timeline for implementation, we identified short-term, medium-term and long-term measures.  We agreed that homelessness among Travellers in particular and also the number of households camping on the roadside, which is approximately 600, is at emergency level so we are keen to see the recommendations implemented immediately or as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  On the recommendation about the strategic policy committees, SPCs, we noticed when we reviewed the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 that the Act itself is progressive legislation.  It was comprehensive and introduced on foot of the Task Force of the Travelling Community, which was very comprehensive.  One of the issues that has blocked its implementation is that there has been a range of other developments relating to planning law in the local government sector that superseded the arrangements in the 1998 Act.  One of them, for instance, is the establishment of SPCs.  Local Traveller accommodation consultative committees were set up under the 1998 Act.  They have only advisory status.  Local government was then reformed and SPCs were set up with responsibility for the local authorities' different functions.  The Traveller consultative committees just report to an SPC.  They are outside the current system, so to speak, and we felt that giving them the status of an SPC would bring them into the core of the local government system and ensure their recommendations were acted upon.</p> <p>  We also highlighted some problems in the operation of the committees, particularly in respect of supporting the Traveller community representatives.</p> <p>  On the national body, the entire report focused on the blockages to implementation of the Traveller accommodation legislation.  A key blockage is that nobody is enforcing implementation at the central level.  No one is monitoring effectively what is being done.  There is some monitoring but in our view it is not effective monitoring.  In respect of the funding not being drawn down and the accommodation not being provided, no one is monitoring that and enforcing implementation.  We felt that the authority would have this role in terms of reviewing the evidence base, ensuring it is strengthened, monitoring what is being done at local authority level and, if necessary, referring local authorities to the national planning regulator to ensure their implementation can be enforced.  The planning recommendations in the report reflect the fact that local authority managers have the power to bypass any vetoes on the implementation of the Traveller accommodation programme.</p> <p>  We had recommended a relatively small but properly staffed body to implement its functions, managed by a similar representative board along the lines of the current national Traveller accommodation consultative committee.  We did not recommend that it would do delivery centrally.  In terms of the reason for that, I wish to acknowledge that delivering Traveller specific accommodation is extremely challenging for local authorities.  It is not an easy function.  We felt that having it delivered at local level by people with local expertise who were aware of the local planning issues was the best way to proceed but where implementation is not happening, somebody needs to be monitoring and identifying that centrally and enforcing implementation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.255" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor Norton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019111300002#D00400"><p>On those two points, the first point I would like to make is that we sought to put the planning recommendations in a broader context.  I refer to longer-term and shorter-term recommendations.  In the longer term, we want to see systemic change in planning, the legislation, general guidance, policy and a better alignment of areas.  The Deputy can see those in the recommendations we make.  In the shorter term, however, we are recognising and responding to the existing need.  We are recommending a five-year period, which is really the end of the planning process - the delivery stage.  From reading the previous reports and the consultations we have had, one area that keeps returning is the section 8 provisions within the planning code.</p> <p>  There are two elements to our recommendation.  The first element is that in the short term, while we are putting in place the changes to the planning system, the decision-making on the Part 8 function would switch from a reserved function, which lies with the local representatives, to an executive function so it would lie with the chief executive for a temporary period.  </p> <p>  To balance that, we would draw attention to the fact that we would like to immediately see that reinforced, even in this period, and retaining the role of the local elected representatives in the Traveller accommodation programme, TAP, in the housing strategy and in the development plans, to ensure that any concerns about local democracy, local consultation, engagement, etc. can be addressed in that sense.  That is a short-term recommendation.</p> <p>  I would have a similar concern about shifting decision making from local authorities into the centre but in this particular instance, we would recommend that, for this shorter-term period, to address delivery we would have an alternative route for decision making to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and that that would be similar in nature, although not the same, to the provisions that currently exist for strategic housing development.</p><p>Obviously, we consider that there is a strong need for it in this instance.  I probably would not be in support of these provisions, in that as a planner, I am not generally in support of provisions that would move local decision-making out of the local arena.  </p><p> The Deputy asked what it might look like.  It would be ideal, were the proposals to be brought forward on foot of the TAP and the development plan.  The executive develops the proposals and brings them forward for local consultation and engagement.  At a certain point in time when decision-making is required, that provision is made to submit those proposals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  As with strategic housing development, a consultative process is available within the board to allow those who have made or wish to make representations locally to get engaged in that.</p><p> Some design would be required for this process.  Perhaps some of the lessons that have been learned regarding strategic housing development could be added to that, in respect of revisions, additional information and so on.  </p><p> I reiterate the point that those short-term measures are within the context of longer-term systemic changes to legislation and the very basic policy foundations in planning to deal with Traveller accommodation.</p></speech>

Like many of those in attendance, I speak with a certain amount of experience of the Traveller accommodation issue.  I was an incidental landlord and rented property to a Traveller family for a long time very successfully.  I have seen at first hand the intimidation and discrimination that takes place against families who are trying their best.  </p> <p>  As a member of a local authority who had quite an amount of Traveller accommodation in my direct home area, I never objected at all but actively encouraged and supported quality Traveller accommodation.  That leads me to a couple of questions, because we were able to get around many issues through the use by the county manager - or CEO in today's terms - of emergency powers to circumvent and build emergency accommodation and I note one recommendation is that these should be used more.</p> <p>  Where does best practice take place?  The review group has looked at all the local authorities in the country.  If one was to identify best practice, is there a local authority that has used the structures and supports that are there to a certain degree of success?  The overarching point is that nationally, we have a diabolical record in accommodating members of the Traveller community.  Can the witnesses give a good example in this regard?  As there are powers in place, where have they been used successfully?  While we absolutely need to bring in more powers where they are needed, there are powers available that are not being used.</p> <p>   Has the review group done any investigation - I have not read the report in detail - as to whether approved housing bodies have stepped up to the plate to a large degree with regard to their responsibilities?  Perhaps legislation is needed to ensure that a percentage of their work, and of the houses they allocate would be Traveller-specific.  I will start with those questions and may have a couple of follow-on questions afterwards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.258" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Michelle Norris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019111300002#E00500"><p>I thank the Senator for his questions.</p> <p>  On the emergency powers issue, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Limerick City and County Council have successfully used these powers successfully.  There also have been a couple of other instances where they have been used but have failed following a court challenge.  I acknowledge that we met representatives of a large number of local authorities and of the County and City Management Association.  The chief executives of local authorities are in a challenging position in using emergency powers.  Their job depends on working with the councillors, the elected members of the local authority, as regards all the other local authority functions and in striking a budget.  Stepping in and using emergency powers is always difficult.  We feel that on occasion, it is necessary to address these blockages to delivery that we have mentioned.  </p> <p>  In the short term, these emergency powers could be used more widely before the legislation is amended to make Part 8 an executive function for a period, as we have suggested.</p> <p>  On good practice, another challenge we identified regarding the delivery of halting site and group housing scheme accommodation concerns the design of that type of accommodation, taking account of the need for the accommodation of horses and to support Travellers in their activities in gathering and selling scrap metal, for instance.  Trying to design and deliver such accommodation well in high-density settings like towns or cities is challenging.  Moreover, when local authorities or approved housing bodies deliver mainstream social housing, they also design and deliver it.  There is not generally a great deal of consultation with the people getting the accommodation.  People are accommodated from the housing list and then move into the accommodation.  It is different when Traveller-specific accommodation is delivered because it often is for a specific extended family group that is looking for halting site accommodation together.  There is a need for an extended period of consultation in working with that community, which can be very challenging and time-consuming.  It is a particular challenge for approved housing bodies.  Often, they do not have the wider staff to allow them to do that.  Under the funding model, they get the money for the project when it is let, that is, when they get the rent.  </p> <p>  One recommendation we made concerns a small organisation called CENA, a Traveller-led body that was set up as a housing association to provide accommodation.  It has done some valuable work with different local authorities and in consulting with Travellers who are seeking Traveller-specific accommodation on their preferences, as well as advising on the design.  Were this organisation centrally funded by the Department, that also would enable the delivery of more Traveller-specific accommodation.  A good example of that is Offaly County Council, where CENA have worked successfully with the council.  It is also working with Cl&uacute;id Housing Association separately, which is another good practice example.</p></speech>

The Senator is correct that the key problem, however, is with the drawdown of capital funding for the construction or refurbishment of the dwellings.  There is not so much revenue funding for these activities, compared with what is available on the consultation side of it.  We felt that a relatively small amount of funding to support CENA, the organisation we identified that is already doing this activity, could help a great deal.</p></speech>

We have figures in the report on Travellers' success in getting into mainstream social housing accommodation.  We acknowledged that Travellers get more mainstream council housing <i>pro rata</i>than the size of their community would suggest.  They are successful in getting into mainstream council housing; there is just not enough of it.  They are also successful in getting into approved housing body, AHB, housing, albeit not at the same rate as getting into council housing.  The specific issues we identified with the approved housing bodies is their role in the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation.  They are now major providers of social housing but the level of Traveller-specific accommodation provided by approved housing bodies is extremely low.</p><p>We identified only two or three sites.  As they are now major providers of social housing, we would like to see more of that.</p></speech>

Say that 15 houses are to be allocated, and the local authority give the approved housing body a list of 13 names, ten of whom are Travellers.  The Travellers still might not be allocated a house.  Has Professor Norris done any research on why that figure is so low?</p></speech>

It is impossible to know definitively how many Travellers get into mainstream social housing because there is no ethnic identifier on the application for social housing.  We base our estimates on other censuses and surveys of the population but we do not actually know the real figures.  One of the recommendations in the report is that Travellers should have the opportunity to identify their ethnicity when applying for social housing.  That would obviously be voluntary but that provision would be there and would allow us to monitor the numbers more closely.  Those figures on success rates are from our own analysis of the data.</p></speech>

The problem among the Traveller community is extremely acute, particularly regarding homelessness.  We discuss this in the report.  The number of homeless Travellers in Dublin indicates that their risk of homelessness is ten times higher than that of the settled population.  There is no doubt that leadership is extremely important.  While the policies at national level could do with some reform, they are generally strong.  The problem is with implementation.</p></speech>

In the context of our larger proposals, there are things we probably need to do now, as well as short-term recommendations.  Five years is considered short term for planning.  We then need to look at the longer-term fixing of the system.  Emergency provisions should be used to tackle the current crisis or emergency, but we cannot run a system on the basis of emergency responses.</p></speech>

I was taken by Senator Conway's remarks about leadership.  I have no difficulty with what he said but the reality is that all parties and none are represented on these local authorities.  We do not have to go far from Dublin and its suburbs to see the track record of people from all political parties and none.  It is all very well saying that they all need to be responsible but that must be echoed through parties' memberships and contacts.  I do not want to rehearse the issues D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, of which I am a former councillor, has had.  Some of those problems were very recent and related to the disposal of lands identified for Traveller accommodation, with the support of the political establishment.  That must be remembered.  I will leave it there because that matter will be revisited at some stage and there will be some questions around it in the next week or two.  We can talk about that again.</p> <p>  I do not agree with all of Professor Norris's recommendations.  I will be honest and tell her why that is.  I do not believe in the erosion of powers of democratically elected public representatives.  That is something for which I have always argued strongly.  The professor and her team will be aware that we have a revolving, five-year county development process and that there is extensive public consultation and engagement on the planning process, planning cost, etc.  The witnesses will also be aware that each local authority adopts a housing strategy and a housing needs strategy, which it puts in place.  The local authorities actively engage with the Traveller community about its needs.   Some are better at it than others, which is an issue.  The Traveller accommodation programme, TAP, is identified and marked with symbols on county development plan maps.  There is a sense of certainty there for the Traveller community, its advocates and everybody else in the community.  A county development plan is a contract with a citizen.  It gives a certain degree of certainty about the future of the sustainable planning of the area, which is to be welcomed.  For this reason, I do not support the suggestion that we could somehow suspend some of the critical powers and functions of the elected members of local authorities.  We should focus on, and come down heavy upon, local authority members who are discriminatory in their conduct, language or approach to Traveller accommodation.  I do not support any of that.</p> <p>  Good councillors of all parties and none have worked with the Traveller community and advanced Traveller accommodation.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has performed well in this area.  The local authority has adopted the TAP as part of its housing strategy and has identified Traveller accommodation on its development plan.  The problem is the delivery and execution, which rests with the executive - the crowd to which Professor Norris wants to give more powers.  She has suggested suspending the powers of the elected members and giving powers to the executive.  Has she asked questions of the executive?  I see from the back of the report that a substantial number of them have made contributions, which I welcome.  However, our focus must be on the executive because ultimately the policy of the council is adopted by its elected members.  It has reserve functions, as we know.  The executive needs to roll out the policy.  The sale of that site in D&uacute;n Laoghaire was supported and initiated by the executive.  We all know that.  The facts speak for themselves.</p> <p>  The report recommends that we request further research and a review from the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, of Traveller accommodation policies and objectives.  That is a very good proposal.  We should do that because we need facts.</p> <p>  On Part 8 guidelines and so on, could the witnesses provide the committee with some exact detail of where they found elected members to have strayed, erred or gone off course?  I want to home in on which local authorities we are talking about.  Where were there particular difficulties?  We know that some local authorities perform better than others.  We need to address the issue of where councils have abused or misused their powers or in some way frustrated the roll-out of approved TAPs.  We must get to the facts and cannot deal in generalisations.  Those are a few of my concerns but we need to focus on the roll-out of plans that have been adopted.  I have a number of them in mind.  I lived next door to Traveller accommodation.  I subsequently sold my house and I have bought a site next to another Traveller accommodation site where I intend to build a house.  I have no difficulty with that and work very closely with them.</p> <p>  I have a few more issues.  The ethnic identifier does not sit easy with me as I do not like when people talk of ethnic identifiers.  Professor Norris mentioned that it might be a voluntary code.  How is she engaging with the Traveller community on that?  I raised this issue of an ethnic identifier with a Traveller yesterday and it did not sit comfortably with that individual.  I now raise it with Professor Norris here today.  I wanted to flag that.</p> <p>  Page 4 of Professor Norris's submission refers to councillors and the acquisition and disposal of land.  Councillors do not approve the acquisitions of lands, which is one of the problems.</p><p>The executive can go ahead and acquire land without any consultation with the elected members.  Issues only arise in respect of how the executive is going to fund such acquisitions.  Councillors have no role or function in the acquisition of property, although they do, as was mentioned, have a role in the disposal of property.  I will not support any move to take that power away from those elected members.</p><p> Last, the proposal for a national Traveller accommodation authority is a good one but it must have real teeth.  Is it envisaged that such a body would have executive or non-executive powers?  Deputy &Oacute; Broin spoke on that but I ask the witnesses to address it.  This is a really good body of work and a good start but we should leave the powers with the elected members.  This has been a good exercise.  Traveller communities across the country work well with local councils on the whole and in the main.  The focus should be on why we not delivering on existing plans that are ten, 15 or 20 years old, plans which have been voted on and successfully approved.  Why is that not happening?  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.275" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Michelle Norris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019111300002#G00300"><p>I thank Senator Boyhan for his comments.  I will deal with the ethnic identifier aspect first.  An ethnic identifier would have to be voluntary under the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  People always mention that, but it does mean it would have to be voluntary.  We had extensive discussions with local authority social workers who interact with Travellers and have detailed and in-depth knowledge of the Traveller community.  They told us that some Travellers did not wish to identify as Travellers and obviously that is their right.</p> <p>  We face the problem that it is difficult to monitor how many Travellers are getting into accommodation and the level of need.  An ethnic identifier would address those issues.  We also suggested other changes where Travellers could identify a preference for the type of accommodation they wanted as in standard housing at No. 1, a halting site at No. 2 etc.  The Traveller representative bodies in particular suggested to us that Travellers felt pressured into always identifying standard social housing as the first option, whether they wanted it or not.  That was because they felt their chance of getting halting site accommodation was so poor.</p> <p>  We had meetings with the Traveller representative bodies.  I do not wish to speak on their behalf but my impression of their views is that they support the ethnic voluntary identifier.  The data are so weak that it is hard to know definitively how much delivery there is.  Local authorities, which are not delivering, are able to hide behind the figures and claim there is no demand for Traveller-specific accommodation, when the Traveller representative bodies are stating there is such demand.  That was something we were anxious to address by ensuring we have robust data.  </p> <p>  Turning to the comments on the diminution of powers of elected members of local authorities, I share the Senator's view that the powers of those elected members should not be diminished any further.  In this case, however, we feel that the situation with Traveller accommodation is at an emergency level now.  I know many sections of the community face strong pressures in gaining access to housing, particularly people facing affordability challenges.  Travellers, though, face all those pressures too, being a population which generally has a low income, as well as the added pressures deriving from discrimination regarding access to properties.  There are also practical pressures, given that the average size of a Traveller household is three times the size of a settled household.  Trying to get accommodation for a family with a large number of children in the Dublin area is impossible with HAP because the properties are simply not on the market.  Given all of that, we believe there is an argument for suspending some of the functions of councillors on an emergency and short-term basis.  </p> <p>  On the comments concerning the quality of work being done in TAPs and their implementation, I again share the Senator's view that in many cases, good work is being done.  I acknowledge that.  This is a challenging area and one in which it is far from easy to work.  If these issues were easy, they would have been resolved by now.  Our analysis indicates that quality varies around the country.  Some local authorities have very good Traveller accommodation consultative committees that are working very well and have good relationships with the Traveller representatives on the committee.  In other areas, however, they are effectively non-functional and the quality of the Traveller accommodation programmes varies nationally.  </p> <p>  The key issue, however, is the implementation of those programmes.  The process is that a local authority publishes a Traveller accommodation programme, which is then sent to the Department and the Department allocates money based on the programme.  The local authorities, therefore, make the request for the money.  In the relevant table in the report, it will be seen that there is major variation in the level of drawdown.  The problem, in particular, is that the drawdown is weak in local authority areas where the Traveller population is rising.  Some of those areas identified in the report are Dublin city, Cork city and county and Longford.  We examined in some depth why drawdown was not happening and Dr. Norton can speak further on Part 8.  One concern we had, however, was that all of the effort put into devising the plans was not then matched by their translation into development plans.  Senator Boyhan mentioned the example of D&uacute;n Laoghaire, but it is not the case in every local authority that sites are identified in development plans.  There is often a disconnect and that is a problem.  </p></speech>

There is also the matter of agreeing to initiate Part 8 and getting planning started for Traveller-specific accommodation.  Looking at the figures for Traveller-specific accommodation, they are not great, as I keep mentioning.  What seems to be happening is that there is a great deal of spending on the refurbishment of existing halting sites.  That spending sometimes involves the demolition of a halting site and the building of a group housing scheme on the same site.  Little additional Traveller-specific accommodation is being supplied and that is where Part 8 needs to come into play.  Dr. Norton will answer in more depth on that aspect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.280" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor Norton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019111300002#G00800"><p>I agree with much of what the Senator said.  Looking at the local level process in a broader context, this report would hope, ultimately, that planning processes for the creation of TAPs etc. is strengthened in the short to medium term.  I refer to trying to harmonise the TAP, the housing strategy and the development plan.  We make recommendations in those areas.  It is our strong view that there should be increased involvement of local communities and elected representatives in the formulation of the TAP and the development of good policies locally.  Essentially, this entails providing a clear pathway for the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation.  In the short term, given the inconsistent delivery of accommodation and the emergency nature of the situation, I note some local authorities have been exemplary while others have not been in a position to deliver.  It is that inconsistency that concerns us in the short term.  The measures we are suggesting are only intended to be short term.  I refer to final decision-making on Part 8 and to the disposal, not the acquisition, of land <i>per se</i>.  We envisage that the role of local elected members will not be diminished in any way in respect of forward planning, preparation of the TAP etc.  We would like to see that role enhanced and further aligned with the housing strategy and development plan.  <br/><br/>Recommendation No. 5 is very important.  We are operating in a situation where we do not have good data or evidence.</p><p>There is no national register for us to draw on regarding Part 8 and delivery of housing for Travellers.  We have an imperfect knowledge base from which to work.  It would be useful to engage with the Office of the Planning Regulator, in its role in research and so forth in the planning area, to dig deeper into that.  That would be a fairly big piece of work.  One would have to look through each and every local authority or housing authority.  That is an important point and could be pushed on in the immediate term.</p><p> The Senator is correct in suggesting that the executive side has responsibilities in delivery.  It should not be seen that we are targeting local authority members.  The executive side has a great responsibility in the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation at local level.  Again, we see an important role for the Office of the Planning Regulator arising in this regard.  It will have a role in reviewing development plans and other such plans across the country.  It could have a role in looking at the specific arrangements and policies made for Traveller-specific accommodation, the local objectives etc.  More importantly, it could see if there some consistency across different local authorities in this area.</p></speech>

This is my first committee meeting.  Please bear with me as I try to formulate my thoughts and notes.</p> <p>  I thank the independent expert group for its presentation, observations and findings.  It is a welcome report.  I also appreciate and acknowledge that the Traveller representative organisations have also welcomed these findings and recommendations.  It is important to be cognisant that with no Traveller representation on this committee and on the expert group, the phrase &ldquo;nothing about us without us&rdquo; comes to mind.  It is vital we keep lines of communication completely transparent and open between the committee and its work, as well as any future work from the Department, and the Traveller community.  Otherwise, that is where many problems can arise.</p> <p>  Coming from County Offaly, I am well aware of the frustrations regarding Traveller accommodation both within the Traveller community and those outside of it.  During my short stint as a councillor on Offaly County Council, I was rather disappointed to find out there was a significant underspend of departmental funding for Traveller accommodation purposes.  Although it is not unique to Offaly, it needs further examination.  I am aware Professor Norris alluded to this in her answers already.  We need far greater communication among Traveller representative groups, local communities, local authorities and Departments.  Otherwise, I fear we will never see an end to this problem facing this particularly vulnerable section of our society.</p> <p>  I also appreciate that CENA Housing Association has worked well with Offaly County Council.  That is promising and progressive.</p> <p>  Some members brought up the issue of an ethnic identifier.  Is there a way of finding more information in this regard through the Traveller representative groups?  Have they details on Travellers in social housing?  Has this been explored already?</p> <p>  As I was prepared for a Minister to be present, I have had to slightly change my questions but can the expert group suggest a timeline for the implementation of its short-term recommendations?  Does the expert group envisage that each local authority should be instructed to have a Traveller unit in its structures, according with best practice guidelines in delivering that service?  It has been indicated to me that local authorities have used allocations for Traveller accommodation to hire security firms to assist in evictions?  Did this crop up with the expert group?  Given that a &euro;1.5 million increase was given for Traveller accommodation in budget 2020, mostly going towards refurbishments, what does the expert group believe the budgetary intention or the proposal under these new structures should be?  What is the shortfall in this regard?</p> <p>  The recommendations under the chapter on capacity and resources are crucial.  The practical concerns in terms of Traveller accommodation need more support.  Issues such as waste management and water services are relatively cost-effective ways of improving accommodation for Travellers.  Greater supports in those would assist greatly.  The expert group indicated how household size is different.  That practical aspect needs to be considered.  Some of those aspects are not particularly costly; it is just about providing a service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.284" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Michelle Norris" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019111300002#H00400"><p>The chair of the expert group is a member of the Traveller community but is unable to be here today.  He is a barrister and led on the legal recommendations of the report.</p> <p>  We suggested an ethnic identifier for applications for social housing because it is a means of tracking who is getting into social housing.  We raised some concerns in the report that there are new innovations in the allocation of social housing.  For instance, some local authorities have what they call a choice-based lettings scheme.  This is where one looks up properties available on a website and makes an application over the Internet.  This is valuable from the point of view of efficiency and avoiding vacancies.  For groups such as Travellers, however, who may have literacy issues and may not have access to electricity, let alone access to the Internet, we felt these schemes create risks that need to be monitored.  One way of doing this is through an ethnic identifier for applications.</p> <p>  We also included some recommendations on making the census of population more robust by working with Traveller bodies to come up with a more robust estimate of the size of the population.  We need to emphasise that this is voluntary.  It is up to people and families to identify themselves as Travellers or not.</p> <p>  On the security firms for evictions, we did not come with figures on that.  It was raised in some of the submissions from the Traveller bodies.</p> <p>  We also did not come up with specific recommendations regarding the increase in funding because it was challenging to come up with a specific figure.  Funding has fallen but there has been a failure to draw down funding.  Table No. 5.4 on page 50 of the report gives the record per local authority over the past ten years.  There has been a failure to draw down funding but the amount of funding has also fallen.  The main need for additional funding is for additional supply.  The evidence we have is that much of the existing capital funding is spent on the refurbishment of existing Traveller-specific units, which is valuable.  There is, however, a need to focus on providing funding for additional new supply of Traveller-specific accommodation and a proper monitoring of what is spent on supply and on refurbishment.</p> <p>  Some rural local authorities raised with us that they have much demand from Traveller households for rural social housing such as small cottages in the country.  This would be a valuable source of funding but they currently cannot draw from the Traveller-specific accommodation fund.  Instead, they are having to fund this from the mainstream social housing side.  They recommended that as an additional source of supply.</p> <p>  We did not make specific recommendations on local authority staffing because we feel the needs vary by local authority.</p><p>Some of the urban local authorities had large Traveller accommodation sections, and that is useful, but some of the rural local authorities did not.</p><p> We put one specific recommendation in place regarding spending on caretakers and on more robust management of halting sites.  It was our view and that of some of the local authorities and Traveller groups we met that there are problems with the management of Traveller-specific accommodation.  This is driving some of the objections and concerns from the wider community.  We felt that spending in that area would achieve a lot of dividends.  In the report, we mention the aim of making the estate management function more robust.  In response, some of the local authorities raised concerns with us that this would mean spending on anti-social behaviour but that is not what we meant.  We meant spending on proper management, on dealing with vacant units - which are a big problem on some halting sites - and on ensuring that any waste is dealt with quickly and that there is better maintenance.  A relatively small spend in that area across the local authority sector would improve things.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.286" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor Norton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019111300002#J00200"><p>I will answer a couple of the other points that were raised.  It is important that there is Traveller representation throughout the process.  I will sum up our recommendations across the different areas.  We are basically looking for more efficient and integrated practices at different levels, from involvement in a new national agency to greater and closer engagement within the SPCs, for example, at local authority level, in order to direct engagement in TAPs and development plans and in the preparation of individual proposals for Traveller-specific accommodation.  Those are critical matters in respect of which the Traveller community needs to be engaged.  That will form part of what was mentioned about the great need for integrated planning and design guidance for Traveller accommodation.  This is one of our medium to long-term recommendations.  Work could commence on that almost immediately.  That would look at what best practice is in forming policy and in preparing TAPs or housing strategies that have made proper provision for Traveller accommodation.  It would also include guidance on preparing and developing proposals.  Although a little dated, the design guidance that is in place would integrate everything and be responsive to the needs of Travellers in particular.  This is a key element of one of our long-term proposals and it would underpin practice throughout the planning system.</p> <p>  Members mentioned timelines.  We have not provided a matrix or anything of that nature.  We have tried to differentiate between immediate actions, short-term actions and the sort of actions we want to end up with.  If one takes the planning proposals and recommendations, we see five years as being the likely horizon for making all the changes so that we have a planning system that is fit for purpose, so that we have the policies in place and so that we produce plans that are in line with good practice, etc.  Five years would be an outside time period.  If we work back to that, circulars, which were mentioned earlier, could be initiated rapidly and we could start working on legislative changes and provisions that have to pass through the normal processes that would take 18 months to two years.  The members of the committee are the experts in that area.  It is a phased approach but it is probably fair to say we should see this as a five-year project.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.287" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1357" speakername="Pat Casey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019111300002#J00300"><p>I thank our guests for their presentation.  As previous speakers noted, it has taken a long time to get here and we appreciate how quickly the review group has acted in preparing its report.  We thank it for that.  A lot of this has probably been dealt with and we have spoken about many of these issues already.  One of those issues is the collection of data and how important that is moving forward.  Some of these are easy fixes in the sense that they could be done in a fairly straightforward manner, including that additional details such as those relating to the type of accommodation involved could be included on the housing application form.  These are all basic and simple issues that could be fixed quite readily if the will is there to do so.</p> <p>  I will move to the more complicated and controversial matter of the local authority members themselves.  Most people in this room do not want to remove powers from the local authority members.  In fact, we want to give them more powers if possible.  Failing to include local authority members in this process might have a worse effect in the long term when we try to integrate people into the communities or to deliver these projects at the end of the day.  To develop that point, I sat on a local authority for 12 years and we had to take some tough decisions.  Professor Norris mentioned objections from councillors and resident's associations.  Sometimes I question how much energy, from the point of view of administration, is put into Traveller accommodation and into resolving the problem relating to it.  Ultimately, the county council does not realistically get involved until something is put in front of it.  I sometimes question whether the will is there at the management level.  The report clearly indicates that the chief executive of a local authority has emergency powers to do this if he or she so desires.  How many chief executives of local authorities across the country have used the emergency powers to help resolve the Traveller accommodation problem?  How many part A planning processes for Traveller accommodation have members of local authorities voted down versus the percentage that have been voted through?  Do we know the statistics for that?  I am trying to be objective here.  I do not like to see powers of local authority members being taken away.  We need to look at other ways of trying to incentivise local authority members to be engaged in this process because they have a fundamental role in the integration of the Traveller accommodation problem at the end of the day.  If we remove those powers from them, we could be creating another problem.</p> <p>  I want to move on to the planning process.  Our guests referred to strategic housing developments, SHDs, and the board proposal.  We had a huge debate here on the SHDs only a couple of weeks ago.  A lot of us have a fundamental problem with the consultation process in the SHDs.  This is not a Traveller accommodation issue, it is an issue with planning itself because at this stage a number of communities in my county would not have had their local area plan reviewed for 12 years and then the next minute the SHD process is forced on them without them having had any engagement on it.  I have no problem with the principles of that process but I do have a difficulty with how we get there.  I would be fully supportive of the need for county development plans and local development plans to be developed to a much higher level of detail.  We need to clearly indicate what every piece of land will be used for and the type of design that will be used.  A great deal more effort must be put into the consultation also.  At that point and from there on I would not have a problem with the SHD process but that process involves more than Traveller accommodation.  It has a broader remit.  The SHD process has good points but one of the weaknesses was in the area of the consultation process.  I would like to get some feedback on those issues.</p> <p>  Professor Norris stated that the majority of the money is being spent on renovations as opposed to being spent on new deliveries.  We spent a good few years of delivering nothing, be it social houses or Traveller accommodation.  Do we have a percentage for the amount of money that is spent on new deliveries as opposed to renovation works?</p><p>I have not read the full report, only bits of it.  I have two charts in front of me: one on the spend and the other on the population.  Is there a correlation between the allocation of money and the population of Travellers in each county or area?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.289" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Conor Norton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2019111300002#K00200"><p>I will deal with the planning matters raised by Deputy Casey.  Professionally, I am a planner also and strongly agree with the sentiment expressed by the Deputy about making sure local decision-making takes place at a local level.  I am also a member of the Irish Planning Institute.  We are strongly in favour of returning the proposals for strategic housing developments back to local level.  I believe in local democracy.  From our perspective, this situation is unique.  It is perhaps an emergency.  Inconsistent delivery is an issue and a problem that has been highlighted repeatedly.  It was raised in the consultation on numerous occasions.  We produced a detailed report on our consultation and Part 8 kept cropping up.  What we are suggesting is that it is very much a short-term measure and that it be put in place, pending the fixes made to the planning system.  The critical point, on which Deputy Casey put his finger, is that there is a need for better local plans and local resourcing.  We need to be more specific in the plan-making process about what we mean in the context of the provision of Traveller accommodation.  The evidence must be available and we must be far more specific and give a clearer indication to the community, the elected representatives and others as to where we intend to develop Traveller-specific accommodation, how we are supposed to provide it and the timeline involved.</p> <p>  We have found that it is not consistently the approach across local authorities.  Therefore, we are suggesting it be a short-term measure.  In a situation where there is a fixed planning system, ideally, what we would have is planning and design guidance that would show the way local authorities could plan better Traveller accommodation in some consistent framework which would also provide backup guidance on design and other matters.  In the guidance one would also wrap methodologies for assessing demand and also perhaps consultation and dealing with other such matters.  There could be comprehensive and integrated guidance that would provide the basis for returning the decision-making processes to the local level, certainly at the end of the Part 8 process.  Some of the issues we have had in this area include that planning for the provision of Traveller-specific accommodation is a long-term process, at the very end of which is a decision-making stage under Part 8 involving the elected representatives.  We suggest there be a suspension of it for a short period and a review while we make the larger fixes to the planning system.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Casey.  We have lessons to learn from strategic housing development.  It might perhaps be extended for a further period of two years, but, like the provisions we are proposing for Traveller-specific accommodation, the processes will return to the local level, at which time we would have comprehensive and robust guidelines for how we would manage the planning and design of Traveller-specific accommodation.</p></speech>

I mentioned at the start that we had agreed a joint report.  All three of us signed up to the recommendations, but as the Deputy can imagine, it is fair to characterise the debate between the three of us on the various recommendations made as lively.  I share the concerns about the diminution of functions.  I agree that in ideal circumstances the accommodation to be provided for groups such as Travellers should be agreed to collectively within communities through the forum provided by the elected local authority.  That is one of the reasons I personally was not keen on the idea of having a central body for delivery because I felt it could be counterproductive.  Also, there are local issues of which local authorities know because they are active on the ground and with which a central body would spend years trying to catch up.  That said, there is evidence that the initiation, in particular, of Part 8 developments presents a problem.  it is also true that the emergency powers mentioned by the Deputy are underused.  I gave two examples, namely, Limerick City and County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, both of which have used them successfully.  Colleagues in the law department at NUIG law produced an interesting report on the use of emergency powers which was unsuccessful in the sense that they had been successfully challenged in the courts.  We can make the report available to the Chairman.  From memory, it identified about six occasions on which the emergency powers had been used in other local authorities.  They have been used rarely, despite the critical nature of the issue involved.</p> <p>  It is also true that often issues such as the location of sites are not mentioned in county development plans and that plans are not updated often enough.  There are general problems in the planning system that create particular problems in the provision of Traveller accommodation.</p> <p>  Deputy Casey referred to the point I had made about the spend on Traveller accommodation in each local authority area.</p></speech>

It indicates that 54% of the spend on Traveller accommodation in the past ten years was on refurbishment.  There is a lot of spending on items such as caravan loans.  The spend on the supply of halting sites was 14.7% and 18.4% on the supply of group housing schemes.  As I indicated, on some occasions the group housing schemes are to replace existing halting sites.  Does that make sense?</p></speech>

I do not wish to imply that there should be a cut in spending on the refurbishment of Traveller-specific accommodation, but it is critical that funding be made available for new supply.</p> <p>  The other point made by Deputy Casey was related to the allocation of funding to local authorities and whether it reflected the size of the local Traveller population.  To my knowledge, it does not.  It reflects what local authorities state they need in the Traveller accommodation plan.  The allocation they receive more or less matches what they have requested.</p> <p>  Also in the report we look at the differences in drawdown by local authorities.  The breakdown is to be found in table 5.4.  In table 3.2 we look at the growth in the Traveller population countrywide.  The population is growing and Travellers are also splitting in more separate households, just like the settled population, which means that the need for housing is growing.  If we compare the problems in drawing down funding to the increase in population, I have mentioned a number of local authorities where it is problematic, where their record is not strong and the Traveller population is growing.  They include Dublin City Council, Longford County Council, Cork City Council and Cork County Council.  In all of these areas the Traveller population is growing substantially, while the drawdown of the budget allocated is weak.  There are some others areas where the Traveller population is falling and the local authorities concerned are drawing down 100% of their allocation.</p></speech>

I apologise as I was slightly delayed owing to having to attend another meeting, but I have read the opening statement and looked through the report.</p> <p>  My colleagues have asked a number of questions.  I do not propose to go back over them, but I wish to make some observations.  I fully understand the problems in grappling with the recommendations made in respect of local authorities and considering how we can expedite the delivery of housing.  I represent the constituency of Dublin Fingal which has a sizeable Traveller population.  There is a real issue in providing Traveller accommodation.</p><p>We have been better than many other local authorities.  I know the drawdown might not show that.</p><p> I am very interested in the Part 8 process that Deputy Carey asked about.  Do the witnesses have recent data on how many times members of local authorities have voted against a Part 8 process for delivery of Traveller accommodation?  In all my time as a public representative, since 2004 - I was only three short years on the council, but I keep a close eye on it - I have not been aware of any in Fingal.  I am aware of one injunction that was taken very recently and the court ruled for that.  I do not think that is the issue.  Removing those powers &ndash; I know it is only a temporary recommendation &ndash; may have the unintended consequence of making the situation worse.  I believe local authorities need to remove the veil of secrecy around delivery of purpose-built Traveller accommodation.  The majority of Travellers who I interact with on housing issues want Traveller-specific accommodation.  The veil of secrecy covers purchase of land such that things are found out only after the event.  Particularly with the rural nature of some of the land purchases, more work can be done with communities.  For example, there is a very good Traveller accommodation scheme close to where I live and as part of that scheme the local authority brought the main sewer up the lane to deliver 15 purpose-built homes for Travellers, which is great, but it did not allow any of the local residents connect to the mains.  There are simple things like that, not bringing it further down the road, that are a question of consultation.  The executives and planners at local authority level need to carry the can for much of that.  It tends to be that when people find out that the land has been purchased, as in the recent case where the injunction was successful in the High Court, they do so only through the media.  Local authorities should treat citizens as adults.</p><p> There is a serious housing issue for the whole community and it is quite acute in the Traveller community.  Most people who I deal with want good sustainable, quality accommodation for all their citizens, including the Traveller community.  That is something that one of the witnesses might elaborate on, purpose-built Traveller accommodation versus integrated accommodation in existing settled communities.  What does their research show about what the community asks for?  I have received many complaints recently of certain members of the Travelling community who have been housed through approved housing bodies in existing estates where they never wanted to be and they cannot settle.  They let that be known at the time and the answer is take it or leave it.  It is that or nothing.  That poses problems then within the estate.  The Part 8 process would be of interest to me.  I do not know of any in my area that have been refused in 15 or 16 years.  I could be wrong, I stand to be corrected.  The development plan and local area plans are where to deliver and be very specific about it and identify it.  The only development plan I was involved in was the 2005-2011 one.  At the time very specific objectives for Traveller accommodation were delineated and noted on the maps in Fingal.  It was very clear to people.  Then we move through the Part 8 process, and try to deal with issues, some of which might be infrastructural, to try to have a planning gain as well for everyone in the area.</p><p> I thank the witnesses for their work.  This is a nettle that needs to be grasped.  Most of us are in agreement.  We are all committed to providing good, sustainable, permanent accommodation, and good homes for the Travelling community.  We want that.</p></speech>

There is no register we can refer to.  Apart from what might actually make it through to the Part 8 process, we cannot monitor projects that start and do not proceed.  I hope it does not come across like this.  We are not pointing the finger at the local elected representatives.  There certainly is a very significant responsibility with the local administration or the executive.  We certainly got that from our consultation.  Obviously, some of the recommendations we are making would improve the oversight and practice carried out at the executive level to support better local decision-making.  That is around proper planning guidance, processes that need to be put in place, consistent approaches to gathering data such as identifying the real demand, best practice in location, sustainable development, and managing services and infrastructure, all of which are points the Deputy mentioned.  There are issues, for example, around taking a more place-based approach to Traveller accommodation.  Maybe it is part of an area plan and there is betterment for the local community embedded such as infrastructure or a park.  There are many positives that could come forward from that.  We would like to see better guidance around the processes and a more area-based approach to that.</p> <p>  On oversight, our recommendations focus on two areas in the long term.  One is in respect of plan making, and this would be oversight of the executive and of the outputs, such as the adoption of plans etc.  That would be the Office of the Planning Regulator and we make recommendations on that in the initial term.  The second point is the new agency we are recommending that would have a broader role in monitoring delivery nationwide at some point.  We make initial recommendations on governance and what an agency might look like.  It is not very detailed and a great deal of work would have to be done on its architecture.  Principally in respect of planning, they are the issues.</p> <p>  I will hand over to Professor Norris to answer the question about demand and what Travellers want.  There are complexities here.  We are recommending that even within the TAP and the development plan we must have a much more sophisticated approach to considering what really is the local demand and how the TAP, the housing strategy and development plan respond to that.  There is an added complexity in that we are talking about a Travelling community.  It is a bit more dynamic perhaps than a settled community and we have to be able to plan for that.</p></speech>

It is not kept centrally by the Department.  Dr. Norton consulted very widely with planners in local government for the report, and they identified this as an issue, which is why it is in the report.</p><p>Now that the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR has been established, we believe it has the capacity to play quite an important role in improving the delivery of Traveller accommodation.  The problems we identify in the report of Traveller accommodation plans not lining up with what is in development plans and sites not being specified are issues which can be referred to the OPR and the office can go back to local authorities to insist they are addressed, which would improve matters.  Where there is non-implementation of measures, the regulator also has the power to recommend to the Minister that enforce implementation, which he is legally empowered to do.  That structure has been put in place and we believe it has quite a lot of potential.</p><p> Regarding secrecy around the acquisition of sites, the Deputy was previously a councillor, as he mentioned.  I have no doubt from his experience he found that is an issue.  The acquisition of sites was not an issue that was flagged with us but regarding the development of Traveller-specific accommodation where there has been non-delivery, we examined the potential for penalties, which is one of the issues the committee mentioned to us.  We decided against that option on the grounds it would penalise other vulnerable communities with, for example, cuts to social housing budgets for non-delivery of Traveller accommodation, and what is the argument for that?  Local authorities are also in large part self-funded through the property tax and there is less of an opportunity to penalise them.  Responsibility for the roads budget has been transferred from the Department with responsibility for housing to another Ministry.  Rather than penalties, the issue of incentives is one we discussed, although we did not include it in the report, but it would be worth examining.  The Deputy mentioned gains for areas that have Traveller-specific accommodation, for example, the water and sewerage infrastructure being augmented, but there are arguments for putting in place improvements such as the provision of playgrounds, which would benefit Travellers getting the accommodation but would also achieve benefits for the local communities in those neighbourhoods.  That is something that should be definitely explored.</p></speech>

The witnesses have covered that.  In my area the figure is 44% but in other local authority areas, it is 20%, 19% and 12%.  We need to find a balance.  Local authorities play a major role in this area.  I work with many members of the Traveller community in my area and Traveller accommodation is a major issue.  Looking at the big picture, perhaps workshops may be needed to ensure local authorities, agencies and everybody concerned work together.  There can be a lack of information or awareness of issues but information is the key.  It would be good if we could all work together because what service delivery is needed.  One of the greatest issues in my area is accommodation.</p><p>We know that poor living conditions are a major issue for the health of older Travellers in particular.  Do we always hear from them?  Is there a designated Traveller representative on each of the 31 local authorities, particularly through the SPCs?  When one is on the ground listening to people's concerns, that is where one will learn more.  That will be important when all the agencies and local authorities work together.  My local authority in Carlow made a submission.  Its officials are helpful when I engage with the council.  There were only 15 submissions from local authorities, which means 16 local authorities did not make a submission.  Is that a concern?  As was said, the 31 local authorities play a major role.  As we move forward, all the agencies need to work together.  One of the witnesses might respond to me on these concerns I raised.  Traveller accommodation is an important issue and we need to find a balance.  If funding is allocated for Traveller accommodation, it needs to be spent.<b></b></p></speech>

The percentage spend is based on the Traveller accommodation programmes that have been prepared, for example, their estimated cost, etc..  Funding is based on that, and it is a circular process.  There are issues with the methodology and identifying need.  We are not suggesting, for example, that even the figures presented encompass the sort of demand that there might be.  Those figures must be viewed as being indicative but they are very instructive with respect to the inconsistency in expenditure on the basis of Traveller accommodation programmes.  It very much highlights issues with inconsistency in delivery.  It is important in that regard.</p> <p>  Regarding Travellers' representation on SPCs, the emphasis has always been on LTACCs at local level.  Our recommendation on governance is that the Traveller accommodation SPC would bring in the local representative.  That governance would bring them closer to the decision-making of local authorities and then there should also be a direct connection to the local authority's own SPC on housing.  The existing arrangements were constructed in the late 1990s on foot of the Act in 1998 but there was reform of local government in the early 2000s, which superseded that and created the SPC structure.  We recommend a specific local Traveller accommodation SPC.</p></speech>

As Dr. Norton mentioned, that was the rationale for the recommendation on having a Traveller SPC.  We asked whether Traveller accommodation is a standing item on the housing SPCs for different local authorities.  We were informed it is in Dublin, but it varies.  We thought that having a formal SPC was a much better process.</p></speech>

It is important to tease out this stuff but it is also important to acknowledge the Minister and his staff are paying close attention to this committee because implementing this report will be tricky and the Minister will not put himself out on a limb if he does not think he will get support for these measures.  Much of our conversation has been about the Part 8 process, section 183 land disposals and the role of the regulator.  I am one of the minority Deputies who vigorously opposed the strategic housing development legislation for all the reasons we are discussing here in terms of not wanting powers to be centralised but we must acknowledge a number of basic facts.  Page 50 of the report refers to a 35% underspend in Traveller accommodation over the lifetime of projects.  What those figures hide is that in recent years the underspend has worsened.  There was a 48% underspend last year and that was higher than the underspend the previous year at a time there were finally some increases in budgets for local authorities.</p> <p>  In recent years some local authorities have not spent anything on this.  Last year, ten local authorities did not spend a cent on Traveller accommodation, upgrades or new accommodation.  A total of 14 substantially underspent their budgets.  If we want to send a signal to the Minister that we want to work with him to fix that problem, we will have to take some uncomfortable decisions.  I say this with the greatest of respect to Deputies Pat Casey and Darragh O'Brien and Senator Victor Boyhan because I am grappling with the same difficulties and we share views on this.  If we do not do something on section 183, Part 8 and the regulator, nothing will change.  With respect to the issue of how many Part 8 proposals have been refused, generally our difficulty is we do not even get to the Part 8 process.</p><p>We have a Traveller accommodation plan.  It is approved by local authorities with statutory responsibilities.  In some instances, councillors are responding to pressure from settled constituents.  In others, managers do not want to progress the project.  There is often collusion between those two elements and the project never gets to a Part 8 application.  Large numbers of people in the settled community do not want Traveller-specific accommodation beside them and will do everything that they can to convince elected representatives that if they support the projects, they will not be re-elected.  The level of underspending is incredible.  Last year and the year before, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government came to us to request additional expenditure for mainstream social housing because it was overspending.  That is at a time when we are not spending nearly enough.  I wish the Department would ask us to double its budget, which we would happily do.</p><p> We cannot say that we want to fix this chronic underspend and yet not at least find some way to do it.  If members are uncomfortable with what is here, I accept that.  I do not think this is straightforward.  We have then to find some other way to do it.  I started out not being in favour of taking Part 8 and section 183 powers away.  I just cannot work out any other way to fix the problem that the data show.  If the expert group tasked with dealing with this says that this is the best way to do it and I do not have an alternative, then I will defer to the wisdom of the people who are tasked to do this.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, needs to hear from this committee that whatever he brings forward to tackle this, we will work with him to try to get it through.  If we start to get political divisions, this will go nowhere, and we will be sitting here in another year or two with even more underspends.</p><p> Members will know that I am not prone to exaggerated language in this committee.  A consequence of not fixing this is that people will die.  Those of us who know the Traveller accommodation in our communities, who go to see the poor state of electricity connections and foul water sewage connections and who know what happened in Carrickmines have to be serious about this.  One of the reasons that those things happened is that allocated budgets were unspent and too small.  I appeal to members, if not necessarily to change their minds in the course of this meeting, either to support what is on the table or to come up with something else.  We cannot leave the planning and land issues as they are.  We can do the other good stuff, such as having ethnic identifiers, giving Traveller families the option of stating preferences, and having a much better evidence base.  The crucial thing is to make sure that every single cent that is allocated is spent within the year that it is allocated to improve existing accommodation and to provide good quality new accommodation.  This is too important for us to miss.</p><p> Senator Boyhan asked an important question.  If we temporarily move section 183 and Part 8 powers to the chief executive, that does not address the issue that arises when the executive is reluctant to progress a project.  How confident are the witnesses that the powers that they said the planning regulator has been given on foot of a communication from this new State-wide Traveller agency would be enough to force the manager to use those powers?  I presume that the logic is that the manager is given these powers to implement the democratically agreed Traveller accommodation programme.  If a manager chooses not to do it for whatever reason, this new State-wide Traveller agency can then say it is not acceptable and complain to the regulator.  Do the witnesses think that mechanism will work?  Will it be fast enough or do we need to think through something else?</p><p> I accept the point about choice-based letting.  Local authorities with good practice on choice-based letting have a drop-in facility on Mondays and Fridays where people with literacy issues can go in and use choice-based letting.  They have portals.  Pretty much every elected representative in those constituencies provides that service to people with restricted literacy.  As choice-based letting is rolled out for people who are not computer literate and have restricted letting, that should be made available in every local authority.  It is a sticking point that caused difficulties at the start in some areas.</p></speech>

Choice-based lettings have substantial advantages, especially with regard to the management of vacant dwellings.  That is a good suggestion.  I do not want to speak for the regulator but we met the regulator and discussed these proposals in much depth before putting them forward.  The regulator said to us that he is confident that this mechanism will work.  I mentioned that a theme in our analysis is that the 1998 Act was brought in and that various things have happened since then that undermined its implementation.  The regulator is an example of the opposite.  It is a new facility that was not there when the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 was introduced.  It has a mechanism to review plans and will do so for everybody.  We will have that expertise once it is properly staffed.  We felt that that was a very logical way to deal with the issues regarding planning for Traveller accommodation in a streamlined way along with any other planning issues that arise.  We are confident that the regulator can play that role.</p> <p>  One reason for the amount of material on evidence in the report is that academics love evidence and we felt that it was necessary for planning.  The advice of the regulator is that any regulator intervention will be subject to court challenge unless the decisions have been reached on foot of robust evidence.  That is one reason evidence is so important.</p></speech>

It is a matter of trying to move projects forward and in line with the TAP.  Traveller accommodation programmes are currently in place.  As perfect or imperfect as they may be, there is immediately potential to review what is in the TAP and to start to monitor that if it can be provided as a priority to the Office of the Planning Regulator, which has a lot of work to do at present.  Ultimately, we are talking about a national agency, which would have a specific role of monitoring plan-making.  It would not solely relate to plan-making, but in its interaction with the planning system, it would certainly monitor the plan-making and delivery across the country.  When the system is fixed, it would refer appropriate matters to the Office of the Planning Regulator, which has a legislative connection to the Minister, to be able to issue directives.</p></speech>

If legislation was in train, the Minister and Oireachtas should say that local authorities have a choice to do this in the way the legislation originally set out, that they should start to process their plans appropriately through Part 8 applications.  If local authorities do not do so, and there is clear evidence that they are not implementing the programmes, then this new State-wide agency will do its job and say to the regulator that because local authorities are not implementing new plans as appropriate, it is requesting that these amended Part 8 and section 183 powers be implemented.  If I were a chief executive or a group of councillors in South Dublin County Council looking at these new powers coming down the line, I would say that we might as well do what we agreed to because then nobody will ever propose utilising the executive section 183 or Part 8 powers.  That is how it would work in some senses.  It is not like we are saying that, tomorrow, all the Part 8 and section 183 powers will be taken off elected members, but that where they are not being used, the regulator would be requested to step in.  In those instances, new powers will be available.  Am I misunderstanding it?</p></speech>

Our second recommendation relates to five-year proposals.  While the planning system and policy are fixed, we recommend that the reserved function on the night of decision-making would rest with the chief executive.</p><p>We also recommend that an alternative route be available to the board during this period within which we are fixing the planning system, because it is very difficult to highlight performing or non-performing local authorities etc.  Sometimes, there is patchy performance but most, if not all, planning provisions apply at a national level and across the board and we are suggesting that for operational reasons, the provisions would apply for this short-term period.</p></speech>

I do not think this committee has worked very well together.  We do not wish to be a stumbling block but we have genuine concerns about removing powers from local authorities.  I was a local councillor for 12 years and in that time I was not aware of any Part 8 application being refused.  As we do not have the data available, this is not a discussion based on factual information.  A problem might arise before an application gets to the stage of a final decision, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin probably pointed out.  I am willing to consider all suggestions but I am unclear how the system would work if power was moved towards the centre.  To follow up on comments of Deputy &Oacute; Broin and Dr. Norton, would such a move improve the system?  How would the process work if decisions are made centrally?  How would the nuts and bolts of the system work?</p> <p>  I was involved in a scheme of four houses developed for the Travelling community in Ashford, a relatively rural part of County Wicklow.  It was through engagement with the community that we delivered that project in quite a short timeframe.  One of the landowners came up with an alternative suggestion regarding the layout and the council swapped some of the land.  The process of engagement through local authorities, local authority members and the community is fundamental in how this will succeed.  If we move the powers of decision to the centre or the chief executive, what will be the process?  What steps will be put in place to get to a decision?  The committee is not here to be obstructive but, rather, to find solutions.  The powers of local authorities are worthy of genuine consideration.</p> <p>  The sequence in terms of how Traveller accommodation plans fit in with county development plans has been reversed because of the national planning framework.  It was the case that plans progressed from local level to country plans, regional plans and national plans. All of a sudden, it is the other way around and everything is being dictated from national level down through regional and county plans to local area plans.  The whole thing has been reversed.   It is on a statutory footing, which was not previously the case.  County plans must follow within 18 months and local plans must follow thereafter.  It might be quite easy to fit Traveller accommodation plans into that cycle, although I am not sure where.   That is an observation on tying Traveller accommodation plans into local area and county plans.</p></speech>

The issue is that this has not worked in large parts of the country from the 1960s when the State first got involved in this area.  The situation in respect of Traveller accommodation has reached emergency levels.  There are approximately 600 families camping on the roadside.  The legislation provides eviction powers and, as such, any of those families could be instructed by the Garda to move on within 24 hours.  That is a big driver of overcrowding on halting sites, which we flag in the report.  None of the overcrowding on halting sites is authorised by local authorities, which devote much time to policing it.  Families simply have nowhere else to go.  They face their caravan, their only asset in life, being impounded by the Garda.</p> <p>  The data indicate that the situation in respect of Traveller homelessness is not superb.  It is a serious issue for Traveller families with children.  There are slightly more than 500 Travellers in homeless accommodation in the Dublin region.  They make up 19% of the homeless population in Dublin even though Travellers make up less than 1% of the national population.  It is an emergency situation which is getting worse.  As such, we believe an emergency intervention is necessary, namely, the suspension of Part 8 applications.  We make that proposal not because it is an ideal solution but, rather, because the situation in respect of Traveller accommodation is at such an emergency level that this intervention is warranted.</p> <p>  On how we envisage it would operate, the sequence of events is set out in section 6.3 of the report.  We recommend that the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee be strengthened.  It is currently an advisory committee.  A general theme in the provision of Traveller accommodation is that there are many advisory bodies doing much good work and coming up with recommendations but those recommendations are not implemented.  We recommend that the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee be strengthened, properly staffed and given responsibility for active monitoring of the planning and provision of Traveller accommodation.  That should include making the data more robust.  For instance, the compilation of data on failure to initiate Part 8 proceedings would be a big help.  Part of its role would involve monitoring local Traveller accommodation plans.  Those would still be put together by local authorities with input from elected members and local authorities.  It would also monitor the translation of local Traveller accommodation plans into local development plans.  We have recommended that the timeframe for the various planning stages be changed such that they occur concurrently.  Development plans currently happen over a different timeframe from Traveller accommodation plans etc., which creates problems that undermine implementation.</p> <p>  Crucially, we suggest the new authority would have powers in circumstances where it is of the opinion that a Traveller accommodation plan has not been translated properly into the development plan.  For instance, if sites for accommodation had not been specified, the authority would have the power to go to the Office of the Planning Regulator, which could intervene and require that to be addressed in the plan.  That is one particular blockage.  Elected members would still have a role in making these decisions but there would be the possibility for intervention at central level in cases of inadequate planning.  The authority would also monitor the implementation of plans locally.  Where there was non-implementation of plans, it could go to the regulator, which has the legal powers to review that and recommend to the Minister that he or she enforce implementation.  It would be a process where there is a body driving implementation.  It is not just about making plans and consulting.  Where there is no implementation, adequate intervention may address many of the problems.</p></speech>

With his significant experience in local authorities, the Deputy will know as well as I do that a manager is not going to bring forward a Part 8 application if he or she knows a majority of the elected members will not support it.  That is the way Part 8 provisions work.  In many local authorities managers often decided to move a social housing project from under Part 8 to a standard planning application by an approved housing body either because privately elected members had asked for it in order that they would not have to take a difficult decision or to prevent them from blocking it.</p> <p>  The Deputy is absolutely right that there is no research-based evidence to indicate the number.  Those of us who have been around for a long time and spoken to councillors in many local authorities know that part of the difficulty is that one cannot even get into the Part 8 process because the manager knows that good councillors under pressure from the electorate will feel under pressure to vote against a proposal, or other councillors who in my view are bad because they are taking the wrong decisions will also vote against it.</p> <p>  While there will still be a consultation role, a manager will be allowed to proceed, irrespective of a democratic vote.  I do not believe that is good and I am with the panel on the issue.  If, however, we do not remove the blockage-----</p></speech>

By definition, it is very hard to ferret out the cause of non-decision-making.  The planners, with whom we consulted widely, indicated that the failure to decide to initiate Part 8 proceedings was a problem.  The issue was also raised in many of the submissions we received, particularly from Traveller groups but also from local authorities.  It was mentioned that we had received 16 written submissions from local authorities.  We actually met many more local authorities than that number.  We also met social workers for Travellers and the County and City Management Association.  Some local authorities flagged an unwillingness to initiate Part 8 proceedings as a particular problem.  The job of a chief executive of a local authority is not easy.  Much of it involves deal-making with councillors on issues on which support will be obtained.  The make-up of councils varies based on the level of representation political parties and whether there is a majority.  Therefore, the challenges are not insignificant.</p> <p>  On the failure of the executive to do the job, about which Deputy Casey asked specifically, proper and robust monitoring by the local authority and a complaint to the planning regulator will help to identify where there has been a failure to provide enough Traveller accommodation to meet the needs of the population in the area in question and a failure to specify where the sites are.  That issue will be dealt with.  Where there is a failure to initiate enough developments on foot of planning applications, it will be dealt with in another complaint to the planning regulator.  Therefore, the non-decision-making aspect will be addressed.  The suspension of the Part 8 powers of elected members and their transfer to the chief executives really mean that the chief executives will have no opportunity not to act.  That was the rationale behind the decision.</p></speech>

We still have to get to the final Part 8 proceedings, but they will be undertaken by the manager.  That is where the blockage is.</p></speech>

One of the main issues is not quantitative but qualitative.  We need to engage in some research.  One of our recommendations is that there be more research in this area to determine the reasons.  We obviously have evidence of under-expenditure, but we need to bore down into it to really find out why and it will not be that simple.  There could be very good reasons for under-expenditure, but there are great inconsistencies associated with delivery and under-expenditure.  The point we are making is that this is very much a short-term measure.  We suggest a period of five years.  If it were possible to foreshorten that period, it would be ideal.  We envisage circumstances in which the local powers would be restored in the context of very robust guidance, procedures and practices associated with planning Traveller accommodation in order that there would be very consistent approaches to gathering evidence, preparing policies, identifying land and planning and design.  It is a matter of having a robust planning system that is able to deal with plan-making and decision-taking related to the provision of Traveller accommodation.  We have to get to that point.  What we are suggesting is that temporary measures be put in place.  We are suggesting a period of five years, based on our knowledge of what we regard as an outside timeline for acting on these measures, but if it could be done in a shorter timeline, that would also be ideal.</p></speech>

We are joined by Ms Caroline Counihan, legal policy director at the Rape Crisis Network Ireland, RCNI.  She is very welcome.  From the Law Society, we are joined by Mr. Robert Purcell and Ms &Aacute;ine Breathnach.  They are both very welcome.  I note some of their colleagues are present in the Visitors Gallery, including Mr. Ken Murphy.  I do not recognise everyone but they are all very welcome.  I ask our visitors to put mobile phones on silent.  I will shortly invite each of our guests to address us, starting with Deputy O'Callaghan.</p> <p>  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

As the Chairman mentioned, the purpose of this meeting is for the committee to scrutinise legislation I introduced last year.  It is a small Bill titled the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) (Amendment) Bill 2018.  In order for legislation to progress further through the Houses of the Oireachtas, we apply scrutiny through today's process.  Neither I nor anyone on the committee is particularly sensitive, so the witnesses should feel free to be very critical of the legislation and to outline how it could be improved.  This is a very important part of the process of ensuring that any legislation introduced is effective and works.  I thank the Rape Crisis Network Ireland and the Law Society for their opening statements, which we have received and I have read closely.  They are very helpful contributions to the debate.</p> <p>  I will give an overview of the reasons for the legislation and its effect, if introduced.  The reasons for the legislation derive from the fact that in Ireland we have low levels of reporting of sexual offences.  In recent years, the recorded crime figures have shown that reporting of sexual offences has increased but that is probably partly because we have had such low levels of reporting in the past and much of the increase is accounted for by historical reporting of previous offences.  Many people who are victims of sexual offences and rape find it a very intimidating process and they do not report those offences to the same extent as somebody who is a victim of an assault on the street or a burglary.  I know it is difficult to accumulate accurate statistics in this respect, but the One in Four organisation has estimated that only 15% of victims of sexual abuse make complaints to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Irrespective of the true figures in that respect, we as legislators have a responsibility to take legislative steps to improve those statistics and make it more comfortable for people who are victims of sexual assault to come forward and make complaints to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p> <p>  As I said, part of the reason for this is that many victims of these offences find the criminal justice system quite intimidating.  It is an intimidating system for many persons involved in it.  Its primary function is to determine whether a person accused of a particular offence is guilty or not guilty.  It is unfortunately also true in cases involving rape or sexual assault that the complainant very much becomes a party heavily involved in those proceedings.  The process by which the complainant comes before the court can have a very negative effect on him or her, and can also have a very negative effect on other persons reading about the experience complainants have had.</p> <p>  The purpose of the Bill we are discussing is to amend progressive and important legislation enacted by the Houses two years ago, the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017.  Specifically, this Bill seeks to amend section 17, which deals with special measures during investigations.  At present, the section contains provisions outlining the special measures which may be implemented in respect of a victim during the course of the investigation of an alleged offence.  One of the special measures available to the victim is that where the alleged offence involves sexual violence, gender-based violence or violence in a close relationship, the victim may be informed of his or her right to request that interviews are carried out by a person of the same sex as him or her.  That is a welcome addition to the protections available to a complainant, but the purpose of this legislation is to go further and provide greater protection and support to individuals who come forward and make complaints.</p> <p>  One often hears when speaking to persons who have been through the criminal justice process as a complainant, particularly in cases involving sexual assault and rape, that they did not realise at the outset the extent and nature of the process in which they were getting involved.</p><p> For instance, they were not aware that statements they provide to the Garda and the statements of other people supporting them would be provided to the accused, as they must be.  They are unaware that when it gets to court for the hearing of the prosecution that the complainant will be required to give evidence in respect of their statement.  They are unaware that the complainant will require to be cross-examined by the accused in the case or by counsel representing the accused.  They may be unaware of the extent to which their case can become an issue of public notoriety in the newspapers, notwithstanding that their identity will be protected.</p><p> The purpose of this short amending legislation is to provide that in such cases of sexual violence, gender-based violence or violence in a close relationship, where complainants go to make a complaint at the outset, they will be provided with relevant information and legal advice by a solicitor, funded by the Minister, advising the victim of the process involved and actions required for criminal proceedings in respect of the alleged offence to be brought and heard.</p><p> Currently, in many instances this protection and resource is provided by rape crisis centres, which have their expertise.  Individuals can be given advice by a solicitor as to what will be involved in the process.  However, it would be beneficial if we could enact that and ingrain it in legislation.</p><p> The Bill seeks to provide levels of support that I believe will not be costly for the State.  We propose that legal advice under the criminal legal aid scheme be provided to complainants.  It will not involve them being represented at the hearing of the process because laws exist for that to apply.  However, it will mean that at the outset, formal legal advice will be given to a complainant, telling her - as the case generally is - of what is involved in the criminal process and being present for the complainant as she goes through that process of the complaint leading up to the prosecution.</p><p> I am conscious that in practice this will require the State to fund legal aid solicitors who will be able to provide this scheme.  I will be interested to hear from the Law Society regarding the extent to which it believes this would be a burdensome process on any solicitor.  It would be beneficial if complainants knew before going to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that if they go down the process of making a complaint, they will have the support of a solicitor funded by the State, who will be able to advise them in respect of what is involved in this process.  Provision of such information would be beneficial because it would give individuals an overview of what is involved.  In a way it is a hand-holding exercise to make them feel more comfortable when it comes to the process of making the complaint.</p><p> That is the purpose behind the Bill.  We are starting off in the legislative process and amendments will be tabled in respect of it.  I am happy to hear any amendments that might be recommended by RCNI, the Law Society or any colleagues.  It would be a valuable addition to provide that level of support for complainants in what are very difficult criminal acts perpetrated against them and where they need the support of the State to bring the complaint.</p></speech>

I will make four main points.<br/><br/>There is a need for legal advice for victims of sexual violence in criminal proceedings.  The criminal justice system, though it has improved, remains daunting for these victims.  The intimate nature of these offences, their association with still powerful rape myths and the fear of being victimised in cross-examination all combine to make many victims reluctant to make and sustain a criminal complaint.  Having access to independent legal advice from early on can and does empower victims to make and sustain a complaint.  In our view, such access should be the right of victims of sexual offences and arguably other serious offences.<br/><br/>While RCNI can provide some legal support to individual survivors on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis because, thankfully, it is funded to do so by the Department of Justice, unfortunately this additional assistance is not adequate to meet the needs of all victims for legal advice from offence to conclusion of criminal proceedings and beyond.<br/><br/>As members will be aware, victims of sexual and other offences now have the right to have their legal representative present whenever they report an offence to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or make a formal complaint to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in addition to a person of their choice, subject to certain restrictions.  In our view, victims should be able to exercise this right without worrying about the cost.<br/><br/>My second point follows on from the first.  The current provision is not adequate to meet the needs of victims.  I stress that I mean no criticism of the Legal Aid Board when I say this.  In principle, RCNI welcomes any expansion of victims' rights to legal advice as they negotiate the criminal justice process.  At present, victims of sexual violence are entitled to free legal advice from the Legal Aid Board regardless of means, provided that a prosecution is in being and that the accused person is charged with rape, aggravated sexual assault, defilement, incest or one of a short list of trafficking and prostitution-related offences.  They are also entitled to free legal advice and representation from the Legal Aid Board, again regardless of means, in two limited situations: when there is a defence application for leave to introduce evidence into the trial of their other sexual experiences or when they wish to object to disclosure of their counselling records.<br/><br/>However, victims of sexual violence are not entitled to any free legal advice from the Legal Aid Board before anyone is charged with an offence.  Neither are they entitled to that advice if the accused person is charged with sexual assault, by far the most common offence reported and charged.  My experience is that the greatest demand for this advice is at two distinct stages: before the victim decides to make a formal complaint to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and later on, if the DPP decides not to prosecute in his or her case, and the victim must decide whether to look for the reasons for that decision and-or to seek a review of the decision.  That said, of course, victims also look for advice and support at any stage throughout the investigation and prosecutorial stages, and beyond.<br/><br/>It will be seen that the existing provisions are not adequate to meet victims&rsquo; needs for legal information and advice.  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is obliged to, and does, provide information about the criminal justice process itself and about protective measures, special measures and other rights specific to victims of crime, it is not its role to provide independent legal advice to victims of sexual violence, for instance, as to whether they should object to disclosure of counselling or other personal records, or whether they should request a review of the decision not to prosecute in their case.<br/><br/>Our third point is that while the Bill is welcome, it could go even further to improve legal support to victims.  It represents a good start, but it could be improved further.  For instance, RCNI would remove the qualification at the start of the section 17(1) of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, &quot;during the course of an investigation&quot;, as far as the right to legal advice is concerned, because so many victims in my 11 years' experience need detailed information and legal advice - perhaps more than once - before they decide to report the offence.</p><p>The RCNI suggests that, instead of using the word &ldquo;provided&rdquo;, the section should read &ldquo;be informed of his or her right to be provided with legal advice from a solicitor [whether funded by the Legal Aid Board or directly by the Minister for Justice and Equality] about the criminal justice process to be followed so that criminal proceedings in respect of the alleged offence may be brought and heard&rdquo;, or include something very similar in order that it would be clear that not only did the Legal Aid Board or another entity have responsibility for funding the provision of any advice requested but also that unwanted or unnecessary advice would not be provided.</p><p> RCNI also suggests considering amendments to section 26(3A) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 to the effect that legal advice could be provided by the Legal Aid Board free of charge, regardless of the sexual offence involved, from the moment the offence took place until the conclusion of criminal proceedings at least, subject, of course, to the overriding control of the case staying with the prosecuting lawyer.  It would also provide for attendance at the Garda station or other venue when the victim reported the offence or made a formal complaint, if the victim so wished.  It would provide for legal advice and support to be made available to a victim whenever a negative decision on prosecution was received from the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p><p> Victims of sexual violence need advocacy support, as well as legal advice and information.  The response of State agencies to victims of sexual violence has improved significantly in recent times.  However, when that response is inappropriate, altogether lacking or downright wrong, many victims find it hard to address the issue, even if they know what their rights are.  Rape crisis centres will do their best to provide advocacy support for their clients as far as they can within the limits of their training and expertise.  Garda and court accompaniment volunteers are given some general training in the law and procedures relevant to victims of sexual offences, thanks to the Department of Justice and Equality which funds the programme, while they also have access to some legal support from RCNI.  However, we would prefer to see a system in place under which each rape crisis centre would have continuous access to advocacy services for their clients from a dedicated and appropriately trained professional advocacy and support worker.  To that end, we are applying for funding for a pilot scheme to employ such a worker at one or, possibly, two rape crisis centres.  A scheme such as this is already working very well in Scotland and has been evaluated positively.</p><p> In our view, advocacy and support workers would complement the work of solicitors in providing legal advice and information for victims of sexual offences.  It would be the role of these workers to make themselves available to listen to victims&rsquo; fears and concerns, provide for accompaniment to Garda interviews, court appearances and, elsewhere as necessary, to ensure victims would understand what their rights were and to liaise with legal advisers and garda&iacute; and others, as necessary, to ensure the concerns of victims were heard and addressed.  There is no question of their giving legal advice.  Instead, they would refer victims to the appropriate sources to receive that advice.</p><p> We note that in his report on the law and procedure for serious sexual offences in Northern Ireland published in May Sir John Gillen recommended that general legal advice and information on the relevant law and procedure be made available to victims of sexual offences up to the commencement of a trial and that the Northern Ireland Department of Justice sensure the advocacy and support scheme, proposed to start there in 2020, be similar to the one already established in Scotland.</p><p> I am happy to answer questions about any aspect of this statement and on the issue of legal advice for victims of sexual violence more generally.</p></speech>

The Bill comes at an important time for Ireland, having just ratified the Istanbul Convention, that is, the Council of Europe convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.  Our obligations under the convention must be matched by clear actions, structural changes and necessary resourcing.  It also arises on the eve of publication of Professor Tom O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s review of the conduct of investigations and prosecutions of sexual offences.  The society, practitioners and others await the recommendations to be made in that review which we anticipate will further support the victim in these circumstances, while not compromising the rights of the accused.  I am joined by my colleague &Aacute;ine Breathnach.  Both of us practise in this area and are members of the society&rsquo;s human rights and equality and criminal law committees, respectively<br/><br/>As of today, the right to legal aid and representation for victims of sexual and gender based violence is <i>ad hoc</i>and piecemeal.  The Bill provides an opportunity for the State to develop a comprehensive legal advice and aid service for victims of sexual and gender based violence in a way that will support them throughout the criminal justice process.  The prosecution and successful conviction of sexual offences are necessary in a society that wants to protect and vindicate the rights of all victims of sexual and gender based violence, including women, girls, boys and men.  It is in the public interest for victims to be supported through the legal process as the victim is the primary and often only witness of these crimes which, by their very nature, strike at the core of their dignity.  It is also important that victims be aware of their rights to privacy on issues of disclosure of counselling, phone records, medical records and other personal information.  The witness, complainant or victim, depending on circumstances, is key to a successful prosecution and, as such, should be afforded comprehensive and continuous representation.  Currently, victims have no right to legal representation before making a complaint to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  <br/><br/>I support the remarks made in the previous submission on this matter.  The provision of information on what could be coming down the line for a person embarking on this process is extremely important and forewarned is forearmed in this situation.  It would also attempt to avert the experiences relayed to Deputy O'Callaghan by somebody who had been through the process.  There is also no right to legal representation where the Director of Public Prosecutions decides not to prosecute, while there is limited funding to provide for a right to legal representation in the disclosing of counselling and medical notes.  <br/><br/>The Bill represents a lifeline and important public service for those affected and Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan is to be commended for advancing it.  Some of things to which I have referred are happening for practitioners, but they are being done without payment, generally because of the means of the individual concerned.  The Government's support for the Bill is welcome.  Its endorsement of the Istanbul Convention and the Domestic Violence Act in recent years provides practitioners with hope its interest in criminal justice issues is genuine and sincere.<br/><br/>I will address a number of issues dealt with in the Bill.  On the subject of providing clarity on the type of legal advice to be provided, there are many stages in dealing with a criminal complaint and prosecution.  The Bill will provide an opportunity for victims to make informed decisions throughout the process, provided that the right to funding for a solicitor and legal advice begins prior to making the complaint.  Use of a solicitor who is qualified and proficient in court procedures and criminal law is vital in navigating these boundaries.  The process involve a pre-complaint to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, an investigation stage, a prosecution stage, the decision of a jury or judge and the sentencing stage, as well as a consequential appeal stage.<br/><br/>The Bill is an important step in supporting victims of sexual violence through the very complex and gruelling process of a criminal justice trial.  It is submitted that a Bill such as this provides very necessary legal and technical support for victims of sexual and gender based violence.  Wider reform is, undoubtedly, needed in this area, particularly in the disclosure of sensitive details predating or unrelated to the prosecution, as well as concerning the rights of the victim.</p><p>The work and advocacy of supports services, such as RCNI, Rape Crisis Centre, and One in Four, as well as the genuine interest taken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies, in the victims of sexual and gender-based violence must be commended and is vital.  <br/><br/>There will always be a need for comprehensive, timely and appropriately communicated information services.  The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act has been helpful in that regard.  However, legal aid and representation is distinct and particular to aiding a victim of sexual and gender-based violence through the complexity of the criminal justice process.  These cases are highly sensitive, legally complex, unique to the parties and with so much at stake that they demand a specific and bespoke representational role, that generalised information, however helpful, will not compare to. <br/><br/>In the life cycle of a case, from reporting to sentencing, a range of issues arise that demand a legal and qualified perspective, to protect the interests of the victim, and the credibility of the legal process.  On the delivery and management of this advice, there are a number of avenues the State could adopt to provide this service.  To date, the Legal Aid Board manages a number of <i>ad hoc</i>and specialised schemes in areas such as the Garda station legal advice scheme, and the international protection applicant legal aid scheme, as well as the limited schemes available for witnesses in rape trials.  It is likely that the provision of legal advice and aid as proposed under this Bill will require a blending of approaches in other schemes, however models exist and are operational that provide immediate and effective services in other areas that could be adapted for this service.  Most important, when designing this scheme continuity of service should be of primary concern to ensure that the victim does not have to repeat her account on a number of occasions to different lawyers and thus increase the risk of retraumatization.  <br/><br/>The question has been asked as to whether providing advice might delay criminal proceedings.  We do not believe that it would.  Criminal proceedings are likely to be more secure where the victim has representation and support and has an understanding of the process what is involved in the process and what they may have to go through in the future.  A well-considered scheme, such as those in place by the Legal Aid Board, and that safeguard continuous legal representation, are likely to speed up rather than delay proceedings.  Our vision of an appropriate scheme for the victim is one that runs in tandem with the case rather than part of the proceedings.  It is important to acknowledge that the accused's rights are no way diminished by improving the victims understanding of the process.  A fair trial is crucial.  We also wish to assist and aid any victim within legal parameters in respect of the trial process.  Our submission to the O&rsquo;Malley review identified a number of reforms that, hopefully, will be reflected in the final report.  These reforms are more likely to reduce delays, and include the introduction of pretrial hearings; specialist training for the Judiciary, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other agencies; supports and information to victims throughout the process; the adequate resourcing of the aid and the courts; and case management by the courts. <br/><br/>The Government expressed concern that the scope of the Bill and the challenge of defining the offences.  However, current sexual offences legislation, in particular the 2017 Act, as well as the Domestic Violence Act 2018, provide assistance in identifying classes or categories of victims that would benefit from this Bill.  Broadly, legal aid is limited to those who are victims of aggravated sexual assault, rape, incest and child defilement.  A question that arises, which relates to our values as a society, is whether all people who claim that their personal dignity and privacy and safety has been violated should be afforded legal aid and representation.  <br/><br/>We urge the committee to appreciate Ireland's obligations under EU and international law and how this Bill plays an important part in it.  We urge it to fully engage with the O'Malley report that is due to be published, hopefully by the end of the year or perhaps by early next year.  Resourcing and specialisation are vital building blocks.  State agencies, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Society, Bar Council and NGOs such as the Rape Crises Network all have a part to play.  A collaborative approach will be doing the State some service. <br/><br/>To conclude, the victim must be put front and centre, and how their interests are best protected, forms part of that obligation.  Ms Breathnach and I look forward to engaging with the committee on any questions it may have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.364" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1408" speakername="Frances Black" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019111300002#F00300"><p>I thank Deputy O'Callaghan and the witnesses.  Sexual, domestic and gender-based violence are important issues and I am glad the committee is taking them so seriously.  I wish to note some points and then I will ask a question.  I welcome the Bill and offer it my strong support.  It is a short, concise Bill, which does not seek to move mountains.  It would secure greater information and support for people in difficult and vulnerable situations.  Given that we are dealing with highly sensitive complex cases, often involving a great deal of trauma and shame, it is only right that we make extra efforts to provide support.</p><p>Context is important.  Mr. Purcell mentioned how Ireland has just ratified the Istanbul convention on violence against women.  We need to ensure that it is not only aspiration but that we match the commitment with action and material support.  I have seen this with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, where words are not always followed by action.  Providing better and more inclusive legal aid and advice is an important step in this.</p><p>On improvements, the point made by Ms Counihan and the RCNI on when legal advice is needed is crucial.  I fully agree that people need this information and support before they contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or they might not make that call at all.  This is something we should consider for the Bill.</p><p>The Law Society presentation also sets out just how <i>ad hoc </i>and piecemeal the current system is.  That is the Bill's value as it would provide a framework for the State to put a clearer, simpler system together in one place.  If we did that, it would bring us closer to Deputy O'Callaghan's goal of increasing the number of people coming forward and would send a signal to women that if something awful does happen, there is a service that will support them comprehensively from day one.  That would be brilliant.  Currently, women can feel as though they are being passed around from service to service, which makes the entire process more daunting.  </p><p>I wish to ask Deputy O'Callaghan whether the money message issue might impact the Bill.  He will be aware that this is something on which I have worked closely over the past year.  I firmly believe the Government has been acting outside the bounds of the Constitution and abusing its power.  It seems possible if we finish this review and the Bill moves forward that the Government will argue that this will cost money and seek to veto it.  Is the hope that a money message will be provided?</p></speech>

Expenditure will be incurred under the legislation as the State will have to pay for solicitors providing the legal aid.  In contradistinction to other legislation with which the Senator will be familiar, the incurred expenditure is clear and it will require a money message but I would like to work collaboratively with the Government on this.  It has indicated a level of support for the Bill so I would not like to see it progress in an antagonistic way and just work with it with the Government.</p></speech>

Senator Black mentioned context.  I have read the Oireachtas Library and Research Service paper on this.  I always take the opportunity to thank them for their detailed work, which is tremendous.  In 2018, there were 16,994 disclosures of domestic violence alone.</p><p>The Bill seeks to cover more than domestic violence.  Reference is made to 19,089 contacts with Women's Aid.  The purpose of the Bill which I welcome is to bring about an increase in the number of people reporting sexual abuse, leading to successful prosecutions.  On page 10 of the Oireachtas Library and Research Service paper statistics are provided for a survey which are both fascinating and frightening.  The survey found that 22% of victims wanted to keep the abuse private, 18% feared reprisal and 16% cited shame.  If we add the three figures for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, we get a total of 19%.  A total of 8% believed the police would do nothing about it, 6% felt it could not do anything about it, while 5% thought they would not be believed.  The legislation is welcome, but I hope amendments will be made to it.  It is being discussed in the context of dealing with an enormous problem.  In economic terms, we are talking about a figure of &euro;2.2 billion, which is a conservative estimate.  As a woman, I do not even want to use the economic argument, but it is really important for any Government that is serious about dealing with violence.</p><p> I have a number of questions for the delegates.  Has Mr. Purcell received information on the O'Malley report that the committee does not have?  He has said we are on the "eve" of its publication.  I have notes that indicate that it was to have been published at the end of 2018.  Then it was to be published in the first quarter of 2019.  Does Mr. Purcell know something we do not know?</p></speech>

Perhaps we might come back to that issue in due course as a committee as it is a vital piece of the jigsaw and was supposed to have been published by the end of 2018.  It has been quoted by the Government on numerous occasions.  We have been told that we should await the O'Malley review.  That is a very sensible suggestion, but for how long do we wait?</p> <p>  There is an existing Legal Aid Board scheme that covers a limited number of sexual offences, including rape.  The Bill seeks to extend the range of offences covered.  What concerns me is that there has been little uptake of the existing scheme, something on which I ask the delegates to comment.  Again, I thank the Library and Research Service for its paper on this issue which shows that the take up of legal advice is very low, with only one application being made in 2018 and four in 2017.  That begs the question as to what was the take-up prior to 2017 and 2018.  Why is it so low and what, if anything, has been done about it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.371" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Counihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019111300002#G00400"><p>I refer back to my earlier answers.  In my role in the past 11 years or so I have most commonly found that people want to receive advice prior to the point at which the Legal Aid Board provides assistance by way of legal advice, that is, before any prosecution is in being.  A lot of our work takes place before victims report to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and also when victims receive a decision from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions that it does not believe it is appropriate to prosecute.  Victims have to decide what to do about it, but, as members know, it is time-limited.  They have to make up their minds quickly.  So much of what we are talking about is sexual assault which is not covered by the scheme.  By far, that is the most relevant point.  By a factor of three or four, the sexual offence reported most frequently is charged as sexual assault which the Legal Aid Board's limited scheme does not cover.</p></speech>

Reports have also reached me that people in distress have needed advice, but were not able to access it quickly.  Again, I stress I mean no criticism of the Legal Aid Board or any solicitor.  Sometimes these things happen.  Sometimes victims are able to get hold of somebody like me much more quickly.</p></speech>

In our network just over 60% of clients with whom we deal in any given year tell us about historical child sexual abuse.

What I want to know is what has happened in the Department of Justice and Equality since 1995 in researching the uptake.

That is what we are here for, but it takes a little while to gain a proper understanding.  On paper, there seems to be a very good scheme in place under the Legal Aid Board, but it is limited.

Let us say, for example, that a person's sexual history is to be brought up during the course of a trial.  The defence will notify the prosecution which will then notify the Legal Aid Board which will brief a solicitor and a counsel who will attend with the victim or complainant and advise him or her in that regard.  If the court allows the cross-examination to take place, the counsel and the solicitor will remain in court and be part of the proceedings at that time.</p></speech>

The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 has assisted in the provision of information, but those lawyers do not give people specific legal advice tailored to them and their individual situations, as it is not within their remit to do so.  These people are victims, as stated in the legislation but, as Deputy O'Callaghan said, they are also witnesses in the State's case against the accused.</p></speech>

We are anxious to have a much wider scheme in place.  The difficulty at the moment is that it is <i>ad hoc</i>and piecemeal.  Even as an expert, when I researched this issue prior to coming before the committee, it was difficult to find information on what was available, how to access it, who to ring, when the services were open and so on.  It was difficult to access information and find out what one was entitled to, even from a professional point of view.  A victim of an assault may not know what type of assault they have been subjected to, according to the legal definitions, and so they will not know where to look for assistance.  We would like a much more comprehensive service that would start with the victim at the beginning and continue all the way through.  That would limit any kind of retraumatization of the victim through having to retell their account to different solicitors or lawyers throughout the process.  Unfortunately, the service is currently very narrow and piecemeal and thus it is very difficult to assess what impact it has had.</p></speech>

There is an onus on the Government and the Department to conduct a review of that scheme and identify the issues in order that we can introduce proper legislation based on policy.</p> <p>  I fully support amending this area.  Could we amend the existing legislation, such as the 1995 Act, to broaden the scope?  Is that appropriate?  If we bring in a new Act, it would unfortunately be confined.  Should we instead amend the existing legislation in a broader way?  Would that help?</p></speech>

To put it in concrete terms, while I have no issue with including all sexual offences in Deputy O'Callaghan's legislation, if section 26(3)(<i>a</i>) of the 1995 Act was left unamended, there would be a contradiction there.  If one is amending the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act, perhaps one should also consider making an amendment to the Civil Legal Aid Act.  As I said, I am no parliamentary counsel.</p></speech>

I have not considered the position of a solicitor in detail, as I am a barrister.  I have not thought about how solicitors should be contained, whether they should work in-house, what supports they would need, whether we would need professional indemnity insurance to cover them, how much space they would need, and so on.  We could look at somehow taking on that role if we had the resources and if it were appropriate within the solicitors' own professional conduct rules.  I do not know whether that is the case.  I do not know whether that is appropriate from their point of view.  Perhaps solicitors might be able to assist the Deputy a bit better on that question</p></speech>

The D&aacute;il is inching towards its end, as we all know, and I fear this legislation, now that it is in pre-legislative scrutiny, will, unfortunately, lapse with the D&aacute;il and have to be re-examined by a future D&aacute;il.  There would have been an opportunity if the O'Malley review had been accelerated, prioritised and published so that at least we could have a fusion of what it recommends, what is here and what the witnesses are stating as experts.

While it is welcome, it has limitations with regard to who can access the advice and when it will be made available.  I am not sure about the mechanics of how it would work, particularly prior to charges being brought.  It would be interesting and worthwhile to work it out and go through it.  An individual having to make even a small contribution could be a barrier because what might be a small contribution to us would be a large contribution to those who need the advice.  On the civil law side, victims of domestic violence must make a once-off payment of &euro;130 to access legal aid.  That would be prohibitive.</p></speech>

Will the witnesses elaborate on how this could work?  Who would be the best person to give advice prior to charges being brought?  How would it be accessed?  At what stage would it be accessed?  I imagine it would probably have to be a rape crisis centre.  Charges might never be brought.  How would that work?  Have the witnesses thought about it?</p></speech>

There are approximately 400 solicitors who are experienced in criminal justice work throughout the country.  We have a certified list of solicitors who attend Garda stations.  They have front-line experience in these types of cases.  I also believe that some advanced specialist training may be necessary for people to be approved to give this advice.  If the NGOs were the first port of call and this list was available to them, they could refer to us individuals who require more specialist advice.  Most of the 400 solicitors to whom I referred also operate a 24-7, 365 day service so it is not limited.</p> <p>  The certification would have to involve a State agency, perhaps the Legal Aid Board, with an appropriate form and certification of means or something similar which could be verified before a particular claim is processed on behalf of an individual.  Would Ms Counihan say these generally involve emergencies?</p></speech>

Quite often when victims of historical sexual violence think they might report, there is no particular urgency because it happened so long ago but, at the other extreme, there are situations where people have been the victims of a recent and traumatic rape and they are absolutely at sea and do not know what to do but they must make decisions fast.</p></speech>

The way people usually come to me is they approach a rape crisis centre because all of a sudden it has come to the surface in their lives.  I am thinking in particular of people who have been victims of historic child sexual violence or, at the other extreme, where there is a very acute need.  Generally, they do not find it very difficult to tell people in rape crisis centres who have specialist training in dealing with trauma.  By and large survivors do not find it an ordeal to talk to people at rape crisis centres.  The people who work in all our centres throughout the country and other rape crisis centres are good at working out what is a legal query they cannot answer or should not try to answer.  At that point they get in touch with me and I respond to the client.  Perhaps we might have a meeting, they might ring me or I might ring them.  We might email each other, whatever suits, and that is how it happens.</p> <p>  I hope and pray it is not a traumatic encounter for them.  The aim of what I say is to explain the system to them to address their particular concerns where I can, and to reassure them if they decide to report that somebody from a rape crisis centre can go with them at the earlier informal stage when they report what has happened.  They can also go with them to the Garda station or, more commonly nowadays, to the rape crisis centre itself, for their formal statement to be taken.  It is the idea of working with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at local level to provide, as far as possible, wraparound support that addresses all of the concerns of the client.  I am the legal element of this.  I hope it is not traumatic for them to talk to me.</p> <p>  I have had some very upsetting conversations.  Sometimes I have had to tell people things that I know are legal facts and they do not particularly want to hear that, unfortunately, this is how far they can go in this direction and there is no further avenue of appeal.</p><p>That can be very difficult.  To move on to the formal interview with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in which a person's statement is taken, there is more and more awareness of how to deal with traumatised witnesses among garda&iacute;.  As members will be aware, we now have a certain number of divisional protective services units.  These units cover approximately one third of the country and I understand they will shortly cover a bit more.  The officers in these units have received intensive extra training in how to deal with particularly sensitive cases, which may involve sexual or domestic violence.  In any event, reporting to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is less of an ordeal than it was but it is, of course, still difficult.  No matter how sympathetic the garda is, this is a formal stage of the proceedings and what one says will be recorded and included in one's statement, which will form the basis of the prosecution case.  If the case goes to court, one will be cross-examined on that statement.  It is still very heavy and very serious and people need legal support.  It is no harm to have a lawyer present, particularly to deal with issues of privacy and disclosure.  If a lawyer is present, he or she can address those.</p></speech>

It may also involve advising clients as to whether they have to sign a consent form for the release of medical information or whether they have to hand over their phone.  What about their privacy and family rights?  It is about talking them through the legal process, including what their rights are and how to vindicate them at the earliest possible stage, rather than talking them through the trauma, which is the role of a specialised counsellor.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.445" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019111300002#K00600"><p>First, I commend Deputy O'Callaghan on the work he is doing in this area.  Any expansion of the rights of people in these circumstances has to be welcome.  It is the way forward.  The many of us who have had experience of dealing with people who have gone through the traumatic experiences of either sexual or domestic violence will understand what a huge trauma it represents to those people and those near to them.  This legislation is a start.  It moves us in a direction that will allow people to have more courage, which is what they need.  Any support we can give that would enhance that courage is important.  From that point of view, I commend Deputy O'Callaghan on introducing this legislation and moving us in the right direction.</p> <p>  I was out of the room for a few minutes but I was listening to the meeting on the monitor.  I know that many questions were answered and dealt with in that time.  One issue I have come across on a couple of occasions relates particularly to young people and teenagers.  I refer to sexual encounters or experimentation crossing the boundaries that most of us would set and becoming assault.  That can often happen a number of times before a young woman understands what has happened to her.  These women find it very difficult to report such cases or to find the courage to do something because it was not a case of being attacked; it was consensual up to the point at which it crossed over into something which was no longer consensual.  In the context of what we are doing here, how will support be given to people in such circumstances?  I have young teenagers myself and I listen and hear.  We have a very good relationship in the house and can talk about these things and I know that this is an issue for many people.  They feel they cannot report stuff which they really should.  They will not do so.  Do the witnesses feel this legislation goes far enough in supporting people in those circumstances?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-13a.446" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Counihan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2019111300002#K00700"><p>What I have observed is that, when such situations arise, the first port of call is very often a rape crisis centre and a number of sessions with a counsellor to tease things out.  That is where, at a certain point, the light bulb goes on and people realise that they did not just think something was abuse, but that it was and that they had not seen the reality for what it was.  Most of the time, what I hear is either a counsellor or the parent of a young person asking what the next steps are or asking about aspects of the legal process.  They will have their list of questions but I am never really involved in discerning whether something was abuse or consensual.  That is more the role of a counsellor or another wise mentor who has helped a person arrive at this realisation.  Sometimes it just comes out of a conversation with a parent, an older wiser friend or even a contemporary.  A person's friend may say that what happened to him or her was rape and that he or she should do something about it.  Thank God, he or she then does.  Our hope is that such people will then find their way to a rape crisis centre because these centres have the expertise to help and support them in teasing out what happened, in working out where the abuse began and in clarifying what happened to find the point where, as the Deputy said, it went from the consensual to something more sinister.</p> <p>  It is only later on, if at all, that the Garda is involved.  People sometimes do not want to have anything to do with a formal report to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It should be borne in mind that if a young person is involved, a report will have to be made to Tusla.  As the Deputy will know, Tusla shares information with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, so the Garda will be alerted anyway.  Quite often, the young person does not want to have anything more to do with it.  Sometimes they do, and it is at that point that I would get involved.  The person may seek legal advice or help.  Sometimes, all that it is needed is an informal chat with a local, experienced, sympathetic, and well-trained person, usually a garda.  This is the right person to talk to and can often answer many of the person's questions.  </p> <p>  The extra bit I can offer is the independent viewpoint.  I am not aligned with the prosecution; I am myself.  I am essentially independent of the whole criminal justice process.  I am there to support survivors.  If a survivor, of any age, tells me that he or she absolutely does not want to go through with this, I will not say he or she has to.  I am survivor-led.  I will tell this survivor that it is up to him or her as to whether he or she decides to make a report.  In fairness, members of the Garda are not heavy-handed when it comes to persuading people to report either but sometimes people can feel that even contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is pressure and that they will have to report and there will be no way out of it.  That is not actually the case.  It is my job to reassure people that agency lies with them.</p></speech>

I also thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for their contributions.</p><p>We have learned much from this morning.  As Ms Caroline Counihan indicated, the fact section 17 only applies during the course of an investigation excludes many complainants.  When one looks at it from the point of view of legal aid for the accused, it starts at the beginning for the accused when brought before court for the first time.  For the complainant, the beginning is earlier than that.  It is from the date of the offence.  We will all have to put our heads together to think how we can draft it in such a way to ensure those events preceding the investigation can be the trigger point for the complainant to receive this aid.</p><p> I thank everyone and the committee will produce a report.  Hopefully, we will get this enacted before the D&aacute;il finishes, contrary to what Deputy Jack Chambers said that we are inching towards the end.</p></speech>
