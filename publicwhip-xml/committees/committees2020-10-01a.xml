I would like to warmly welcome our witnesses.  I look forward to working productively with both bodies in the months ahead.</p><p>The focus of today's meeting is the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report No. 110 on the nursing homes support scheme, also known as the fair deal scheme.  The scheme has now been in operation for ten years.  On foot of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report this is an appropriate time for the committee to examine it.  To assist us in our examination of the report we are joined by witnesses remotely and in person, in compliance with public health guidelines.  </p><p>From the Department of Health, we are joined in person by Mr. Colm O'Reardon, acting Secretary General, and Ms Kathleen MacLellan, assistant secretary at the social care division.  We are joined remotely by Mr. Niall Redmond, principal officer at the social care division, and in support, Ms Pamela Carter, principal officer at the parliamentary division.</p><p>From the Health Service Executive we are joined in person by Mr. Paul Reid, CEO, and Ms Anne O'Connor, chief operations officer.  We are joined remotely by Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer, Mr. Ultan Hynes, head of service for the nursing homes support scheme, and in support, Mr. Ray Mitchell, of parliamentary affairs.</p><p>The witnesses are very welcome.  I know that the HSE in particular is going through a particularly busy and difficult period at the moment.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile telephones must be switched off.  I also ask members and witnesses to remove their masks when speaking as they interfere with broadcast sound.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 218 to the effect that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour, they can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-01a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020100100002#A00600"><p>The special report for consideration by the committee today presents the findings of an examination by my office of the nursing homes support scheme, generally referred to as the fair deal scheme.  Members are probably already aware that it is a complex means-tested scheme, and one that is vital to many members of our communities.  I wanted to look at how the scheme was operating about ten years on from its establishment.</p> <p>  I should first make a couple of points about the scope of the examination.  Nursing homes are regulated by the Health Information and Quality Authority where standards of care are concerned.  We decided not to look at issues in that area and to focus instead on the financial and administrative aspects.  The year, 2018, was the latest available period of account when we were doing our fieldwork and drawing up the report.  Where we could, we have provided relevant later data.</p><p>Where we could, we have provided relevant later data.</p><p> Finally, we completed the report in the first weeks of the Covid-19 lockdown.  It was already evident that the pandemic was impacting enormously on residents of nursing homes and that it might impact significantly upon the nursing home sector as a whole.  I decided that it would nevertheless be useful to publish the report as an input to the debate about how the sector should operate in the future.</p><p> In 2018, some 23,300 residents of nursing homes were being provided with financial support under the scheme, at a cost of &euro;969 million to the HSE.  This included &euro;51 million worth of loans provided to help residents pay their contributions to the cost of their care.  The HSE estimates that residents paid an additional &euro;343 million directly to nursing homes.  Approximately 550 nursing homes participate in the scheme, with the majority, 80%, being privately-run for-profit and not-for-profit operations.  The remainder are public nursing homes run by the HSE.</p><p> The types of goods and services provided under the scheme were set out by the Department of Health and the HSE in 2009.  They comprise accommodation, bedding, food, nursing and personal care, laundry and standard aids and appliances to assist with day-to-day living.  No review of these components has taken place since 2009.  Nursing homes also provide other services not covered by the scheme, such as access to social programmes, and transport and assistance for residents who need to attend medical appointments.  These additional services may result in additional charges for the resident.  From a review of nursing home contracts, the examination found that the level of detail on additional fees charged by nursing homes varied.  In addition, it appears residents of private nursing homes are more likely to incur additional charges for those services than those in public homes.</p><p> The way in which the weekly charge rates are determined for individual nursing homes is prescribed in the scheme legislation.  For public homes, the cost of care method must be used.  For private nursing homes, the agreed maximum price method must be used.  In 2018, the average charge for public nursing homes was &euro;1,564 a week, while the average charge for private homes was &euro;968 a week.  Because the methods used to determine these rates differ, a meaningful comparison cannot be drawn.  The weekly rates are the same for each resident supported by the scheme regardless of his or her care needs, including his or her level of dependency.  By law, the weekly charge for public nursing homes must not exceed the cost incurred by the HSE in providing care.  The HSE calculates the rates it charges by reference to prior period scheme costs and an expected 95% bed occupancy.  As the HSE does not currently have a single financial system, the process to identify and isolate these costs is not a straightforward one.  This creates risks around the completeness and accuracy of the weekly charges calculated and published by the HSE.</p><p> Funding shortfalls occur in public homes where current operating costs run at a higher rate than the prior period or where bed occupancy is less than anticipated.  In 2018, additional funding of &euro;23 million was allocated to public homes by the HSE from other Exchequer resources to cover such shortfalls.</p><p> The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, is responsible for negotiating the prices to be charged by private nursing homes.  The NTPF has outlined the many factors it takes into account in arriving at the weekly charge rate it is prepared to allow for a nursing home.  However, it has not provided to the examination team a model explaining how the various criteria are weighed and combined, stating that all the criteria are considered in the aggregate.  Consequently, it is unclear how these criteria influence the negotiation.  I will explain more about this when representatives from the NTPF appear before the committee in two weeks.</p><p> The scheme is a cash limited one meaning that an individual will only receive financial support once funding becomes available.  A placement list is used by the HSE to manage access to the scheme.  The examination found that the HSE's target waiting time of four weeks was generally met.</p><p>For individuals in an acute hospital setting awaiting access to scheme funding, the HSE also has in place short-term transitional care arrangements to facilitate discharge from the acute setting to a residential care setting.  Payments of approximately &euro;12 million were made to private nursing homes in 2018 for transitional care.  The cost of transitional care in public homes is not known, and transitional care payments are not counted as part of the scheme cost.  Resident contributions are also not collected while transitional care is being provided.</p><p> The scheme's optional loan element is to ensure that an individual does not have to sell his or her home or other property assets in order to pay for long-term care.  By the end of 2018, just over 10,600 individuals had availed of this facility with loans advanced totalling &euro;239 million.  The loan normally falls due for repayment upon an individual's death and Revenue has statutory responsibility for collection.  By the end of December 2018, the HSE had notified Revenue of 5,650 loans worth &euro;114.1 million that could be collected.  We found that 94% of the debt had been recovered by the end of February 2020.</p></speech>

I now ask Dr. O'Reardon for his opening statement on behalf of the Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-01a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm O'Reardon" time="10:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020100100002#C00300"><p>Good morning, Chairman and members of the committee.  Before I begin, I congratulate the Chairman on his appointment and wish him and the members of the committee every success in their work.  The Department is obviously pleased to work with the committee.  We see this engagement as important and helping us in our role.</p> <p>  In talking about nursing homes, it is important to record again the serious impact which Covid-19 has had on residents of nursing homes this year and to again express our condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in nursing home settings.  It is equally important to commend all of those who worked tirelessly to protect nursing home residents and prevent the spread of the Covid-19 virus in those settings.</p> <p>  The nursing homes support scheme or fair deal scheme is a system of financial support for people who require long-term residential care.  The scheme, established by the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009, has been in place for more than ten years.  It aims to ensure that nursing home care, when needed, is both accessible and affordable.</p> <p>  Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their means while the State pays the balance of the cost.  This helps to safeguard equity of access and the sustainability of the scheme, ensuring that resources are targeted at those most in need.</p> <p>  When an applicant to the scheme is approved, following both the care needs and financial assessment, he or she can choose his or her preferred nursing home regardless of whether it is public, private or voluntary once that nursing home has an available bed and can cater for the care needs.  Applicants' level of contribution is unaffected by their choice of nursing home and all registered nursing homes are regulated by HIQA against the same set of standards for safety and quality.</p> <p>  In 2019, almost 23,000 residents were supported by fair deal.  For 2020, additional investment of over &euro;70 million to the scheme brought its annual budget to over &euro;1 billion for the first time, to support over 24,000 residents.  The Government has also made &euro;90 million available this year through a temporary financial scheme to support private and voluntary nursing homes to prepare for and manage Covid-19 outbreaks.  Funding for fair deal represents 6% of the current health vote.</p> <p>  The Department welcomes the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which provides an overview of the scheme after its first ten years in operation.  The report acknowledges the complexity of the scheme and recognises its cash limited nature, which can create challenges with regard to waiting times for access and timely discharge from acute care.</p> <p>  The Department fully supports the report and its findings and has commenced engagement with the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, regarding the report's recommendations.  This includes initial consultation with the HSE on the recommendation for the Department to review the cost components of the scheme.</p> <p>  The principles underlying fair deal remain essential in our planning for services that can meet the diverse needs of our older citizens.</p><p>To ensure fairness, value for money and equity of access, the Department is committed to the development of a standard assessment tool for care needs assessment, a safe staffing framework and new care models.</p><p> I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for his comprehensive examination of the scheme, which will lead to its further development and improvement.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation to attend this meeting to discuss the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report No. 110 on the nursing homes support scheme, also known as the fair deal scheme.  As this is our first meeting with the incoming committee, I would like on behalf of the HSE to wish the committee well with its important work and to assure it that the HSE will assist it in every way we can.  I also wish the Chairman the very best.  I am joined by my HSE colleagues, Ms Anne O Connor, chief operations officer; Mr. Stephen Mulvany, chief financial officer; and Mr. Ultan Hynes, head of service, nursing homes support scheme.</p> <p>  As we submitted in advance of the meeting, as requested, a briefing paper on the nursing homes support scheme, I will confine my opening remarks to the following.  The nursing homes support scheme is a scheme of financial support for clients who are deemed to require long-term residential care.  The scheme was established under the Nursing Homes Support Schemes Act 2009 and currently supports more than 22,572 residents at HIQA-registered older persons&rsquo; residential settings.  In 2020, more than &euro;1 billion is assigned to the scheme to support those clients.  The HSE provides residential care for some 20% of those funded under the scheme.</p> <p>  As well as being a service provider, the HSE also administers the scheme, which was the primary focus of the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report.  Although the HSE administers the scheme, the National Treatment Purchase Fund agrees the weekly maximum price for private nursing homes.  The cost of care for public nursing homes is calculated by the HSE and does not exceed the cost to the HSE of providing such services.  The HSE acknowledges that there is a variance in the average cost of care paid to public versus private nursing homes, with HSE centres generally having a higher cost of care.  There are a number of key factors driving this variance, including pay-related issues, with generally higher staff pay rates and conditions at public nursing homes, as well as higher staffing ratios.  The physical build at a number of older HSE centres also adds costs due to the extra staffing levels required to manage clients in such circumstances.  There was also a requirement for a reduction in the number of long-stay beds to comply with health and safety, fire regulations and HIQA compliance with residential care standards.  Finally, the HSE provides residential care services in locations that are not viable for private providers.  The HSE has inputted to the ongoing Department of Health value-for-money review of nursing home costs.</p> <p>  The administration of the nursing homes support scheme requires significant resource input by the HSE for the application process and the financial administration of the scheme, including the oversight of a process to manage payments of &euro;1 billion annually to public and private nursing homes.  I welcome the nine HSE-specific recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report and note that the HSE has designed a management action plan which assigned responsibility for the implementation of all the HSE recommendations, the majority of which are now implemented.  The HSE is committed to working proactively with all other identified stakeholders noted in the special report, including the Department of Health.</p></speech>

The lead speaker this morning is Deputy Catherine Murphy, to be followed by Deputy Munster who has been called to the D&aacute;il Chamber for Priority Questions but will join us soon.  Deputy Murphy has 15 minutes.</p></speech>

There is a degree of normality in having a hearing such as this at the Committee of Public Accounts, even though it is a busy time for the witnesses for other reasons.  As the Chairman pointed out, my time is limited.  I have 15 minutes for my questions and the witnesses' answers.  I will try to get as much in as possible and I would appreciate if I could have fairly short responses.</p> <p>  The previous Committee of Public Accounts sought a value-for-money review.</p><p>That related to a period before Covid-19, and the review was to look at the value for money in respect of public and private nursing homes.  We had an expectation that was going to be produced in 2019, originally in March, and then we were told it would be the fourth quarter of 2019.  We were given those assurances.  Dr. O'Reardon might tell us why it has not been published to date.  I will start with that question.  </p></speech>

We share the Deputy's frustration about that issue.  It is an important piece of work.  The value for money group was set up, I think, in March 2018.  It is an interdepartmental arrangement and ran into serious difficulties in getting data.  The original plan was to go to the NTPF and use its data sources and that ran into data protection issues, legal discussions, etc.  Subsequently, there were discussions with Nursing Homes Ireland and eventually an agreement was reached to access data via that group.  Things had been paused because of the scale of the data problems but it got back up and running in March, and then immediately Covid-19 struck.</p></speech>

That agreement was not arrived at easily.  The group is now back meeting, but I do not have a date to give to the Deputy for the completion of the report.</p></speech>

It did not publish the rate for 2017, and produced an incorrect rate for 2018.  The average weekly rate increased by 26% in public nursing homes between 2010 and 2018, and by 11% in private nursing homes.</p> <p>   Deputy Catherine Murphy:  In 2015, the HSE commited to publishing the weekly cost of care-based charge rates for public nursing homes.  It did not publish the rate for 2017, and produced an incorrect rate for 2018</p><p>Why did the HSE commit to publishing those rates in 2015 and then not do so?  The executive uses rates internally for pay adjustments, for example.  Perhaps Mr. Reid will address that.  Does the HSE have the information?  Why is it not published?  What is going on in that regard?</p></speech>

On the previous commitment in 2015, much work was done to try to collate the data.  We did reflect, and I believe the Comptroller and Auditor General reflected in his report, some of the frustrations around not having a single integrated financial system, which is what we are currently working on and deploying.  We have put processes in place to collate the data much better and we have made some progress on the production of it.  I will ask Mr. Mulvany who is in the other room to make a comment also.</p></speech>

At our previous meeting we discussed the deficiency in not having an integrated system.  How is this impacting that work, given that the HSE knows the pay rates internally and knows the pay adjustments?  How would that not be reflected?  Is this a reason?  It seems obvious that the HSE knows these pay adjustments.</p></speech>

Significant investment, which has been approved by our board, and which is Government funded, has put in a deployment process for us that we are now on track to roll out.  On the specific elements of this, perhaps Ultan Hynes could comment on the cost elements, while we try to get Stephen Mulvany into the room.</p></speech>

We will deal as much as possible with the four witnesses in the room.  We are aware that the numbers are restricted here.  The committee is trying to operate within the guidelines.

We have published the 2020 cost of care.  The important thing about cost of care is that it does not impact on the contribution from residents.  Sometimes there is a perception that the cost of care can affect the payment by residents in nursing homes, but it does not.  That is calculated in a different way.</p> <p>  On the challenge around the system, the cost of care is calculated on a range of different factors.  In the absence of a single integrated financial system we are reliant, as we are in many other areas in the HSE, on gathering through all sorts of different mechanisms the costs of specific things in different locations, even the costs in different geographies.  We do not have a single system across the country.  Capturing costs on a geographical basis on a single national rate can be very challenging for us.  The integrated system can impact on our ability to give a standardised view of cost in relation to everything, including this.</p></speech>

I appreciate that there is a method of calculating for individuals, such as 80% of their income and so on.  We know the calculations for those people's personal contributions but how uneven is it around the country and what data sets is the HSE using?  Is it looking for other sources of data to have a more even calculation?</p></speech>

I will explain the diagram to the Deputy.  If she looks at the width of the graphic rather than its height, the lighter green colour shows figures from about &euro;800 to about &euro;1,400, which is the spread of weekly charges for private nursing homes.  The lower graphic goes from about &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,800.  There are also some much higher figures going up to as much as almost &euro;2,500 for some nursing homes.

I thank Mr. Reid and everyone from the HSE for giving their time at this most difficult time for themselves.  As someone who is mercilessly critical at times, I want to take the opportunity to thank the HSE and the Department of Health and all associated with them for their mountain-moving heroics over recent months on Covid.  It is important to say that and that I, as someone who is often very critical, would say it.</p> <p>  If technical difficulties interfere, rather than hold up the meeting, I ask that Ray Butler would reply to the meeting in writing this evening.  I do not want an answer here, but I have an important question on public expenditure to ask now, which Ray Butler might answer on behalf of the HSE or the Department of Health jointly, if necessary.  </p> <p>  In the context of Covid, where there is very substantial expenditure, it would be useful for the committee to know if NPHET uses any formula similar to that of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics when a breakthrough drug comes on board such as Ipilimumab or Orkambi which are very expensive.  Apart from the health technical assessment and the other medical criteria that it applies, it also considers the formula cost per year per life saved.  As Mr. Reid has said, this could be with us for a great deal of time.  I am conscious that responding to a question from a colleague yesterday, NPHET replied that the average age of those deceased, with whose families we sympathise, was 89 years with underlying conditions.  Is a similar formula or methodology applied in the sorts of restrictions and expenditure we must enter into for measures for Covid?</p><p>If there is, will Mr. Reid let us know what it is?  If not, why is that the case?  The witnesses have acknowledged this disease will be with us for some considerable time so will the HSE or the Department consider implementing such measures and informing us of the criteria?  That is not for the here and now but a detailed paper or note for the committee would be very useful for us, considering the vast expenditure that is, quite rightly, being applied to fighting this terrible disease.</p></speech>

Our response to date has been primarily driven by the public health advice given by the NPHET and Government decisions.  From a HSE perspective, we implement those decisions.  I am very familiar with the process outlined by the Deputy from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics and the financial economics process behind that.  It is a very good benchmark.</p> <p>  However, in the context of the pandemic, our response has generally been driven by public health measures to protect and save lives.  Many of the measures we have implemented from a range of perspectives, including the impact on the economy, society or the health service and costs.  Examples include PPE and testing and tracing, which have been a big cost for us this year.</p></speech>

I hope to focus on two points, specifically overall spend and the NTPF.  I also echo Deputy MacSharry's acknowledgement of the ongoing efforts in the fight against Covid-19 and tremendous work that is being done.  It must be appreciated by everyone.</p> <p>  On the report, 33% of the entire fair deal budget for 2018 was given to HSE-funded nursing homes, which support only 20% of residents in long-term care.  How is that justified?  Mr. Reid has stated the entire budget has amounted to more than &euro;1 billion to date.</p><p>However, we only reflect 20% of that in the public interest.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, we do not have our financial team connected yet but as we have said in the report, the breakdown of cost elements are very different.  The calculation methods of the NTPF and the public sector are very different and the cost drivers can be very different between public and private.  The report has reflected those differences and the two different calculation costs so the distribution of the costs is done on that basis.</p></speech>

Is this about funding for the most vulnerable to avail of specialist care or do we need to determine the practices and how the NTPF engages in this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-01a.101" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne O'Connor" time="10:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2020100100002#K00400"><p>As regards the calculations of the cost, I cannot speak for the NTPF but from our perspective the costs are higher in public centres for a number of reasons and that has been the case historically.  I mentioned the staff already as staff rates and conditions in public nursing homes lead to a higher charge.  The conditions and physical build of many HSE facilities would also be poorer than those in the private nursing home sector.  There have been incentives for the development of private nursing homes.  We have an improvement programme but the environment would require us to have different costs associated with older buildings.  As regards occupancy, the reality for some HSE units is that we are the provider of last resort in some areas.  Our cost of care is calculated by occupancy rates and in some of our units we are not filling all of our beds.  However, we have to maintain a unit.  That would not necessarily be the case in a private nursing home.  The costs have to capture all of that and so they are higher.  We are looking at the different supports and I know concerns have been expressed about the range of supports provided in public and private homes and so on.  The expert review group and the work that would be undertaken was mentioned earlier.  That is what underpins the higher cost in public units and it is on that basis that the cost of care is set by the NTPF.</p></speech>

Resident contributions to the cost of care are based on a maximum of 80% of their weekly income, or 7.5% of the value of their home, subject to a three-year cap.  That could be changed to six years with new legislation coming in for farms and businesses.</p></speech>

In terms of determining people's assets as part of the fair deal assessment process, there are quite robust systems in place for how we work through that process with people.  There is a financial system there that is set to be updated.  We are working in the most standardised way we can in the units around the country, given the infrastructure available to us.  The fair deal scheme and the work of the HSE is standardised in how we go through that process with people.  It is bound by the rules set in the legislation around it.</p></speech>

I would not like to give the impression that just because we do not have an integrated financial management system, we have not gone about putting in a standardised process.  Some of the actions we have taken under the report included standardisation across all the offices, standardisation of training and data capture and a more user-friendly application process to guide the client through.</p></speech>

I know this is Mr. Reid&rsquo;s second time at an Oireachtas committee that I am aware of this week, and the same goes for Ms O'Connor.  I am sure they need it like a hole in the head considering the work they have to do, so we appreciate that.  However, parliamentary oversight is important, and arguably more important at this time than ever. </p> <p>  I want to go back to the issue regarding the differential in fees between the publicly and privately provided care facilities.  Notwithstanding all of the other understandable issues Ms O'Connor has mentioned, I gather from Mr. Reid&rsquo;s opening remarks that salary differentials are a big factor.

Many private nursing homes operators have told me that they had difficulty in that their staff were applying for HSE positions.  Is there a problem with the negotiated rate paid by the NTPF?  Does that encourage private nursing homes to pay their staff less?  Will Mr. Reid comment?</p></speech>

First, I am more than happy to be before the committee or any number of committees.  We fully respect the oversight role of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  Second, with regard to the issue of agency staff and private versus public costs, certainly during Covid the movement of agency staff between nursing homes was a primary factor, although we are not going into it today.  We worked very closely with Nursing Homes Ireland, which is private, on reducing the movement of agency staff between multiple sites, and that was one of the areas we wanted to address. </p> <p>  I will make a brief comment on the second point on staff applying to go from private nursing homes into the HSE.  This is something we are always cognisant of in that we do not want to cannibalise the sector.  Certainly, during Covid, we put very clear communications out into the system that we should not draw our resources from private nursing homes.</p></speech>

If we say the average public cost for nursing home care is &euro;1,564 and for private it is &euro;968, what is the associated average cost if we were to extrapolate for the patients who are in nursing homes to have home care packages?  We would be talking about a substantial number of home care packages being required.  Does the HSE have a cost as to what that would average out at?</p></speech>

In terms of where we are at with the introduction of the interRAI system, we would have a standardised assessment.  The Deputy is right that part of the challenge heretofore has been that the cost of having sufficient home care for one individual has often been such that we have not been able to pay that, and it has sometimes been more straightforward for people to go into long-term residential care.  The new statutory scheme will help with that and there will be a standardised assessment that will be used to guide whether people should go into home support or into residential care.  I know the Department of Health has been very involved in that.</p></speech>

That will give us a much stronger sense of the demand and the type of finance model, and linked with that has been the standard assessment tool.  This means we will be able to link that with the kind of care needs across our older people, hopefully guiding people towards the different types of care.</p></speech>

I take it that everyone agrees that we should move towards a more home-care based model.  Regarding how this is relevant to the work of this committee, can our guests give a commitment that there is nothing, contractual or otherwise, that will result in a cost to the State from this?  Private nursing homes, some of which are new, had an expectation of fair deal scheme revenue but that might be removed if our home care strategy is successful.  Can we be assured that there will not be a cost to the Exchequer if that strategy succeeds?</p></speech>

If we look at the demographics in our country, it is clear that we are going to have significant increases in the numbers of older people that we are going to have to care for into the future.

I also thank all of the staff of the HSE and the Department of Health for their efforts in the fight against Covid-19.</p> <p>  I wish to take up some of the points made earlier on costs.  The breakdown of the 550 nursing homes involved is that 80% are private and 20% are public.  Of the millions of euro that are spent, is there a disparity between the care and ancillary costs for people in public nursing homes as opposed to private homes?  I refer to care, equipment and activities.  Are those costs covered if a person is in a public nursing home as opposed to a private one?  My understanding is that all of the ancillary costs in private nursing homes are paid for by residents or their families.</p></speech>

There is a concern, and there is some legitimacy in that concern, that people in public nursing homes may receive ancillary services.  This relates, in particular, to some of the social and therapeutic activities as well as to other equipment, aids and appliances that are probably more readily available.  This is not true in all cases and it is important to note that there is a perception that people in public homes receive significant amounts of therapy which is not actually the case.  Anyone awaiting a therapy appointment will be aware of the significant waiting times, regardless of where a person lives.  We also know that in some private nursing homes people are charged for a range of different ancillary supports.  I am not familiar with the situation in every nursing home because, as the Deputy said, there are more than 500 of them but there is a perceived inequity there.  The expert group is looking at that issue and has committed to doing so.  We are looking at the range of supports available.  Some supports are available to everybody regardless of where they live.  For example, GP and pharmacy supports funded under the scheme are available to people regardless of where they are living.  There may be some inequity but it is not necessarily as pronounced as may be perceived in some areas.  A lot is dependent on resources.</p> <p>  The development of services for older people in general as part of our model around integrated care and community-based networks will, hopefully, support everybody in a better way and that is the direction of travel for us.</p></speech>

I invite Dr. O'Reardon to come in on this as well.  Nursing Homes Ireland has called for an independent appeals mechanism to be introduced within the fair deal negotiation process.  Is that going to be considered by the value for money group?</p></speech>

The value for money review is a formal process run under the auspices of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is a commitment under the programme for Government to examine the issue of additional charges in nursing homes.  The issue was looked at recently in collaboration with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC but there is a further commitment to go back to it under the programme for Government so we will be moving on with that work.</p><p> Finally, the NTPF has statutory responsibility for dealing with the negotiation of charges.  That is its role.  A review of the pricing negotiation mechanism was recently completed and we are hoping to publish it shortly.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the comments by the HSE witnesses regarding the 80:20 split as between public versus private provision.  In terms of agency staff costs for the HSE, there does seem to be an inequality - if one wants to call it that; disparity might be a better word - between public and private nursing homes.  I hope that will be addressed within the work of the value for money group or in any of the other reports that are being done.  There is a perceived inequality in this area and that needs to be addressed.  Certainly, in terms of the staffing costs detailed in the report of the audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the sheer volume of agency staff being used needs to be addressed because it is going to drag up those costs.  Ultimately, the public is paying for it.</p></speech>

I have seen some of them at meetings of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  It is very good to see Dr. O'Reardon at this meeting today.</p> <p>  I want to focus on dementia and the cost of providing nursing home and long-term residential care services to people with dementia.  Some 7,500 people are diagnosed with the condition every year and that number is increasing as a result of better detection and awareness and also because people are living longer.  Dementia is a terminal illness and some 25% of people admitted to hospital have the condition as part of their presentation.  While we want people to be cared for in their homes in the long term as far as that is possible, we recognise that residential care is an important part of dementia care at different stages of the treatment of the illness.  It is a very particular type of care and a more expense type of care because of the nature of the additional social care that must be provided and the different presentation and profile of people in residential care focused on dementia compared with other forms of residential care.  I would like to hear the witnesses' thoughts on that before we discuss more specific issues.  What is the cost of providing long-term residential care for somebody with dementia as their primary illness compared with the cost of care for other people in long-term residential care?</p></speech>

When it comes to dementia, the cost of care does not necessarily reflect dependency rates.  We know that many people in long-term residential care have dementia and it has become a much more prevalent condition courtesy of the ageing population, etc.  Caring for people with dementia has become more of a business as usual thing.  As the Deputy correctly said, the dependency level of those residents is higher.</p></speech>

Whereas now, given the population profile, all nursing homes cater for people with dementia.  There are people who present with very challenging behaviours associated with dementia and not all nursing homes can cater for them.  In addition, there may be higher staffing ratios associated with residents who have more complex needs.  I do not have a breakdown of costs relating specifically to people with dementia in residential care.</p></speech>

The provision of good care for people with dementia is about providing a more proactive, socially focused form of care.  Such provision is necessarily more expensive because it requires more day-to-day attention than in the case of somebody with a long-term illness who may be bedridden for a long period.  It is not just about challenging behaviours or complexity.  How is the HSE anticipating the cost of caring for people with dementia in residential care and why can that specific cost not be distinguished?  Some residential care centres are devoted to dementia patients.  Why can a distinction not be made as to the particular costs associated with the provision of dementia care?</p></speech>

The standard assessment tool, which we already referred to, might be helpful in this regard.  It will provide us with a much better and more structured and objective approach in the assessment of care.</p><p>The Deputy is absolutely right that people with dementia have very specific, bespoke needs and need a person-centred approach.  The standard assessment tool involves a number of assessments including frailty, cognitive assessment and the ability to live at home with certain supports or to have to go into longer-term care.  Once we start moving with that, and there are commitments in the winter plan as we move into 2021, it will really help us provide much stronger, focused care for those with dementia.</p></speech>

However, take St. Joseph's in Shankill in my area, which is facing significant funding issues.  That is my concern.  It is linked to the overall funding structure, the NPTF and the nursing homes support scheme process, and the appeals mechanism relating thereto.

From what I hear and what I have read, it is clear that the NTPF does not have an appropriate model or process in place to determine fees or compare costs relating to nursing home care.  Ms O'Connor said that the costing disparity depends on a number of factors.  She referred, in particular, to the east-west costings and the fact that it costs more depending on the part of the country.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

There is a difference between east and west in those costs.</p></speech>

I do not understand how a public bed in Wexford that is within 15 km of the closest private bed costs a little short of &euro;1,600 where the private bed costs &euro;910 under the fair deal scheme.  There should not be any disparity in the calculation of the cost of providing the service.  The facilities in question are within 15 km of each other and the staffing issues relating to both are similar.  It is not easy to get staff in the sector.</p></speech>

I have looked at that because I am personally in touch with all of the nursing homes, private and public, particularly in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.  I am greatly concerned that the Comptroller and Auditor General, over a period of time, has highlighted the issues with the regard to funding and support for nursing home residents.  There seems to be a dire need for scrutiny because the disparity in care provision is growing.  With respect to Deputy Carthy and the point that there may be an inclination to move to care at home, I am one of a family of 11 looking after my 83-year-old mother in a home environment.  I can say that that is not a model that anybody will be moving to because 24-hour care in a home setting involves almost 20 people in the course of a week.  I cannot see how that model would be suitable for many.  Much of the equipment used in home care requires two people to operate it, so I do not want people in this country to be under the illusion that funding will be provided or that value for money will be delivered in providing care in a home setting.  I do not believe that and it should not be intimated.</p> <p>  The review of the fair deal scheme was published in 2015.

The difference between the price in the public and private care settings is long established and has been there since the scheme was introduced.  In terms of the direction of policy, it has been the policy for a long time to work to develop a statutory home care scheme.  The two things are not mutually exclusive.  We think we will have to continue to provide residential care into the future and it will always be part of the suite of policies that exist in this area.  However, there is an urgent need to work ahead and develop the statutory home care scheme to ensure we are providing the maximum amount of care with the maximum value for money.</p></speech>

Every circumstance is different and obviously I cannot comment on the case of the Deputy's family.  However, the direction that we see ourselves going in is home care.  It is much more beneficial, with the right supports and enablement in place.  From our perspective, long-term care settings provide a good service, but our experience is that providing the service at home for as long as possible is the right thing to do.  That is the line of flight we are heading in with Sl&aacute;&iacute;ntecare, and it is where we want to provide more support in the future.</p></speech>

However, when one looks at the issue from a public purse perspective, as the committee is doing here, it has taken so long to develop a strategy that deals with the disparity in care provision.  For example, &euro;23 million of extra funding was provided in 2018, as the Comptroller and Auditor General may wish to confirm.  There was an increase in funding of 26%, whereas the costs in the private sector in the same year increased by 11%.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about the value-for-money review and the publication date.  I believe the Secretary General dealt with that question.  The Deputy also asked about publication of the public cost-of-care rates.  The HSE published in 2018, 2019 and in February 2020.  There was an issue in 2018, as referenced in the report, when there was a 3% difference caused by pay rates.  The rate that was being used was different from the rate that was published.  The key point, which is set out clearly in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, is that has no bearing and had no bearing on the actual contribution that individuals had to pay.  They were not impacted by that.</p> <p>  Reference was made to a single financial system.  I think there is some confusion there.  There is a system that our nursing home support officers use to gather and process applications and payments for the fair deal scheme.  That is a single system, although we are working to make improvements to it and we have made some improvements to it and the processes.  Separate from that, there is a reference in the report to the HSE's own finance and procurement system.  The HSE is implementing a single national system and that will take some years.  We would expect 80% of the entire public health system, including large voluntary organisations, to be covered by 2024.  These are two separate but related elements.  While this is, as the report states, causing some additional complexity in calculating costs of care, it does not impact of the rates that individuals are contributing to their care.  We have implemented processes to try to improve that, pending the single national financial system.  That will make it more straightforward but there are other issues that my colleagues have referred to, including the safe staffing framework and the assessment of complexity, which are as important as the issue of the cost piece of it.  The value-for-money report will provide an opportunity to bring those matters together and to actually see what are the structural reasons public and private might be different.  The issue of the rural piece has a relevance, but staffing related issues and the complexity of care will be the predominant factors.</p> <p>  We make no apologies for the fact that we have public servants running these units.  They are on public sector terms and conditions.  In some cases, we have a different ratio of staff to patients than in private centres.  In some cases, this is clearly appropriate given the dependency levels.  We also have different ratios of qualified nursing personnel to unqualified healthcare assistant personnel.  Typically, we have different clinical supervision at nurse management levels, which is also important.</p> <p>  The value-for-money report is the best opportunity to use real data to say which of those disparities are justifiable and should continue, and if there are any on either side that need to be worked on.</p> <p>  I will leave it there unless there are any obvious points I have missed.</p></speech>

Deputy Catherine Murphy is absolutely correct that it is only when comparable, quality data is compared to a process that has an independent chair, which this process does, that we will end up getting real understandings as to which of the differences are appropriate and which may need to be adjusted over time.</p></speech>

The legislation states that all nursing homes participating in the scheme, whether public, private or voluntary, must provide the specified services within the contract payment amount and at no additional cost to the care recipient.  The services included are outlined on page 25.  One of these is nursing and personal care appropriate to care needs, along with standard appliances needed to assist with daily living.  I wish to raise the issue of private nursing homes charging for incontinence wear.  In the report that was furnished to the committee, the sample of contracts stated that one of the nursing homes is charging &euro;61 per box.  The HSE supply these free of charge.  If additional wear is needed that would normally be provided.  Residents are actually being charged twice for the same thing.  These charges appear to involve breaking the law.  Would I be right in saying that?</p></speech>

What is outlined on page 25 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is clear in that it is standard aids and appliances to assist with daily living.  Incontinence wear is part of that.  The HSE provides standard levels of assessed need for incontinence wear to residents in public and in private nursing homes.  The issue is when additional incontinence wear may be required and whether this is charged for.  It is charged for on the public side.  Making it an additional charge for something that is not covered under the contract is not a breach of the contract.  The question is whether the HSE charges for such additional incontinence wear over and above the standard.</p><p>In some or most cases, it does not.  As colleagues noted earlier, that needs further examination.  I do not believe the private nursing homes are breaking the law by levying a charge for something which a standard contract does not require them to provide.  Were they charging for something which a standard contract did require, that would certainly be a breach of the contract.  I hope that is clear.</p></speech>

The HSE clearly does so in the public nursing homes and if it is provided free by the HSE to both private and public homes, why are private nursing homes charging additional costs?  Is that not a breach of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act?</p></speech>

The report states that a standard assessment is carried out.  As I understand it, though colleagues may have better information on this, that assessment looks at the incontinence wear requirements of residents in both public and private nursing homes and the HSE provides that free of charge.  From time to time, there may be an additional requirement for incontinence wear.  That is outside the normal contract and therefore a charge may be levied by the private hospital.  In practice, I understand the HSE does not levy an additional charge in most cases.  That is the issue.  It is one of disparity as opposed to breach of contract.</p></speech>

The difficulty we had with it is that that is not allowed for a scheme patient but there is some confusion because the contract a scheme patient has with a nursing home actually states that there may be additional charges.  It is confusing and that kind of confusion is unnecessary.  It should not be a great onus on a nursing home to produce two different kinds of contracts, one of which states quite clearly that there will not be additional charges.

I ask the HSE and the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment on the differential between the value placed on a property and its sale price.  Often, the value is set when a placement is made, but at the time of settlement or after the person has passed away, the value may have changed.  Has the HSE lost out in some cases because there has been an uplift in the market since the value of a property was originally set?  Equally, are there collection issues for properties where the market has gone the other way?  Many families feel they are paying a far higher percentage than the 15% outlined in the scheme because their property was valued at a higher rate and then sold at a lower one.</p></speech>

It unlocks my second point, namely if we are dependent on the market, is there a need to review the scheme to see if settlement can be made far earlier?  I suggest this because there is a difficulty with housing.  Selling the home at any point is an emotional issue but it often happens when the person passes away.  Is there any way that if the scheme is being reviewed that financial incentives to promote the sale of the home while the person was alive could be put into the contract?</p></speech>

They are sold by banks which provide a lump sum but there is no capital or interest repayment during a person's lifetime.  It is a punitive product which often results in very significant repayments.  I have seen the HSE view that differently for different people in the fair deal scheme, where in some cases it has been taken into account for the calculation of the 15% and not in others.  I believe it is equivalent to a mortgage and should be taken into account.  </p></speech>

There have been questions comparing public and private provision already.  Between 2010 and 2018, the cost of public nursing home provision has increased by 26% where the private sector has increased by 11% in that period.  The 2018 figure was &euro;1,564 in public and &euro;968 in private.  The &euro;1,564 is to cover the day-to-day running costs of a public nursing home where the &euro;968 which the private nursing home collects includes part of the repayment for the capital cost.  It is only a small part but the private sector has to pay for the cost of providing the building whereas in the public sector, that is absorbed into the HSE budget.  Therefore the discrepancy is far higher.  Why was there a 26% increase in public sector costs in the eight-year period and an 11% increase in private sector costs?</p> <p>  From the report, the HSE indicates that the total operating cost of public nursing homes for 2018 was around &euro;590 million.  A total of &euro;320 million was from the fair deal scheme and &euro;68 million from residents' contributions.  Can I get clarification on that?</p> <p>  Another member raised the matter of dependency.  When someone goes into a private nursing home, he or she may be able to get up and walk around, but as the years pass, that person's dependency increases.  Is there a review of that dependency and is it built into the cost that the private nursing home must accommodate?  There is a change from the first day a person arrives in and, say, three years later.</p> <p>  Can we get a better system for step-down facilities?  If we want to develop home care, we must have step-down facilities.  We find time and again that someone who is in a hospital and ready for discharge after five days is still occupying a bed six weeks later in the same hospital.  What is being done to develop step-down facilities?  What can be done immediately to do that?  It is the biggest cost factor in the HSE.  Recently, I dealt with someone who had a stroke and was still occupying a hospital bed 16 weeks later even though they were ready for discharge.</p></speech>

On the difference in increases between public and private costs, we are very anxious that the value for money process helps to address that and brings out the different drivers of costs.  That will be one of its valuable outcomes.  We summarised what we believe are the significant variations, which are staff related, which can be significant, the complexity of care, which can differ across public and private providers, and similarly the dependency level, and the different mix of staff allocated between the two.</p></speech>

I will ask my colleague to speak on the increased dependency and progression.  On the final question on step-down care, that is something we value greatly.  We see huge benefit in it as part of the Covid and winter plan.  We invest significantly in it.  It does help reduce costs and the burden.</p><p>It is part of Sl&aacute;intecare and part of the direction in which we want to go, and we are investing more money in step-down beds.</p></speech>

I presume that is on the basis that groups of people in the nursing home have different levels of care and requirements.  One person might be ready to move along, but other residents would be coming in as well.  There clearly will be an assessment of a client's medical and nursing needs, but in respect of finance there is a fixed price and that is the rate.</p></speech>

I turn now to the idea that the value of the property is set at the time of placement, in the context of the realised value when the property is sold and the differential in the market value.  Given that it is set in stone that it is the value at the point of placement, does that automatically allow us to put in place some incentive to allow people to settle matters early and release housing stock back into the market?</p></speech>

Regarding selling the property, we need to separate out the issue of ancillary State support.  People who take out a loan on a property can pay that back at any time.  They do not have to sell their property, they can pay back that loan at any time, if they wish to do so.  People generally do not wish to do that, because the situation usually occurs after someone passes away.  There may even be a deferral.  I do not think it is appropriate for me to comment on the issue of selling property.</p></speech>

The largest single element of that difference is the &euro;125 million that is the cost of our care which is not long term.  Similar to the private system, our public nursing units provide long-term care, which is the subject of the fair deal scheme that we are discussing, and care for short stays, such as for rehabilitation, convalescence etc..  The fair deal scheme does not deal with those aspects, so &euro;125 million of that figure arises from those short-stay beds.</p> <p>  The figure of &euro;54 million arises from the different supports that might be provided in the public system rather than the private system, and the last portion concerns instances where units do not obtain the necessary occupancy level.  We are then effectively spreading the total cost over a smaller number of beds.  We do not allow that cost to hit the fair deal scheme, because that would contract the total funding available for patients and for the private sector.  That is an internal matter which is managed.  </p> <p>  The 26% referred to by the Deputy concerns the movement over time, from 2012 to 2018, in the cost of public care.  That has been largely driven by changes in standards and our need to reduce the number of beds across the public system, particularly given the age of some of our units.  When the number of beds is reduced, an element of the costs is fixed and that is spread over a smaller number of beds and that in turn drives up the cost.  </p></speech>

Reference was made to geography.  There is also the issue of staffing ratios.  I ask the witnesses to keep their answers concise.  The staff-to-patient ratio in the public nursing homes with which I am familiar is higher than that in private nursing homes.  Does Mr. Reid believe the level of care is also a factor?  I refer to the variation in cost around the level of care, patients being higher dependency and staffing ratios.  Are those issues, along with the fact that staff having better rates of pay, major drivers of public nursing homes being more expensive?</p></speech>

The cost of pensions must be taken into account.  In addition, the staffing ratios are different and the clinical mix of staff probably is too.</p></speech>

There is an issue around access to allied staff in public nursing homes.  Typically, patients would have access to a chiropodist, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists.  Some residents of private nursing homes have to pay for such services whereas they are available free of charge to residents in public nursing homes.

For example, residents of St. Mary's Hospital in the Phoenix Park have access to all therapies, but it is more than just a long-term stay facility.  Not all public nursing homes have access to all the therapies.  I mentioned earlier that there are challenges in terms of waiting times in certain areas for those awaiting any of the core therapies, namely, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy.

I would not want people to think that people in public nursing homes have ready access to all of these therapies either because that is not the case nationally.  There is a significant difference in different areas depending on the resource available.  I would say, though, that as part of our development of our community health networks and our integrated care teams for older persons, and certainly based on the learning we have had from Covid with our Covid response teams, we are developing that view.  Certainly, as part of the implementation of the expert group, it is something that we are going to prioritise in terms of examining what is available and how we can support populations regardless of where they live.</p></speech>

As the Deputy can understand, people have been working incredibly hard on a whole range of things in the area of nursing home residences.  There is a huge volume of work that comes out of the expert panel review.  This is one of those things that we look at but - I am sorry for taking up the Chair's time - we expect the NTPF to engage in a commercial way with the commercial nursing homes to drive value for money for the taxpayer.  We are broadly satisfied that it is doing that.</p> <p>  If I am permitted one more comment, for all of us to get to a better place on this whole issue, it is important we develop the standardised assessment tool so that we have a better understanding of the level of need in the community and dependency of nursing home residents in whatever setting they are in.  That is a fundamental piece of work that we have to do, both in terms of public and private nursing homes and also in terms of the statutory home care scheme.  If I was to identify one important piece, I would say that is the thing that will help us to get to a better place in this conversation.</p></speech>

The first pre-budget session with the Minister is a welcome opportunity for the committee to discuss budgetary strategy and the important budgetary decisions being made against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic and the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union.</p> <p>  Before we commence formal proceedings, I wish to advise that any witnesses giving evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts to note that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before committees may not extend to them.  There is no clear guidance on whether or to what extent the evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature.  Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regime.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter they must respect that direction.  I would also like to remind members that the meeting is limited to two hours due to the current Covid-19 guidelines.  This is to ensure the safety of members, witnesses and secretarial staff.  We have agreed on speaking slots and times and I ask members to remain within these agreed times.  I also remind members that other committee members will be attending this room.  I ask them to vacate their seats at a reasonable time and use the available wipes to clean their seating area.  This will allow the next set of committee members to arrive and take a seat.</p></speech>

I thank him for coming to the committee in person.  We have a lot of work to catch up on.  I know from previous membership of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight that the Minister has always made himself available, and he has not let us down today.  I hope the technical issues can be cleared up as time goes by.</p> <p>  The Minister's statement mentioned the level of unemployment, which has thankfully fallen, although I believe it has risen a little in the last week.  It would be useful if the Minister could present figures for youth unemployment to the committee.  We received briefings from the independent Parliamentary Budget Office earlier this week.  The Minister's statement mentioned that support disbursed by the State amounts to &euro;24.5 billion to date.  As the Minister says, this is a colossal sum, amounting to 14% of national income.  The transitional Government which held office between the previous Government and the formation of the present one bolstered particularly vulnerable sectors of the economy at a time of great national need, and in that sense fulfilled the unwritten social contract that exists between the State and its citizens.  As a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, I would like to flag the fact that most of this went unaudited, unsupervised and unquestioned.  There was general quiescence from the Opposition regarding this expenditure.  It is a huge sum of money, and other committee members and I would like to review that spending in detail.  We owe that to taxpayers.  I hope I am not misquoting the Parliamentary Budget Office, which indicated that digging down into these figures was difficult.  Any assistance the Minister's Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform could give in that regard would be very welcome. </p> <p>  Several medical measures pertaining to GPs, medical cards and other issues were outstanding from budget 2020.  They were meant to have been put into effect in July and were not.  The Minister might be able to report on them.  I accept that these were micro-issues.  </p> <p>  I was very taken with the pre-budget submission of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC.  It is a conservative group.  When Mr. Seamus Coffey was the chairman he used to remind us that the purpose of IFAC was to institutionalise the memory of the crash.  We tend to think of that in terms of what went wrong.  Today I am minded to think of the impact of the crash on vulnerable people and the pain it caused.  As a committee, we should listen to IFAC.  If we are to institutionalise the memory of the crash, we should also institutionalise the memory of austerity.  I warmly welcome the general thrust of IFAC's submission, which essentially counsels against penny-pinching at this time.  The submission refers to three phases and advises the Government to keep those supports going at least until the second phase, when the pandemic begins to disappear, please God.  I know that tax and income figures are good and there has been an unexpected bounce.  </p> <p>  I have a couple of questions concerning the budget.  I received a text from a publican in the city today.  It cost him &euro;80,000 a month to remain shut.  He has laid off 25 people.  The Chawke Group, which includes the Old Orchard Inn and is run by Mr. Charlie Chawke and his son Mr. David Chawke, laid off 300 people yesterday.  Delays to Covid-19 payments to staff were a big issue.  Some 300 people will now be depending on social protection payments for a period.  These delays are not good enough.</p><p>The publican to whom I referred contacted me this morning to say he was thinking of investing in weather proofing for the outside of his premises to accommodate a marquee type of set-up.  This would cost him &euro;10,000 and he wanted to know whether I thought it was worth doing or if the option to provide an outdoor service would be shut down.</p><p> The second issue I want to raise is the fact that Dublin city is dying.  The convention centre, where the D&aacute;il sits on some days, is beside the headquarters of PricewaterhouseCoopers.  I spoke to someone there recently who told me there used to be 1,500 staff working at their desks in that building but now there are only 100.  The Minister will appreciate that the impact of what is happening on local sandwich bars, restaurants and coffee shops is absolutely phenomenal.  There were packages of supports from the Government for businesses in counties Laois, Kildare and Offaly but there does not seem to have been any such package for Dublin, particularly for the city centre.  I acknowledge the efforts of Dublin City Council in trying to facilitate people coming into the city.</p><p> This leads me to the issue of remote working.  The Government said something about it during the week and I ask the Minister to flesh out what is proposed to be done to get people back into work.  Leinster House has functioned through the crisis.  There are 400 or 500 people working here, although some are probably still working remotely.  Surely there is a cohort of Dublin city workers who could come back to work safely while others continue to work remotely?  What incentives does the Minister intend to offer in that regard to help bolster the economy in the city next year?  I make no apologies for trying to champion the cause of the city, because it is dying.  We have discovered during the Covid crisis that it is utterly over-reliant on tourism and remote working is adding to the problem.  Is there any research being done on people's views on remote working?  Everybody thought it was the greatest thing since the sliced pan at the start of the Covid pandemic, but it seems to be the case that some people are no longer as keen on it.  Perhaps a blended working arrangement would be the best thing psychologically, if for no other reason.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-01a.299" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100100002#F00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his opening statement and questions.  I will make two points about his statement before dealing with each of his questions in turn.  First, in regard to youth unemployment, I am of course keenly aware that it is younger workers and students who have suffered the most during this crisis.  Those most affected have been young people starting out in work or those hoping to get a job.  While I do not have the figures on youth unemployment to hand, I know they are available.  If the committee cannot access them quickly, I can get them sent on.  We  know that the share of young people who are now unemployed because of the impact of this awful disease on our economy is very high.  We must endeavour to make further progress in addressing that issue.</p> <p>  Second, in regard to the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and its predecessor, the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, I am very confident that the overwhelming majority of employers have used both schemes exactly in the way in which we intended.  We can see that by the number of employers on the scheme and the number of employees who are now related to the scheme.  As we move into a more mature phase of maintaining the subsidy - we have already given a commitment that it will go up to 31 March next year -  issues that have always been very important to the Revenue Commissioners, such as compliance and how employers participate in the scheme, will absolutely continue to be things that we monitor and check.  As I pointed out when I brought the legislation to the D&aacute;il to launch the TWSS, the penalties and sanctions are very severe for any employer who uses the scheme differently from what is intended.  It will be a really serious matter for any company if it turns out that the way in which it entered or used the scheme is not as the D&aacute;il intended.  The amount of money involved in the two schemes is huge and it is intended to look after citizens at a time of great risk.</p> <p>  I will now answer the four questions the Deputy put to me.  The first related to IFAC's pre-budget submission.  In fairness to IFAC, it has always made the case for having the right budgetary policy in place to reflect what is happening in our economy and with our people at any given time.</p><p>IFAC has been broadly supportive of the first phase of supports we introduced and has given us some thoughts for the second and third phases.  Those advices are being examined.</p><p> The Deputy also spoke about weather and outdoor dining.  Much of the advice that is issued is in the hands of the Department of Health and the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.  It is worth noting that at level 3, as members will know, some outdoor dining is allowed.  I am only too aware of the fact that different local authorities are doing this differently.  Some are doing it better than others.  I ask all local authorities to use all the flexibility they have to support caf&eacute;s and restaurants, for which this has been such a tough time, in facilitating dining outside of premises.</p><p> Before I make my point about office living and our city centres, I want to give the context that our pre-eminent concern, and the concern of anybody who debates and discusses this issue, is to defeat this disease, keep people safe and keep workers safe.  To repeat what I said in the D&aacute;il earlier in the week, I think we gravely underestimate the impact on our citizens of people not being able to go into work.  We can view it purely in terms of the indirect effects that office working has on restaurants, caf&eacute;s and how the city centre looks.  The Deputy was beginning to go into that territory in the points he was going to make to me.  Equally, having workplaces functioning is at the heart of how we develop skills.  It is important from a well-being point of view that there is a workplace to which those who can do so safely can go.  That well-being is at the heart of how we develop skills.  This is a skills-based economy.</p></speech>

Today is 1 October, and I am very conscious that this would normally be the time of year when many people would be starting their first job having gone through college.  Working in an environment with other people, learning from them and socialising with them is such a critical element of well-being and how we develop productivity for our economy.  Clearly, now is not the time for that given where we are with this disease.  As our efforts redouble during the rest of this year, I hope this is an issue we can make further progress on next year.</p></speech>

The fact that the summer economic statement was not published this year hampers the scrutiny of the budgetary process by this committee and the D&aacute;il.  As I have a number of aspects that I want to discuss, I will launch straight into asking questions.  In terms of the wage subsidy scheme, has the Minister figures on how many people across the economy earn less than the &euro;151.50 gross weekly pay?  Will he consider Sinn F&eacute;in's proposal to introduce wage supports for those low-paid workers and increase wage supports for the more impacted sectors?  What consideration has he given to replacing the EWSS post 31 March?</p></speech>

These proposals are being made by every Deputy on this committee as we consider how we can evolve existing supports to support sectors of the economy that are very vulnerable and are being hit very hard at the moment.  Of course, I am looking at the options in this regard in advance of budget day.</p> <p>  I have given thought to what will happen beyond 31 March but we are still some way from being able to answer the really critical questions of what will be the level of subsidy that will be needed for our economy in April and May of next year, and what would be the appropriate structure of the wage subsidy scheme at that point.</p><p>We are looking at options in that regard, but I do not believe we will have the information available to us to be able to make decisions on the future design of a wage subsidy scheme for some time yet.</p></speech>

I seek clarification on this.  What is this deficit range in nominal terms?  In saying this is on a no-policy-change basis, does that include the &euro;9 billion in Covid-related expenditure?  With regard to funding the borrowing, in 2020 part of the deficit was funded through cash transfers, for example, an Exchequer transfer of &euro;2 billion from the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  Will a portion of the 2021 deficit be funded through other cash transfers and, if so, what are they?  The Minister mentioned, and has previously stated, that we must stay within the pack of EU member states in the context of deficit levels.  In announcing his budgetary strategy, he stated that the objective is to ensure that Ireland's deficit position remains within average euro levels.  Is he aware of what the deficit levels will be in other EU member states next year?</p></speech>

Yes, it includes the &euro;9 billion of Covid-related expenditure.  Regarding transfers within the balance sheet for next year, the key one that will be coming through will be further transfers from NAMA.  On the nominal value of the different deficit ranges I have outlined, it would equate to between &euro;14 billion and &euro;18 billion to &euro;19 billion, depending on where we end up in that range.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, is working hard to understand where we would be in that range from a no-policy-change perspective.</p></speech>

We have a situation whereby my colleague, Deputy Doherty, submitted a parliamentary question about the &euro;9 billion and did not get an adequate response to it, but later we saw that it was then printed in the Irish Examiner.  In that regard, the Minister said in his opening statement that he has announced supports which, to date, amount to &euro;24.5 billion or 14% of national income.  Can the Minister clarify what amount of this has been released to date?</p></speech>

While we are unclear about what the exact figure will be, we are anticipating that it will be approximately &euro;1.5 billion.  The figure for this year was in the region of &euro;2 billion.</p> <p>  Regarding the deployment of the &euro;9 billion, the vast majority of that has now been released in the way we anticipated because so much of it is driven through the TWSS, the pandemic unemployment payment and the cost involved in the acquisition of items such as personal protective equipment, PPE.  That is being spent in the way we anticipated.  Obviously, one of the things we will be working to understand, particularly across November and December when Departments look to deliver the expenditure commitments they have committed to, is ensuring that all of the money we made a commitment to spend is spent.</p><p>I am particularly aware, given the prevailing economic circumstances, that spending that kind of money may make a big difference to people's lives, their incomes and even their jobs, given the many other existing pressures.</p></speech>

Many of my colleagues are involved in their own national budgetary processes.  While they have given me some indication of where they might end up, I am reluctant to share that information in deference to their parliaments and work in which my colleagues may be involved with their governments.  As we move through next week, however, I hope to try to get more of a sense of where our borrowing requirement will be compared with other countries in the eurozone.  The key aspect, which the Deputy already recognised in her opening question, concerns the opening figures of our current deficit range.  On a no-change policy basis, that will be between 4.5% and 5.5%, so whatever figure we end up with on budget day will be ahead of that.</p></speech>

What is under way now is that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, is working to finalise what exactly will be the deficit position when all our current commitments are met.  When we are clear on that aspect, any policy choices to stimulate the economy and the initiation of any new policy measures will follow.  Those are the two major pieces of work that we will be engaged in for the next week.</p></speech>

Regarding the budget and the recovery of the Irish economy, how does the Minister see the impact of a vaccine being found for the Covid-19 virus feeding into the budgetary process?  Can the economy recover fully before a vaccine is found and what are the implications for budgeting?  The Minister might also comment on implications of a no-deal Brexit for budget preparations.  The EU has also set aside the fiscal rules for the moment, but for how long does the Minister foresee that being the case?  I ask the Minister, therefore, for his overview of the economic landscape for the next three years, including whether the Irish economy can recover before a vaccine is found and the implications of a no-deal Brexit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-01a.323" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100100002#J00900"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I begin with the scenario of a no-deal Brexit.  Brexit occurring without a trade deal would have a significant impact on how we would have expected our economy to perform next year.  I will give two figures to illustrate what that context would look like.  In the absence of a trade deal, post-Brexit, we expect the economy to grow by around 1% to 1.5% next year.  If a trade deal is agreed in the context of Brexit, our national economic growth could be between 3% and 4%.  That is a very big difference, and the biggest difference that will be felt in people's lives will concern where we are with levels of unemployment.  We indicated that if we were successful in securing an agreement with the United Kingdom, that unemployment could be approximately 8% for next year.</p><p>This would still be very high, but in the absence of that agreement, unemployment would be between 10% and 10.75%.  That will make such a big difference to the lives of so many people.</p><p> In terms of whether the economy can recover before a vaccine is found, we should distinguish between two things relating to the vaccine.  The first is a vaccine being discovered and the second is the vaccine being broadly available.  As the Deputy well knows, they are two very different events.  Do I believe our economy can recover before a vaccine is discovered?  The economy is showing signs already of recovering in terms of how we could measure growth in that it is growing in a very different way from how it grew earlier in the year.  Even if we end up having to deal with a no trade deal Brexit, the economy will still be bigger next year than it was this year, and our assumptions are based on there not being a broadly available vaccine for most or any of next year so it can recover.</p><p> Then we get into the distinction between a recovering economy and a recovered economy.  I believe we will only get to the point where we have a recovered economy if there is medical technology or a vaccine that is broadly available and accepted.  That would create an environment of confidence in which we could get back to the levels of employment and income growth we left behind at the start of this year.</p><p> With regard to the parts of the economy that are most affected by it, there are two.  The first is those parts of our economy that rely on the assembly of people and for whom social and physical distancing has such an impact and, therefore, where we are with hospitality in particular.  All of the parts of the hospitality sector are the most adversely affected by this type of technology not being available.  The second comprises aviation and tourism, because confidence regarding being able to travel healthily is having a fundamental impact on people's willingness to travel.  This in turn is tied up with the availability of a vaccine.</p><p> I go back to the point I made earlier on a vaccine being discovered and verified and then becoming broadly available.  While I am not by any means an expert in these matters it would appear there will be a period of time between these two things happening.</p></speech>

Will it be for one, two or three years with regard to proofing a budget?  Does the Minister expect a no-deal Brexit at this stage?  He is preparing in this way but does he expect it to be the case?</p> <p>  With regard to the sectors, our income tax receipts have held up in the main and our corporation tax receipts are up, but generally it is the multinational sectors and higher end jobs holding it up.  How does the Minister believe we can deal with the sectors he mentioned, including the hospitality sector, which are lower paid and aviation with regard to health implications?  What measures can we put in place so we do not have a long-term scarring effect on these particular sectors that are so impacted by Covid?</p></speech>

Precisely because of the two issues the Deputy has raised, which is where we stand with Brexit and the availability of a vaccine, we have decided not to do a budgetary forecast beyond next year.  On budget day we will update where we are in 2020 and 2021 and we will not go beyond that.  We have not assumed the broad availability of a vaccine for almost all of next year because of the need to be careful about the assumptions we are making.</p><p>I have touched on some of the sectors that are most adversely affected.  We are coming into challenges regarding the trade-offs between universally available schemes that have a big impact on and are a big help to everybody and the fact that not everyone is being impacted equally.  Every government and parliament dealing with Covid-19 is now grappling with that.  The tools available to deal with that include grants.  For example, the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, has already done a great deal from a grant point of view to try to support different parts of our society and economy.  The choices regarding the temporary wage subsidy scheme and any future wage subsidy scheme are difficult because any effort we make to change the operation of the subsidy scheme for one part of the economy has big impacts on the rest of us.  That is difficult for us.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, and I are meeting the Ministers with responsibility for different sectors and I am also meeting representatives of many of these sectors directly.  I meet those who work on the front line in the different sectors regularly to hear what it is like working in the various parts of our economy at the moment.  I cannot give the Deputy the detail of anything we might be able to do yet for the sectors to which he referred.  Clearly, however, in preparing for the budget we are aware that some parts of our economy and country are not recovering at the same speed as the other parts.  That is evident to all of us.  We are trying to assess what we can do that will be of help to the economy at the moment and that will form a big part of what we will do on budget day.</p></speech>

As we have moved to the Green Party slot, I will now question the Minister.  I have a longer question about the pressure of health expenditure on the budget but I will start with a broader question.  Is the Minister currently considering measures to ensure Covid-19 expenditure will not be rolled into the base of Government spending going forward leading to significant permanent expenditure increases?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-01a.331" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100100002#L00500"><p>We are looking at the question of what amounts of additional expenditure will not roll over into next year.  This always happens on budget day when we have the fabled "one-offs" and must assess whether something that happens in a particular year will continue into the next year.  However, the complexity involved in doing that at the moment is significant.  Even earlier this year, for example, we thought there would be a one-off policy measure.  It turns out there are still things we need to do and that we must maintain as we move into the second half of the year.  The Minister, Deputy McGrath, and I are working on that at the moment.  The answer, therefore, is "Yes" but being exactly clear on what will not carry over into next year and continue beyond that is a difficult calculation to make.</p></speech>

I am interested in the view being taken on the pressure that health expenditure will bring to bear on the budget and how we are managing that in a dynamic situation where this could be a long-term pressure on the budget.  By the very nature of the sudden onset of Covid-19, we have had to expend vast quantities on money without the level of oversight or scrutiny we might otherwise have had.</p><p>One of the areas the budgetary oversight committee will be considering more generally in the coming months concerns how to track the level of services being provided in terms of public expenditure.  I am interested in hearing what measures are being implemented to audit the return on the expenditure and manage its changing nature.  Does the Minister envisage supplementary budgets?  What will be the impact on his view on the budget and expenditure in the long run?</p></speech>

At a time when we are trying to keep our schools open and encourage people to return to safe workplaces, this is a major challenge.  The scale of the winter plan reflected that in terms of what is being done with public health experts and through the provision of additional beds.</p> <p>  On the question on how we are going to manage this on an ongoing basis, it goes back to whether we can track what the money is being used for.  In many ways, greater clarity is required than in the past because we have to know every day how many beds are available from an ICU perspective, who is in them and whether they are being used.  That is not information we can check every month; we have to know the position every day.  In one way, the measurement of those indicators is far sharper now than at other times.</p> <p>  The other medium-term challenge we are going to face is trying to assess the resources that need to be permanently available.  At present, it is very difficult to be clear on that.  We are not seeking to make additional budgetary forecasts beyond next year now because we hope we will be clearer on some of these issues in the first half of next year.</p></speech>

The Parliamentary Budget Office made a presentation to this committee this week and mentioned in its submission the possibility of Ireland setting its own domestic fiscal rules, or debt limits, while the Stability and Growth Pact is suspended.  Could the Minister comment on whether that is a possibility over and above setting a stated target for this year, for example?</p></speech>

Fiscal rules, by their nature, are medium-term and try to set out the arrangements for a number of years.  It is fine to advise that this be done but to set figures, begin the debate now and try to set targets for the rules would not be appropriate for the economy now or for the encouragement of an economic recovery.  That is the view held by many of my colleagues in the European Union and in our European institutions.  It is definitely appropriate for Ireland at present.  I have given a commitment that, as part of the stability programme update that we will give in the first half of next year, there will be an opportunity to put together a budgetary forecast for a few years and lay out what we believe our targets will be, but I am not in a position to do that now.  Trying to set the targets now would not be helpful.</p></speech>

Our objective is to recycle all the additional revenue for very clear purposes.</p><p>The first of these purposes is to seek to protect anybody who would be at risk of fuel poverty and adversely affected by moves in carbon taxation.  The second purpose will be to fund the development of needed infrastructure and the third will be to make progress on the retrofitting of homes.  This is not a new approach initiated by this Government; it is what we did last year.  We will continue with that approach in the coming budget.  There is a lot of value in being able to explain how this money is used and in using it to influence decisions that families and businesses might make in the future with regard to the use of carbon and fuel.  I am very much aware of the need to get the balance right between such a move and protecting the living standards of those who are vulnerable.  That is why a significant share of the revenue generated by that move is put into changing the relevant allowances in our social welfare code.</p></speech>

Everything we do at the moment, we do in the context of Covid-19 and the need to maintain social solidarity in the face of the existential threat we face now and which we have been facing for some time.  The guiding principle that has underpinned this is that we are all in it together.  People bought into that and have suffered great hardship on the understanding that we would remain in it together against Covid-19.</p> <p>  As the Minister will know, for some time I have been raising the plight of particular sectors that are suffering disproportionately.  He referred to some of these groups in answering earlier questions.  Their futures, however, remain very unclear.  I refer to the 25,000 or so taxi drivers whose livelihoods and industry have been decimated.  As long as restrictions persist, or if they become even more severe, they are in deep trouble.  The arts, music and live entertainment sectors are also affected.  These sectors are important but they have been ignored or dismissed.  We realise now more than ever that we need these people.  When access to public transport is restricted, we really need the taxi drivers.  We will need them afterwards as well.  We also need the arts to sustain us through this time and, when we come out the other side, we will need the music and live entertainment people.  </p> <p>  Their key demands are for the retention of the income supports and for flexibility to work a bit beyond what is allowed, when work is available to them in this very uncertain period.  These are their key demands although they have others.  Both these groups have ongoing costs, including insurance and loan repayments.  Many of these people are in deep trouble.  Will the Minister sustain them so they can pay their bills, rent and mortgage payments and so that their businesses can survive?  That is one key question.</p> <p>  Other groups have been affected but these are two that have got themselves organised.  I welcome the engagement of the Minister and his Department, particularly with regard to the events sector.  I wish he would reconsider his decision not to meet the four groups representing taxi drivers.  He should meet them and hear their case.  I would also like a breakdown of the other groups that have been hit particularly hard.  Does the Minister have a breakdown of those who are getting the pandemic unemployment payment?  By definition, everyone getting the payment is in a sector that has been hit.  We need to know precisely in what sectors and employments people are getting the PUP.  It is a similar situation in respect of the wage subsidy scheme.  If the Minister does not have that information now, I would appreciate it if he would provide it later as it would help us understand which sectors really need help.</p><p>Connected to that, some sectors have not been hit as hard.  Looking at corporate tax returns and some of the income tax returns, they are surprisingly good.  This suggests some people are doing well.  If we are all in this together, should we consider a solidarity tax on wealth and profits for those people who are not suffering, or in some cases who are doing very well, in order to finance the supports necessary for the people who are hardest hit?  That is if we are all in this together.  Would it not be a reasonable suggestion?<br/><br/>I have a question on collateralised loan obligations.  There was a rather alarming article in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>about commercial loans securitised on a very big scale that are floating around the global financial system like the residential securities that plummeted the entire global economy.  We could be facing a similar position with commercial loan obligations that are securitised and on the balance sheets of financial institutions with all sorts of potential consequences or a very severe economic crisis if they go bad.  We need to know about such matters.<br/><br/>I will comment on the fiscal rules.  We opposed them because we thought that positions precisely like this would render them redundant and pointless, or an obstacle to taking the necessary actions.  Is it not fair to say now that the fiscal rules are a bit like an umbrella full of holes; when the sun is shining, that might be fine, but when it starts raining it is absolutely useless.  We should recognise they were misguided and they have, effectively, been abandoned in the current context.</p></speech>

We have figures of the breakdown by sector of people in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and wage subsidy scheme.  I will have those figures sent to the committee.  The composition will not come as a surprise to members and the sectors affected most include construction, retail and hospitality.  They formed a very large share of either employers on the wage subsidy scheme or former workers on the PUP.</p> <p>  The challenge I face in engaging sectors is that there is a range of Ministers who come before a range of Oireachtas committees and they must engage with the sectors for which they have responsibility.  I have to respect that.  After our previous engagement in the D&aacute;il, I raised with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, the concerns mentioned by the Deputy about taxi drivers and the role of the National Transport Authority, NTA.  I raised the matter with the NTA as well.</p> <p>  On the arts and performance sector, which relates to the questions put to me by Deputy O'Donnell, I am very much aware that there are really important parts of our society that have been adversely affected.  A life without concerts or theatre is a very different life to look forward to.  I fully appreciate that.  I am really aware of those who are affected by this disease in that way.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, in his engagement concerning spending with other Ministers is also looking at this.</p> <p>  Many governments are grappling with this and not many have found a clear or effective solution.  It is very difficult for the Government to be able to step in and entirely take the place of live audiences or regular live events happening while compensating all the revenue without setting off big challenges in doing the same for the rest of the economy.  This is the matter we have considered now for quite a while.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned that some parts of the economy are doing better than others and that is the case.  We made changes in the employment wage subsidy scheme and there are many parts of our economy that were able to manage that change in subsidy.</p><p>They were reopened or they were doing well at the time the change in subsidy was made.  That, I believe, will be evidenced when we are able to point to the number of employers on the new scheme.  I accept that, at the point we made the change in the subsidy, other things happened in the economy and in our public health guidance that created an issue for important employers in our country and their workers.  It goes back to the big challenge we have here that even in this phase of dealing with Covid, the so-called multi-speed Irish economy is now moving in different cycles.  This is something the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, and I are looking at in terms of how we deal with it from a policy point of view.</p><p> On collateralised loan obligations, CLOs, and what the Deputy referred to in terms of commercial property risks, globally that is one of the set of challenges that are there.  From an Irish point of view, the Deputy will remember the years of debates we had in this room regarding the owners of commercial property in Ireland.  The relationship of the Irish banking sector and our domestic economy with the owners of commercial property is now different from what it was a number of years ago.  If certain trends in commercial property were to develop, while it will have an impact on our banking sector and we will have to evaluate what that impact would be, the Irish banking sector is no longer the only owner of commercial property in Ireland.  That is a big change from where we were a decade ago.</p><p> On fiscal rules, it will not surprise the Deputy to hear me say I would make the opposite argument to his, namely, the fact that most countries in Europe, including our own, went into this crisis with public finances that were balanced, in surplus or had smaller deficits allowed two things to happen.  First, it helped with the European Central Bank making its huge intervention to support the selling of government debt across this period of the crisis.  Second, countries had a capacity available to them to borrow huge amounts of money quickly.  It makes a big difference to our economic fortunes that we can now borrow money as a semi-core European economy as opposed to where we were when we were dealing with another global crisis a decade ago.  That makes a huge difference to our country's ability to fund the things we will need to fund in the future.</p></speech>

He is in an elevated position today, though I know he would never dream of talking down to anybody.  The Parliamentary Budget Office figures we have looked at and the Parliamentary Budget Office commentary that arrived on our desks over the last couple of days suggest that a further &euro;7 billion in public spending will be made this year additional to what was originally allocated by the D&aacute;il.  That suggests that there will be at least one further set of Revised Estimates or Supplementary Estimates presented to the D&aacute;il this year.  Will the Minister comment on that?  If it is the case, when will that happen?</p> <p>  Second, I note in the Minister's response to Deputy Mair&eacute;ad Farrell earlier that he put on the record that he expects an additional &euro;1.5 billion in receipts transferred from the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, next year, so he is clearly factoring that into his budgetary considerations ahead of budget 2021.  Are there any other significant once-off payments he expects to arise next year?</p> <p>  Third and final, though I hope to have the opportunity to put more questions to the Minister after his initial response, the Social Insurance Fund is obviously under significant pressure and there is expected to be a &euro;3 billion refund to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection from that fund before the end of this year.  Outside of getting people back to work, how do the Minister and his colleagues plan to replenish the fund?  There are huge draws on that fund at the moment and huge expectations in terms of additional benefits people might expect over the next few years.  Does the Minister plan over the next period of time to bring, for example, PRSI contributions for self-employed and employer's PRSI up to the level of EU norms?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-01a.349" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100100002#P00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  On the timings for Revised Estimates, Cabinet earlier this week agreed a set of Revised Estimates.</p><p>Earlier today, I was fixing a time with the finance committee as to when the finance Estimates would come before it.  Many Estimates will be coming before the relevant committees over the next few weeks.</p><p> The Deputy asked about the Social Insurance Fund and the kinds of steps that need to be taken.  He is correct that the largest contribution that can be made to the fund is to get people back to work.  That is why dealing with our unemployment challenge is so important.  One of the things I believe we need to assess, as recognised in the programme for Government, is the level of social insurance payments we have in the Irish economy.  To be clear and precise, I am not saying they are going to change in this budget or even imminently.  If we are going to make a change like that, it clearly must happen at a point when the economy is not dealing with the level of challenge that it is today.  That said, we are going to need to fund policies in the future that have always been important but are probably going to be even more important as we become aware of our vulnerabilities regarding public health.  We are going to have to look at the social insurance code.  I am aiming, in conjunction with the T&aacute;naiste, to put in place a process through which we can get views from the Oireachtas and different parts of our society and economy on that matter.</p><p> I am not aware that any other one-off transfer of the scale of that from NAMA will be coming in.  It will be the case, as we move through the year, that some other one-off payments may accrue but they will be nowhere near the scale of the NAMA figure.</p></speech>

A degree of consensus is building about some of the lessons that have been learned about where there are gaps in public services as a result of the pandemic and how we have responded to it, as well as about the need to improve our public services, particularly our healthcare service, in the longer term.  The programme for Government has ruled out any increases in income tax, regardless of what one might be earning, over the duration of this Administration.  The Minister will have been briefed on the Central Bank report issued a couple of weeks ago, which shows clearly the level of wealth held by a relatively small minority of people in this country and the nature of that wealth.  It should not be beyond us to introduce a net wealth tax as has been achieved in analogous EU states to try to tax that wealth in a smart fashion.  Most wealth is held not in income but in assets, property, inherited wealth and other ways.  It can be done.  Is it something the Minister is considering?  We need to broaden the tax base and make it much more sustainable because we are vulnerable to international shocks.  We are reliant on corporation tax and there are a lot of moving parts around the international conversation on corporation tax at the moment.  It is possible to achieve the design of a wealth tax that would have a minimal impact on the productive economy.  Is that something the Minister and his officials are looking at now?  Is work taking place in the Department of Finance on that possibility?</p> <p>  The following point has already been mentioned and, in fact, I raised it in the D&aacute;il when we had an opportunity to ask Priority Questions in the middle of this week.  IFAC has referenced in a recent report the requirement for a &euro;10 billion multi-annual stimulus fund.  Is that fund interchangeable with the Minister's notion of a national recovery fund?  Where does he plan to obtain the resources to fund that recovery fund?</p> <p>  The Minister will know that I, along with the Labour Party and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, have been a proponent of the idea of this country adopting a German-style short-time work scheme.  Deputy Boyd Barrett has referenced, for example, the particular difficulties experienced in the arts and entertainment sector and by embedding the kind of short-time work scheme that has been in place in Germany since the last recession, we can address in a more sustainable fashion the kinds of problems we are having at the moment.</p><p>That would also allow us to embed the ideas of training and of conditionality around State support for the business sector.  I would appreciate the Minister's remarks on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-01a.353" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100100002#R00200"><p>I will deal with the Deputy's queries in reverse order.  We will have to learn the lessons from the two different wage subsidy schemes that we brought in.  I believe there are elements of those wage subsidy schemes that will become more permanent features of where we will be in the future.  I am not saying a wage subsidy scheme would always be "on" and operational but we will have to reflect on the possibility that we would have tools such as that which would be quickly available.  For me, in comparing what happened in Germany and Ireland, the speed of a response of a tool such as that makes a big difference to keeping jobs.  We moved with extraordinary speed to implement the TWSS, and I thank Deputy Nash and other Deputies who facilitated us in doing that over a long day and night in the D&aacute;il.  However, if something like that had been available a couple of weeks earlier or a week earlier, it might have made a difference to the lives of thousands of people.  When we get through this particular phase of living with Covid-19, I want to think about how something such as this would be available to this and future Governments so that we would be able to quickly turn it on with a speed that we could not do at that time.  I would say, however, that I am not sure it will offer the panacea the Deputy is looking for in relation to particular parts of our society and country.  This scheme has proven its ability to work effectively for the PAYE sector, whereas many of the citizens to whom the Deputy is referring are self-employed.  That is at the heart of some of the difficulties that we have and that I have debated with other members of the committee.</p> <p>  I am aware that IFAC's view on the multi-annual stimulus is that it is necessary.  I would be cautious, however, about putting a figure on that multi-annual stimulus at this point in time because it is one thing to try to get the level of stimulus that is needed for 2021 right, but another thing to make decisions at the end of 2020 about what could be needed in 2022 or 2023.  Those are big decisions to make.  I fully anticipate that we will need to continue to provide levels of stimulus for a while yet.  What those levels of stimulus will be will only become obvious when we get nearer the point in time in which we need to make it available.  IFAC's advice that I need to have a multi-annual stimulus available can equally be critical if I find myself in a given year in which the level of stimulus is too high.  Although it will never be too high for those who are benefiting from it or who need it, it could well be too high in the eyes of IFAC.</p> <p>  On the matter of a wealth tax, no such measure will be presented in a week and a half.  We have an array of different taxes such as capital gains tax.  The way local property tax is implemented makes a big difference to the progressivity of our tax code.  The Deputy referred to some effective wealth taxes in other countries.  It appears to me that wealth taxes in other countries lead to wealth moving or to tax advisers and solicitors being paid well for advising their clients on those taxes.  The figures from the CSO that the Deputy has mentioned also showed that the relative share of net wealth held by the top 10% of households in our country has decreased since 2013.  The decrease in Ireland was bigger than that in other eurozone countries, which points to the fact that between our direct and indirect taxes, we have effective ways of taxing wealth.</p><p>I am always open to getting the views of the committee regarding how these things can be done differently.</p></speech>

First, we cannot pre-plan what we will be doing beyond the middle of next year, which creates a difficulty and means we cannot prepare a forecast.  We do know what has happened since last March and on what money was spent, however.  With the emergency funding which has been put in place and all of the good this has done as a life support for the economy, how do we measure the outcomes and results?  Are we getting value for money?  Is there a deadweight within what we have done?  How are we learning for the next six months of this crisis?</p> <p>  The performing companies are in pharmaceuticals, chemicals, medical devices and computer services.  It is the smaller indigenous industries which are on life support at the moment that concern me.  They have got supports like the wage subsidy scheme and the restart grants.  How sustainable are these?  How long can we keep them going?  Until we know we will have a vaccine and are on top of Covid, as well as how we are figured out with Brexit, how can we plan next year's budget to support those industries?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-01a.357" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100100002#S00400"><p>If we look at the level of supports made available since July, it is an indication of the kind of policy measures likely to be needed for 2021.  These measures included the wage subsidy scheme, the continuation of the pandemic unemployment payments until next year, although at a reduced level from where they were at the crisis, and the availability of restart grants.  Do I believe we can keep those supports going indefinitely?  The honest answer to that question is we cannot.</p> <p>  Can we keep them going for a long enough period to deal with the impact of Covid-19, however?  I believe we can if we are willing to make choices regarding the level at which those policy interventions are made.  The wage subsidy scheme is a good example.  We made changes to the subsidy which was available in September, which gives me the confidence to say that we can extend the scheme up to 31 March in an unchanged format.</p> <p>  I am equally aware that when we get beyond 31 March, there will be things that will be needed after that.  If we can build up a consensus regarding the reduction of subsidies, as our economy begins to reopen or stay open for longer, then I believe we will be able to continue to support our economy as we live with this disease and then contain and cure it.  Integral to that is an acceptance, if not an agreement, of the need to change those level of subsidies and the frequency with which they are made available.</p> <p>  Is there deadweight in these supports?  I have no doubt at all that in the coming weeks, months and years, many will argue there is deadweight in the interventions we have made and they should have been done differently or better at the time.  Whatever deadweight is there, I am certain it is more than offset by the jobs and income that we protected at a time of enormous risk for Ireland.  What we have saved far outweighs any deadweight effect that is there.</p></speech>

Today, my own county council met to discuss the prospect of closing down two of its public swimming pools as it cannot afford to keep them going.  The income of the local authority sector has been decimated.  It will take a huge commitment to bring them and their rates base back when things start to improve.  The plan to support local authorities is very important but it must not be a stopgap measure as they will need support for a number of years to recover if we are still to provide the services from local authorities that we expect and take for granted.  What is the financial commitment in the budget?  What are the Minister's thoughts on the matter?</p></speech>

For three quarters of this year, we have committed that the Exchequer would centrally fund rates income across that period.  I am sure that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, are looking at what kind of commitment we can give for the final quarter.  Despite a huge intervention like that, we will not be able to meet every need that we are asked to meet.  Due to the level of need that is coming from local authorities and other parts of Government, not to mention from our economy and society overall, not all of those will be met.  I hope that in the engagement that will take place with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and with local authorities, really important facilities like swimming pools can be maintained and kept open.</p> <p>  My understanding of the swimming pools that the Deputy referred to is that they have a private operator and are in licence to the local authority.  The impact of social distancing and the general decrease in attendance at swimming pools like that is having a really big impact on the funding of those swimming pools and the revenue that that operator is getting from the maintenance of those pools.  I hope engagement will be possible on issues like that.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked whether we can keep this going forever in terms of the funding and things that we had, and I said we cannot.  I do believe, however, that we will still be able to do enough to meet really important key needs.  I hope now that the local authority in his area and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government can engage on the future of those swimming pools.  I and the Chair know from our constituency the importance of those kinds of facilities and I can well imagine the upset that will be caused by the closure of them elsewhere.</p></speech>

That was mostly for practical reasons.  To be able to go ahead with that and for the Revenue Commissioners to be able to implement it, we would have had to have legislation passed relating to all of that across May and June of this year.  For many reasons, that simply was not possible to do because there was either no Government or a Government was just being formed, and then when the Government was formed we were focused on and preoccupied with lots of other huge priorities.  What will now happen is that I have indicated to the Oireachtas that I will look to have the relevant legislation for a change for next November, presented and passed in the Oireachtas by the first quarter of next year, which will then allow the Revenue Commissioners to make the change they need to make.</p></speech>

It is vital support in the present climate.  Unfortunately, as the Minister has indicated, more will have to come.  At least we hope that more will come.</p><p>We do not want to go into that other than to say I support the points raised by other speakers relating to the entertainment, services and sporting sectors, all of which contribute to the mass of our economy.</p><p> I have questions about two issues.  First, we have the potential double whammy of Covid-19, as it stands now, and Brexit.  If the Minister does not want to answer this question, that is fine, but is he satisfied that adequate provision can be made in the case of an island nation for adequate transport to and from this island, air and sea, to meet the double challenges to which I referred, and I refer to the national airlines, Aer Lingus and Ryanair, in particular, given that other countries had to bail out their respective airlines for obvious reasons?</p><p> The other question relates to the extent to which our colleagues throughout the European Union are impacted by Covid-19.  Does the Minister see that affecting their ability to recover and that having an impact on this country in terms of them not being able to meet their commitments in the way that was anticipated, which may cause changes in the way the Stability and Growth Pact is applied?</p><p> On the calculations, businesses have been hit in a severe way.  I disagree with the notion of increasing taxes in the current climate.  It would be implosive in so far as the range of businesses in the sector is concerned.  Will the Minister put into his calculations situations where, for instance, businesses that were hit by the downturn in the economy in the past ten years, followed by Covid-19, may have a need to re-equip?  I am aware there are supports already in place but they may or may not be sufficient to re-equip and prepare for business.  If businesses can write off the various investments against their taxes, it works.  If they cannot do that, they are at a disadvantage.  I will take written answers if the Minister runs out of time.</p></speech>

I will begin with accessing airlines and so on.  It is the case that many very high-profile national carriers in other countries have received funding from their own governments.  It is a tribute to the way in which a number of very big airlines are run here in Ireland that they are able to keep access going and the support they have received is a matter for them.  We have brought in some broadly available support schemes for the entire economy.  They may or may not have participated in them but up to this point they have been able to maintain the level of access they have without some of the very high-profile things that have happened in other countries.</p> <p>  In respect of the EU and what is happening in other countries, the issues we have debated regarding the speed of recovery here in Ireland play out across the entire European Union.  The impact that Covid-19 has had on the economic growth of member states of the European Union is divergent.  Some countries have taken a hit of a particular magnitude.  Other countries have taken far bigger hits.  The next generation EU initiative and the recovery and resilience fund that was launched by the European Commission and the European Council is vital because that is trying to close the gap between different member states of the European Union to try to bring all countries to an average level of recovery.  That is why the historic decision has been made in respect of the availability of grants towards member states of the European Union.</p><p>It absolutely is the right thing for the European Union and it is a significant development.  If one looks at what the European Central Bank is now doing and if one looks at the Next Generation EU recovery plan, there is a profound difference between these kind of interventions and where we were ten years ago and it represents a gigantic change.</p><p> On the Deputy's point regarding employers re-equipping, Deputy Lahart, in his questioning, talked about the consequences of 2008 and 2011 and what that means for policymaking today.  One of the important consequences in dealing with this crisis is that the level of private and corporate debt in the Irish economy as we entered the Covid-19 crisis was far lower than it had been at other times.  That will prove to be an incredibly important part of how companies have equipped themselves to recover.  The combined impact of that and the work we are doing in restart grants, the income subsidy schemes and so on can help employers of all sizes recover from the economic effects of this terrible disease.</p></speech>

At this stage, we are preparing for a disorderly Brexit.  What spending provisions are there to deal with a no-deal Brexit and of what does the Minister see them being composed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-01a.367" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100100002#V00300"><p>In terms of the existing provisions, there are two important dimensions to it.  The first is the supports that have been made available through Enterprise Ireland as we have got ready to deal with Brexit over many years.  The supports that are available, primarily from Enterprise Ireland, EI, have been really important components of helping employers and companies get ready for dealing with Brexit.</p> <p>  The second is the support in training that is available now in grants to help companies deal with the different customs regime that we may be in if we find ourselves having to deal with a no-trade-deal Brexit.  New ideas and proposals from that were recently launched by the T&aacute;naiste.</p> <p>  The last part of it all that has been really important is what has been done from a loan point of view.  We have initiatives that are now in place such as the Brexit loan scheme, which involved &euro;300 million, and the future growth loan scheme, which involved a further &euro;800 million.  Those kind of loans that are available at lower interest rates for longer have been really helpful in getting companies ready for the shock of a no-trade-deal Brexit.</p> <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, we had to invest a great deal of money in getting Dublin Port, Rosslare Europort and Dublin Airport ready to deal with the consequences of Brexit.  However, that money to get our airports and ports ready has been spent over a number of years.</p></speech>

The public health measures are, of course, necessary to contain its spread and its impact on the economy.  The economic forecast published this week outlined public health restrictions here have been more stringent than those in other EU states and I would be interested to hear the Minister's view as to why this is.</p><p>I also wish to touch on the interview by the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, with the <i>The Currency</i>today, where he stated that we have to say to public health experts that it cannot be public health only.  The T&aacute;naiste touches on the fact that he had been in Berlin where there were more people in offices.  He states that we need to be looking at the numbers in hospitals and that kind of thing, although we are aware that even if one is not hospitalised, there can be long-term impacts on people, including young people.  Does the Minister know if the T&aacute;naiste has raised these concerns with NPHET or if this is just with the media and does the Minister have a stance on it?</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste, the Taoiseach, myself and the Cabinet are always looking at what that balance is and how we can get it right and that is what has underpinned the publication of the five-stage roadmap.  That five-stage roadmap looks to have a set of public health restrictions in place to reflect where we could be with the disease at any one point in time.  For myself, in these kinds of debates, I have always argued that the long-term foundation of our economy recovering is our citizens having ongoing confidence in our public health.  Of course, there are always discussions about how we get the balance right, stage by stage, within NPHET, between the Government and NPHET and then within Government.  However, the T&aacute;naiste and the Cabinet believe that in the roadmap we have published we are getting that balance right but we always need to be open to debating this and looking at what the right thing is to do.</p></speech>

He touched on an awful lot already but I want to focus on the stimulus measures we have taken so far, more so on the capital stimulus measures rather than the wage subsidies, unemployment assistance and so on.  I acknowledge it is still quite early but are there indications that these measures are having an economic effect?  Are there particular stimulus measures on the capital side that the Minister sees as being particularly effective?</p></speech>

The first one is the employment wage subsidy scheme.  I hope in the next 48 hours to be clear about the number of employers who are on the scheme and the number of people affected and supported by the scheme.  The two wage subsidy schemes we brought in are among the most effective economic policies ever introduced in our country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-01a.375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100100002#W00700"><p>I am sorry to cut across the Minister but I was trying to focus on the other stimulus, not so much the wage subsidies but there was a lot of infrastructure investment in the July stimulus, for example.  Are we now seeing the effect on the labour market and on the economy generally of that kind of spending?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2020-10-01a.376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2020100100002#W00800"><p>I thank the Deputy for the clarification.  We are seeing it in the number of people who have moved from the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  If we look at the number of construction workers who have moved from being on the PUP, which they were in March and April, I am certain that if we had not given clarity regarding what our public capital spending was going to be later on in the year and had not  given an indication we are going to maintain it for next year, the reduction of people on the PUP from the construction sector would not be as big as it has been.</p> <p>  Within that, if I were to pick out two aspects that have been really important, the first would be getting public housing projects under way again.  Having people building them is important for all the reasons the Deputy knows but it is also really important for getting people back to work across the country.  The second aspect is the work that has been under way in cycling and pedestrian infrastructure, where  councils all over Ireland moved really quickly to do it.  Consequently, they were able to employ people who, in the absence of this kind of work, might not have had work to do.  For me those are the two standout examples of what has happened in the past few months.</p></speech>

It has already been indicated by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, that it is not just about how we can increase those levels of capital spending, it is about how we can preserve them.  When I was before this committee several years ago, we had capital spending of between &euro;3 billion and &euro;4 billion per year.  It is now &euro;9 billion annually.  Being able to have the confidence that we can maintain that level of spend in the context of there being uncertainty regarding private sector investment in 2020 and 2021 will have a significant effect on the recovery of the economy.  The Government and I are committed to maintaining that.</p></speech>

I know it is not too far away, but there is a long way to go before any decisions are made from a social support point of view for any part of our country and society.  Like the Deputy, I wish to appreciate the significant contribution carers make to our country and echo the fact that this has been a particularly difficult year for them.  I am sure that when the Minister, Deputy McGrath, is putting together his plans, he will try to ensure that is recognised.  There are currently a significant number of demands on the State.  We need to recognise the very important contributions the Deputy has highlighted, but also the big challenges we face in getting people back to work and the maintenance of so many support schemes.  All of that will come together and be announced in the budget on Tuesday week.</p></speech>

One of the things that is damaging is this notion that 0.0001% in tax is paid by a particular firm, and this is used in justifying the pursuit.  It is bad PR for this country, particularly because it is not correct.  My understanding is that the firms in question pay 12.5% corporation tax in this country, where they are manufacturing, and the rest is drawn from other manufacturing locations throughout Europe, and sometimes outside Europe.  The presentation of the carrot in front of the donkey that was already well burdened leaves people to conclude that we are that particular donkey and we intend to be in that position for a long time.  Will the Minister comment?  It is another whammy that is sitting there waiting.  The pretence is that there is money there for us.  I do not believe there is, but that is neither here nor there. </p> <p>  My second question is in regard to the recovery.  I noticed one day last week about 60 trucks on the motorway heading for the port - huge trucks with six axles and more, heavily laden.  I presume they are serving manufacturing industries which are making frantic efforts to catch up, and which I believe will catch up quickly.  Hence, I do not think we should penalise them in their part of the recovery, which would be a disincentive.  Can we rely on the extent of the recovery in the time ahead, which will be very important? </p></speech>

I am participating in an event with Commissioner Vestager in the morning.  I have a lot of respect and recognition for the work she does.  All of the issues in regard to Apple have been well aired elsewhere for quite a while.  We just have to look at the work that has been published by the Revenue Commissioners, in which they indicate that the effective rate of tax paid here in Ireland for very large employers is very close to the headline rate of corporation rate in Ireland of 12.5%.  There are other publications, for example, those that came out from the OECD earlier in the year, that point to the rate in Ireland being very close to our top-line rate, reflecting the fact we have a broad, simple rate, and then there are a small number of exemptions from that, for example, the research and development tax credit.</p> <p>  In regard to the trucks and our exporting sector, we can depend upon that for now and it has been the bedrock of helping our economy to stabilise during 2020.  However, as the Deputy knows, it is a world that changes very quickly and is a highly competitive world for the companies involved in the export of goods and services.  We have to be ever-vigilant that we are a competitive country and that we are able to ensure those Irish companies, and larger companies that are located in Ireland, continue to be in Ireland and do business from Ireland.  If we ever needed a reminder of how important it is to have a diverse range of exporting companies of all shapes and sizes, it is 2020.</p></speech>

It is a great honour to be appointed as Chairman to this committee.  I look forward to working with all members in a genuine spirit of partnership and co-operation.  I welcome all members of the committee.  The Joint Committee on Health is and always has been one of the busiest committees in terms of its work programme and demands on members' time.  Much of our work will relate to how our health service copes with Covid-19.  The way we work as a committee will also be restricted by the protocols that are in place to protect members, staff and witnesses.  We will go through both the protocols and the development of the autumn programme in private session.  We are limited to a two-hour session and this means many issues will have to be addressed by way of written submissions in the first instance.  All I can do is commit that I will endeavour to be as fair and impartial as I can to all members of the committee.  I believe strongly that a united approach, wherein all members contribute and feel their efforts are worthwhile, will yield the best results.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the election of a Vice Chairman.  I ask that any nominations be sent to the clerk by Monday and a decision will be made by next week.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p> <p>  I propose we now go into private session.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
