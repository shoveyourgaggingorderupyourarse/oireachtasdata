    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1639" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Carrigy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022062800002#A00200"><p>Apologies have been received from Deputy Flaherty and Senators Wall and Garvey.</p> <p>  Before we hear from our witnesses, I would like to read some formal notices.  The Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l, and the Cathaoirleach, Senator Mark Daly, published a Covid-19 code of conduct for the parliamentary community in May.  Members, staff and visitors are requested to continue to be vigilant and follow public health advice on preventing the spread of Covid-19 infection so that we can manage the risk for ourselves and for others who are more vulnerable, including colleagues and their family members who may be elderly and-or have underlying health conditions.  All members of the parliamentary community and visitors are strongly encouraged to wear face masks &ndash; not visors &ndash; in busy or crowded locations in the Leinster House complex.  Medical grade FFP2 masks should be worn whenever recommended by the public health advice and should be worn for ten days after diagnosis of Covid-19.  This will help to reduce the risk of Covid-19 spreading among the parliamentary community.  I ask for everyone's full co-operation in this.</p> <p>  I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House, in order to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the parliamentary precincts will be asked to leave.</p> <p>  For the information of the witnesses, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references they may make to other persons in their evidence.  The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege.  They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  I welcome everyone to the first public meeting of the Joint Committee on Autism.  Before we hear from our witnesses, I wish to make a few introductory remarks.  Following debates in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, this committee was established earlier this year with support from across both Houses to consider matters relating to services and supports provided by the State for autistic people.  As legislators, we must ensure that all Departments and agencies shape their policies and strategies with the aim of creating a more autism-inclusive and neurodiverse-friendly society.  For the past two months, we have been meeting in private session to identify the key policy areas where we can make valuable recommendations in our final report and to prepare our work programme.  Over the next nine months, the committee will sit in public and hear from the key stakeholders as we examine policy, the implementation of policy and the legislation relevant to autistic people.  We look forward to hearing from autistic people, their friends, their families and their representative bodies as well as Ministers, Departments, Government agencies, trade unions and other stakeholders to assess the current state of services for autistic people, the barriers that they can face when dealing with the State and how we can make improvements in those areas.  The committee is also interested in international good practice in national autism strategies.</p> <p>  Our first meeting is with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to discuss autism policy and education.  We look forward to a wide-ranging discussion with Mr. John Kearney, its CEO, and his colleagues.</p> <p>  In the coming weeks, we are planning to hold meetings on autism policy with the Minister of State at the Department of Education with responsibility for special education and inclusion, Deputy Madigan, and the Minister of State at the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Department of Health with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte.  Before the summer recess, we also plan to meet the Teaching Council of Ireland, trade unions like the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, and the Teachers' Union of Ireland, TUI, and Mr. Adam Harris, CEO of the advocacy group, AsIAm.  We will meet many more stakeholders after the summer recess.  Later in the year, we will examine other issues - assessments of need; access to assessments and interventions; education, including the limited effectiveness of special classes in promoting full inclusion; the lack of employment, or the high percentage of underemployment, of people with autism; adults' access to diagnoses and the implications of same; public buildings and the need for autism-friendly buildings; and the relevant legislation.  The committee hopes that Leinster House can be made an autism-friendly building just like the parliamentary buildings at Stormont.  In that context, we have written to the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach to request that this be done.</p> <p>  There is a body of work to do on generating more awareness of hidden disabilities like autism and on fostering a culture of acceptance, understanding and inclusion in society.  The committee plans to report to the Houses by the end of March 2023, in time for World Autism Day on 2 April, with recommendations for policy changes for children and their families.  These recommendations will be fed into the new autism innovation strategy, which is in line with a commitment in the programme for Government and is being developed by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.</p> <p>  As no members wish to comment before we start, we will move on to the first business on our agenda, namely, the minutes of our previous meetings.  Are the minutes of the private meetings held on 7 April, 5 May, 17 May, 19 May and 2 June agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>On behalf of the committee, I extend a warm welcome to representatives from the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, namely, Mr. John Kearney, chief executive officer, Ms Paula</p><p>Prendeville, policy and practice principal officer and Ms Mary McGrath, operations principal officer.</p><p> Before we hear from our witnesses, I propose that we publish their opening statements on the Oireachtas website.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I suggest that Mr. Kearney make his opening statement in the region of ten minutes.  We will then have questions and comments from members.  Each member will have ten minutes and I will be strict on that time to keep the meeting within the specified two hours.  Hopefully, members will get an opportunity to come back in again afterwards.  I invite Mr. Kearney to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022062800002#B00200"><p>I wish the Chairman and all Oireachtas Members a good morning.  On behalf of the NCSE, it is a delight to meet with the committee this morning.  I commend all members on their deliberations, which will make a difference to so many young people's lives.</p> <p>  Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh, as an gcuireadh a thabhairt don NCSE teacht chun labhairt leis an gcomhchoiste inniu.  John Kearney is ainm dom agus t&aacute;im anseo ar son an NCSE.  We warmly welcome the opportunity to assist the committee on matters relating to the services and supports that the National Council for Special Education provides to support autistic students in our schools.  I am here in my role as chief executive officer in the NCSE.  I am also joined today by my colleagues Mary McGrath, head of operations, and Paula Prendeville, head of inclusion, policy and practice.  Ms McGrath has overall responsibility for the delivery of front-line services to children, families, teachers and schools.  Ms Prendeville leads on policy and practice with responsibility for inclusion and special educational needs in the NCSE.</p> <p>  The National Council for Special Education was established in 2004 to improve the delivery of educational services to persons with special educational needs arising from disabilities, with particular emphasis on children.  The NCSE&rsquo;s vision is for an inclusive society in which children and adults with special educational needs are supported to achieve better outcomes in their education.  We provide advice to the Minister for Education in matters of special education, including autism.  We support schools to enable students with additional needs, including autistic students, to develop skills for life so that they can participate meaningfully and to their fullest potential in society.</p> <p>  The focus of our supports for autistic learners is always to enable inclusive practice in schools that centres on a strength-based approach and embeds the autistic voice.  The NCSE provides a range of supports in the area of autism that are focused on building the capacity of schools to meet the holistic needs of neurodiverse students.  Our programme of supports for autism includes teacher professional learning programmes, establishing special classes and special schools and providing assistance to schools that have opened special classes for autistic students.  We regularly engage with stakeholders who support autistic people and work in partnership with other educational providers.</p> <p>   In our role of building capacity in our schools to support autistic students, the NCSE facilitates a range of professional learning opportunities for teachers that include seminars, in-school supports and communities of practice.  Our seminars range from courses that are two hours in duration, facilitated after school by our advisers, to supporting cluster meetings that assist teachers to embed practice-based evidence to support autistic students in schools.  In partnership with St. Angela&rsquo;s College in Sligo as a linked provider of the Atlantic Technological University, our multi-day seminars lead to an accredited course that awards a graduate certificate or diploma in special educational needs.  Some graduates of this course also progress to a master's level degree in autism.</p> <p>  The NCSE has a central role in establishing special classes and special schools to meet the needs of students with very complex learning needs.  For the forthcoming school year, there will be 2,184 autism special classes providing places for more than 13,000 autistic students in our schools.  This is an increase of 561% over the past decade.  Some 306 new autism classes have been established for this coming September.</p> <p>  We have an essential role in supporting schools who open a special class for autistic students.  We provide a range of supports to schools when they open their first class for autistic students.  These supports include a principals&rsquo; seminar that provides practical information on establishing a special class.  This seminar facilitates a learning space for principals to meet each other and learn from other principals who have previous experience of opening classes.  We have designed and developed a four-day introduction to autism seminar which all teachers who are opening their first special class are invited to attend.  Teachers universally comment on the invaluable information they gain by attending these courses.  These schools also receive follow-up support from one of our advisers.  All staff in schools who establish new classes have the opportunity to attend a facilitated exceptional closure day to increase the school&rsquo;s awareness and understanding of autism.  This approach embeds the creation of a whole-school culture to support the inclusion of autistic learners in the school community.</p> <p>  In the past school year, the NCSE has sanctioned and supported the establishment of two new special schools to cater for students with autism and complex needs, located in counties Dublin and Cork.  Both schools have received bespoke training programmes developed in consultation with school principals and their management bodies.</p> <p>  Requested by the Minister for Education, the NCSE facilitated the first national special needs assistants&rsquo;, SNA, training programme, which has been developed in collaboration with the school of education in University College Dublin.  This course will train up to 3,500 SNAs in our schools and, in collaboration with neurodiverse people, this course has a dedicated module designed to support SNAs to have a greater understanding of their autistic students&rsquo; strengths and needs.</p> <p>  We also published a range of resources that assist autistic learners in our schools.  These include supports to assist with the summer provision programme, a publication to develop sensory spaces in schools and a resource that assists teachers to facilitate movement breaks that support the regulation needs of students.  Upcoming publications to assist schools to build their capacity to support autistic students will include Establishing Communication, and Planning for Teaching and Learning in the Special Class.</p> <p>  In its advisory role, the NCSE&rsquo;s published policy advice paper No. 5 provided advice to the Minister for Education on the provision of supports for autistic learners in our schools.  One of its recommendations was to publish good practice guidance to assist schools to meet the diverse needs of autistic students.  We worked in collaboration with educational partners to support the development of this guidance.  In March of this year, we welcomed the Department of Education&rsquo;s publication of this guidance to facilitate an environment where autistic students can participate meaningfully in school life.</p> <p>  The NCSE has a long-established partnership with Middletown Centre for Autism.  Middletown centre is a North-South body that provides excellence in autism education provision.  We work collaboratively with the Middletown centre around the provision of teacher professional learning.  We support teachers of students with autism to access specific courses by providing travel and subsistence costs.  In addition, substitute cover is available for teachers with primary responsibility for autistic students where it is deemed essential by their school principal to attend a specific training course.  We also have representation on the steering committee for the pilot learning support and assessment project that Middletown centre implements and which supports the needs of autistic students, their families and their schools.</p> <p>  D&eacute;anfaidh muid gach iarracht na ceisteanna a fhreagairt inniu agus is f&eacute;idir linn scr&iacute;obh chuig an chomhchoiste tar &eacute;is an chruinnithe le heolas breise m&aacute;s mian le comhalta&iacute;.

I will now turn to the members.  The first member to indicate was Deputy Carroll MacNeill, who has ten minutes for both questions and answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022062800002#B00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for coming in today and beginning our work.  I thank Mr. Kearney for his statement.  It does not reflect the experience I have with parents in my community and, indeed, other communities who have come in here to speak with members.  Parents identify a significant continual uphill struggle as they seek to access early intervention and school places for their children, retain school places, get appropriate education programmes developed in a consistent way across schools and get SNA access consistently as the roles and responsibilities of SNAs change.  The list goes on and on from a parent's perspective.  The services are not being delivered well at present.</p> <p>  I have a number of specific questions for the witnesses with regard to, for example, early intervention in my own community.  There is an early intervention class in Ballyowen Meadows Special School in Loughlinstown.  Representatives from the school told me they were in touch with the NCSE to offer a second early intervention class to the students of my area and beyond and the NCSE has not been back in touch with them.</p><p>This early intervention class is badly needed, according to the parents in my area.  That is a question for the NCSE.</p><p> I note that in his statement, when describing the teacher training programme, Mr. Kearney said, "Teachers universally comment on the invaluable information they gain by attending these courses."  That is too self-congratulatory.  Teachers are telling me is that there is not enough access to picture exchange communication system, PECS, and treatment and education of autistic and related communications handicapped children, TEACCH, courses, and that they have insufficient access to ongoing training.  It is not enough.  I am trying to be brief because I want to give Mr. Kearney an opportunity to respond.</p><p> The response from the special schools is that the equipment needed for occupational therapy, OT, such as compression vests, and furniture grant forms are hard to find and the system is not clear.  The HSE asks them to request it from the NCSE and it is not clear how and where to apply, and whether the HSE or the NCSE is supposed to provide it.  It is unclear to the schools.  If it is unclear to the schools and we have to ask about it here today, it is an important issue that needs to be followed up.</p><p> School places are the subject of much discussion.  I have had two parents contact me in the past couple of days about a sense that they are being managed out of the school place that they currently have and that the school cannot be sure it has the resources for their child next year.  This is the sort of language they are hearing.  At a stage where a child is in fifth class and going into sixth class, they cannot be sure.  Can Mr. Kearney imagine how disruptive that is for that family, and how stressful it is for the parents of that child who has been settled well and who has in many respects been settled better than other children without neurodiverse needs?  It is a concern.  It is all very well having a place for a while, but I refer to this sense of being managed out and not exactly knowing why, perhaps not having had the communication over time.</p><p> There is a range of different issues here.  I suppose I am reflecting the considerable frustration that parents of children with autism have in the service delivery that is being provided to them.  Quite apart from the OT and the speech and language therapy that they are not getting, this is the experience in schools, even at present.  It is about all of these nuanced issues.  It is about being managed out.  It is about the NCSE giving a list of schools to parents and sending them off to call all the full schools and beg them to take their child with autism.  In some cases, I have had parents telling me that they are pretending the child is not as autistic as he or she is or that the child does not have the difficulties that he or she has - I am using their language now, not mine - to try to access and secure a place.  What is the response of the NCSE when a place breaks down and when there is that sense of being managed out?  I will let Mr. Kearney respond to that.  I appreciate I have given him a lot of information there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022062800002#C00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  To recap in terms of where we have come from in the past decade, it has been quite spectacular in terms of the level of investment in the sense that the special classes just over a decade ago numbered slightly over 500.  As we currently speak, over 2,466 special classes have been delivered.  That has been complemented by an ambitious capital investment programme that has seen permanent accommodation in over 292 special classes and additional capacity for 112 classrooms in 22 special schools delivered through the national development programme capital investment period over the past three years.</p> <p>  A further 700 projects are currently progressing under the national development plan.  They will deliver over 1,300 new special education needs classrooms and 200 replacement special education needs classrooms, catering for over 7,800 special education pupils across primary and post-primary.  Almost 100 of these projects are currently on site and will ultimately deliver classroom spaces for over 1,000 additional children.</p></speech>

This is my time and I have asked Mr. Kearney a series of questions.  That information could have been included in Mr. Kearney's opening statement.  I am trying to get to the questions that I asked Mr. Kearney.</p></speech>

I have been appointed chief executive of the NCSE in the past three months.  In regard to many of the fears and reservations the Deputy is expressing on behalf of the parents, I have been out there meeting parents.  I completely empathise with some of the concerns and frustrations that they are voicing in terms of securing placements.  Demand here is challenging supply.  In terms of 315 classes being delivered this year, there has been a very significant range of delivery by the NCSE.  I am not saying it is perfect for one second.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022062800002#C00500"><p>I certainly acknowledge that.  I can see that in my own community.  I can see the additional classes there.  I can see the efforts that schools and parents have gone to in collaboration with the NCSE to be creative.  One school in Booterstown proactively identified a parish hall next to it, and the school, the parents and the Department have worked to secure that and find the additional space.  When I go down the road, however, there is a school of 600 children which needs a lot of work.  That school needs a lot of work anyway but the NCSE did not come to it with the same creativity and ambition to find the extra space, which I can see adjacent to the school.  My point is that Mr. Kearney is correct that the NCSE is to be congratulated on that additional work, particularly over the past two years.  I can see a pipeline over the next two years but more needs to be done to try to be creative and secure those premises.  So many parents, and also schools, are trying to drive this.</p></speech>

I completely acknowledge the collaborative challenge that is ahead of us all, both at parental level and school staff level, and working in collaboration with the Department and the NCSE, in terms of delivering the comprehensive range of supports that are required for special education provision.  I completely agree with the Deputy's comments and observations in relation to that.</p></speech>

I do not have that information with me today.</p> <p>  In relation to the OT equipment that the Deputy mentioned, the NCSE does not have a role in providing that type of equipment to schools.  It is through the HSE services that schools should apply.  It is unfortunate that there continues to be that confusion.  Certainly, it is something that we can take away.  We can reflect on how we can support schools in clarifying what our role is.  That is something we have been doing with various partners over the past while but we can take that away.</p></speech>

If Ms McGrath is saying the school should apply to the HSE, there needs to be a resolution between the NCSE and the HSE.  It is not a question of taking it away.  It is a question of when my special school applies for OT equipment for the students there.  They actually have a room.  The committee visited it.  They have a room there and they cannot use the equipment because they do not have the therapist to support it.  I appreciate that is not directly for the NCSE.  This is equipment that is in part there - they need more of it - but the students cannot use it because they do not have support.  Even when they are applying, if the HSE is telling them that they are to apply to the NCSE, this is a real problem.  This is something that needs to get resolved this week.  There needs to be a resolution between the NCSE and the HSE this week so that those schools, when they apply on the next occasion, have total clarity.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy.  There has been no change to the role of SNAs.  I am unclear what communication the Deputy is referring to.  There have been some changes over the past couple of years in how SNAs are allocated to mainstream settings.  Since 2020, SNAs have rolled over each year in a mainstream setting and schools can apply to the NCSE for additional mainstream SNAs if they are required to support the needs of the children within that school.  Schools can do that through an exceptional review process which opened earlier this month for the forthcoming academic year.  NCSE has made a clear statement and, in collaboration with education partners, is prioritising developing schools that may not currently have an SNA resource within them to ensure there are no children within the school environment who may be prevented from attending school in September due to a lack of access to SNAs.</p></speech>

I have met them all previously: Ms McGrath, Ms Prendeville, and particularly the CEO, Mr. Kearney.  Mr. Kearney and I worked together a long time ago.  We know each other going back to when we held different roles in life and neither of us dreamed that we would meet here.</p> <p>  The first question I have to ask is a fairly obvious one.  Much of the talk in the past few weeks has been about the lack of school places coming this September for children with additional needs, in particular children with autism.</p><p>I wonder what kind of data the NCSE holds on exactly what school places are needed.  Does it have a mapping system to identify where school places are needed, particularly as pupils go from primary to secondary school?  Many people do not understand why if a child is already in a special class, an autism class or a special school, it is not recognised that the child may need the same service at second level but it is not provided.  There is a major deficit in particular areas in the country, including Dublin, Cork and other areas.</p><p> What kind of data does the NCSE possess and how far in advance does it plan?  How far in advance would it advise of the Minister of exactly what is needed?  It was mentioned that there are 106 children without school places for September and it is now almost too late to be dealing with such matters.  It is almost a rush job when the process should be planned perhaps two years in advance.  What sort of data and planning go into ensuring children have places because this comes up every year at this time?</p></speech>

I commend her on the various inputs she made to teaching and learning in schools in County Cavan.</p> <p>  I assure the Deputy and other committee members that the NCSE has quite a comprehensive database.  It is a five-year forecasting model, as such, which projects ahead in terms of placements required.  At any given time we have a county-by-county analysis of placements required built on weekly meetings with the Department to project future placement requirements.  Enrolment is an ongoing process, particularly in and out of special class placements, and those six students in a class could keep changing.</p> <p>  Based on our weekly meetings with the Department and the geographic information system that it shares with us, we have managed the demand on a county-by-county basis and we are confident we have the capacity to address emerging needs arising between now and September.  We have narrowed this to the Dublin region with respect to 50 special school placements and 56 special class placements.  We are quite confident in the data we manage, notwithstanding the fluidity of the enrolment processes.  That enables us to accommodate and deliver on the projected need.</p> <p>  It is not perfect for a minute in that there are anomalies.  Our first focus is very much on delivering against need so each and every student with special educational needs is provided with a special class placement in this country.  We achieve this, by and large, and we have identified hotspots in Dublin that were well publicised recently.  We are also focusing on moving in time so students would travel to local schools in local catchment areas.  At this time, we are confident in the data and the management of that around places.</p></speech>

We can see how people, especially parents of these children, can be frustrated.  Most of us enrol our children in secondary schools in November for the following September but we are now at the end of June and coming to July and these children still do not have a place.  We can see how worrying it is for such parents.</p></speech>

I have walked these byways and was a principal dealing with parents.  In my role I can completely empathise with parents.  In the past three months I have met many such parents.  Unfortunately, it is in another context and having another conversation that I would like to have with those parents.  I would prefer to be speaking about the teaching and learning experience in schools but, unfortunately, it is a more depressing conversation about trying to secure special class placements.  Not only am I meeting them but I am fortunate to be joined by the committed staff within the NCSE, and our special education needs organisers, SENOs, are out and about.</p> <p>  To correct an implication that was made, our SENOs cannot engage with the enrolment process, which is the individual preserve of schools.  We can only advise on placements and support parents in trying to progress an enrolment request with an individual school.  We get the confusion and upset, however, and we know the hurt and trauma inflicted by on parents by each letter of rejection to families.</p></speech>

Action should have been taken before this.  Mr. Kearney has said the NCSE has regular meetings with the Department.  Really, it should never come to a position where we seek the passing of emergency legislation.</p></speech>

There is an urgent crisis and the vast majority of schools are proactive in engaging with the NCSE.  Sometimes, some schools are less forthright in doing so.  There is a need for emergency legislation to address the crisis we are currently facing.  There is also a very significant pathway to be followed over the next couple of years in terms of getting uniform special class placements right across the country.  Processes need to be streamlined, quickened and sharpened with a view to approaching that work.  The legislation is the avenue to provide the degree of sharpness that is required.</p></speech>

The post stated that in 2003 there were 72 SENOs and 15 other staff employed by the NCSE and in 2019 there were 65.6 SENOs and 150 other staff.  That indicates there are fewer SENOs now than there were almost 20 years ago, although we know the number of children diagnosed as having additional needs has increased.  Are those figures correct?</p></speech>

That was the first thing I looked at when I was appointed chief executive in the context of an expectation for service delivery.  I ruthlessly followed up complaints and issues around service delivery.  I was confident that by and large, we were delivering, but our services were stretched in terms of what we were expected to deliver.  I have earmarked this for the Department, which is very much working with me to identify funding arrangements for additional staff with a view to providing that degree of service.  What the Deputy is saying is quite correct in that staffing levels are more or less exactly the same as they were 20 years ago and the degree of service has changed.</p></speech>

Many parents would make the point that accommodation is not the only issue and it is about the resourcing of that accommodation.  I know a school but I will not mention its name or location.  If a school or class opens but there is not properly trained staff or proper resources, the process will not work.  We have ended up seeing many children in special classes or schools being suspended, expelled or withdrawn by parents because it was not an appropriate placement.  Does Mr. Kearney have any figures on the number of students in inappropriate placements or being homeschooled because there is no appropriate placement for them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.41" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022062800002#D01200"><p>I do not have the exact figures sought by the Deputy and further work is required.  The chief inspector's report on the placement of students in classes gives an indication that we need closer observation of special class placements, and that is further work for the NCSE to develop and take on board.  What is very much required is an annual review of each and every special class placement in a school.  That is required for any assessment of a student in a school and how the placement is working.  That consultation must take place between a variety of stakeholders, including teachers, school management, parents and, in many cases, the student.</p> <p>  There is a collective responsibility in taking on special classes in a school.  It is a formidable challenge for any school to take that on.  It is a change in culture and leadership, with a dynamic approach required by all sections of staff to fully embrace each and every learner coming into a school community.  They should be given the same sense of opportunity and progression as any other learner coming in.  It is a journey that must be travelled by a school and it takes a significant effort to do that.  The NCSE is eager and enthusiastic to assist schools on that significant journey they must travel.  It is ultimately a journey that the vast majority of schools will have to travel in time.  A number of schools are making that journey but more will have to do so in order to make a cultural change and provide strong leadership, openness and engagement with parents so as to deliver the quality of education that students with special educational needs deserve.</p></speech>

Last week, I tabled a Commencement matter on special schools that was answered by the Minster of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Josepha Madigan.  Today, I have heard Mr. Kearney speak about special schools in the cities of Cork and Dublin.  What does he mean by the term "special school"?  I will ask him what I asked the Minister of State last week.  Is the proposal to open five special schools in Dublin still being considered?  I ask because students, parents and organisations need to hear the answer.</p> <p>  Personally, I believe it should be against the law to provide special schools for children with disabilities or additional needs because that puts them into boxes, which is what was done to Travellers years ago.  As I said last Wednesday, there used to be special schools for Travellers.  That was why many members of the Traveller community could not read or write.  Instead of being educated, they were being washed and cleaned in school settings.  This is not the conversation for it, but I probably know more than anybody else around this table what special schools can do to communities.  I know from my work with some of the disability organisations that they do not want special schools.  People with disabilities also do not want special schools.  I am interested to know who the NCSE is working with to create special schools and who has requested them?</p> <p>  The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission does not agree with special schools because they form a breach of human rights and equality legislation.  There has been talk about the provision of special classes and supports in the cities of Cork and Dublin.  There are children with special educational needs in rural Ireland and they also need services.</p> <p>  The SNAs are looking to be valued by the education system and that is nowhere in sight.  A few weeks ago SNAs attended a committee here to explain why their work should be valued and why they should be recognised as a profession.</p> <p>  AsIAm published a snap survey, and according to that, 267 children do not have a school place for September and 112 children can be between one to six years on a waiting list.</p> <p>  I welcome the establishment of this committee and look forward to working with my colleagues to bring about equality for people with autism.</p></speech>

To clarify, there are a range of special educational needs, SEN, supports that we support the State in providing through our network of education facilities.  First, there is the mainstream school, and the vast majority of students with special educational needs are accommodated within the context of a whole school.  Then there is the special class, on which some of this discussion would have centred, and 315 of those will be opened this year.  There is another degree of provision then called special schools, and there are in excess of 122 of them in the country, providing the much-needed targeted support to students and their families who avail of those schooling services.</p> <p>  I think what the Senator was referring to was the proposal that was mooted about four or five weeks to have special education centres.</p></speech>

I have gone out there and I know the SENOs and the staff have spoken to and listened to the parents.  We were looking at a number of avenues in trying to bridge that gap and ensure as many students as possible were offered special class placements come September.  That looked at a number of measures.  We invoked section 37A, which was an operational process that would eventually lead to schools being compelled to provide placements.  We also worked in close collaboration with two education and training boards - the City of Dublin ETB, and the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire ETB.  Very much embedded within that was an integration model, particularly from having listened to parents who had experienced extreme frustration when it came to their children and the supports that were required for them.  We were looking at that as a transition pathway to ultimate integration into special classes, whether they in primary or post-primary schools, within the city of Dublin.</p> <p>  Senator Flynn's points about integration are very well made.  Our vision within the NCSE is that of an inclusive education where all students are completely cherished, respected and admired within their whole school community setting.  Ultimately, we are working towards where each and every child can attend, as close as possible, the school that is nearest to him or her.</p> <p>  On the AsIAm survey, it mentions 267 students awaiting a placement.  That does not quite tally with our figures for what is required.  Notwithstanding that, we have interrogated the survey and know there is more work to be done in enabling students to travel closer to their local school in their local community, and that is the determinant of appropriateness.  We are doing this in stages.  Our first stage is to deliver those special class placements.  The next is to get them closer to the individual parent's household.</p></speech>

It is very refreshing, especially when he discusses local schools and says it is very important for children to attend their local school.  I counted and believe he said it three or four times.  It is new language the NCSE is using, and it is noted, so I thank Mr. Kearney for that.</p> <p>  SEN education has come in leaps and bounds.  In Dublin 12, a huge number of classes have opened.  Not every school has a class and I believe there may be six without a SEN class.  It would be great to see every school in Dublin South-Central having a SEN class.  It would be great to show the rest of the schools in the country that this can be done, that this is one constituency that managed to do it.</p> <p>  As Mr. Kearney rightly said, schools need the support to open classes.  They need to ensure they have enough teachers, SNAs and the additional supports my colleague mentioned, such as occupational therapy equipment, speech and language therapy equipment and sensory rooms.  Mr. Kearney has clarified that the HSE is involved in providing the equipment for sensory rooms.  That is a discussion that might need to go back into the remit of the NCSE because they very much go hand in hand.  It is not possible to open a SEN class without providing a really good sensory room with sensory facilities.  It just will not work correctly in terms of getting a child regulated properly because a child will not learn unless he or she is regulated properly.  I say well done but we still have a lot to do.  There are complete blackspots in Dublin 4, 6 and 6W and children are still travelling from these areas to Dublin 12.  We are delighted to have them in Dublin 12, but children should be able to go to the same school their siblings are attending.  It puts extra pressure on schools in Dublin 12, which want to do the best for local children.  A body of work needs to be done there.</p> <p>  It is very difficult to get a child into an early intervention class.  First, there are very few of them available.  Second, an autism diagnosis is needed to get into an early intervention class.</p><p>We know that children are not being diagnosed because of the huge waiting lists.  The only way a child can get into an early intervention class is by way of a private diagnosis.  That is unfair on the child that only if his or her parents can afford it he or she might get into an early intervention class.  There are none in Dublin 6W, there is one in Dublin 12 and one in Dublin 8.  It is scandalous because we preach about early intervention but there are no early intervention classes.  I have raised it previously but I would like to see the National Council for Special Education taking this on board and in particular, taking on board how to make them available and then how to get over the fact that children are not being diagnosed with autism because of another Department's shortcomings.  That is a big stumbling block.</p><p> At what stage does a special educational needs organiser, SENO, get allocated to a child?  Is it just at early intervention or when he or she starts primary school?  Many parents will know their child has autism when the child is about two and a half years old.  They may not have a diagnosis yet but are working with therapists.  It is likely they have a diagnosis of autism but not a formal one because the HSE has not been able to given them space for a diagnosis or they cannot afford a private diagnosis.  Even the waiting lists for private diagnosis are crazy.  When does the SENO get involved?  How do parents get their child in front of a SENO to map out the child's educational needs?  Many parents approach us and tell us their child may or may not have autism but they really do not know where they are going, whether they can go to an early intervention class, opt for mainstream with an SNA or to an autism class.  Parents need a good deal of guidance.  </p><p> My specific questions are, when does the SENO get involved?  What is the ambition in regard to early intervention classes?</p></speech>

As mentioned earlier there are 73 SENO posts and 67 are currently filled throughout the country.  Each SENO has a caseload of schools and engages with parents who live in the locality around that caseload of schools.  The caseloads are geographical.  Quite often the first time a parent engages with a SENO is when their child is at that pre-diagnosis stage where they contact the local SENO.  They may become aware of the SENO through one of our parental engagement sessions.  We work with HSE teams to reach out to families on waiting lists in order that we can set out what that education journey will look like, the different options and the different services and how to access those services within that education system from preschool, be that the early intervention classes or the access and inclusion model, AIMS, in the ECCE scheme to which no doubt Ms Prendeville will refer.</p></speech>

It is really the early intervention classes I am trying to figure out because you need a formal diagnosis.  Without that, you cannot get into an early intervention class.  Your cr&egrave;che can get AIMS support.  It is important to highlight that AIMS support does not attach to an individual person.  It attaches to a class so it is not a case that your child is getting a special need.  It is rather that the class is getting a little more support.  I am not a massive supporter of the AIMS programme but I want to know how do you capture children into early intervention if the HSE has not been able to give them diagnoses?</p></speech>

That is the current pathway into one of those classes.  When parents contact our local SENO looking for that support and guidance as to where their child will go in the education system, that is something we will track.  We track that engagement from the family, where that child is going, whether he or she gets a diagnosis and track what that report suggests in terms of forward planning for additional special classes in the area.  In answering the question on how a child gets attached to a SENO, it is through that geographical caseload of schools that each SENO manages.</p></speech>

It was quite scathing of the Department.  We should not take the negative from it.  It should not be an attack.  Dr. Niall Muldoon is an unbelievable man.  Some of the words he used were quite positive, such as "reconfiguration", "being reimaginative".  There is no point in being negative.  We must be positive in terms of what we can do in the future.  The council needs to reimagine and reconfigure how to work, maybe rip up everything it has done so far and start again.  We know it is not really working but as we have a new team, a new leader, it should really try to figure out a new plan, a new way of working, and put parents' needs at the forefront.  I say "parents' needs" because parents have their children as their number one  priority so when looking after parents you are really looking after the children.  The council needs to figure out providing more early intervention classes in the city because it is really upsetting for parents not to be able to put their children in a proper placement.  Moreover, AIMS is letting parents down and by that, letting children down.</p></speech>

We certainly welcome that from a number of perspectives.  In synchronising with the Senator's observations in terms of positivity we did glean and extract the positivity of it as well.  We certainly welcome the insight from the ombudsman in terms of reviewing various aspects of the legislation and the impetus for the entire system to build local capacity and to build greater collaboration with individual schools, the education partners in building that capacity and professional development, to assist schools to change that individual school culture.  We were particularly interested in the ombudsman's report in respect of proactively engaging with schools, parents and students on the development and pathway of special education delivery in this country.  In many ways, the first hurdle, namely, the creation of the special classes, is the first journey to be encountered in terms of delivery of special education.  Far more enriching conversations on that will be happening in due course both with individual schools and parents in terms of the quality of the learning experience and then we need to look at progression pathways for children with special education needs in terms of progression from schools and the enhancement of quality of life and community engagement for students with special education needs.</p></speech>

I have met some of them over the past number of years and I welcome the interactions I have had.  In the past couple of days, a number of colleagues touched on this earlier, this proposed emergency legislation has emerged.  I know that nobody in this room has had sight of it but my question is, does Mr. Kearney welcome it?  Albeit we are in the dark, the timelines being spoken of in the media seem to centre around six to eight weeks, or eight to ten weeks, to prepare for those classes.  Does he think, if true, that timeline is sufficient?</p></speech>

His practitioner experience as a teacher is certainly telling in terms of development of special education in this country.  The legislation obviously centres on the section 37A process.  It is a process that none of us would like to invoke with a view to delivering special education places for children.  However when weighing up the needs of parents and the requirement of special class places, ultimately if the legislation has to be invoked, it is invoked.  It has been invoked three times.  This is our third time actually to invoke it.  On one occasion it was four months in terms of delivery.</p><p>On another occasion, it was much longer than that.  It has to be streamlined.  Sharp, decisive action is required on occasion.  None of us is party to the exact detail of the special education legislation being considered this morning, but sharp, decisive action is required in terms of giving assurances to the parents.  Many members have articulated well the fears, anxieties and apprehensions of the parents in terms of lack of clarity and special class placements.  If it takes legislation to progress that with individual schools and to provide that degree of certainty to parents, then so be it.</p></speech>

As was said, that is in theory or ideally how you would like to approach these things.  Obviously, we are where we are and the fact the Ministers have signalled their intention to bring forward emergency legislation is in itself an acknowledgement of the situation we are in.  Based on that, would it yield what Ministers are aiming to set out?  Earlier somebody asked Mr. Kearney how many children were getting a diagnoses every year.  He said there is a model, a five year forecast, but at the rate we were going with the collaborative approach, how long would we have been waiting to catch up given the shortage of places with that forecasting model before this emergency legislation was mooted?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, there were scenarios where a poll was done with staff on whether they should embrace and take on special class delivery as such.  We have travelled a transformative journey since then and it is reflected in terms of that 500% increase in special classes delivery in that decade.  We have much further to travel as a society.  I certainly welcome the educational partners.  We would have engaged with them through the section 37A consultative process.  There was a very strong indication of how working collaboratively and progressively with a view to delivering it.  It has delivered so much but there is so much more to deliver and quicker.  </p> <p>  I believe the legislation will provide a sharper delivery but there are going to be twists and turns in terms of effective delivery as well-----</p></speech>

Senator Flynn asked a question, which I would like to follow up on.  I refer to special schools and their place in the overall education sector.  We have spoken about the New Brunswick model in the past and obviously we are operating an inclusion model here.  I am coming from a perspective where I believe there is a role for special schools and I put that on the table because there are people with profound intellectual and physical needs that need a space.  In terms of the disparity between the provision of ASD classes at primary level and second level - I think it is a ratio of approximately 3:1 in primary, or it is definitely 2.5:1 - is it a case that in the future we are going to see further mainstreaming of children with ASD provision who heretofore might have had a space in an ASD class?  Is that ultimately the model the NCSE envisages where we will be shifting to a model where students might rotate or do a set amount of time per week or per month in an ASD class and then transition back to mainstream and keep it on that kind of a loop?  Ultimately the question is around how many buildings we can build.  Is there going to be a critical point where it becomes the norm that kids are in and out of an ASD class?</p></speech>

I have been out and about to schools and have been managing and leading schools for the vast majority of my professional career.  I already know there is a lot of quality engagement and enhancement in terms of integration between the special class and mainstream schooling and more of that needs to be enhanced and developed going forward.  The international perspective, and as a nation we have subscribed to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, will put tremendous obligations on us in time but we have a very significant journey to travel in terms of resource development and cultural development of schools and specific supports being provided.  It is well down the road in terms of delivering on that requirement and vision.  For now, in regard to the special schools that have been developed and created, there is a very specific target need for those schools in terms of offering support.  A progressive pathway needs to be developed towards inclusive education but we are talking about decades rather than years with a view to achieving and delivering on that.</p></speech>

We have 11 or 12 special schools in Cork and I would often talk to management in those schools.  Many of them say they prefer dealing with the Department of Education, for example, than with the Department of Health.  There are significant blockages when it comes to dealing with that Department.  In regard to the therapies about which Deputy MacNeill spoke and which people are crying out for at this stage, could they be placed under the remit of the Department of Education rather than the Department of Health because it is clear the current process is not working?  Is that something the NCSE would welcome?</p></speech>

We are developing expertise in terms of the benefits that speech and language therapy can bring to a whole school as well as supports like occupational therapy.  It works best when it is with a view to building teacher capacity.  A whole string of our policy advice is very much indicated in terms of therapeutic supports and empowerments that are required for schools.  We will certainly be supportive of whatever pathway that can be developed in time with a view to enabling those contributions.</p> <p>  Does Ms McGrath want to come in on therapeutic supports?</p></speech>

NCSE has a number of occupational therapists and speech and language therapists who are working on the ground with 75 schools, including, I believe, four special schools, although I might have that number slightly wrong.  The early results we are seeing from that project are really quite transformative.  The focus of the work of the speech and language therapists and the occupational therapists is building teacher capacity to have the right supports for the children in the school as and when they need them.  Early evaluation, which was done by a team in University College Cork, has been very positive in terms of the outcomes.</p></speech>

Many people are very interested in this subject and we have a huge responsibility on our shoulders.  I look forward to working with everybody so that we can produce a comprehensive and, hopefully, action-oriented report.  I welcome our colleagues from the NCSE.  Mr. Kearney said he was fairly new to this job, so I wish him well.</p> <p>  My first question refers to the emergency legislation to be debated on Friday.  A number of people have referred to it and Deputy O'Sullivan's intervention has changed my question a little bit.  I was going to ask why we needed emergency legislation because it was said that the Minister had been advised and that there is a database and five year projections, etc.  If all of that is in place, then in theory at least, we should not need emergency legislation.  In that context, I have two questions.  First of all, does Mr. Kearney feel there might be a need to update the database and the information he has?</p><p> The collaborative model was mentioned.  I am not here to apportion blame, but if it is not working in some way, or if it is not working well, what changes need to be made?  It is absolutely crucial that it works.  There is no point in complaining that it does not work.  These children need our support.</p></speech>

This could only have been achieved with the engagement and collaboration we have had with so many schools.  As I mentioned to Deputy Tully earlier, to open a school community to developing and supporting students with special educational needs is a very transformative journey for schools.  The NCSE is greatly appreciative of the collaborative efforts of so many schooling communities in subscribing to it.</p></speech>

More and more supports are required.  The NCSE has developed various policy advice over the years.  Education partners continually make submissions seeking further support.

In ongoing engagement, particularly that in the past week, the education partners are continually seeking more support and encouragement in terms of what they are endeavouring to do and rightly so.</p> <p>  To get back to the Deputy's specific query on the legislation, by and large the collaborative approach has worked.  Some hotspots arise in terms of special classes being opened as quickly as we would like.  We are always weighing it up in terms of the pace and the capacity of an individual school allied to the need for special class placement.  When I speak to parents, I see the hurt and frustration in their eyes.  I know what has to be done and whatever action is taken it is done with a view to delivering on the placement.  Whether from the perspective of the NCSE or that of the Department or the Minister, it is a step we would rather avoid but if it is a step that has to be taken with a view to securing places-----</p></speech>

I hear what he has said about certain hotspots.  Change is always difficult.  It is difficult in any institution and educational institutions are the same as all others.  For change to happen significant supports are needed.  The carrot is much more important than the stick.  I am not saying the legislation is a stick but it is to some extent.</p> <p>  I want to follow on with another question that relates to this.  Courses for teachers, St. Angela's in Sligo and courses for special needs assistants have been mentioned.  Does the NCSE feel that sufficient courses, seminars and educational opportunities are in place for teachers so that we have sufficient numbers?  Is there a timeframe for the 3,500 special needs assistants?  How many will be there this year, next year and the year after?</p> <p>  Last week I spoke to some childcare providers.  Many childcare providers have level 6 or 7 qualifications.  Their services close during the summer.  They made the point that perhaps there is a real opportunity, with a little bit of further education, for them to help with July provision and summer provision.  I know this is not directly the responsibility of the NCSE but do the witnesses think it would be worth their while considering liaising with childcare providers or schools on extra places for July provision?  I do not need to tell the witnesses it is very important.</p></speech>

I will begin on some of the queries on the professional development of teaching staff.  It is the starting point to bringing in the necessary change, the development of leadership and the teaching and learning development capacity in a school.  For many years, it is decades at this stage, the Department has been supporting staff in participating in up-to-date professional development courses at graduate level, particularly at St. Angela's College in Sligo.  There is also the progression to the masters programme that is envisaged.  We have been reflecting and developing our own portfolio in a range of programmes on sensory, communication, interaction, assessment planning and curriculum access aspects of autistic programme development.  An area we have particularly targeted is supporting the continuing professional development of special needs assistants.  I will invite my colleague, Ms Prendeville, to elaborate more on this.  Before that, I want to tell the Deputy I concur with her on the importance of the summer programme.  The Department has very much been leading to it, with regard to its development, enhancement and roll-out.</p></speech>

We provide a lot of training for teachers to support students with autism.

This is an important and time-bound committee that has quite a lot of work to do within a nine-month timeframe.  Even thought we must take a much wider view of autism than just education, it would be widely acknowledged that children's access to appropriate education is a significant part of how they experience the world.  It is not children with autism but all children.</p> <p>  I will be a bit all over the map on this.  I have quite a number of questions to put to the witnesses.  I looked fairly closely at the policy advice paper No. 5, which dates from 2014 and which is a bit outdated.  My questions concern timelines around the provision of special education supports to children.  Working off these 2014 figures, it was estimated that about 63% of children with autism were in a mainstream classroom whether that be supported or unsupported.  Would that proportion broadly be the same or has it changed greatly?</p></speech>

An average is very crude but at what age are children being diagnosed with autism because that affects access to services?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.108" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022062800002#J00400"><p>Ms Prendeville will take that question.</p></speech>

We tend to see later diagnosis in young females whereas in the male population, they tend to be quite young when they are diagnosed.  I am a trained psychologist and have worked as a teacher in early intervention and mainstream classes with children with autism.  I have also worked in children's disability network teams so I have a really good sense of the issues of the ground and the holistic issues that crop up.  Risk factors emerge early on but they tend to start flagging around eight or nine years of age depending on the developmental trajectories of the young person.  You get to a certain stage where they are meeting their developmental goals and the developmental goals start to widen as social communications become more nuanced.  Because autism is social communication difficulty, the gaps really start to widen at that stage whereas you tend to see that at a very young age in some young people born with developmental delays who present with autism and other co-occurring complex needs conditions so it really depends on the developmental trajectories of the children.</p></speech>

A secondary question - I wonder if it is a question at all - involves the complicating factor of disadvantage.  I assume that wealthier parents have access to assessments more quickly because they can go private, which means that we have a complicating factor of disadvantage.  Particularly in an early years setting, we know all of the benefits that are there in terms of language deficits and access to language within an early years setting.  I will leave it at that because it is not quite a question.  What are the average waiting times for a diagnosis?  How long are our waiting lists from the time a parent seeks a diagnosis and a principal takes one of those precious NEPS slots?</p></speech>

NEPS does not assess children with autism.  It occurs in a multidisciplinary team, which is the remit of the Department of Health children's disability network teams.  Even if a child is flagged as having a developmental difficulty with his or her NEPS psychologist within a school, the role of the NEPS psychologist is to sign post the parents in the direction of how to apply for an assessment.  Waiting lists really depend on where students live, but that is a matter for the Department of Health regarding the waiting lists for children's disability network teams.  We would not be privy to that information.</p></speech>

These are all going towards that idea of first presentation to when appropriate supports are put in place.  Ms Prendeville said that possibly in or around 63% of children are still within mainstream classrooms.  For the benefit of the committee, could she talk me through the continuing support process that will happen within schools?  Again, there is a timeline issue.  We should be talking about classroom support and move on to school support and school support plus.  However, there is quite an amount of paperwork involved in getting from one end of that continuum to the other.  Ms Prendeville might talk the committee through that process from the point of view of a principal, a classroom teacher or an SEN teacher, and how long it takes for a child to move through that process to get to the appropriate level of support.</p></speech>

The NCSE uses that model and a multi-tiered system-of-support model.  Regarding the response to intervention model, the Deputy is correct in saying that schools track how the child responds to intervention across those tiers.  We have the universal tier where we have the expectation that the school environment would be adapted and supported to meet the needs of the young children and then over time, the school in collaboration with leadership - the set teacher and the SNA supporting the child - look to see how the child responds to that intervention over time.  That is tracked over time.  It is the business of schools to track that.  I know the Deputy said there is work involved in it but a significant amount of supports have gone into schools to enable them to track that support to build capacity in schools.  The NCSE has developed a lot of resources to help schools around that universal piece.  We have the sensory document we produced, which really supports schools to understand the regulation needs of students.  Our therapy colleagues within the NCSE have also developed communication supports around adapting the environment to meet those holistic communication needs.  Any of us from teaching backgrounds who have taught children with autism know that really good interventions for students with autism are really good interventions for all children regardless of what their need is.  There are a lot of universal supports.  We can embed a universal design for learning approach, which meets the needs of all students.</p> <p>  Over time, some students will not respond to all those supports.  They then move to the school support plus, which means there will be more intense supports for those students.  The NCSE has many advisers who will go into schools and request additional supports.  We have advisers in inclusion and behaviour who will help in respect of those needs.  For the very intense supports, students can access behavioural therapists because I know behaviour is a major issue in many schools, particularly in special schools.</p></speech>

The universal design for learning piece needs digging into but we cannot do it in the one minute and 47 seconds available to me so I might pivot slightly.</p> <p>  The assessment of the July provision is less than sanguine in policy advice paper No. 5.  Mr. Kearney emphasised how important the July provision is to him.  I know he is new in the job, and perhaps a new brush sweeps clean.  What has brought about the change in mindset towards the July provision?  Have there been changes in the model of provision?</p></speech>

In the Department's close consultation with parents in particular regarding the necessity and importance of the July provision, especially for parents of children in special schools, Covid heightened the awareness of all stakeholders regarding this.  The July provision is also important for Ukrainian students and other students with emerging needs.  The importance of the stability and continuity of a regulated and consistent provision has highlighted it.  Sometimes when you look at policy perspectives, they can look jaded or nuanced in retrospect.  Many of those policy advices have stood the test of time in terms of 2015 when this document would have been issued and developed by the NCSE.  Many of them have been implemented and progressed.  Further enhancements can certainly be taken on board.</p><p>The Deputy has astutely picked up on matters relating to the July summer provision programme.

Is deas bualadh agus caint le John Kearney ar&iacute;s mar gur chas m&eacute; air c&uacute;pla bliain &oacute; shin i gCabh&aacute;n.  T&aacute; taith&iacute; mh&oacute;r aige agus gu&iacute;m gach rath air ina phost &uacute;r.  Gu&iacute;m f&aacute;ilte roimh Mary McGrath fosta, is deas casadh l&eacute;i ar&iacute;s fosta, agus roimh Paula Prendeville fosta, m'iarchomharsa i dT&iacute;r Chonaill, go dt&iacute; an coiste.  The Chair is strict on time so I will delve straight into this.  Mr. Kearney's practical experience will be instrumental and pivotal in his new role.  I wish him well.  His knowledge of school settings and his relationship with principals and former staff will be critical, because he will know where the pressure points are.  That is already evidenced in his contribution about the principals' seminar.  Principals who do not have special classes need to hear from the principals who have special classes.  It adds value to the school and changes its culture.  Mr. Kearney knows all this.  In Brownknowe National School in Donegal, one student became the new heartbeat of that school and it changed everything.  That experience is important.</p> <p>  I was going to ask about St. Angela's College and the progression from a graduate certificate or diploma.  Mr. Kearney answered it in his contribution.  There is now a path to a masters degree.  I was going to raise this in the context of a discussion I had with John Gorman, principal of Rosses Community School.  He was talking about the value of that continuous professional development for teachers.  St. Angela's College plays a significant role.  It will be part of the Atlantic Technological University.  The access officer in Letterkenny, Brian McGonagle, plays a key role too.  Since that question has already been answered, I have an additional one.  Are we mapping the progression of a student from secondary school into third level or the world of work?  There is a history and tradition of moving from primary special classes to secondary classes.  These students are now entering the world of work.  These are our new scientists and new leaders in the world of work or education.  Are we mapping that progression as a way to inform other principals who do not necessarily understand the complete benefits of being part of this model?  A good story might help.</p> <p>  My other question relates to special schools.  I passed Little Angels Special School this morning.  It was great to see the crane over the building site for the new school.  I assume we have moved on from the New Brunswick idea of a few years ago.  I want the NCSE to state its policy on special schools.  In the last year, it announced the opening of two new special schools.  During my time as Minister, we opened a new special school in Dublin.  It is important that we have mainstream integration but there is still a need for special schools.</p> <p>  We have a positive story to tell in Donegal with regard to primary and secondary level interventions.  We have been fortunate because, in the early days, some schools led from the front and created a new culture of inclusive education.  A politician can get into bother by mentioning schools, but I will mention Scoil &Iacute;osag&aacute;in, Buncrana, Niall M&oacute;r National School, Killybegs and Woodland National School in Letterkenny.  I have left others out but I just do not have time, so I apologise for that.  Raphoe is not a big town or city, but Raphoe Royal and Prior Comprehensive School and Deele College are both striving to provide this inclusive model.  That is having a positive knock-on effect, so St. Eunan's National School, Raphoe, now wants to be part of that model.  It is important to acknowledge the leadership of some schools, but then one becomes a victim of one's own success.  We have great SENOs in Donegal.  They mix with the schools and communities.  They talk and listen to the parents.  They do a great job and I publicly acknowledge the role they play.  There is pressure on the system.</p> <p>  It is a demand-led system at one end but it can be a supply-led system when it comes to building.  The building unit deals with new builds and extensions with special classes at the heart of their design.  That is mandatory for new schools.  In fairness, the building unit tries to reach out to provide as much as investment as possible to meet the demand.  Not all schools want a prefab and a segregated setting for the special class.  The real leaders that I have come across put a mainstream class into the new prefab and brought the special class into the heart of the school.</p> <p>  I may have to give a practical example of geography, because we learn by getting into the details of geography.  Parents want their children to stay in their communities.  There is no question of that.  It has been reflected through the public domain in the last days.  Not only are children not able to stay in their own communities, they are not able to get a class at all.  That is a constraint of the system.  I understand that frustration and we have to look at ways to try to facilitate that.  Consider Dungloe and Loughanure.  A principal in a primary school in Loughanure wants to open a special class.  A parent has a child in that school.  There is a class in Dungloe, but Dungloe is not in the Loughanure community as far as the parents are concerned.  It is not local and brothers and sisters are involved.  Should we not reward a school principal who steps up to the plate?  It is the same in Milford National School.  The principal and parents want a class in that area but they are not being accepted on the basis that classes are available in my alma mater, Scoil Eoin Baiste, Carrickart, and Kilmacrennan National School.  They are quite close but they are completely different communities.  If it did not matter what community children were in, parents would be sending their children to all sorts of different schools.  In the main, that does not happen.  Parents want their children to come to these new schools.</p> <p>  Will there be a review of that demand-led policy?  If there are vacant classes in a school or special class 20 miles away, does that prohibit a principal in a local school from opening a class if the demand exists?  I have a fair idea of what the answer will be.  It will be that there are constraints on the system and that special classes are being provided.  I would like to emphasise that parents like to keep their children in their own communities if at all possible.</p> <p>  This may be a question for Ms McGrath.  There is a pilot for 75 schools.  She talked about benefits.  Where are we with trying to make that model mainstream?  It is an excellent model that works well.  It will have occupational therapists, potentially physiotherapists, and speech and language therapists in one setting to work in a joined-up way.  That has to be the way to go.  Are we still banging the HSE's door down?  I do not want to get into a turf war between the HSE and the Department of Education when addressing the NCSE's role, but we need leadership from the HSE on this matter, because the feedback on educational matters are positive.  I thank the witnesses.  They have a short time.  If there are issues they cannot get across today, Mr. Kearney might correspond.</p></speech>

I thank him for the contribution he made during my previous role in Cavan-Monaghan, the insights he gave, and the difference he made to the lives of many parents and young people in that region.  He set the scope for future-proofing at post-primary level and the incorporation of special classes in all new builds.  He started that off and, as we know, it has been extended and embellished by the Department in the delivery of the national development programme.</p> <p>  When making his point, the Deputy mentioned good examples of strong school leadership and putting inclusive agenda at the top of the agenda to progress it.</p><p>As we know from parents and the political system, the NCSE's ambition is that children would attend their local school in their local community.  Different needs dictate that at different times.  At the moment our emphasis is on finding that special class placement.  We may very well have to look at reconsidering our policy in terms of demand and need, how best to actually deliver that inclusive education, and what it means when we are dealing with the smaller primary schools in particular and the demands around them not necessarily getting the 6:1 student ratio.  We will certainly be looking at that resource portfolio in time.  I will ask my colleague Ms Prendeville to discuss the progression pathways that were mentioned.  It is certainly an area of future development and evaluation.  I will now invite Ms Prendeville to look at the continuing professional development, CPD, element of that.  Ms McGrath may then take the Deputy's query about expansion.</p></speech>

I will respond quickly to question on the trajectories beyond post-primary school for students who are completing their time in special schools.  We are currently working very closely with the comprehensive employment strategy in the cross-departmental committee to really look at how we can do that joined-up thinking and provide wraparound support to meet the trajectories of young people who are transitioning from post-primary special schools into the world of work or into any apprenticeship.  We welcome the announcement this morning on the increase in that.  I will send the committee more details about that.  It is probably the best way to progress it if I submit it to the committee at a later time, if that is okay.  I will hand over to Ms McGrath now.</p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, we have experienced challenges in recruiting the 31 therapists that have been sanctioned in the pilot area.  I understand it is still a commitment of the Department to work to further expand that project.  There have been fantastic results.  It is something that we in the NCSE see as being transformative.  We hope that this does proceed.  There is a lot of work to do around workforce planning and there are challenges recruiting therapists.  There is a lot of work going on in the background to drive that forward.</p></speech>

The main objective of us all is that at the end of this process parents and children would be clear in the role they can play and the role the NCSE plays around the issue we must overcome.</p> <p>  Many of the questions have already been asked and answered but I would like to get a bit more detail from Mr. Kearney about the database and the five-year forecasting.  We are aware from the NCSE's information that 14,000 students have been diagnosed with autism.  The majority of that cohort is, I presume, in primary school currently and will be moving to secondary school in the future.  Has the NCSE got this mapped out for the next five years?  I would have thought that once a child enrols in a primary school, the NCSE would know about it immediately and would be conscious of the progression of that child.  The NCSE would know that if a four-year-old starts school next September, he or she will need a secondary school placement in nine years' time.  Has its forecasting gone into that detail?  For example, are there enough secondary school places for those children coming out of primary schools at the end of the coming school year, 2022-23?  I presume the changes to section 37A are being brought into place because there would not be enough primary schools with autism classes or the means to bring a child into the school.</p> <p>  On the issue of having to get another assessment of need when going into secondary school, parents have said to me that they have had to get this assessment done privately.  Obviously, it is needed for the child to progress into secondary school to assess what his or her needs are.  Perhaps we could get some clarification around that.</p> <p>  I also want to ask about July provision.  I welcome Mr. Kearney's comment earlier about the role July provision can play.  How many children have not have access to July provision this summer?  I am aware that there are different reasons for some children not being able to get it.  Some committee members, including the Chairman, were at a meeting last week where we discussed the small cr&egrave;ches whose staff are unemployed for the summer.  They are let go when the school term ends and then brought back in September.  They were saying that this cohort of workers could possibly be open to providing July provision.  Has the NCSE looked at this area?  I will leave it at that and if I need to come back in later I will ask another question then.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.130" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Kearney" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022062800002#L00800"><p>I thank Deputy Collins.  I will take some of the queries the Deputy has raised, starting with the July provision programme.  Our role within the NCSE is to support that programme rather than oversee the administration of it.  As I shared with some of the Deputy's committee colleagues earlier, the programme is one we very much endorse.  We see the value of it for parents and we see it from our engagement with parents and, especially, the SENOs' engagement with parents.  The value and merit of that particular programme is well endorsed.  We support every possible way in which we can support that programme, for example with resource materials.  The Deputy is seeking the numbers participating in the programme.  We can source those figures from the Department and revert to the committee afterwards.</p> <p>  On the requirement for assessment, it is entailed within the individual enrolment policies of schools.  An assessment report of less than two years is required with regard to the assessment criteria for the progression of students to post-primary level.</p> <p>  I will recap on the issue of our database.  We have a forecasting model that looks ahead for five years.  We very much take account on an ongoing basis.  It is a five-year forecasting model but it is developing in consultation with the Department from the geographic information system that is provided to us and weekly engagements.  The success of it has really been seen with the delivery of so many special class placements this year, notwithstanding the black spots we have alluded to.</p> <p>  There will be other challenges ahead.  We have seen extraordinary growth at post-primary level which is beginning to peter out now.  This will lead to spare capacity in primary schools.  When one considers where the peak is now heading for provision, up to about 2026 the peak will be very strong at post-primary level.  Unfortunately, there will be pinch points that we will have to navigate with all partners in delivering the degree and sufficiency of special class placements that are required.  I am glad to say, however, that there is a bit of reprieve at primary level making the delivery of special class requirements that little bit easier.  Notwithstanding this, there will be fundamental challenges at post-primary level.  Obviously, the ongoing challenges will also continue with regard to Dublin.  I am very confident that our five-year forecasting model is providing us with the necessary information and data that we will require in scoping out the future need and delivery requirements.</p></speech>

I have found that some schools had been looking for the service, and to get a special education adviser into the schools, but they have been put on a waiting list.  This negates the role of the service if there is a service but the school cannot access it.  A child can be affected by being put on a shorter school day or sent home.  This can have a big impact on the child.  Will Mr. Kearney give us the breakdown of the vacancies in that area?  Perhaps Mr. Kearney will also send over the programme for the five-year forecasting.  It would be very interesting to have a look at that.</p><p>I have covered the area in Dublin 12.  We have four secondary schools that have no autism classes and four primary schools.  It would be good to see them moving over the next two months.</p></speech>

I just have a couple of quick questions on practical matters.  How does the NCSE support dual enrolments between say, a national school and a special school and how does it track and monitor the effectiveness of that or is that something the NCSE does?  How does it track the breakdown of placements or what I described earlier about this perceived managing-out of a student?  What is the council's role in that and what communication does it have, say, in the example I gave earlier where the school is saying to the parent it does not think it has the resources or capacity to support their child next year?  What is the council's role and when does it get notified?  I ask the officials to describe that to me.</p> <p>  We have touched on the SNA and teacher training and what has been especially highlighted is psychological training and presence of psychologists to be able to support different behaviours so children have the opportunity to learn in a better way.  Those three aspects are really important to me.</p></speech>

That is the point that has been raised again and again to me.  There is another issue that is also being raised with the special schools and the teacher training more generally, though I appreciate the latter is not the NCSE's direct remit.  Teachers when they are being trained get a two-week placement in a special school but they do not prepare a lesson plan or do any of the things they might do in an equivalent way for any other school.  Therefore, you have teachers being produced every year by the colleges of education who are not necessarily equipped to take over special classes within the schools.  You do not see a career progression for teachers within mainstream schools to take over special classes and it is being left, one has a sense, to the designs of the individual principal about finding somebody who has either the experience or the desire to do that.  However, if we do not have teachers coming out who are equipped to deal with children with additional needs in all forms then that is going to be much more difficult.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.140" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Paula Prendeville" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022062800002#M00900"><p>I can answer this really quickly if that is okay.  I am getting a look from the Chairman.  First, on behaviour, there has been a lot of work on behaviour for the training of teachers and SNAs.  A lot of work has been done in the background with regard to those specific behaviours of concern that are in schools.  There were plans to publish that prior to the Covid pandemic and that work is at a very advanced stage at the moment.  Alongside the work the Department has done on that, the NCSE has developed a behaviour framework and we are really hoping both of those will support schools in the next academic year to meet that very intense need of building the capacity at universal level, the target level and the very specific level to build the whole capacity of the school system.</p> <p>  Specific to teachers and teacher training, the c&eacute;im recommendations around the requirements that young trainee teachers coming out into the system have an understanding of the needs students with disabilities and inclusion are mandatory from January of next year with the Teaching Council.  That means every initial teacher training course in the country has to have embedded those practices within its training programme.  There are provisions there for supporting those teacher trainers who are out on their professional training placement, so that will progress in that space.</p> <p>  On the SNAs, as the Deputy knows, we have the course that has been running in UCD.  An internal review was done on that and as the Deputy rightly said, there is that need for the SNAs to have greater understanding of the behaviours to address and meet the behaviours of concern for students - all student with needs.  It has been looked at and, in response to that, to support it there is an extra module being developed currently that will be available to the SNAs who are attending that course.  This extra module is specific to addressing behaviours of concern to build the capacity within SNAs to meet that need.  There are three positive moves in that space I hope will make an impact in the next school year.</p></speech>

The Deputy's question is really probing.  There are a number of facets to that, in terms of the NCSE supporting transitions where you leave one schooling environment and go into another educational facility and track that along.  Unfortunately-----</p></speech>

Unfortunately from our perspective, there are capacity issues in delivering on that.</p> <p>  The breakdown in placements is a very astute observation as well because it is our thinking each individual placement would have to be reviewed on an annual basis because that alludes back to the chief inspector's report as well, so there is significant work and progression.  We would very much like to have a role in that but unfortunately as we currently stand there are capacity issues with that.  I have worked with the Deputy's colleague at ministerial level.  Both Ministers are aware of it in terms of additional support and resources for the NCSE and likewise with the Department.  We are progressing that with a view to delivering on those very incisive observations the Deputy has made there on supporting-----</p></speech>

It is great to be here.  This is my first time at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Autism and it is wonderful to have it, thanks to the Cathaoirleach.</p> <p>  I have just gone through Mr. Kearney's opening statement and I thank him for the detail given there.  It is very important.  As he has mentioned, we have 13,000 school students with autism.  That is a lot of families and households who are dealing with this.  It is good to have this important focus.  I am curious about some of what is in the opening statement, which references 3,500 SNAs.  We had a group in with the education committee last week and I understood it was 1,000 at the moment and 500 that have previously been trained.  Is that 3,500 over a number of years?  That is the first question.</p> <p>  The census has just been done and the population is 5.1 million, which is excellent.  Lots of people are wanting to come and live in Ireland.  Of course, I want them all to come and live in the west and take the pressure off Dublin.  However, we have challenges with capacity in areas like Ballinasloe where I am based.  We have St. Teresa's as the special needs school there dealing with moderate to severe complex needs as well, which is so important.  That graduation from primary to post-primary is going to be crucial.  Then there is the role of the SNAs.  To understand this a little better, if SNAs are a primary school-level support, what happens when you move into secondary school?  The SNAs, from what I understand, are not going to be providing care in each subject when their students are at secondary school level.  I apologise if the officials have commented on this before but will they highlight how that could be managed, especially with that increase we see coming down the tracks?  It is something that is going to be very important, especially where we already have issues with capacity?  In another few years it is going to be an even bigger pressure.</p></speech>

In the results of internal evaluations done so far, SNAs have welcomed this course.  They said it has empowered them a great deal in respect of the work they do.  The programme is being evaluated by the NCSE.  Once that evaluation is available, it will be possible to get a good sense of the positive outcomes.

It is a great course and I know many people who wish to do it.  Another issue in this context is that many people are subbing in SNA roles.  From what I understand, though, this programme is currently only available to those who are full-time SNAs, but many people are working in these roles part-time.  We wish to get more people to come in to do this type of work.  How do we support people who are subbing and doing this type of work to allow them to get access to some type of training?  Regarding the 19,000 SNA full-time positions, do all those people have roles within schools or are these positions in which people can come in, sub in one school and then move to another school and sub there for another few days?  Do the witnesses understand what I mean?</p></speech>

I would like some clarification in this regard.  A record budget of &euro;40 million has been allocated again this year.  In all likelihood, and hand on heart, we know we will be lucky if half this amount is drawn down.  Let us be straight about this point.  What is the role of the NCSE in this regard?  Have policy documents been drawn up on this issue?  I read the NCSE&rsquo;s corporate governance guide last night.  Under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004, the organisation has the ability "to advise the Minister on any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities".  That is quite a broad set of criteria.</p> <p>  On that basis, and concerning summer provision, we all want to see it being a success.  Many people on this committee and on the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science come from educational backgrounds.  Unfortunately, there are many different reasons this July provision scheme is probably not as successful as it could be.  Even now, many parents tell me that because it has become so broad, the people it was designed for originally are not benefiting half as much as perhaps they should be.  What is the NCSE&rsquo;s role in this regard?  If the organisation does not have a specific policy in this regard, is that something it could explore?</p></speech>

We do, however, completely see the merits of the programme, including in the context of our continuous engagement with parents.  I met with a group of parents yesterday and they highlighted the benefits of the programme in addressing their requirements in the next eight to ten weeks.  We embrace and support the requirements of the programme itself.  We support it in respect of the development of materials on which we can assist in the context of the delivery of the programme.</p> <p>  We certainly will take on board the policy comments made by Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan in respect of future contributions to the programme.  We are also very much aware that the inspectorate recently commissioned a report on this scheme.  Strong feedback was received on its merits and benefits.  Therefore, regarding the continuation of the programme and its enhancement and improvement, that is well merited this year and in the years to come in respect of the benefits it brings to so many.</p></speech>

From the NCSE&rsquo;s point of view, however, I think we could get far more from this programme.  In many respects, it is too late for this year, but for next year it would be worth looking at providing advice to the Minister concerning how we can improve this initiative.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.191" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1639" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Carrigy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AUS2022062800002#N03100"><p>I am the last speaker.  We have gone slightly over time.  We have tried to keep this meeting inside the two hours.  I will make a few points.  I speak as a parent with personal knowledge.  I have also served on the board of management of Ardscoil Ph&aacute;draig in Granard in north Longford, which has three special classes.  Mr. Kearney will know it.  It was one of the first schools in the midlands to have a special class.  As Deputy McHugh said, these classes are at the heart of the school and that is where they need to be.  They must be in the school and not, by any means, in an outside setting.  Other students in schools derive great benefits from working with the students in the special classes.</p> <p>  Section 37 was mentioned.  I am fully in favour of what has happened in recent days concerning the naming of the schools in the context of this section.  We cannot have a situation where schools are not in favour of having special classes on their grounds.  We cannot have a situation where children must leave their local communities and travel to special classes.  I discussed this issue with parents in Athlone this morning, an area local to my own.  Parents have had to book a place for their children in a school that is 55 km away.  It means a round trip of 110 km daily, five days a week.  We have a school system where it is necessary to go to the nearest school to avail of school transport.  Yet children with special needs must instead go to the nearest school that is actually available to them.  I fully support section 37 and its use and the Minister of State with special responsibility in this area, Deputy Madigan, mentioning section 67 of the Education Act 1998, as amended.</p> <p>  We must have a situation where children are educated with their siblings in their local communities.  This means I am fully in favour of, and this is something I will be proposing to the NCSE and to the Department, doing an audit of every school at primary and post-primary levels to ask them if they are willing to have special classes.  Those results need to be put up on the Department&rsquo;s website.  We need there to be a special class in every school in the country, if there is a need in local areas.  We should not have to invoke legislation or be discussing bringing in emergency legislation.  It is a disgrace that we must do this.  We must do it, though, because some schools are not willing to have special classes.  It is totally wrong.  We need an inclusive education system so that all children, as I said before, can be educated with their siblings in their local community.  We should ensure we do not again have a situation like the one we have today, where parents do not know what schools their children will be in next September.  This situation is prevalent in numerous areas we have mentioned, including Dublin and Cork.  As I said, in my local area, in Athlone, eight children must travel up to 55 km return daily.  This is happening in 2022 and it is unacceptable.</p> <p>  I fully support the school inclusion model mentioned in the context of the CHO 7 area.  This is the way forward.  Speech and language therapy and occupational therapy must be available in the school setting, rather than children having to go out to clinical settings for these appointments.  This is the way forward.  The ability of SNAs to change courses daily must also be implemented.  This move can only benefit kids.  I have seen the benefits of early intervention for children.  This is the stage at which it needs to be done, at that younger age.  I have also seen the benefits of using music therapy.</p><p>Music therapy should be rolled out more.  I have seen the benefit it has for children's speech.  It is amazing the difference it can make.  We referenced the July provision and the summer provision a number of times.  As Deputy O'Sullivan just mentioned, the reality is that the children it was set up for are not benefiting from it at all currently because a significant number of schools, including special schools, are not making the summer provision available.  This year, we had to give financial incentives to schools to provide summer provision for children that are entitled to get it.  Children will regress over the summer if they do not get support, but we are struggling to get staff and schools to come on board.  Summer provision must be mandatory throughout the summer term.</p><p> We have it in our work programme that we will have discussions with other countries.  Malta is a small island in the middle of the Mediterranean and it is miles ahead of us with regard to the provision for children with special needs throughout the summer.  We must look to expand the summer provision.  We met ECCE programme workers.  We have a situation where people are qualified up to levels 6, 7 and 8, with master's in education degrees, who work in the ECCE system and they have to sign on for unemployment benefit during the summer months, yet we are struggling to get staff to work in the July provision.  We hope to have the Teaching Council before the committee in the coming weeks.  The fact that a person needs to have a Teaching Council number to work on the July provision scheme is an issue.  That must be changed.  We have qualified people working in the ECCE system going on unemployment benefit when they could work with and help children with special needs.</p><p> We also have third level students in the areas of speech and language and occupational therapy at a time when there is a shortage of qualified staff.  We must look at where is the best place for them to do their work experience.  They could do it as part of the July provision and give children speech and language and occupational therapy during the summer months.  They are simple proposals and simple asks.  I know it does not come not under the remit of the witnesses, but I ask them to highlight that it is something that can be done.  When we review the summer provision this year, that is something that needs to be put in place for next year.</p><p> I ask the witnesses to continue their work.  They have taken the right decision in the past 24 to 48 hours.  There has been some criticism from certain organisations, but this is the right road to go.  Children need to be educated in their own local school.  We do not need a situation where people are travelling a return journey of 110 km five days a week for their children to get an education.  It is 106 years since the 1916 Rising, when we talked about cherishing all the children of the country equally.  The reality is that we are not doing it when we have a situation like that happening.</p><p> I support the work the witnesses are doing.  We know that massive improvements need to be made within the system, but this is a very positive start.  I ask the witnesses to look at the situation in Athlone.  It is close to my home, and I work with parents in an advocacy group.  It is 28 June and they do not know if they have a place for their children in September 2022.  That is something that must be addressed immediately.</p></speech>

In particular, I acknowledge the role he played in Granard, which is close to home for me.  I remember the proactive leadership provided by the school.  That was at whole-school level.  I also acknowledge the Chairman's role at the board-of-management level.  It is a whole-school approach, with the board of management taking stock and providing school leadership and ultimately the entire extended teaching staff of the school itself becoming involved.</p> <p>  We will certainly progress matters in Athlone.  We are progressing a number of opportunities there in terms of addressing the issues to which you alluded.  We very much concur with the expansion and roll-out of the summer programme.  We have taken on board the contributions of various members on the summer programme in terms of further contributions to it.</p> <p>  There has been significant delivery of special class placements, this year and in previous years, in consultation and collaboration with many schools.  As part of our deliberations last week, we met and consulted with all school management bodies.  They very much want to deliver the same thing.  They have logistical concerns in terms of adequate planning and resources being put in place to address the challenges they are taking on.  Unfortunately, at times there will be situations where the degree of collaboration will not be at the level we would all like.  In those situations, a sharp rebuttal process is needed.  I hope we will be looking at that today in considerations in other channels, and the truncating of the section 37A process in terms of the enhancement of the section 67 avenue as well, with a view to delivering sharper inputs in terms of special class delivery.</p> <p>  On behalf of the NCSE, I thank all the Oireachtas Members present.  It has been a very engaging conversation.  Those involved in special education are passionate and enthusiastic.  Special education brings out the best in us in terms of what we ultimately want to deliver for this country.  We have made great strides in recent decades and years.  We have much more to do, as has been highlighted and earmarked today.  I wish the committee the very best of luck in its deliberations.  This is a very active and vibrant committee, and it is timely in terms of the future development and delivery of special education in this country.  I commend the committee on its work and how proceedings were conducted this morning.</p></speech>

Just before we finish, I ask him to comment on an issue that has been in the media in the past 48 hours.  It was requested that section 37A would not be invoked until September.  There were comments from the INTO in that regard.  Could Mr. Kearney comment on the matter?  Letters were sent to schools, in particular to the 14 schools in Dublin.  Ten schools engaged and four did not.  Part of the section 37A process is that the schools are then listed on the Department's website.</p></speech>

We are balancing two needs at all stages.  Schools the length and breadth of this country have worked to respond to Covid.  As we all know, they were at the centre of communities in terms of offering support to them and reaching out in response to the Ukrainian challenge that presented.  We are now going again with another ask in terms of the delivery of special class placements.  We are always conscious of the situation regarding section 37A.  I have met many parents whose special class placements were not delivered.  I am an educationalist at heart.  I know the frustration, anxiety, hurt and uncertainty in the voices of parents, and that is who I will be responding to in terms of issuing the necessary correspondence that has to be issued.  There is a collective responsibility, and that was echoed in the Ombudsman's report last week.  Ultimately, that is what we have to respond to at a systemic level throughout the country to ensure that parents get due regard in terms of special class placements.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss sectoral emissions ceilings, which are due to be announced in the coming weeks by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the departmental officials from several Departments to the meeting.  From the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, we are joined by Mr. Frank Maughan, principal officer; Ms Karen Egan, principal officer; Mr. Marc Kierans, assistant principal; and Mr. Neil Gannon, assistant principal.  Mr. Kierans is joining us in person and Mr. Maughan, Ms Egan and Mr. Gannon are joining us online.  They are very welcome.  From the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we are joined by Mr. Bill Callanan, chief inspector; and Ms Edwina Love, principal officer, climate and biodiversity.  We are also joined online by Mr. John Redmond and Mr. Fergus Moore.  They are welcome.  From the Department of Transport, we are joined by three officials, namely, Ms Andrea Lennon, principal officer; Dr. Aoife O&rsquo;Grady, principal officer; and Mr. John Martin, principal officer.</p> <p>  As usual, before we begin I will read a note on privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative they comply with any such direction.  For the witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as does a witness who is physically present in the campus.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I remind members they may participate in this meeting only if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex.  In this regard, I ask members joining us online to confirm, prior to making their contribution, that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Egan to make her opening remarks.  </p></speech>

I am part of the team responsible for the preparation of the sectoral emissions ceilings.  I am accompanied by two of my colleagues from the climate division, Mr. Frank Maughan, who works in just transition and sectoral policy; and Mr. Marc Kierans, who works in the land use and sectoral policy division.  I will use my opening remarks to outline the process that the Department has undertaken for the preparation of sectoral emissions ceilings in accordance with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021.</p><p>The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 commits Ireland to a legally binding target of a climate neutral economy not later than 2050 and a reduction in emissions of 51% by 2030 compared with 2018 levels.</p><p> Following the process set out in the Act, the carbon budget programme proposed by the Climate Change Advisory Council was approved by Government on 21 February 2022 and subsequently adopted by the Oireachtas on 6 April 2022.  This carbon budget programme comprises three successive five-year carbon budgets as follows: for the period 2021 to 2025, 295 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent, which equates to an average reduction of 4.8% per annum for the first budgetary period; for the period 2026 to 2030, 200 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent, an average reduction of 8.3% per annum for the second budgetary period; and for the period 2031 to 2035, 151 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent, an average reduction of 3.5% per annum for the third provisional budgetary period.</p><p> Under the Act, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications must prepare, within the limits of the agreed carbon budget programme, the maximum amount of greenhouse gas emissions that are permitted in different sectors of the economy during a budget period, and different ceilings may apply to different sectors.  These sectoral emissions ceilings shall be determined by the Government and are not subject to an Oireachtas process.  The Act requires the Minister to submit sectoral emissions ceilings to Government for approval as soon as may be after a carbon budget takes effect.  The Minister intends to take a proposal to Government on sectoral emissions ceilings shortly.</p><p> The Department has considered a number of scenarios to support the preparation of the sectoral emissions ceilings.  It is being supported in this work principally by McKinsey and Company and MaREI at University College Cork.  Key inputs have also been received from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, Teagasc, EirGrid, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, University College Dublin and other contracted support.  The Act provides that the Minister shall, when preparing a sectoral emissions ceiling, consult such Ministers of the Government as he or she considers appropriate.  Over the past two months, extensive consultation with relevant stakeholders has taken place.  In terms of the engagement to date, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has been sharing analysis, including through bilateral meetings and workshops with key Departments.  There has also been a series of meetings at Secretary General and ministerial level.</p><p> I thank the committee for inviting me and my colleagues to come before it and I am happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

I am principal officer over a new climate engagement and governance division established recently in the Department.  I am joined by my colleagues Ms Aoife O&rsquo;Grady and Ms Andrea Lennon.  Ms Lennon heads up our energy, air and adaptation division, which includes policy on renewable fuels and biofuels for transport, while Ms O'Grady leads our climate delivery team, which focuses on facilitating the transition to electric vehicles, our EV charging infrastructure strategy, and the establishment of the zero emissions vehicles Ireland office.  I am responsible for co-ordination and reporting on our obligations under the climate Act and Climate Action Plan, supporting the implementation of our recently published sustainable mobility policy through the SMP leadership group, and improving our engagement on climate action with the public and our partners in the transport sector.</p> <p>  Members of the committee will be well aware that transport accounts for about 18% of our national greenhouse gas emissions.  Our initial baseline emissions abatement target going into the sectoral emissions ceilings process was to deliver a 51% emissions reduction from a baseline of 12.2 million tonnes per year in 2018 to approximately 6 million tonnes per year by 2030.  The indicative levels of abatement expected for each sector of the economy in CAP21 set a range of 42% to 50% to be delivered in the transport sector, and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and the Department are committed to delivering to the upper end of this range, while acknowledging the scale of the challenge involved for the sector and society, but also the huge benefits to be derived in terms of quality of life as well as carbon abatement.  There has been significant expansion recently in the Department's climate teams to ensure we have adequate resourcing and capacity in place to help us to achieve this ambition.</p> <p>  The Minister has commented repeatedly that transport, as a sector, faces an extraordinary challenge in terms of achieving the required emissions reductions in the timeframe envisaged. This difficulty arises from the scale and level of the personal and systems transformations required to shift from settlement patterns and travel behaviour that have been embedded over decades and are dominated by car use.  Moreover, as highlighted by the recent EPA report on our greenhouse gas emissions projections, the current suite of CAP21 measures for transport are projected to deliver a 39.3% reduction in emissions, falling short of our 51% abatement ambition.  To quote the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report, further immediate and deep action is required.  We acknowledge and accept this shortfall, which we have termed our "gap to target" and which was also noted in the modelling undertaken for the development of CAP21 as a 0.9 million tonne per year shortfall to be identified through additional measures.</p> <p>  In recent months, we have undertaken significant work with our National Transport Authority, NTA, modelling teams, other agencies, academia and transport stakeholders to calibrate our modelling and identify additional measures that could be implemented, recognising the need to ensure fairness and equity in the impacts of such measures.  A few areas were selected for particular attention, including identifying measures to reduce the volume of fossil fuel vehicle kilometres travelled, a focus on rural transport and just transition, supporting the decarbonisation of the freight sector, and possible regulatory and financial or taxation measures that could support transport decarbonisation.  A report on this engagement and updated modelling results are expected to be delivered this summer, in advance of the annual update of the climate action plan 2023.</p> <p>  While negotiations on the sectoral emissions ceilings are ongoing, our engagement with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has been constructive, with a clear focus on agreeing ceilings that recognise the delivery challenges and timing impacts of the measures involved while also aligning the base assumptions underpinning the analysis involved.  In particular, the carbon budgets proposed recognise that a greater level of emissions abatement in the transport sector will be achieved in the second carbon budget period.  This trajectory needs to align with the likely uptake of electric and other alternative technologies, the ramping up of transitionary biofuels and renewable fuels, and the longer lead-in times for the roll-out of additional infrastructure and services.  Critically, it needs to recognise the level of behavioural and systems change that will be required.</p> <p>  The ongoing war in Ukraine, the spike in energy costs tied to the increased cost of living and supply chain shocks that are particularly affecting the supply of electric vehicles have added to the level of challenge involved.  Therefore, the introduction of sectoral ceilings and the level of transformation needed will require strong buy-in at political and citizen levels as we seek to accelerate delivery.  It is our view that beyond the existing measures in CAP21, the best means of achieving our goals will be through enacting further policy measures that directly reduce transport demand and which prioritise, facilitate and support behavioural shift to more sustainable modes.  Our role over the coming period will need to include presenting and communicating policy measures that will lead us to the sustainable future transport system we are trying to achieve to bring the public with us, a future system that is less congested and which prioritises well-being.</p><p>We look forward to continuing our engagement with our colleagues in other Departments to support us in this vision.  My transport colleagues and I are happy to take any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

I want to ask the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications about the recent EPA report, which stated our emissions rose by 6%.  In that context, we know each sector must reach the upper range to be compatible with the overall 51% reduction.  Every shortfall in the first five-year budget makes the second one practically insurmountable.  Will the witnesses comment on what chance there is of every sector hitting that target range on the current projections?</p> <p>  I have a question for the Department of Transport.  It is clear from the witnesses' statement that the only real game on town, and from the pushing, so to speak, we have had from the Bill, is the electrification of the private car fleet.  It seems to me that all the work and emphasis in the scale of our ambitions should be on public transport, on increasing railway and trams etc., and on focusing on rural Ireland.  Certainly, the plans by the NTA for the bus fleet are not at the races.  It is really all down to electric vehicles.  I would like to draw a link between the solutions in both agriculture and transport that seem to be hooked onto new technology as a solution.  With EV cars there is a problem.  If we plan to hinge our targets on a million EV cars, we are depending on mass manufacturing and distribution of these fleets, something in itself, regardless of them being electric, would have a massive cost to the carbon emissions to build and to manufacture them.  The purpose of this technology is to keep things as they are and to keep the reliance on the private car in transport.  Will the witnesses comment on the ambition for public transport in the areas of rail, bus and rural transport we need to achieve?</p></speech>

The EPA reports definitely highlighted the challenges Ireland faces as we seek to meet our ambitious targets.  To reverse the current trajectory of emissions and meet our 2030 and 2050 targets, a significant shift would be required in the speed at which all sectors roll out and ramp up the measures and actions that will decarbonise our economy.  Following the sectoral ceilings in the carbon budgets being legally adopted, the design and the structure of the next climate action plan will be implementing the sectoral ceilings.  In the process of our negotiations with the other Departments in fleshing out the next climate action plan, we will be doing a lot of analysis on the actions and measures to achieve the targets.  It is to that process that we will be working out the pathways to hit the target ranges.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.216" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022062800002#C01100"><p>I will take that question initially.  I thank Deputy Smith for the question.  I would not necessarily agree we are saying EVs are the only game in town.  Of course, they have a strong role to play here, both in the context of private electric vehicles but also in terms of the electrification of the public transport fleet.  Having said that, our statements and our commitments in CAP21 look across a whole range of other areas as well.  While EVs have a role to play, this is definitely a multifaceted approach.</p> <p>  One of the key areas we are looking at is increasing the number of sustainable transport journeys taken daily, up to half a million per day.  That would include public transport and active travel.  There is substantial ongoing investment, as the Deputy is aware, at the moment in public transport.  Some of it will take longer than others.  We have projects such as DART+, BusConnects, Connecting Ireland and MetroLink all planned, and some of these will be online within the timeframes we are talking about - not all of them, obviously.  We are also looking at fairly significant investment in improving the existing services and improving the reliability and attractiveness of the existing services to increase the use and modal shift from private cars to public transport.</p> <p>  We are also looking significantly in the area of active travel.  Almost 60% of journeys less than 2 km are by car.  We have a strong role to play as a Department.  Our agencies also have a strong role to play to communicate to people the importance of modal shift away from the private car, be it a fossil fuel car or an EV, and moving into other, more sustainable forms of transport, such as public transport and active travel.  In the context of rural Ireland, that is a very important point, that we need to enhance the services offered in rural Ireland.  That is what is Connecting Ireland is all about.  That will take a while to roll out, but there are improvements being made on an ongoing basis.  The NTA annually reviews its services and the delivery of its rural services and looks to identify improvements that can be made not just to the routes and frequency but also to the attractiveness, such as in improved bus shelters, real-time travel timetables etc.  This is very much a multifaceted approach and is not focused just on EVs.</p> <p>  In terms of EVs themselves, I might ask my colleague, Dr. Aoife O'Grady, to make some comments.  Ms Andrea Lennon may also wish to comment in the context of biofuels, which also have a very important role to play in the eight years between now and 2030.</p></speech>

To reiterate the comments my colleague Mr. Martin has just made, that while EVs are a significant part of the Department of Transport's action to reduce carbon emissions and they are probably the single biggest element of our carbon reduction plan, they still would equate to only 40% of our total emissions reduction.  Therefore, the majority of emissions reduction will actually come not from the electrification of the fleet but from active travel, sustainable travel, demand management and the increase in the use of renewable and sustainable biofuels in our petrol and diesel mix.  To reiterate again, part of the plan for electrification is not just the electrification of the private passenger car but of the taxi fleet, freight and the public transport fleet.  All of those will not just bring carbon emissions benefits but also significant air quality benefits in urban areas.</p> <p>  In terms of rural areas, alongside the increased sustainable mobility, we know short journeys in rural areas can transition to active and more sustainable travel modes, but we also know many citizens in rural Ireland rely on the private car for use.  Where it is not possible for them, we would look to avoid-shift-improve system.  Where it is not possible for citizens who rely on the private car either not to make the journey or to shift to a sustainable form of transport, the next stage is to improve the technology.  We would hope the electrification of the fleet in rural Ireland by the end of the decade would support decarbonisation of those trips.</p></speech>

They are the biggest individual share.  The other three elements of sustainable renewable biofuels, sustainable transport and demand management equate the majority but EVs are the single biggest share.  Mr. Martin will talk about the sustainable transport side because that is more his brief than mine.</p></speech>

We will do that by steps every year of about 3% or 4% in the biofuel blending rate so that we will hit that target in 2030.</p> <p>  On alternative fuels, there is CNG biomethane, hydrogen fuel cells and electrification.  We are looking at refuelling infrastructure.  Under EU Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulations, or AFIR, there will be requirements to have hydrogen refuelling stations.  There is already a roll-out of CNG biomethane refuelling stations, by Gas Networks Ireland, which is heavily funded by the EU as well.</p> <p>  On fuel, more investment is needed in green hydrogen production and the route to market for green hydrogen.  We hope that the hydrogen strategy by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications will help in that process or provide a regulatory framework for that.</p> <p>  On regulations, there is a need to look at regulations for green hydrogen.  We are carrying out a study, in conjunction with Northern Ireland, under the shared island fund, on the safety and economic regulation on green hydrogen, particularly focusing on transport use.</p> <p>  On public transport, we had the hydrogen fuel cell bus trial on three buses.  The outcome and report showed that electric still has stronger case in terms of public transport buses.  The NTA has recently announced that it will focus on electric transport for urban centres.  For regional routes, the NTA is still open to hydrogen fuel cell technology in a small quantity perhaps.  There are still a lot of unknowns about the operation of those buses.  Indeed, we will learn a lot in terms of the electric bus fleet.  We have a bit of a way to go on that.  The timeline for the NTA to consider hydrogen fuel cell will be post 2024 in terms of its current tender.</p></speech>

Last year, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage introduced one tweak that requires all new housing builds to be enabled for EV charging.  Consideration is being given to how infrastructure and new infrastructure both private and domestic or commercial sides, including workplaces and new shopping centres, can be designed to already work with a sustainable or decarbonised transport system.  All of those are small tweaks that we can make and they will build in to an overall environment that encourages more sustainable and decarbonised trips.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee to inform its discussions on the sectoral emission ceilings.</p> <p>  The 51% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions on an economy-wide basis by 2030 is extremely ambitious and will transform every aspect of Irish society.  Notwithstanding, I re-emphasise the point that I made when I last appeared in front of this committee in January,  which is that the agriculture and land use sectors will be required to play their part in meeting Ireland's climate ambition.</p> <p>  The policy approach is structured around three pillars.  We must continue to reduce emissions using the best science and best agricultural practices; we must continue to sequester carbon and increase our avoidance of emissions through increased afforestation and better land management practices; and we must make a contribution to sustainable energy, and the displacement of fossil fuels and energy intensive materials.</p> <p>  On mitigation, the Climate Action Plan 2021 sets a reduction target of between 22% and 30% in agricultural greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.  This means that agriculture emissions need to reduce to between 16 to 18 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030, which is an absolute reduction of between 5 to 7 Mt CO2 eq.</p> <p>  The 2021 plan identifies a series of core and further measures that can deliver a landing point at the upper end of the range assigned of the 16 to 18 Mt CO2 eq while remaining within the context of a broadly stable herd, which is a herd of approximately 7 million animals.  The set of core measures will introduce significant change to the approach to farming across our 140,000 family farms.  It prioritises early action within the first 5-year carbon budget on reducing nitrous oxide emissions in agriculture, which are mainly associated with the use of chemical nitrogen fertiliser.  A national fertiliser register of compliance, which requires primary legislation, will be developed and reductions in chemical nitrogen allowances under the nitrates regulations will help achieve our objectives as will supports such as training and advisory services to underpin this transition.</p> <p>  Progress on methane is more challenging but is expected to accelerate within the second five-year carbon budget as methane reducing feed additives become commercially available.  Even a 3% reduction in methane emissions from the Irish livestock herd over the decade would ensure no additional global warming arises from farming activity.  The Environmental Protection Agency has confirmed that methane emissions may need to reduce by up to 30% to reach the 18 Mt CO2 eq.  This is very much at the upper end of international ambition and will make Ireland a leader in this space.  We are signatories to the global methane pledge through which the EU has committed to cut emissions from agriculture, which is biogenic methane, by 10% and cut methane emissions from non-agricultural sources such as landfills and some forms of energy production by 50%.  Our national commitments now far exceed this.</p> <p>  In terms of exploring further measures through diversification, the Department continues to advance this agenda through research and stakeholder engagement.  By way of example, a joint research mechanism with New Zealand was recently announced.  In addition, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, established the Food Vision Dairy 2030 group in February with the objective of stabilising and then reducing emissions from the dairy sector.  The group recently submitted its interim report.  A similar group for beef and sheep met for the first time in recent weeks.</p> <p>  Nonetheless, these measures will only take the sector so far.  They will never achieve zero emissions status because as long as we produce food, fuel or fibre then emissions will result.  This complexity is reflected in the climate Act, which refers explicitly to the social and economic role that Irish agriculture plays in society.</p><p> I turn to land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF.  Our soils act as both sinks and sources of carbon and it is imperative that we reduce the amount of CO2 emitted from our soils as we move towards climate neutrality by 2050.  The climate action plan commits to reducing the management intensity of up to 80,000 ha of organic soils by 2030, better management of 450,000 ha of mineral grasslands, increasing our cover crops and straw incorporation as carbon-storage measures and increasing our afforestation rates to enhance our carbon sinks.</p><p> Notwithstanding the increases in the gaps to target as a result of the 2022 LULUCF inventory refinement, these actions are extremely challenging to implement.  In terms of reduced management intensity of organic soils, this is an entirely new area of work with much uncertainty and complexity, which Ireland has no choice but to pioneer an approach to.  Similarly, we need to address the downward trend in afforestation and grasp the opportunities that our existing forests provide in producing timber and wood products to contribute to a green economy and increase the use of wood in the built environment.</p><p> The Department has commenced a programme of work to fill the existing knowledge and data gaps, understand the potential contributions to our climate ambition from land use improvements and set in train the development of a land use plan, based on these findings.  The Department is also developing a new forest strategy and programme, which will be grounded in the principles of the right tree in the right place for the right reasons, including the right management.</p><p> On sustainable energy, the sector provides a positive and important contribution to the decarbonisation of the energy system through applying the energy efficiency principle first and reducing energy use at farm level; deploying renewable energy technology at farm level for self-consumption but also a contribution to renewable energy generation through export of electricity to the grid; and providing forest biomass and agriculture feedstocks to the generation of renewable energy, such as biomass for heat, agriculture feedstocks for production of biogas and biomethane from anaerobic digestion.  Through these actions, the agriculture and land use sector is in effect contributing a total of 3.4 million tonnes CO2-equivalent to decarbonisation of the energy system, which is often overlooked. </p><p> The targets as set out in the 2021 plan are ambitious for the agriculture and land use sector.  Delivery will be extremely challenging.  From a technical point of view, in a stable-herd scenario there is a limit to achievability, and higher ambition would require changes in animal numbers.  In particular, there are significant challenges around the reduction of methane within our pasture-based livestock production system and we welcome the fact that the second five-year carbon budget is aligned with the current technological constraints in this regard.  As identified in Food Vision 2030, there is a critical need to consider the three pillars of social, economic and environmental sustainability as we move forward.  I am happy to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

Through Ag Climatise and the marginal abatement cost curve, MACC , agriculture is one of the only sectors with a credible roadmap on paper.  There is a roadmap to follow.  There will be challenges in ensuring that what is in that roadmap achieves the reductions we need but at least it is there and that has to be acknowledged.</p> <p>  Through all these discussions about reductions in emissions, land use was the elephant in the room, in terms of what could be achieved by proper land use and reducing emissions.  Even on the current trajectory, land use could still be an emitter, which is difficult to fathom.  </p> <p>  We have a target in the climate action plan for afforestation rates of 8,000 ha.  We are coming nowhere close to that.  We are in the midst of a climate crisis and a biodiversity crisis.  What will we do to tackle the fact afforestation rates are on a downward trajectory?  They are going in the wrong direction.  It is scandalous given the situation we find ourselves in.  I would like to hear a concrete answer on that. </p></speech>

Emissions are a huge issue in terms of how we address them and how we go forward.  There is a degree of uncertainty, nationally and internationally.  The IPCC report recognises there is much uncertainty about land-based emissions.  The two elements of that are peat soils and afforestation.  In terms of peat soils, to try to address the uncertainty, we have invested heavily through Teagasc to roll out a national agricultural soil observatory of carbon emissions, so that we get a better handle and improve the tier reporting.  As you go up through the tiers, your reporting improves.  That has already been rolled out at farm level and there is engagement in Northern Ireland to try to replicate there and get a better understanding of what is happening in terms of soil emissions, etc.</p> <p>  On afforestation, it is accepted that we have to increase our afforestation rates.  My colleague, Colm Hayes, is working on developing a new national forestry strategy.  That will look at existing issues regarding reluctance and any impediments to increasing the ambition for forestry.  The Deputy is correct the climate action plan sets a substantial increase in that target from what is happening today.  We are at about 2,500 ha to 3,000 ha and it has to get to 8,000 ha.  Legislation has recently been brought in to facilitate small-area planting.  For large-area planting, we have a regulatory framework we must comply with, in terms of environmental compliance.

As part of that, a new forestry programme is being developed and is aimed to be in place from 2023 onwards.  That will provide new incentives for landowners to engage with afforestation.  Importantly, there will be, as part of Project Woodland, a process review looking at the regulatory regime that is in place.  That is being finalised and should be published in the next two weeks to look at what we are doing and to make sure we are maintaining our commitments on environmental requirements and compliance.</p></speech>

At the moment, the range is 22% to 30% but there is an acknowledgement that if each of those sectors does not hit that, the 51% reduction will not be met.  The EPA&rsquo;s recent report stated that for agriculture, there is currently only a 20.3% reduction, so even with the additional measures that are outlined in the climate action plan, agriculture will not be meeting even the bottom of that range.</p><p> The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine says the targets are ambitious and that it will be challenging to meet the 22%.  First, how does the Department intend to bring it up to the 22% if the current measures are only bringing it up to 20.3%?  Second, has the Department done an analysis of how it would reach the higher level of 30%?  It states in its submission that it will be impossible or very limited within a stable herd scenario.  Has the Department mapped out how the agriculture sector will meet the 30% emissions target and what would that mean within the metrics of the herd?</p></speech>

The Deputy&rsquo;s question clearly challenges us in terms of meeting that commitment on the existing range, and that is the challenge.  The Climate Action Plan 2021 has identified those actions that we know we can quantify now in regard to the achievement of the commitment.  It identified a range of 3.7 million tonnes CO2-equivalent  to 4.2 million tonnes CO2-equivalent commensurate with the actions, which are quite significant, whether that is through changing fertiliser, reducing fertiliser or earlier slaughter, and so on, and they are all identified within that plan.  We have identified the need for new technology, diversification and carbon farming to fill that gap.</p> <p>  Clearly, once there is a legal commitment, whatever that might be, we have a responsibility to then propose and put forward the necessary actions to deliver on that target.  The EPA is identifying within that existing knowledge framework where we can get to.  There is continued investment, whether it be in research or international collaboration around certain areas, and so on.  For example, we know commercial feed additives are being made available internationally but they tend to suit indoor systems whereas that is not our system of production and not a direction we would like to go.  However, one would hope that new technology creates the opportunity whereby some of those technologies could be applied to pastoral systems in due course, whether it is slow release-type feeding systems, boluses and so on.  We have not quantified them at this stage because we do not have that scientific certainty in regard to them.</p></speech>

If it was required to meet the 30%, there would be a reliance on new technologies to hit that.</p></speech>

Within a broadly stable herd, there is a requirement for new technology to fill that gap.  We have been very clear in that regard, including what is in the Climate Action Plan 2021 on new technology.  It is developing fast.  By way of example, we have invested in research and there is a project called GreenBreed at Tully, where we have animals that are basically identical and look identical, but have quite different emissions profiles in terms of methane.  A lot of our emissions are associated with the animal.  I am a scientist at heart.  If one can find that difference, one can breed for it and select for it and, consequently, the ambition and expectation is that one can translate that into inventory.  However, it takes time before we get that certainty that is needed because it is the inventory that will determine our success or failure.  That inventory is driven by science and it is up to us to then provide the science and what is the reality, whether it is feeding or breeding.  The European methane strategy identified three objectives, namely, feeding, breeding and anaerobic digestion.  We would concur with that but it then has to go through a process of establishing, first, is it working, second, it is it validatable, and, third, is it transferable into the inventory?  It takes time for them to feed through.</p></speech>

We have to get the research done and get it confirmed, validated and accepted as warranting or identifying the capacity to move up the inventory tier before the EPA will accept it, so it is quite a high bar.</p></speech>

There is that old saying that the best time to plant a tree is 100 years ago and the next best time to plant a tree is today.  We do not seem to be any closer to planting in the near future and we really need to get on top of that.  I want to stress that point.</p> <p>  I have one question on transportation and I will come back in for a second round later.  My question is for Ms Lennon and is in regard to haulage.  This is going to be one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise but, actually, the haulage sector is trying to come forward with innovative proposals as to how it can reduce emissions.  One of those is hydrotreated vegetable oil, HVO.  Ms Lennon referred to biofuels and hydrogen earlier but where does HVO come into this strategy?  All the indications are that the use of HVO could lead to a reduction of 90% in emissions.  It is perfectly suitable for haulage and even for public transport.  The issue is that the cost differential is about 10 cent per litre when compared to diesel, and we know how high the cost of diesel is, so there is no incentive to use it and it is not being used widely.  There is also an issue about how it is categorised when it comes to customs.</p> <p>  Decarbonising haulage and freight is going to be such an important way of achieving our emissions reductions in transport.  There must be an urgency around HVO and how it can be implemented and used by the haulage sector.  We have seen protests block up some of our big urban centres because of the challenges the haulage sector is facing.  This could be a key win and a key way of reducing emissions, while also helping the haulage sector to come on board with this journey towards reducing emissions.  I ask Ms Lennon to comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.245" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Andrea Lennon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022062800002#F00800"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  HVO is a drop-in fuel and it can be blended at rates higher than standard biodiesel, so it is very attractive in terms of road haulage or other vehicle users.  It is more expensive than diesel - as a rule of thumb, is about three times the price of diesel - and there is a lot of global demand for it because it is part of the biofuels strategy globally to decarbonise transport.  As we increase the biofuel obligation rate, there is an understanding that HVO will be the heavy lifter within that.</p> <p>  We have had many discussions with the road haulage sector around this and other ideas.  The Deputy is right that those in the sector are really looking at their area to see where they can reduce costs and decarbonise.  On that, HVO does not attract carbon tax, so that is a positive, but what we have been looking at is the potential for a differentiated taxation treatment of biofuels, and that would include HVO for the purposes of excise, that is, the non-carbon tax part of the mineral oil tax.  There is a bit of a way to go on that.  We are getting a study done on it by Ernst &amp;amp; Young and the context for that is the EU taxation directive which looks at differentiating future taxation for biofuels based on their energy content.  We are going to look at that area to see if there is something in it that could be beneficial to the hauliers - what they call a green rebate.  It would be a replacement for the diesel rebate scheme, given it is acknowledged that in the future there will be fewer supports for fossil fuels, and that would include the diesel rebate scheme.  We need to look at other options and it is certainly something that is on our agenda.  As I said, however, there is a bit of work to be done on that yet.</p></speech>

As I said, it is just out of that affordability range at present but efficiency and reduction emissions could be key.  It will bring a whole sector on board as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.247" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022062800002#G00200"><p>I have a couple of questions.  I will start with one about climate.  I understand the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is at the heart of negotiating with the other Departments and sectors regarding what should be in their targets.  How is it doing that?  What are the criteria?  Is it cost per tonne abated, which is in the marginal abatement cost curves, MACCs, we see in a number of sectors?  How does it look at protecting vulnerable people who might be exposed?  Will the officials briefly describe what the process is in weighing up what sacrifice one sector should be asked to make versus another in the overall effort?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.248" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karen Egan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022062800002#G00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for that question.  In determining the sectoral emission ceilings, the Minister and the Government must have regard to a number of matters that are set out in the climate Act.  These include the social and economic imperative for early and cost-effective action on climate change, the special economic and social role of agriculture, including with regard to the distinct characteristics of biogenic methane, the need to deliver the best possible value for money consistent with the sustainable management of the public finances, and to maximise the net benefits to society, taking into account the impact of greenhouse gas emissions and the need to promote sustainable development and restore and protect diversity.  As a general approach, it is clear there will have to be a ramping up of measures and actions in all sectors.  This will require widespread effort across Government and society in order to deliver the targets.</p></speech>

What is the upper end of the cost per tonne of abating in the sectors the Department is looking at?  What are we talking about?  Is it &euro;1,000 per tonne in the period to 2030 or less?  What sort of range are we in?</p></speech>

Some analysis was done for the 2021 climate action plan.  I can send that to the Deputy separately, if he would like.</p></speech>

I will ask specifically about carbon farming.  We will hear from Ms Egan later on this, but if it is case we are running to &euro;1,000 per tonne in some of the other sectors where we need to abate carbon, is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine looking at measures that would see some of that extraordinary high cost in other sectors deployed to deliver some, albeit very challenging, changes in agriculture?  It does not seem to me that we are yet looking at rewarding for methane management.  There is no price on methane that would give farmers an incentive.  Most farmers want to see their bottom line being healthy and a prosperous family farm in ten years' time.  They worry about herd restrictions among other things.  If we had a new dimension that was properly funded, and would be justifiable in preventing other sectors having to undertake very difficult changes, we would have a different type of debate.  How far down the road is the Department in being able to verify farm emissions and then reward management in whatever way farmers choose to deliver the improvements?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.252" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bill Callanan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022062800002#G00700"><p>We have included the whole principle of carbon farming in the 2021 action plan.  We have set up a group to look at how we do, and how we roll out, something like carbon farming.  It is a clear intention.  I always mention a couple of cautions.  We have to set out baselines in the first instance and then it is about how we validate because we are talking about change at individual farm level or as regards land use etc.  How do we certify that?  How do we encourage it financially?  That may be through supports via the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, which are already there, such as incorporation of straw etc.</p> <p>  In the first instance, however, when it comes to where we are at, we have to be careful about a market like that.  There is a group at European level looking at how a structure would be set up around that.  We need to be in line with that.  It is proposing to publish an overall framework on this later this year.  We had a meeting with the group very recently regarding that.  On the couple of points levelled by the Deputy, the group focused on land-based emissions and how to reduce them through carbon farming but it has certainly not been looking at that methane element.  We are impressing on the group the need to look at methane reduction, which is just as valuable as carbon removal on the land-based side.  That is something that we certainly have been highlighting.  We see a value in both.</p> <p>  On the next step in that, to be clear, we have a significant challenge as regards land-based emissions, which the Deputy identified.  We will need carbon farming initiatives to support the objective of reducing those in the main.  That is the first priority.  The second priority relates to the commitments we have already made in respect of the 22% to 30% range.  We have identified carbon farming as an intrinsic element of that step forward in relation to it. </p></speech>

Generally, agriculture may be 3% or 4% of Europe's emissions.  For us, it is approximately 40% of the non-emissions trading system, ETS, which is the stuff we have to take responsibility for.  We are in a completely different environment than most of Europe.  The way Europe has treated the issue of methane has not been helpful to farming like ours.  Can we push ahead of the European posse on this because it makes such a difference?  Would carbon farming include, for example, a farmer deciding to be less intensive, to reduce the herd per hectare and get an immediate reward for the methane reduction that delivers?  We need to have new tools in the armoury other than those the farming debate is centring on and that has become quite divisive at times.</p></speech>

As I said, we have set up a group to look at the issue, but it is quite complex and we need to step carefully when it comes to making commitments.  Many people are making claims that are unsubstantiated about what can or cannot be done regarding it.  On the forestry side, we have a woodland environment fund, where we are seeking private support to support national afforestation policy.  That is where the corporate social responsibility of companies is bringing in additional finance to run this.</p> <p>  I will caution that there is quite a difference between a compliance market at EU level, which would be the cost of carbon.  That is where, for example, the ETS is trading between sectors such as land use versus emissions associated with industry.  That is not the direction of travel at EU level.  It is very much around the voluntary carbon market and the encouragement of that.  One can reasonably say it will be quite a different market.  We will regulate the provision of that as opposed to simply rolling it out ourselves.  I see a difference between a compliance carbon market, which would be used by industry to offset some of its emissions, versus the encouragement of carbon farming here to which we are committed.</p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Crammond, to respond because the issue of cap and trade is something that came up on the dairy side.  As the Deputy knows, the Minister is keen to work with industry on progressing this.  We will certainly progress a call for evidence on carbon farming in the near future regarding how we will progress in developing carbon farming models.  What the Deputy talked about as regards support for different dairy farms as to their level of intensity etc. has already been discussed in the context of that dairy group. </p></speech>

The interim report of the food vision dairy group, which the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, set up earlier this year, has been submitted.  There are two recommendations of interest within that which are operating in this space.  One of them was a recommendation that we establish at farm level what the emissions of each farm are.  We do not have that information at this point.  That is a first step.  We need to know what each farm's emissions are before we can put policies in place to reduce them.  There was also a recommendation to explore a cap and trade model.</p><p>Again, it is linked to that model.  If a farmer was to destock, he would potentially be financially rewarded to do so.  It is very early days in the development of these, but it is something we are looking at.  Ultimately, the Government is going to make a decision that will lead to the establishment of a methane reduction target for the agriculture sector.  We will have to deliver it at that point.</p></speech>

I am wondering about our role in monitoring whether we are on track.  If those milestones on the pathway are subject to technology performing or not performing or if it is disappointing or not disappointing, within this process, is each sector taking responsibility for the corrective action that would be necessary should the technology or the behavioural projection not be realised?  It is important to know at the outset who has responsibility when we go miss a target that is entered into in good faith.  Otherwise, everyone could be coming here and saying to us that they tried their best but did not deliver.  I want to understand that process.</p></speech>

That was the genesis of the Ag Climatise roadmap because farmers need to be told what the actions are and what they should do.  We regulate towards certain objectives and we incentivise towards certain objectives, but we also need to capture industry in terms of engagement to ensure that the same messages are coming from industry on the achievement of the objectives.  Our general approach has been engaging with industry in order that it is giving the right messages, sustainability bonuses for the right actions and so forth.</p> <p>  The Deputy's specific question on the sectoral responsibility drives that structure that is being put in place by the Minister where the dairy group is looking at the dairy sector with the objective of stabilising in the short term and then reducing.  The beef and lamb group has just commenced its work.  There is a recognition that everybody must play their part.  Similarly, there is a recognition that every sector will have a certain responsibility in achieving the objectives overall.  The key performance indicators are identified.  Ultimately, the inventory will determine whether we are on track so we will monitor that carefully, whether it is the tonnes of fertiliser that are used or livestock numbers.  All those indicators that drive the inventory would be very transparent and available to everybody to judge whether we are on track.</p></speech>

I only have one question.  That is because my other questions have been asked by previous speakers.  The question relates to the Department of Transport's incentivisation that was referenced with regard to electric vehicles and dissuading people from acquiring high carbon emitting internal combustion engine, ICE, vehicles.  Has the Department considered vehicle registration tax, VRT, as a mechanism for incentivising more purchases of electric vehicles?  If it has, are there any study documents that it could share with the committee?  Further, the taxation bands currently target the CO2 emissions of the vehicle.  Is there scope for further mechanisms to dissuade people?  Perhaps I should qualify that.  Over the last few years there have been very small increases in the tax that is applied to vehicles.  Is it time for us to consider stepping up those bands or has the Department looked at the effect that it might have on the availability of EVs, whether they be plug-ins or fully electric, given the global demand that exists and the slowness of the market to respond?  Would there be a net negative effect on the market and would people therefore default to ICE vehicles?</p> <p>  The other question relates to public transport.  I note Mr. Martin's comments regarding fares, which is very welcome.  I am hopeful that we can make the right decision for 2023, and that hope is probably shared by the vast majority of members of the committee.  I would like to see it as something we would do on an ongoing basis.  However, regarding the modal shift that is required in terms of incentivising people to use alternative forms of transport rather the private car, I get the impression that it is very difficult for local authorities to spend the money they have on delivering cycle lanes and cycle tracks.  Some local authorities have been amazing and some not so much.  Would the Department be able to provide the committee with an overview of how effective the budgetary outlay has been in the last year and-or project into next year?  It would be helpful for us to try to formulate a picture of what we can do to incentivise local authorities to spend that money.</p> <p>  My final point relates to EV charging facilities infrastructure.  My local authority, with Dublin councils, has published its strategy document, which is welcome.  I cannot help but refer back to Deputy Bruton's recent comment that local authorities have been quite dismal at rolling out EV charging infrastructure, so I am pleased to see a strategy document in place.  Will the Department comment on that with regard to other local authorities, particularly in cities and provincial towns around the country, and how we can get local authorities and the Department to ramp up the delivery of public charging infrastructure?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.262" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022062800002#H00700"><p>I will start with some commentary on public transport and active travel, which the Deputy referred to and is a very important issue.  Then I will pass the EV taxation issues and the charging infrastructure questions to my colleague, Ms O'Grady.</p> <p>  In terms of public transport, the fare reduction has been an important step forward.  We have yet to see the full impact of that in additional take-up of public transport as a result, but that may come through in time.  It certainly has not been immediate.  Notwithstanding that, it is certainly something we would be keen to see continuing, and we are looking into continuing it on an ongoing basis.  Anything we can do to get people out of their cars and into public transport, including fare reductions, is a good thing.  However, it is not all about price.  It is also about improving infrastructure, improving service, improving reliability and improving frequency.  These are all things we are examining through a range of projects such as the DART+, MetroLink, BusConnects and Connecting Ireland initiatives.</p> <p>  In respect of active travel, there are just over 1,000 active travel projects under way across the country which are funded by the Department through the NTA.  As the Deputy said, some local authorities are pushing ahead to get those rolled out, while in other local authority jurisdictions the progress is slower.  It has to be noted, however, that this is not a question of funding or, indeed, of a local authority's ambition to roll this out.  As many people do not want this stuff to be implemented as do want the projects to be implemented.  We see with increasing regularity that there are well-mobilised opposition groups, social media campaigns and so forth opposing the roll-out of these types of projects.  We have to work hard to communicate the benefits of these not just in terms of carbon abatement but also in terms of the quality of life issues and the well-being of cities, towns and communities by implementing them.</p><p>Unfortunately, however, there is an issue where some of these are challenged during the planning process.  They are subject to judicial review.  We have seen that on our own doorsteps.  While I acknowledge that there is good ambition and funding - there is &euro;360 million per annum for active travel projects and there is an ambition within the local authorities to implement them &ndash; there are also obstacles.  We are hoping that, through better communication and better stakeholder engagement, as well as through a review of the existing planning framework being undertaken by the Attorney General this year, we may see more improved take-up or rolling out of active travel infrastructure over the coming years.  It is definitely a key part of all of this.</p><p> On budgets, the NTA will administer just under &euro;290 million this year.  I do not have the figures on expenditure, but my understanding is that it is - subject to some of the difficulties that I highlighted - on track.  On expenditure in previous years, I do not have the figures to hand.  If we need to get those to the committee, we can certainly provide them.</p><p> Before I hand over to Dr. O&rsquo;Grady to discuss EV incentivisation and EV charging infrastructure , I would certainly say that I support the Deputy's view that there is much to be gained by trying to put as much active travel and cycleway infrastructure out as possible, be it through the NTA's active travel programme or Transport Infrastructure Ireland's greenways programme.  The Department is 100% committed to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.264" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aoife O'Grady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022062800002#J00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  I will deal the vehicle registration tax, VRT, incentivisation first and then move on to infrastructure.  On VRT, just to start, we would note that there has actually been a significant change in the VRT rates over the past two budgets.  Going back to budget 2021, we had a transformation in our VRT rates.  We went up to a multiple of 20 bands, where there had been much fewer, and the differential between the lowest VRT rate of 7% and the highest VRT was 37%.  That brought in a much bigger change between the lower emitting vehicles and the highest emitting ones.  Last year, there was then a further incremental approach taken where there was a 0% increase on the first eight bands, a 1% increase in respect of bands 9 to 12, 2% in respect of bands from 12 to 16 and 4% in respect of the highest emitting vehicles.  That brought in a further change.  We also have a relief for VRT on battery EVs up to a value of &euro;50,000.</p> <p>  There is quite a lot available for someone purchasing an EV at the moment.  I would always like to see greater incentivisation, and I work with my colleagues in the Department of Finance to try to push that agenda.  We have a very generous suite of measures both in terms of capital grants and through the VRT system to incentivise the uptake of EVs.  So much so that if one gets a full rebate for an EV and a capital grant, one can get &euro;10,000 off the price of the on-the-road vehicle, which is pretty good.  In the UK two weeks ago, they removed any grant for a passenger EV.  In terms of what Ireland is offering compared with our nearest neighbours, we have a very good system.</p> <p>  We are in discussions with the Department of Finance on ways that we could use the taxation system to further incentivise the uptake of EVs.  That will continue throughout the summer months.  We will get the outcome in budget 2023.</p> <p>  On infrastructure and the need to accelerate the roll-out of publicly accessible EV charging infrastructure, that is a space where we probably have not, at central and local government level, been able to deliver as much as is needed.  There are quite a few public charging points in place, but we always need to be ahead of demand.  The Department published the draft EV infrastructure strategy earlier this year.  It was open for consultation until the end of May.  Within that draft strategy, there is an acknowledgement that the offering for local authorities either was not sufficient in the context of funding or when it came to support.  In terms of helping and supporting local authorities to deliver greater EV charging infrastructure, the draft strategy proposes that we support local authorities in the development of an approach for a local EV charging network, which is exactly what the four Dublin local authorities have done.  We have been engaging with them throughout the year and are delighted to see the publication of their strategy.  It will help Dublin move forward.  Now that the four authorities have set out what they want to do, we will be able to support them through capital funding in implementing the strategy.  We would like to see other local authorities doing likewise.  We proposed to offer them supports, financially and through the setting up a kind of a framework system whereby they could draw on expertise in order to help them to design and deliver a strategy for EV charging, maybe at a regional level, in the way that the four local authorities in Dublin have done in respect of the greater Dublin area or the Dublin metropolitan area.  That might be something worth looking at.</p> <p>  Where we had a local authority public points scheme - which was run through the SEAI and which is still available - there is an acknowledgement from local authorities that this does not really provide sufficient cover on the upfront capital costs for delivery of EV charging infrastructure.  As a result, we are proposing two schemes that local authorities will be able to avail of.  One is specifically for local authorities.  It is what we call the neighbourhood or residential charging scheme and it would see publicly accessible charging points designed for areas where residents do not have driveways.  It is for people living towns or city centres who have either very small front gardens or who can just walk out their front doors and onto the street.  Such people cannot put in home charging points.  We would be funding local authorities to set up on-street charging or perhaps a local hub people can access.  The idea would be that this would be accessible and local and would suit local needs.  People would not have to walk or drive far to get to these points.  That would be the first aspect of public point charging that we would support.</p> <p>  The second aspect would be a destination charging point scheme whereby local authorities would be able to avail of funding for local facilities, such as libraries, public authority car parks and leisure centres..  This would also be open to the private sector as well.</p> <p>  We anticipate that local authorities would get support for the design of infrastructure strategies for their areas, public point charging schemes for residential use where people do not have access to home chargers and the destination charging scheme relating to trip generators at locations to which people would be travelling anyway and could park and top up while they are going about their business.</p></speech>

Is Dr. O&rsquo;Grady referring to the &euro;5,000 grant to local authorities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.266" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aoife O'Grady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022062800002#J00400"><p>That is the existing scheme, which, we understand from our engagement with local authorities, is just not sufficient to cover the charging point costs because there is not only the problem of purchasing the points, there is also a need for capital to be invested and for electric works to be done in order to get an EV charging point site ready.  To refresh that scheme, rather than offer a capped rate of &euro;5,000, we would approach it on a co-funding basis.  In the draft infrastructure strategy, we propose co-funding of 75%.  We are going through the responses we received in respect of the draft strategy.  Local government would like further co-funding, but we will see what is in the pot.  We would change the funding approach in order that central government would provide increased capital support for local authorities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.267" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1562" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022062800002#J00500"><p>I certainly welcome that.  I have heard about the costs involved from at least two local authorities.  Any measures on that front would be welcome.  Has the Department looked at the trials that are being run in respect of non-conventional charging locations, such as, for example, lamp posts?  Dr. O&rsquo;Grady might come back to me on that.</p> <p>  My other quick supplementary question relates to VRT.  For a multitude of different reasons, Brexit and other matters, the second-hand car market has collapsed, as, no doubt, our guests are very much aware.  This is because part of our market was sourced in the UK.  That option is no longer viable.  The primary reason that it is no longer a viable option is VRT.</p><p>The number of EVs on the road in the UK is obviously increasing dramatically, as it is here.  Over the next year or two a second-hand market in EVs will become available.  I wonder if the Department of Transport, in conjunction with the Department of Finance, needs to start thinking about that in the context of how we can increase the number of EVs on our roads.  It is not available, but it will become available soon.  I wonder if there is any means, not specifically relating to VRT, of reducing the cost of EVs in Ireland.  If you do a comparison across the European Union you can see that the most expensive vehicles in Europe right now are in Ireland.  List prices on EVs in Ireland are higher than any of our European neighbours, by and large, although there are a few exceptions.  By and large, our prices are the highest.  That is because of the additions that we add on to the cost to our consumers.  This is notwithstanding the generous incentive scheme, as Dr. O&rsquo;Grady rightly pointed out.  While this question may not be answered now, it is something that the Department needs to think about, particularly in the context of the second-hand market.  It is also a matter of increasing the number of options for people.  If they must buy a car, let it be an EV.  Can we incentivise that in some way? </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.270" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aoife O'Grady" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022062800002#K00300"><p>I have a brief response.  On lampposts, we are actively looking at it.  There is a technical barrier in terms of the designated meter which is required from the ESB network side.  If you have to put the meter in the lamppost, you then have an additional piece of street infrastructure which takes away from the rationale for using a lamppost in first place.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and Fingal County Councils are trialling them but they are doing it on an unmetered supply.  They are not charging users for it.  If we do a significant roll-out and we begin to charge users, we have to work out how to get around the meter issue.  That is the challenge, but we are actively working on it.</p> <p>  In terms of the second-hand market, I completely agree.  In the Department, I chair a working group called the electric vehicle policy pathway, EVPP, implementation group.  It follows on from the EVPP group&rsquo;s report, which was published last September.  A subgroup was established within that to consider not just the second-hand market but also the issue of a just transition to the electrification of the transport fleet.  Within that, we are considering ways to encourage and expand the second-hand EV market in Ireland.  It is also looking at other low-cost ways of supporting people on lower incomes who are making that transition to EVs.</p></speech>

I call Senator Boylan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.272" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1635" speakername="Lynn Boylan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022062800002#K00500"><p>I thank our speakers.  I have questions for each of the Departments.  The first question is on transport.  I am glad to hear that the just transition has been factored in.  As Deputy Alan Farrell said, there is no second-hand EV market as such.  Many people who are driving diesel cars are doing so because they were previously incentivised to buy those cars.</p> <p>  My concern is around the lock-in of the SUV market, given that 55,000 SUVs were sold in 2021, and especially the number of SUVs that have been purchased in Dublin.  I appreciate that many of those who have big vehicles live in rural Ireland and need them for work, but I am particularly concerned about the use of these vehicles in urban centres.  What sort of policy measures is the Department looking at to stop the purchase of these SUVs?  Not only are they more dangerous on the road and less aerodynamic, but there is also the issue of their weight.  Even if they are electric, a large amount of power is required to charge them up.  They also damage the road infrastructure, which then has a cost in terms of public funding.  Will we look at taxation measures to disincentivise people from buying SUVs, whether they are electric or non-electric?  There is also the issue of their marketing.  Is there any scope for banning the advertising of SUVs?</p> <p>  The other question I have for the Department of Transport relates to the bike-to-work scheme.  Everybody will agree that it is a great scheme.  It has facilitated many people to get into cycling.  However, it is designed regressively so that the higher your income, the more benefit you get from it.  It also excludes children, students and anybody who is on social welfare payments.  Is there scope to amend that scheme so that it is more inclusive of people who might want to take up cycling but, for whatever reason, are not in paid employment?</p> <p>  My next question is for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is my understanding that the second five-year carbon budget looks at the addition of feed additives to reduce methane emissions.  However, it will not be until the third carbon budget that the Department predicts that we will have pasture additives.  What are the implications for the message we send out that Ireland has grass-fed, pasture-based farming if we are going to be relying to bring down those emissions on food additives which would require indoor feeding?  How do we square that circle for the second five-year budget?</p> <p>  My final question is for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  The officials mentioned in their opening statement that the Minister must take regard of a number of different factors under section 6.  One of those is the particular social nature of agriculture, and another one is the need for climate justice and a just transition.  How does the Department do that balancing act of ensuring all of those factors are taken into account when deciding the emissions cuts?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.274" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Martin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022062800002#K00700"><p>I thank Senator Boylan for those questions.  I will start with the concerns expressed around the bike-to-work scheme, which has been very successful.  As the Senator rightly points out, it is focused on cycling to work.  Therefore, there is a PAYE element to it.  As a result, it excludes those who do not work, including children and students, etc.  It is something we are looking at.  We are also looking at other things in respect of e-bikes or e-cargo bikes, where the bike-to-work scheme does not cut it in terms of the amount of relief it offers.  As we lead up to the next round of budget negotiations, essentially we are looking at whether VAT reductions could be applied for certain mobility sales, such as bikes, etc.  That would not necessarily involve a deduction of pay at source or of tax at source.  Rather, it would be a VAT relief on certain things.  That is an area that could be considered in that regard.  We would need to work with closely with our colleagues in the Department of Finance on that.  However, I reiterate that it is on our radar.  We are aware of it and we are looking at it.</p> <p>  SUVs are a complex area.  Our existing approach to taxation of motor vehicles is through VRT.  It is already designed to encourage a shift to improved emissions performance.  Therefore, we are looking at higher taxation on heavier vehicles by default or by proxy.  While it is not specifically targeted at SUVs by name, the bigger the cars, the higher emissions they tend to emit and, therefore, the higher the level of tax you pay on them.</p> <p>  We continue to engage with the Department of Finance to look at a range of improvements on the taxation system to try to disincentivise heavier vehicles and higher-emitting vehicles.  However, the current focus is on the actions that are in the climate action plan, the sustainable mobility policy and the road safety strategy.  We need to be a little careful when we focus on weight alone, or on aerodynamics alone, because we could introduce an increased tax band on EVs as well.  This could therefore reduce the attractiveness between an EV and an internal combustion engine.  People will just decide to go for a fossil fuel car or, worse still, decide to stick to their existing car, which probably has higher emissions than a new fossil fuel car or an EV.  We do not want to force people back into higher-emitting vehicles through a weight-based taxation system.  I might hand over to Dr. O&rsquo;Grady to pick up on the EV implications of that.  </p></speech>

As Mr. Martin has said, we already have a kind of proxy disincentivisation that does not target SUVs, but it does target the heaviest vehicles.  As our EV market share increases, the Exchequer will need to have a look at the VRT system again because in the future, when we get to a very high proportion of vehicles coming in as battery electric all at 0% VRT, there will need to be a consideration of another means rather than just tailpipe emissions for managing VRT.  We know that some discussions are at an early stage not just in Ireland but at a European level to look at overall energy efficiency, and weight and vehicle size would certainly come in there.</p></speech>

That is not correct.  We will need them, and we have already identified them as required within this decade in terms of our contribution but what we are saying is that we identify a level of caution in terms of the roll-out.</p> <p>  In terms of where we are at, we have invested in research to look at the various types of feed additives, because there are multiples of them.  There is a product called 3-NOP, there are oils, and seaweed is another one that has been mentioned.  That project is ongoing and is working away.  Simultaneously, there is a process at European level to ensure food safety conditions.  That is undeniably the most important element to address first of all.  That is through the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA.  The 3-NOP product is well advanced through the EFSA process, and it may even have been concluded.  We are combining that with the practical reality that any of the existing interventions, the most successful of which is 3-NOP, requires continual feeding and that is why it is for indoor systems.  We have included it within our early achievement elements, based on the expectation that the animals can be fed when they are indoors, as is the case for dairy production and during the winter.  What we then identified is that in the medium term we need the evolution of scientific mechanisms to add feed additives to pasture-based systems, which are not as yet developed.  That will be required within the period from now to 2030 to bridge the gap in terms of achievement, not in the third period.  Mr. Crammond might want to comment further.</p></speech>

Teagasc is working hard.  A lot of companies are working commercially, for example, Fonterra in New Zealand, is working with the company that produces 3-NOP, which is the most advanced feed additive.  Teagasc is looking at it in the context of perhaps feeding it to cows when they are in the milking parlour in the morning to see what level of abatement we would get.  We know we get 30% when we feed it in an indoor system of production and the question is what we can realistically achieve averaged out over the year when we include that period when animals are out on pasture.  That is the key for us now.</p></speech>

For example, if you have an indoor feeding system, the feed is made available, and the animal is continually taking in a certain level of feed and you can incorporate it through that system.  If an animal comes in and out twice a day for milking, you can mix it through the feed ration that it gets at milking time, but it is clear that it does not create the same level of reduction as continual feed.  That means we get spikes and reductions.  There is an immediate reduction in methane production but that dwindles quite quickly and it does not create an evenness across the whole day.</p> <p>  There is no mechanism for applying that in a pastoral system where there are a lot of animals that do not even come in for milking.  That is where that work is at.  The question is how we develop that: whether it is by means of slow release, boluses or other such measures.  Ultimately, there is a need for all the safety checks to have been done as part of the process to make sure that we can do it.  That is why we are cautious in terms of it not coming on stream at the pace people might like.  We will require it not in the third budgetary period but in the first and second.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1693" speakername="Pauline O'Reilly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022062800002#L00600"><p>I am conscious that we do not have officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage but, notwithstanding that, it is important to raise the issue of local authorities again.  I know from some of the previous contributions that some councils are performing better than others when it comes to active transport and public transport.  I have a lot of sympathy for those who come to me all of the time saying we need more stick and less carrot when it comes to local authorities.  I would like to see what the figures are.  Reference was made to 1,000 projects.  I would have thought that there have to be the same problems in terms of public acceptance across local authorities.  Why are some getting it right and others are not?  There must be more than what is going on with local objections.  I think there is an issue with some local authorities.</p> <p>  When it comes to transport, everybody is affected.  That is why the whole issue of EVs and how prohibitive some people find them is an important point, but it is not the only point because it is all public funding.  When I look at my city of Galway, about 25% of people commute by walking.  I am looking at all of the percentages of households across Dublin who do not own a car.  That is not just to do with access to transport, it is to do with poverty rates as well in those areas.  Everybody pays tax.  Do the witnesses feel they have got the balance right in terms of ensuring that the most vulnerable across every sector are catered for when it comes to the public purse paying for grants and for the infrastructure so that we are getting it right for people in rural areas?  Even with the best will in the world, Connecting Ireland, which is an amazing project, will still only bring us from 53% to 70% of coverage for public transport across the country.  There is still that segment who will not have access and who, let us be honest, are probably not going to hop on a bike either.  There must be some realism there.  How do we get it right for those people?  Do the witnesses feel they have got it right for them, and for people who are impacted by funding going into electric vehicles, for example, when it is public services that they need for their areas?</p></speech>

The NTA is working with all the local authorities to try to roll out as much active travel infrastructure as possible.  To be honest, Senator O'Reilly is correct to say that some are better than others.  They all experience some degree of challenge and some degree of opposition and resistance, but some are better than others.  I will outline what we are doing in that regard.  The sustainable mobility policy was launched in April of this year and as part of it we set up a leadership group, which comprises membership from the Department, the NTA, TII and also the City and County Management Association, CCMA, and the regional assemblies, as well as the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  What they are doing is overseeing the implementation of the action plan and of the policies that were set out in the sustainable mobility policy to try to encourage stakeholders - the regional assemblies and the individual local authorities &ndash; through the CCMA, to engage more in implementing and developing the infrastructure needed to support active travel.  That is happening now.  That group was established back in May and we are trying to push that message out to each and every one of the local authorities, through the SMP leadership group, as well as supporting the NTA's work in engaging with the local authorities on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p>  One of the things we are doing as well is that we have set up a delivery team, which is seeking to identify what we are calling pathfinder projects, which would be exemplar or spotlight projects around the country that we can roll out quickly at scale across the country.  This covers everywhere, not just specific areas, not just Dublin, but across the whole country that can demonstrate what can be achieved and the benefits of that.</p><p>The Department is really pushing that pathfinder programme throughout the whole country to put a greater impetus behind the installation and development of active travel infrastructure around the country, both in urban centres and rural areas.</p><p> In regard to rural issues as far as decarbonisation and transport are concerned, some areas are not as well served by public transport as others.  We are trying to address that insofar as possible through the Connecting Ireland programme.  That will have a big impact and will make a big difference.  In addition, we need to communicate and advertise more clearly to people that those resources and routes are available.  Sometimes routes are not available to people but other times routes are available and people may just not know about them.  It is about getting the message out as far as we can throughout the country that these rural transport services are available to people to use and that they are being invested in and improved.  It is important we continue to work on our rural public transport infrastructure, network and services, and promote them to ensure people know they are available for use.</p><p> In regard to the issue of EVs in rural Ireland and generally, I will pass back to Dr. O&rsquo;Grady to pick up on some of the specific points around that.</p></speech>

Inevitably the capital supports are going towards people purchasing new vehicles because that is where we are in the EV cycle at the moment.  The people who purchase new vehicles in Ireland tend to be those on higher incomes.  As I said in the previous response to Deputy Farrell, we have a subgroup examining how we can look at the just transition element of that and how in future years we can support a second-hand market when we have sufficient for it to function in Ireland.  We have looked at other lower cost alternatives such as internal combustion engine, ICE, to EV conversion, which we do not believe are available at scale in Ireland at the moment, but in future years, if they become scaleable and deliverable, that would be a lower cost alternative.</p> <p>  There are very generous grants available for EVs and the Government is funding that, but in terms of scale the capital budget that is available for the electrification of transport this year is two-and-a-half times smaller than the capital budget available for the active travel supports.  Although we are giving supports to EVs, we are giving much more significant supports to active travel.  That does not include the public service obligation, PSO, supports we give on public transport fares.  There is much more funding going into those than into supporting the transition to EVs.</p> <p>  In regard to urban areas and the concept of transport poverty and people who do not even have access to a car, this is one of the things we will be looking at in the coming years.  We will shortly establish the office for zero emission vehicles in Ireland within the Department.  An example of an initiative we have seen in other cities is in Hackney, London.  Hackney is an area with pockets of very high deprivation.  The council in Hackney has supported electric car clubs for local residents.  They have been able to provide dedicated on-street electric charging points.  The concept of these is that this is a neighbourhood where people do not have access to a car, so the council has engaged with local car club operators and provided a carbon-free car club option to enable people to have car access.  That is something we would like to look at.  We are not quite ready to do it at the moment.  There are questions about Government procurement and how we engage with the private sector on that.  However, we would certainly like to see this kind of initiative rolled out more widely.</p></speech>

What we want to see happen is that people in areas, for example, in some parts of Dublin where 80% of people might not own a car, would rightly have access to public transport and active transport and that it would be ensured that their taxes were used predominantly for that.  That is my main point, not that we would give more people access to cars who actually do not need it.</p> <p>  Education was mentioned.  I would like to see a stepping up of the message on climate and getting it out into the public that we are in an emergency.  I am not feeling that from enough people beyond a bubble.  Much more needs to be done on that.  When it comes to education, we need to talk about things that can be done.  It is fairly clear that unless children grow up using buses, they are not going to be as likely to take a bus.  For want a better word, we should park the idea that it is just about access to public transport.  It is actually also about willingness to walk ten minutes to get on a bus or to get on a bike.  What can be done between the Department in collaboration with the Department of Education around school transport?  Currently, people have to live either 4.8 miles or 5.2 miles away from a school to get access to a school bus for instance.  That access should be for those journeys of less than 2 km that were talked about if we want the 60% to get out their cars.  What measures can be taken in that respect?  What would the witnesses propose?</p></speech>

The NTA administers a programme called safe routes to schools which is an initiative for local authorities to improve the access to schools and improve the zone in front of schools to encourage children getting to school by active transport, cycling, walking and other active travel means.  That is very welcome.  We need to see more of that.  My understanding is that 170 schools currently participate in that programme.  Many more are keen to join.  We encourage the safe routes to school programme and are trying to roll it out through the NTA.  In regard to school transport, we are engaging with the Department of Education on this on an ongoing basis.  That is certainly something we can look at.</p> <p>  The communications point is well made.  The Department of the Taoiseach has just set up the climate communication co-ordination committee, which looks at co-ordinating the messaging and the narrative on climate across all sectors.  It is a whole-of-government approach to ensure we are all saying the same thing and not conflicting and tripping over each other in our climate communications.  That group has just been established and will be putting in place a whole-of-government communications strategy to ensure there is consistent messaging that does not get crowded out or cause fatigue for citizens and that is consistent on climate and what we all need to do across all sectors, both by Government and by citizens, to address the climate issue.  That is a well-made point and something we need to take on board.</p></speech>

Part of that study is to look at the distributional and socioeconomic impacts leading to just transition.  We hope to have the output of that study this summer.  It should help us understand the impact of some of the measures we are putting in place and whether we are getting the balance right, looking at the user benefits and affordability, being able to break down the population by zone, by rural areas, by transport, by time of day, and that question of deprivation.  It will help us to understand who has the choices and options in terms of non-car-based transport.  On the point of the school transport, part of the modelling is throwing up some possible additional measures we could apply.</p><p>One of those was looking at a reduction in escort to education private car use.  There could be some benefits there for carbon reduction and it is an area in which we will do a little more work with possible measures.</p></speech>

Their infrastructure needs are much more aligned with sustainable mobility needs.  The charging for them is not significant.  The infrastructure being considered by the zero emissions vehicles Ireland, ZEVI, office would be that kind of large-scale charging infrastructure.  My feeling is that the infrastructure challenge for electric scooters and bikes is much more on the sustainable mobility side than the electric charging side.</p></speech>

There is still a residual carbon cost.  If we got to 80% renewables use by 2030, which would be brilliant, there would still be 20% of the power for those vehicles coming from fossil fuels.  It is not part of the accounting system but we should also consider the embodied emissions associated with electric vehicles.  It is not correct for it to be called the zero emissions vehicles Ireland office because it is not and cannot be that.</p> <p>  I ask about the vehicle kilometre reduction target for fossil fuel-powered vehicles.  It is 10%.  It seems that is pretty meaningless in the context of the target of 850,000 electric vehicles by 2030.  We should easily eclipse that 10% target for vehicle kilometre reductions in internal combustion engine vehicles.  If that target is for vehicles powered by fossil fuels, it should be much higher.  If it is not, are we saying we will not achieve the target in the first instance?  Are we not being true to the avoid, shift and improve principle if we do not apply it to the total number of kilometres driven?  If we are not applying it to the total number of kilometres driven, are we saying there will be an equal or greater number of kilometres driven by vehicles in 2030 when the avoid, shift and improve approach means we want to get people onto other modes, first and foremost, and reduce the need for driving?</p></speech>

We must remember this is measured against the baseline in 2018, so we are looking at a reduction of 10% in total kilometres driven by fossil fuel cars as compared with 2018, but that must also counter the level of growth we will see between now and 2030, which is not insignificant.  There will be growth and we are trying to drive down the number of kilometres driven by those vehicles.</p></speech>

We should bear in mind that some of the public transport or active transport journeys we are trying to promote would be typically over a shorter distance.  We will still have people driving over much longer journeys in their private cars.  In many cases that would be logical because there may not be an alternative to such a mode of transport.  The total number of kilometres would still be impacted in the context of private car use.</p> <p>  The average length over which ICE cars or cars powered by fossil fuels are on the road is approximately 14 years.  We are looking at getting a fairly significant number of electric vehicles on the road by 2030, with a total of 940,000 when we look at light vans as well, but there will still be many cars sold down the years up to that point powered by fossil fuels.  They will remain on the road even after cars powered by fossil fuels cease being sold at all, and there will be a residual.</p> <p>  The 10% reduction in kilometres may at first glance appear to be quite small, but all the modelling and analysis we have done, and even looking at the modal shift from cars to active travel and public transport and the transition from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles, indicates it is quite an ambitious target.  If we meet it, we will be well on our way to meeting the abatement targets set out in CAP21.</p></speech>

Is the Department is committed to demand management, reduction and the avoid, shift and improve principle?  That is really about electric vehicles where there is no other way of providing the transport needs of the population.

It is a carbon counting mechanism.  We modelled what we could do under biofuels, sustainable and renewable fuels and the reduction that would give us in carbon emissions.  We considered what would remain to be achieved through carbon emissions reduction through greater uptake of electric vehicles and what would be delivered through our sustainable transport investment over the years between now and 2030.  This is not even in order for us to get to 51%.<br/><br/>The modelling us shows us a 10% reduction in ICE car kilometres will reduce further carbon emissions.  There is still a 0.9 megatonne gap to target, and the work Ms Lennon referenced earlier is identifying a way of delivering that 0.9 megatonne additional reduction in the least negative distributional impact.  As a Department, we are trying to identify that final pathway that will do it in as beneficial a way as possible for society and the economy.<br/><br/>That 10% demand management in kilometres reduction is defined as an ICE kilometre reduction because the aim is carbon reduction.  There may well be electric vehicle kilometre reduction in there also but that does not count towards our carbon reduction target, whereas on sustainable mobility-----</p></speech>

There was a study earlier this year or late last year by researchers in University College Cork, UCC, showing that nearly 40% of our transport emissions are caused by private car journeys in the 0 km to 8 km range.  Many of these are commutes, school runs, trips to the shops, mass and so on.  Within that 0 km to 8 km range is, certainly at the lower end, there is potential for cycling and there is good work being done in that regard.  At the upper end of the range, there certainly is potential for e-bikes.  Is the modelling appropriately accounting for the potential for e-bike uptake?  I am concerned that the office is not looking at e-bikes.  They are not fully zero-emission either because they require power but they certainly are much closer to being zero-emission vehicles than are the typical electric vehicles.  Does the modelling account for the potential for e-bike uptake for the 3 km to 8 km range of journeys?</p></speech>

We will come back to the committee on that.  In the exercise we undertook this year on the transport model, in collaboration with the NTA and SYSTRA, we looked at the question of reducing kilometres travelled.  We had four workshops and that was one of them.  One of the key things we looked at was around car ownership, including measures looking at multiple car ownership and how that might be reduced.  We also looked at the trips themselves and the question of differentiating, as the Chairman outlined, between shorter trips and longer trips.  There is a different demand response there.  Those kinds of issues are being taken into account in the review of modelling.  The results of that review will be available very soon, in the course of the summer, and will inform our thinking.</p> <p>  We also have another study that is being carried out on e-bikes.  It is a co-funded project with the SEAI and the output from that will also inform our thinking in this area.  Part of the review process we did in the workshops was involving academics, policymakers and modellers in looking afresh at the model and seeing where we can get gains.  It is primarily about addressing the 0.9 megatonnes gap we have.  We want to look again at the balance of measures and whether we are hitting all the various measures we can to achieve the overall goal.</p></speech>

It is about more than the 0.9 megatonnes gap.  A lot of the journeys we envisage being made by the 845,000 EVs could be made by even more sustainable modes.  The potential in this regard is vast.  I am not saying it is necessarily straightforward.  We have to build the networks in all our villages, towns and cities in order that people can feel safe getting onto a bike, e-bike or e-cargo bike.  If we accept that the potential here is huge, because anything in the 0 km to 8 km range is comfortably cyclable, then we probably would not need to be so ambitious in our EV target, which is, as everybody would agree, very ambitious and very costly to the State.</p></speech>

The modelling we have includes what is referred to as a cycling propensity factor, which is, in essence, a measure of how likely people are to cycle and over what distance.  We can ramp that up and down.  The uptake of e-bikes over the past couple of years has increased very quickly and, fortunately, we are seeing a significant number of them on the roads.  This is particularly the case in the wake of the Covid period, when the supply chain issues around e-bikes began to loosen out and the prices came down.  If we were having this conversation three years ago, there would have been a fraction of the number of e-bikes on the road compared with what we are seeing now.  It is an evolving technology and we are getting much cheaper e-bikes into the market.  I will not name brands but there are much cheaper models becoming available.  One can buy an e-bike for less than &euro;1,500 now, which one could not do two or three years ago.  It is very much a developing area and it something to which we need to react.</p> <p>  I cannot answer directly as to whether the modelling that was done for CAP21 fully incorporated the potential for people to replace longer 5 km to 8 km journeys with journeys by e-bike.  It is something that certainly can be looked at.  These are the sorts of things we have recognised in the carbon budgets and the timing of those budgets.  New technologies will be coming along and we will have to respond and adapt to them and try to harness the benefits they can give us as and when they come along.  This is a perfect example of that.</p></speech>

I have a few more questions.  Reference was made to EV uptake in a Dublin, with mention of a scheme in Hackney, London.  I reiterate Senator Pauline O'Reilly's point that our city centres are where we do not want to see EVs being used, because there are other ways of getting around there.  We should not be seeing it as a target or ambition that everybody living in the centre of Dublin, Limerick or our other cities should have an EV outside their front door.  If we think like that, we are just going to clog our urban areas with cars.  We need to be cautious about providing the infrastructure, including charging lamp posts.  The streets in our villages and towns need to be prioritised not for on-street parking but for active and sustainable travel infrastructure.  We need to be very careful about that.</p> <p>  We might say that the justifiable use for EVs is in rural areas where it is very difficult to provide public transport.  There is huge potential to go beyond what is envisaged in Connecting Ireland.  We have talked a number of times in this committee about the every village, every hour concept.  In fact, provision needs to go beyond an every village, every hour target and also offer a service that is quick and reliable.  I note that Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan was tweeting at the weekend about the Local Link service between Clonakilty and Kinsale.  It was great to see him using it.  We can roll out that kind of service in a cost-effective way right across the country and go way beyond the 70% coverage provided for under Connecting Ireland.  In fact, what we should be trying to do is provide a service not just for people who cannot afford cars or electric vehicles but for everybody, in view of the emissions cost that is associated even with EVs.</p> <p>  I am glad to see support across the committee for really ramping up the ambition regarding taxation of larger, heavier and inefficient vehicles.  Deputy Alan Farrell is very supportive of a big jump in taxes on those vehicles and I certainly agree with that.  Has any study been done on the revenue that would be accrued from a ramping up of taxation in this regard?  It is obscene that 55,000 of the vehicles put on the road last year were these huge tanks that are absolutely unnecessary.  Some people and families might need them but the number is nothing like 55,000.  Is there any analysis being done on the revenues that would arise from an increased taxation on those heavier, inefficient vehicles to fund a more universal rural public transport service?</p></speech>

In Ireland, we do not normally hypothecate taxation revenue.  As such, ring-fencing a certain amount of VRT on higher emitting large vehicles to support public transport in rural areas is a matter about which colleagues in the Department of Finance would be wary.  Two initiatives are being taken, though, in that VRT is increasing on higher emitting vehicles and more funding is being spent on promoting rural sustainable public transport.  The ring-fencing of one or the other is probably more a matter for the Department of Finance, but hypothecation is a space into which it tends to be reluctant to step.</p></speech>

I will start with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, although this is perhaps not a question for its officials.  Is there a commitment, or is it being discussed, that the sectoral ceilings should add up to no more than the national carbon budget passed by the D&aacute;il?  There are concerns that we will exceed it.  Will the sectoral ceilings align with Ireland's 51% emissions reduction target?  Is a final figure that is consistent with legislation and current commitments being ensured across the Departments?</p> <p>  How are we ensuring that there is a fair share of lifting across sectors?  What does the concept of doing a fair share mean?  What is the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and other Departments is feeding into that?  Agriculture is always the hot topic and the contentious space in these discussions.  Farmers' representative groups have stated publicly that they feel that they have not been consulted.  We heard from the Department's opening statements that there are significant challenges as well as plans.  Is a model or direction of travel emerging as regards how emissions reduction targets will be achieved?  What does the future of Irish farming look like?  It is understandable that farmers are nervous about these ceilings.  They have invested significantly and are working under what is in place now.  I am not clear as to whether an alternative pathway has been laid out before them.  Is one emerging?  Where does that situation stand?</p></speech>

The 2021 climate Act gives us parameters within which we have had to operate.  The analysis that has been done is designed to allow us to reach the targets.  The sectoral ceilings will have to add up to the carbon budget.  They must not only allow us to reach our 2030 targets, but also put us on track to reaching our 2050 targets.  Extensive analysis has been done with all of the other Departments in order to ensure that we can achieve those targets.</p> <p>  Regarding the fair share of lifting, the analysis and engagement that we have undertaken allow us to be realistic about what can be achieved across the various sectors.  It has been a collaborative process.  The analysis seeks to include a sense of potential distributional impacts, but I must voice a caveat, in that this will all be dependent on the measures and policies that will be implemented to meet the ceilings and carbon budgets.  Detailed policy design will need to happen to address all of the issues.  Further assessment of the proposals is ongoing, as is further assessment of the impacts with relevant Departments.</p></speech>

It envisages that the relevant Ministers will take responsibility and be accountable to the Oireachtas for the sectors relevant to their areas, while delivery of the sector ceilings will be monitored by the Climate Change Advisory Council, CCAC.  This accountability structure underpins the achieving of the sectoral ceilings.</p></speech>

Does the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications present a line Minister with a set of options and he or she then goes off and negotiates with Cabinet colleagues, who have similar options?

There has been consultation and engagement at official level and there have been meetings at Secretary General level, but there is also the ministerial level of engagement, which is ongoing at the moment.  These matters are still being considered at a political level.  I cannot share much of the detail in advance of a Government decision but a great deal of analysis has taken place while we have worked on the sectoral emissions targets and there will be considerable engagement over the summer on the development of the next climate action plan, wherein many of the measures and actions will be defined.  Does that answer the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

I thank Ms Egan.</p> <p>  Will the officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine touch on the notion of doing a fair share?  Specific measures in the legislation recognise the important position of agriculture, but what does that mean in real terms?  How is it measured or assessed?  Is it built into the range that will apply to agriculture compared with other sectors or do other components factor into the variable that is agriculture's social and economic impact?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.324" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bill Callanan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022062800002#P01000"><p>I will describe different levels to answer that.  The Deputy is correct, in that agriculture's important position is implicit in the climate Act, which recognises the special role of agriculture in terms of food, fuel, fibre, production and so on, as well as its social importance to rural Ireland.  Its recognition within the structure will influence the fair share of lifting it will do.  What we are trying to communicate is that agriculture has to do its part.  In my opening statement, I identified that the pathways towards doing that were reducing and removing emissions and making a contribution to sustainable energy.  That is our general direction.</p><p>The Department has been particularly open to that engagement at different levels, for example with farm bodies and the continuous understanding to look at the challenge that is before us.  Deputy O'Sullivan drew attention to Ag Climatise.  We were out of the blocks early in identifying the actions farmers needed to take in order to deliver on it.  We deal with 140,000 farmers.  At individual farm level we need to break it down and reduce it rather than giving high-level messages.  This is translated through the signpost farm programme.  Teagasc has engaged with industry in developing approximately 100 signpost farms around the country, which will profile and push out those actions that farmers need to do.  There are different levels of engagement at individual farm level.  We have also engaged with industry around the messages they need to give to their farm suppliers to achieve sustainability so they are coherent and consistent across independent businesses.  At the upper end there is engagement with farm bodies around the implications and expectations.</p><p> I must be clear that from all of the levels that I have seen, farmers are engaged and understand the need to deliver on the climate agenda.  It is very much to the forefront because agriculture contributes to climate change, can contribute to the solutions and is also impacted by climate change.  There are people working in that environment every day.</p><p> The Deputy's last question was about alternative pathways.  We have identified within the Climate Action Plan 2021 the need to look at diversification options and to look at carbon farming as a model of support.  They are identified as part of that process.  We must be equally honest about methane.  It needs to be on a reduction trajectory but it is not the same as CO2.  Separately, there needs to be an open and honest debate on what is the quantum that can be delivered.  Those are identified in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021.  They have been recognised by the Government and are part of the programme for Government.  They will necessarily feed into the overall agreed approach across Government and across all of the Government Ministers.</p></speech>

Are any of those at scale yet?  The challenge for farmers is that they are operating in a system that operates for them and provides a return.  An alternative is going to need to do the same and hopefully in a far lower carbon way, possibly by sequestering or by having a net positive impact.  Are any of these at scale or are they more or less pilot studies, possible options or prospects at this stage?  Perhaps Mr. Callanan will give us a sense of that</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.327" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bill Callanan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022062800002#Q00300"><p>I divide it into diversification.  I have always tried to explain it as diversification of income or diversification of land use.  On the income piece, there are a lot of farmers who have diversified through adding value to their initial produce and moving it up, or through off-farm income.  All of those are diversification around the income and it influences their decision process.</p> <p>  With regard to land use, farmers necessarily must look at opportunities.  We have clearly committed to increasing deforestation rates.  Farms must look at how they can have products that contribute towards decarbonisation such as alternative energies, anaerobic digestion, biomass and development of the overall bioeconomy.  Those will all influence the level of economic return that is generated on the national farm.  They will feed into the farmer's decisions.  The reality is, however, that it is a demand-led system where farmers are very much encouraged by the marketplace in producing what the market requires for food production and so on.  We are dealing with perishable products in the food production system.  If the market signals in a particular way, farmers generally will respond to that.  They have no choice.</p></speech>

I have a question for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  Perhaps Ms Egan will take this question.  I am not asking the Department to comment on reports in the media at the weekend that tensions are mounting in the coalition over the scale of carbon emission cuts that will be required for farmers to deliver.  It seems there is pressure from one sector to go for the lower range of emissions reductions, which is a 22% cut, whereas in principle a 30% cut is desired.  Does the Department believe this is what will actually be needed?  If this is what is needed, would we need a cut in the herd to achieve a 30% reduction?  I must point out that the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, has written to the Taoiseach and the letter was circulated to us.  The IFA quite rightly points out that there are special clauses in the Act for the place of agriculture and the characteristics of biogenic methane.  Does the Department believe that this has made us a hostage to fortune by having it in the Act in the first place?</p> <p>  My second question is for Mr. Callanan.  I am sorry if I am asking Mr. Callanan to repeat anything he may have said earlier because I had to leave.  Feeding seaweed to cows seems to be the way the Department plans to reduce emissions, rather than any attempt to cut the herd.  It reminds me of the idea that new technology is going to be the saviour for us in the future.  This comes up repeatedly, whether we are talking about gas and oil exploration or data centres.  We are told they will all have new technology and we should not be worrying about them.  Now we have been told of a new form of technology that involves feeding seaweed to the herd.  I am aware that the tests have shown it reduces methane in cows.  Mr. Callanan has said that this should happen in the first and second carbon budgets.  Do we know, and will we know in time, what will happen after months and years of feeding seaweed to the herd?  Do we know the effects this would have on output of milk and meat?  Do we know the environmental impacts of having to manufacture to scale that amount of seaweed and the additives that come from it?  What risk might it have on other elements of our ecosystem in untested technologies?</p> <p>  I believe we are dodging the discussion on cutting the herd because it is not about the 140,000 farming families that have been represented; it is more about the farming model we have created in this country, which involves a vast amount of export of animals to the Middle East, Africa, China and so on, rather than facilitating family farms to produce the food we need in an ecological way and subsidising them properly to produce that sort of food for us.  Mr. Callanan said that farmers are driven by the market but surely the consideration must be that the system itself is broken for most farmers and it is broken for the environment.  It is a bit of a loaded question but perhaps the witnesses could try to answer it.</p></speech>

I do not want to comment on the media stuff but tensions are healthy.  It is a challenge but there are honest conversations going on across all Departments.  We have heard that already this afternoon.  People are being honest and frank about it.  It is good that it is out in the open and we are having those discussions.</p> <p>  The pathways in the climate action plan and in the sectoral ceilings are not absolute.  They are pathways that we anticipate will deliver the savings that are required under the Act.  They will evolve over time.  Some will deliver early and some will deliver late.  Some might not realise what they have.  There has to be flexibility built into that.  We recognise this in the pathways.  There is a risk that if some of those measures do not deliver they will have to look at alternative measures.  That is the honest conversation about how different sectors will deal with that.  All sectors are at risk of not delivering on certain aspects of it.  We must have those conversations.</p><p>I would defer to my colleagues from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in the context of those risks, which they articulated in their opening statement.  We need to be cognisant of that.</p></speech>

That would be a misrepresentation of what is needed at individual farm level in order to change practice, etc.  If we look at our overall strategy, there are many actions we can take, including, for example, reducing the use of fertiliser and changing fertiliser types for the remainder, engaging in the earlier slaughter of animals and looking at how to deliver breeding strategies.  Feeding is just one component.</p> <p>  It would be wrong to suggest that we are holding out, particularly with regard to seaweed.  The Deputy is entirely correct to say that there are implications in terms of the level or suggested volumes of seaweed that would be necessary.  Seaweed is only one component of those feed additives.  Everybody is investigating a whole raft of them even from, believe it or not, olive residues as a surfactant that reduces mutagenesis within the rumen.  Therefore, it is including commercial products like 3-NOP, which would be commercially produceable, rather than depending on the biological system of seaweed.  There is research in terms of seaweed.  There are also surfactants in oils, etc.  A combination of elements is being looked at.  It is not that seaweed is being relied upon as a silver bullet.  I want to make sure that everybody understands that it is a series of individual actions.  Cumulatively, these will add up to what the requirements are in terms of the commitments to meet our numbers.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.338" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bill Callanan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022062800002#R00400"><p>That is a matter for the Government.  It will have to go through the pluses and minuses in that regard.  What I must be clear about is that we have a pathway that we fully understand can achieve a certain level without reducing the national herd overall.  That is infinitely more challenging as the numbers go up.  We have to recognise that.</p> <p>  In terms of the international discussion on food production, other countries are looking at the difficulties relating to and contentiousness of agriculture.  I will articulate some of those.  By way of example, the proposals in terms of the EU Fit for 55 package, which are not agreed as yet, relate to an integrated agriculture and land use sector by 2035.  That would require something like a 20% reduction in overall emissions at European level and an approximate 20% increase in removals.  In its legislation, New Zealand has segregated methane out and imposed a 10% target in respect of its reductions.  We know from looking at other plans, for example, those of Denmark and elsewhere, that countries are similarly challenged with regard to the appropriate level of ambition.</p> <p>  What we are seeing through the agricultural food process is that Ireland will have to be a leader, especially in terms of pasture-based systems, which are positive.  If we look at that suggestion in terms of how we feed the world and if we go look back 100 years, we had a situation even then whereby we were exporting quite a number of foodstuffs out of the country.  That is the history of our production system.  In defence of that system and in the context of international comparisons, rain-fed, grass-based systems hold up very well from any carbon counting point of view.  They look particularly good in that regard.</p> <p>  I often describe the challenges relating to water in terms of them not being about water quality internationally.  It is actually a case of the availability of water whereby more than 80% of all abstracted water is used for irrigation of crops for food production.  We do not have that problem here.  In the context of our agriculture system, we have issues in terms of improving water quality.  I want to be very clear with the committee.  By comparison, however, we are in the top one third in Europe in the context of water quality when it comes to that production system.  We certainly have much in our production system that speaks very favourably to the way it is structured.</p> <p>  Our system is based on the family farm model.  If we look at the dairy production system, we can see that dairy farmers generate a commercial income by going through processors that are predominantly owned by the producers that supply them, and then supply into the marketplace.  That is a very positive system whereby we supply products through a processing system that is owned, in the main, especially in terms of dairy, by the farmers themselves.  Those products are then sent to the marketplace, which, internationally, recognises ours as a very favourable production system.  If it did not, we would not have access to some of the premium markets to which we currently have access.</p></speech>

These were reported on last year by the United Nations, which is very concerned about the matter.  Methane is much more dangerous because it traps heat at a much more intense level.  From what I have heard today, it does not seem that this matter is being treated with the urgency it deserves.  I would be concerned not just about reducing our emissions but also about how we handle the levels of methane emissions being produced.</p></speech>

The Deputy is dead right; it is important.  Methane has a much higher impact, but it is internationally recognised that it does not need to get to zero with regard to reducing its climate impact.  As a result, we must differentiate between methane that is biogenic, which comes from livestock, versus that which comes from fugitive fossil fuels and waste.  In the context of its strategy on methane, the EU has identified a need to halve emissions in this regard.  That is predominantly around fugitive gas emissions from natural gas, etc., and the waste sector.  There is a commitment in its impact assessment document to reduce biogenic methane emissions.  It is identified on page 112 of that document that a 10% reduction at European level is expected in the context of non-CO2 agricultural emissions.  That is what the EU is looking at.  We must look at methane, but we also have to disaggregate the sources of methane.  Their impact on the environment is no different; I want to be clear on that,  Certainly, the focus of the significant reductions must be understood.  In terms of the trajectory, the EPA recently identified that even to get to the lower end of the range, we are looking at a 30% reduction in methane emissions within agriculture in order to achieve that number.  We all agree on the trajectory in terms of methane emissions reductions.  The quantum is a different issue.</p></speech>

Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan let me speak before him.  I thank Mr. Callanan very much for his answers.</p></speech>

Having researched the technologies a bit, I firmly believe that anaerobic digestion will be a key technology and key tool in decarbonising agriculture, as was just discussed.  Mr. Callanan mentioned acclimatising the mean annual temperature curve, and there were references to anaerobic digestion.  It seems that we do not really have a policy or strategy when it comes to anaerobic digestion.  There are very few anaerobic digesters in Ireland.  Those that are operating took many years to get up and running because of the obstacles that are there.  Then, when they are running, they are subject to very stringent rules and regulations in comparison to many of our European counterparts.  In Germany, for example, there are approximately 10,000 anaerobic digesters.  I am not for one second advocating that we would have that number here, but we have so few.  It is a key co-operative approach to reducing emissions from agriculture.  Mr. Callanan mentioned this earlier.  Is there an estimate of the percentage of carbon emissions reductions we can achieve from a good anaerobic digestion strategy?  This will impact all sectors but particularly in terms of agriculture.</p></speech>

The Department does not have responsibility in respect of that matter.  We have a group looking at how we can encourage development in that area.  To be clear, we are very supportive of the development of an anaerobic digestion industry.  The messages we are hearing from industries, particularly gas-based industries, is that they have an appetite for biomethane and displacement.  Why?  It is quite clear that if we look at our international offering in terms of food, we are at the upper end when it comes to sustainability, but there is a demand for us to go higher.</p><p>It is very clear.  It is expected that biomethane can play a role in respect of the likes of food processing, which relies a lot on heat etc.  </p><p> In respect of an emission reduction factor for agriculture, it does help but it is not as significant as people might anticipate because if your feedstock such as slurry is going in, you are removing the emissions associated with that, which is not a bigger part.  A substantial amount of that contribution comes from displacement of livestock where you are generating a feedstock to go into an anaerobic digester, rather than just the manures.  The manures do contribute but the bigger portion involves that displacement.  </p></speech>

Half the methane in California is in the manure so  the potential is much greater; it is limited in terms of what we can abate from the manure.  Where it may have a role is if it was to displace livestock.  If farmers no longer produce beef but grow grass for a feedstock, the big emissions abatement would occur from the displacement of that livestock.</p></speech>

It also generates enough power for about 1,000 homes.  Surely there are emission reduction benefits there.</p></speech>

Is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine looking at anaerobic digestion with regard to the displacement of livestock for feedstock as part of its push towards 22% or 30%?</p></speech>

A figure of &euro;24 million was identified in terms of that ask and that was announced previously.  We will look at what element of the marketplace we need to focus on in terms of that development because there are different scales of anaerobic digesters etc. out there.  Ultimately, an anaerobic digester must live or die based on the economic return as well and that is an energy-driven policy because the market there focuses on energy displacement and energy replacement.  One would have to broadly expect the change in energy value for gas to have a major impact in terms of that.  It involves the cost of gas.  We had looked at this before.  This was a number of years ago in terms of the propositions I had seen.  There was a huge differential between the cost of that natural gas and that of biomethane.  It was roughly four times the cost.  That gap has greatly narrowed because of the change in the overall energy costs system.  It is massive.  However, there is still that issue from an energy policy point of view.  Is it sustainable from a cost point of view in terms of running anaerobic digestion?  All I am saying is that this is an energy-driven policy.</p></speech>

I think Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan and I are on the same page.  There are beef farmers in particular whose incomes are exceptionally low, who are struggling and who are very much dependent on subsidies.  Is there an economic way forward for them so that instead of producing beef, they would produce the feedstock for anaerobic digestion?  The benefit would obviously be to them but there would also be a benefit to the State in terms of reducing methane.</p></speech>

I know I am going into another industry sector.  Digestate can be used as a much lower-emission and chemical-free fertiliser so there are benefits there.  Any emissions reduction from any technology where we also get renewable energy must be encouraged.</p></speech>

There has to be an underlying economic return.  For example, we supported miscanthus previously but the market did not respond to it.  In the calculation of the economic return of anaerobic digestion, it is important that there is a return to the farmers in terms of production of grass and at a price point that is viable.  I have seen proposals where it makes sense but at an unrealistic price for the likes of the feedstock.  We must be cautious about that.</p></speech>

Regarding the urgency of changing our mode of transport, the Chairman was talking about Connecting Ireland and good public transport and mentioned the journey I took recently from Clonakilty to Kinsale for &euro;8 return.  There were students on that same bus who were getting the journey for &euro;2, which is unbelievable value for money for an efficient service that is quite frequent.  Unfortunately, that type of service is far too rare around Ireland.  I know discussion and consultation about Connecting Ireland are ongoing but I firmly believe we need urgency here.  We need to start rolling out these routes.  Let it run concurrently with a discussion or public consultation process but we need to start rolling them out.  We just discussed the carbon budgets.  Even though the requirement in the first five-year period is not as large as the one in the second five-year period, we will still struggle to get there so I urge that we do that.</p> <p>  Similarly with car charging points, it was mentioned that a review is ongoing.  It all seems to be reviews.  We need to get local authorities rolling out these car charging points, particularly in rural area, be it destinations or just giving people an option.  Again, this should be in parallel with this public consultation process because everything seems to be happening at a snail's pace.  If there was a comment on that, that would be great.  </p></speech>

I agree that we do need to roll this stuff out as quickly as possible.  I think the committee is aware of where Connecting Ireland is.  The NTA has finalised service specifications for the first tranche of projects, which are scheduled for implementation in 2022 so this is moving but, obviously, the consultation has been ongoing and the final business case is under review.  We were in a position to accelerate the roll-out of services to support Ukrainian refugees in dispersed communities and they were community-led Local Link-type services.  We can use this to build on what we have and look to fill in gaps quickly so it is there.  There is an urgency and we certainly accept and appreciate the urgency of rolling out these services.  What we have been talking about this morning covers a number of different prongs such as electric vehicles, additional public transport services, communication and active travel.  We are progressing all these in parallel.  A question was asked earlier about what the priority was and the answer is none of them.  We are working on them all in parallel and they must all be rolled out with a degree of urgency.  We are not sacrificing one for the other.  We are doing our best to get this stuff rolled out as quickly as possible and I think good progress is being made.</p><p>I will hand over to Ms O'Grady in the context of the EV charging infrastructure.

We are hoping to get to a point where we can launch the schemes in the autumn of this year so we are not waiting for the final strategy to be approved and published before we do that.  We are just working in the background on administration, terms and conditions, contractual arrangements and all of that good stuff that has to be done properly.

I would appreciate a comment from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine officials on policy around biofuels.  It seems to me there is contradiction, permanent anxiety and a general sense of not being entirely sure of where the State is going.  What is the officials' sense of where policy is in that space and where the opportunity is?  What might need to happen?</p> <p>  On transport, along the same theme, one of the big areas we will have to decarbonise is haulage and heavy goods vehicles.  What is the officials' sense of policy in that space and what the transition might look like?  What will be the role of alternative fuels, biofuels and hydrogen and what are the prospective timelines?  What is the potential role of agriculture in supporting that transition?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.361" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Andrea Lennon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022062800002#T00500"><p>I will respond on the questions for the Department of Transport.  On alternative fuels, there was a good conversation there about anaerobic digestion.  In terms of compressed natural gas, CNG, and biomethane, Gas Networks Ireland has been involved in the roll-out of refuellers and anaerobic digestion for transport.  It is still a fairly niche area for road haulage.  We have the alternative fuel vehicle grant and there has been some good take-up on that.  However, on moving to hydrogen, which is the next step, there are quite a few considerations.  Again it is around infrastructure.  There is an EU regulation coming into play on alternative fuel infrastructure which will require us to have hydrogen refuellers.  That is something that needs to be looked at.  The actual production of hydrogen on the island is very important both for the road haulage sector and for other transport sectors such as aviation and maritime in the future.  Quite a bit of work has to be done in the hydrogen space.  On CNG and biomethane, the refuellers are being deployed and there is a grant for vehicles, but they are more expensive and it is harder to get those vehicles.  In a sense we are waiting in the HGV sector for the vehicle technology to come on stream.  We can also include electricity in that mix for certain distances for road haulage.  We are looking at all those areas.</p> <p>  There is no confusion on the biofuel policy.  Generally for fuels, in the Department of Transport we have a very firm plan in our renewable fuel for transport policy.  We have a target in respect of B20 and E10 biofuels, in petrol and diesel, and we will be working in a stepped way towards those targets by increasing the biofuel obligation blending rate every year by about 3% or 4%.  That is how we are going to get there.  I hope that covers the question.  The other part of it is maybe for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine officials.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Lennon.  On that transition, one of the criticisms we hear from the sector, which is not well developed in Ireland, is that the transition should happen more quickly.  I raised the matter of B20 and E10 with the Minister a couple of weeks ago.  Is there any sense of a developing industry here or co-ordination of the development of an industry?  We met people who are Irish but operating internationally because we do not have a developed industry here.  They want to work here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.363" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Andrea Lennon" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2022062800002#T00700"><p>On the first question around the target and whether we can go higher and quicker, that is something we are looking at.  There are risks involved around both the sustainability of the biofuels we would be ratcheting up and the affordability.  We know biofuels are more expensive than their fossil fuel counterparts.  We have to keep a watch on that and watch fuel prices generally.  The cost-of-living crisis comes to mind.  On the sustainability question, we are heavily dependent on used cooking oil imported as a base for our biofuels, particularly biodiesel.  There is a risk that the cheaper palm oil is a substitute for that, which gives rise to high-risk land use change in other parts of the world.  We are doing a study this year and hope to have an output on that fairly soon.  That will inform our thinking as to how far we can go with this after 2025 to 2030, whether we can go further or need to moderate.</p> <p>  On developing these other industries for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin, green hydrogen would fall into that category.  There is a lot of activity and interest from the private sector and commercial entities in investing in this.  There is obviously a big price differential at the moment between green hydrogen, because we do not have it produced at scale, and other forms.  Eventually we will get to a point where it could in fact be cheaper as a fuel but we are certainly not there yet.  We are working with a lot of industry-led groups.  The Shannon Estuary task force is another group that is very interested in looking at biofuels and renewable fuels, green hydrogen in particular, for the development of sustainable aviation fuel, SAF.  We are aware of that.  We are trying to build towards that within the framework of the overall hydrogen strategy that is being developed by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications.  There will be a consultation on it imminently and it is hoped we will get some interest generated around that.  We are also doing a study in conjunction with Northern Ireland under the shared island fund around the regulation of hydrogen.  That is looking at how we would regulate that industry for safety or economic purposes.  All those things will provide certainty to industry and investors in building up the supply of hydrogen.</p></speech>

We will be publishing the summary report of that consultation within the coming weeks with a view to publishing the draft strategy in September and finalising the strategy by the end of the year.  Among other issues, that will capture the whole question of decarbonisation of that specific sector.  As Ms Lennon says, there are lots of developments in that space, not least the alternative fuels infrastructure regulations which passed through general approach at the European Council a couple of weeks ago.  In addition to that, it does appear that electric haulage is now starting to gather pace, no pun intended.  It is a technology that appears to be coming on stream quicker than had been envisaged.  I certainly think there are a number of areas coming on stream here.  The haulage strategy will look to capture as much of that as possible.</p></speech>

Those in the transport sector have identified sources of bioethanol and where it comes from, including oils etc.  One element of that is grain-based.  Biofuel production from grain is a significant industry internationally, particularly in America and eastern Europe.  Nationally, we are significant importers of grain.  We do not have a surplus.  We produce about 2.2 million tonnes of grain each year and we use between 5 and 6 million tonnes.  We are not surplus producers of grain.  I do not foresee the siphoning off of grain towards bioethanol production happening when we have that level of deficit.</p></speech>

Are the minutes agreed to?  Agreed.  I wish to advise members that at 1 p.m. the select committee will discuss a Bill.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, will be in attendance.</p> <p>  On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Ms Rachel Collier, CEO, and Mr. Barry Peak, learning and training specialist, from Young Social Innovators, YSI.  Mr. Gerry Fitzpatrick, chairperson, YSI, cannot attend due to illness.  I also welcome a delegation from Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de, Carnew, County Wicklow that comprises Ms Karen Murphy, teacher, Mr. Darragh Rawson, student, and Ms Annie Sheppard, student, who undertook the YSI project.  The witnesses are here to discuss the YSI project.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite Ms Collier to make a brief five-minute opening statement.  She will be followed by Mr. Rawson and Ms Sheppard, who will share a five-minute slot.  Members will then each have an eight-minute slot to ask questions and receive responses from the witnesses.  I ask the witnesses and members to keep an eye on the time shown on the television screens during their slots.  As the witnesses are probably aware, the committee will publish the opening statement on its website following the meeting.</p> <p>  Before we begin, members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>That also applies to the witnesses.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks by the Chair.  It is imperative that they comply with such direction from the Chair.</p><p> I call on Ms Collier to make her opening statement to be followed by the other two statements.  I will allow Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh in to speak early because he has to attend another meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

The vision of Young Social Innovators is to inspire, equip and empower young people to change the world for good.  We do this through social innovation education.  In essence, through the social innovation programmes we have designed, we engage thousands of young people, mainly teenagers, in social issues that concern them.  In teams, they explore these issues, identify new responses or solutions and turn their ideas into action.  It is team-based, action-focused and very much youth-led.  Importantly for everyone, it exemplifies inclusive education.</p> <p>  Every year, we invite teenagers to take part in social innovation projects.  They do this mainly through schools, Youthreach centres and youth services that sign up and receive access to our programmes and educator training.  We train educators to facilitate teams of young people using our unique social innovation framework and resources.  Teams at senior cycle are invited to a series of regional and national events.  We operate a social impact fund on an annual basis and have given out over &euro;100,000 to young people over the past 15 years.  The Speak Out tour is another feature.  We host it in the provinces and it gives an opportunity to young people to share their ideas locally, some of which are selected for our national awards. </p> <p>  Young Social Innovators, YSI, may be best known for its annual awards but that is just one element of our work.  We have a competitive element, which is optional for young people, but our overriding purpose is to empower young people in society and to give them opportunities to contribute to creating a fairer and more sustainable world and to create much-needed social capital in Ireland, ultimately building our capacity to address the many challenges we face.</p> <p>  To date, more than 150,000 young people in some 600 schools have taken part in setting up over 5,000 youth-led innovations.  YSI has trained more than 1,500 educators.  Every year, approximately 220 post-primary schools and 14,000 to 15,000 young people get involved.  We are also piloting a programme in primary schools.</p> <p>  YSI is, in fact, the originator of the concept of social innovation education in the world.  This is a term we use to describe the learning and practice of using creativity to develop ideas to improve the well-being of people, communities and the planet.  While social innovation and entrepreneurship and its methods were gaining momentum in the early 2000s, education in the area had yet to be discovered.  It was virtually unheard of.  It is informed by values of social justice, human rights and sustainable development and a firm belief that young people can and should contribute to communities and society in a much more pervasive way.  It involves a pathway of change that incorporates design thinking, human-centred design and frameworks for critical and creative thinking. </p> <p>  The 2020 programme for Government commits to expanding access to social innovation programmes to all post-primary schools.  With investment from the Tomar Trust and the Department of Education through the Dormant Accounts Fund, we are doing this by developing an area-based approach to youth-led social innovation.  We now have local leaders in ten regions around the country.  As well as supporting local schools, we are building networks of support for youth-led social innovation in different sectors from the business sector to the public, education and community sectors.  We are ambitious in this approach.  There is a challenge here that is not just for schools, education services and youth services.  We are attempting to change a culture which has largely been exclusive of young people&rsquo;s ideas and voices to one which is inclusive of youth voice, participation and innovation.</p><p>YSI is conscious that for this to happen, there is a need for us all to take up the challenge.  It needs to be an important part of our very culture and the way we do things.  We need all sectors on board to place a value on young people, their ideas and their innovations.  They want to be involved, as we know from research we recently carried out with Am&aacute;rach Research on the generation Z index, which was published last week and shows teenagers want to be involved.  In fact, 78% of them want a greater say in future policies and planning, while 35% of them would consider becoming a political representative, which is very good news.  Importantly, however, the vast majority, or 82%, do not believe young people have a say in how their area is planned, while a majority of members of generation Z approached for the survey wanted those over the age of 16 to have a vote and a say in Ireland.</p><p> We have seen many impactful projects over the years, not least those initiated by the young people here today, including the origin of the National Missing Persons Day, which was adopted by the then Department of Justice and Equality and which every year brings families together to remember those lost or missing.  Many towns have benefited from YSI projects, including through environmental projects, playgrounds and gardens.  This year, the high-impact award was given to Boomerang Youth Caf&eacute; in Drogheda, a project initiated by Our Lady&rsquo;s College, Greenhills in the town.  In Fingal, too, projects have been shown to be very impactful, such as in St. Fintan's High School, where the first ever student-led sustainable energy community for schools in the country was set up.  Another school in Fingal mapped Lesotho in Africa, leading to much better planning in the country.  Projects on policies include those relating to sex trafficking, human trafficking, sexting and cyberbullying - I could go on but the committee will hear more from the young people during the meeting.  Our model of learning is being transferred from Ireland to new regions, in particular in Lebanon, Zambia and Sweden, through our international programme.</p><p> To address the challenges we face, we need to build Ireland's capacity and competencies in social change and innovation.  Children and young people are an important part of that change who can and do deliver solutions to social problems.  They should not be overlooked but should form an integral part of building our capacity to create the change we need to make.  Our recommendations for the committee include support for the full roll-out of social innovation programmes; area-based support for youth-led social innovation; the development of an agency to support people under the age of 18 and to provide seed funding for their innovations; increasing research into youth-led social innovation; and support for our international programme to transfer knowledge to our partner countries as part of our remit to build peace in the world.</p></speech>

We did many exercises to explore these issues and it was truly shocking to see how many problems and obstacles exist for young people in Ireland in 2022.  As we quickly learned, listing the issues that exist was not difficult.  Our challenge was finding a topic all 22 students were interested in and passionate about.  Our breakthrough came just before Christmas, when our teacher shared an article with us about body shaming and comparison culture.</p><p>The article explained how the American artist, Lizzo, had recently worn a sheer dress to an awards ceremony and, as a plus size woman, had been roundly criticised online.  She is a talented artist who won awards at this particular ceremony, but none of the articles mentioned this fact.  They focused solely on how she looked.  Her talent and professional achievements faded into the background and all that people wanted to discuss was her choice of clothing.  Interestingly, Rihanna had worn a similar dress previously and was widely applauded for her fashion choice.  A class discussion started; we had found our passion.</p></speech>

What most people do not realise or accept is that a large percentage of images that bombard us each and every day are edited.  This means that people are comparing themselves with an unrealistic and unachievable beauty standard.  In our opinion, this can cause issues with confidence and anxiety and have an overall negative effect on the mental health of young people.</p> <p>  As a class, the most shocking image that we discovered was a Photoshopped image of Prince George of the United Kingdom in the American press.  People are so desperate to achieve a perceived level of perfection that they are willing to Photoshop an image of a baby.  There is no exact figure available for the number of images that are edited online, but estimates range from 30% to 70%.</p></speech>

This included filters on apps such as Snapchat.  The UK attempted a similar Bill but it did not make its way through Parliament.  We are proposing that a similar law be introduced in Ireland.</p></speech>

In our most recent school survey, which got more than 700 responses, 76% of our school felt that this law should be introduced in Ireland.  Only 10% of respondents said that they never compared themselves with images online.  Traditionally, this would have been seen as a problem that predominantly affected young girls, but our research indicated that this issue was affecting boys at an increasing rate.</p></speech>

We have had two radio interviews on South East Radio and have had numerous articles about us appear in our local newspapers and online.  We were delighted to receive &euro;1,000 from YSI Den, which we spent hiring and designing a billboard on Main Street in Gorey raising awareness for our project.  Senator Casey invited us to the D&aacute;il in May to meet the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, about our project and the effect this issue was having on the mental health of young people in Ireland, particularly the concerning rise in eating disorders among both young males and females.</p></speech>

We are all individual and unique and this should be celebrated, not hidden behind filters and clever make-up.  Children born today will never know life without a mobile phone or tablet, but let us at least give them a chance to grow up in an Ireland where they can look in the mirror and love who they are.</p></speech>

It is an agenda that I feel strongly about, so I am delighted to see that it is represented in this social enterprise.  While it is not strictly related to social enterprise, it is being marked out by the EU as an area where there is an opportunity for growth and to reinterpret our economic growth in a way that decouples us from emissions.</p> <p>  Our guests' work is inspiring.  I am reminded very much about a debate that was held in the D&aacute;il on Thursday.</p><p>Deputy Pringle brought forward a Bill on lowering the voting age to 16.  There was a cross-party consensus that this is something that needs to be looked at.  If we look at the work that the students from Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de are producing it shows that they are politically engaged and that they are thoughtful about that political engagement.  They are more than capable of being able to exercise a franchise and of deciding who they should be voting for to represent them.  If we lowered the voting age to 16 that would have an impact on the manifestos of all parties in taking the concerns of young people more seriously and in putting them at the heart of politics going forward.</p><p> I am also reminded of an experiment I ran a long time ago when I was a teacher.  I was teaching sixth class and I asked my pupils to cut out images from newspapers.  We made four columns.  One was if you were in a newspaper for doing something and the other was if you were in the newspaper for looking a certain way.  We did that for images of men and women.  It was incredibly striking when we saw how many men were in the newspaper for doing something and how many women were in it for looking a particular way.  From what our guests are saying, that is not as stark a male and female issue as it was.  Instagram and its influencers have changed that.  Boys and men are increasingly coming under the same pressure to look a certain way that was more often associated with girls and women in the past, albeit that was not right.</p><p> I would like our guests to tell me more about the discussion.  Achieving a consensus in a group of 22 people is not at all easy.  In that context, I would like them to talk to me about the process of how they arrived at that notion with the class group.  It sounds brilliant, and I will have to go away and have a look at the Norwegian legislation to see how easily it could be transposed to an Irish context but what were the other issues.  Our guests spent a lot of time teasing through the issues that affect people of their age within a particular context.  The school is at the border with Wicklow so it might be different from what students in a Dublin school, or a Waterford school in my context, would be thinking about.  Can our guests give me an overview of what other issues came close to the mark in what they were hoping to take on?  Did they see any projects from other schools that they thought were interesting and inspiring?</p></speech>

It took a long time debating and arguing but we put up a poll one day in mid-October or after and everyone voted.  We decided that we would go with whichever one came out on top.  Once we got the idea of "Be Aware, Don't Compare" we kept it going and the whole class got involved.  Everyone loved the idea and we all thought it would work perfectly but we never thought we would be here today on the back of what we chose.</p> <p>  On the question on other schools, every other YSI project this year was amazing.

As Mr. Rawson said, it took a while for us but once we finally got our topic it took off from there.</p> <p>  We want to see this change, and we do not think that it just affects our school or area.</p><p>Instagram is a worldwide app and everyone in the world uses it.  It is a problem, not just in Ireland.  It is a worldwide problem but we would love to see a change being made, especially for Ireland.  It is dreadful.  When we spoke to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, she told us about eating disorders and all.  Loads of those problems, including mental health issues, are caused or influenced by social media platforms. </p></speech>

Could the witnesses tell me a little more about the Norwegian law?  As Annie said, Instagram, TikTok, etc. are all over the world.  Does the Norwegian law just impact influencers based in Norway or is there some way of making the reach a bit more international?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.397" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Karen Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062800002#G00300"><p>My understanding is that it applies to Norwegian-based platforms and photographs that have a Norwegian audience.  We did a lot of research into these things and we found out about the law trough a random Facebook post early in November.  When we looked into it in more detail, we found it was something a lot of individual influencers had called for for years.  Edited and photoshopped images online have a negative effect on people's mental health.  As Annie said, it would be a very difficult thing to police in an Irish situation but we were struck by the lack of awareness among young people about the amount of edited imagery online.  We visited primary schools as part of our project and did workshops and exercises with students from age nine to about 12.  We got them to compare edited and unedited photographs to see the differences and the majority genuinely did not think these photographs were edited.  They thought people actually look like this on a daily basis.  They did not know the images were edited, although older students know.  In our school, students are told about this as part of the SPHE module and other well-being modules, but students who are eight, nine, ten or 11 do not know it.  They genuinely think this is what people look like.  Anyone who has any kind of awareness of mental health will know these issues start at that young age.  This is where this legislation could be most powerful.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming in and for the work YSI does nationally, as well as in the school in Carnew.  It is very beneficial that Senator Casey is bringing them in to meet the Minister.  That is very useful.  I am a fan of YSI.  I participated in 2005, which was not today or yesterday.  We went to the national showcase and it was a very enjoyable experience.  Our project was about a garden of remembrance for people who had died violently.  I remember it being as much about what you learn from putting together the proposal and learning to work together as about the project itself.  It was probably the first time we had to approach businesses to sponsor items.  We were students approaching adults and it was a bit intimidating but people responded very well.  One of the things about being a younger politician - I am not sure I am one anymore but I was in the younger generation for a while - is that you get asked questions about being a younger person in politics.  People ask why more young people are not interested in politics.  My answer to that was always that I did not agree.  Politics is not just party politics.  Wanting to improve your community is politics.  Wanting to have an impact on policy is politics, whether that means getting involved in a community association, a youth club, or projects like this, which are very important in tackling issues around body image and the manipulation of imagery.  This is a massive and growing issue, which probably affects this generation more than previous ones and is likely to continue to do so.</p> <p>  My first question is for Ms Collier and Mr. Peak.  They spoke about integrating social innovation or youth social innovation into the school system as a whole.  What is the current reach in that regard and what is the best method to achieve that aim?  Is it curricular change or access to programmes?  What way can that be best achieved?</p> <p>  My next question is for Darragh and Annie.</p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh has addressed the issue in relation to the Norwegian legislation, which sounds interesting.  I imagine that there are other avenues that can be pursued.  I can imagine that education is potentially one of those.  It occurs to me that tricky thing about some of these issues around manipulation of images is that sometimes, while we can intellectually understand that something has been manipulated, that does not mean that we do not still have an emotional response to it.  The two things can happen at the same time. </p><p> Awareness will be important in people's education of the online space generally.  This includes everything that happens online.  It relates to what is real and what is not, as well as what is plausible and what is not.  Aside from the legislation, which I intend to look at, as does Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh, what other areas of policy change can we in this institution help to address this issue?  </p></speech>

We will need as much help as we can get.  Legislation is not easily changed, as we have said.  It is not even a case of just legislative change as we want to bring this into the view of teachers in primary schools, or any teachers at all, to inform people as young as four or five years old and in order that they can learn.  We want to get this into their heads that this content can be changed, so that they do not look in newspapers and think that it is real, when it is fake.  We want to make it well known that not everything is real.  We think that people should have to make it known that when they change something, it has been changed.  That is my way of looking at it.</p></speech>

From doing this project this year, it has been crazy to see the amount I learned.  On Instagram or whatever, as a teenage girl or, in Darragh's case, as a teenage boy, you would sit, scroll and compare yourself to these images.  We brought awareness to this issue through the project.  We sat back and thought that particular images were altered or filtered or something.  Education, as well as legislation, is important.  We had two main goals at the start of our project.  Our first goal was to educate the young people of Ireland.  Our second, bigger goal was to change the legislation.  We think that we have impacted our local areas.  We went to all the primary schools.  They definitely got something out of it.  We would be interested in committee members trying to put something into the system to educate the young people.</p></speech>

I say "Well done" to them and to all of their fellow classmates.  They are a credit to their communities, to their families and to their schools.  Well done to them and fair play.</p></speech>

We are in approximately one third of the post-primary schools.  We want to be in all of the post-primary schools.  This would be more achievable at senior cycle, where we are mostly, if there was a space for this in transition year.  The new junior cycle curriculum has created more space for applied learning projects, such as in the area of social innovation.  There could be more space at the senior cycle for applied learning.  That would help.  We could also have different access points for social innovation.  This is very important.  Whether a person is in Youthreach, in a school, at primary level or in a community service, they should be able to access social innovation methods, learning and support.  That is what we are trying to do.  It is a matter of creating that pipeline from primary right up to the end of a person's teens.  There is some investment in third level but not so much in second level.  That would make a difference.  Does Mr. Peak have a view?</p></speech>

We do very well numerically, with 220 schools around the country and approximately 14,000 young people each year.  That is great.  However, we are really passionate about making sure that all young people have the opportunity to benefit from social innovation education.  We therefore work actively with Delivering Equality of Opportunity In Schools, DEIS, schools.  We work with Youthreach centres.  We are increasing our reach into primary schools.  This is important to us, because we think that there is real value in social innovation education.  The projects that the kids are doing are incredible, in terms of their outcomes, the impact on the community and the difference they are making in social justice.  However, it is also having an impact on them as well, given the skills they are learning in the areas of creativity, critical thinking, innovation and resilience.</p><p>We think all young people could benefit from those sort of skills.</p><p> Not unlike some of the committee members, I was a teacher for many years.  It seems to me that critical thinking and creativity was at the back of the book for the good kids, but we think all kids ought to have exposure to that to get the learning from it.  It is very important to us that our reach is increased into DEIS schools and Youthreach centres.  We are currently working with the City of Dublin Education and Training Board, ETB, on a Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, level 4 module, which will enable us to go into community training centres and other institutions where we believe young people can benefit from social innovation education.  They can benefit from the projects and the communities they live in can benefit from them.</p></speech>

I am conscious that there is a huge amount of pressure on young people these days in terms of social media, the climate crisis and peer pressure, but it is important that they are informed as well that it is a great time to be alive compared to even 50 or 100 years ago.  It is a great time to be a young person growing up.  I know that there are a lot of pressure such as the climate crisis and social media, but there were pressures on every generation.  One hundred years ago, kids did not have the prospects of health or education the young people before the committee have, so it is a really good time to be alive.</p> <p>  I will ask a question of Ms Sheppard first about the pressure that is on young people when they see social media.  From her assessment, do young people believe what they see when they see influencers on social media?  What are the pressures on young women or girls from seeing influencers on Instagram and other social media platforms?</p></speech>

It is about trying to look as skinny, pretty or perfect as models online.  The Deputy has probably heard of the famous Kardashians.  We were talking with Ms Murphy in class and she said that after you have children, you are often housebound and you do not get out of your pyjamas for that long.</p></speech>

She had her abs and everything back within two or three days.  It is so unrealistic, but at the same time, when you go onto social media first - I do not want to target Instagram - your head automatically compares.  I do not know why that is, but it does.</p></speech>

I am a very sporty person.  Everything comes down to sport or to your looks.  The hardest part is admitting that you do compare yourself.  I do not say that all boys do, but most boys my age compare themselves with other sportsmen or models - any boy or man who has the perfect body or the best skill set on a soccer team or football team.  Comparisons will be made.  While our project will help with comparisons in terms of looks, we will always have comparisons with sportsmen and sportspeople.</p></speech>

It strikes me as primarily an issue of information.  There is a false world out there that they are observing through social media.  They think it is the real world.  How do we cope with that and try to inform them that it is not the case?</p></speech>

Telling people aged 13, 14 or 15 years that they are fake is too late.  In one's head, one has already decided at that stage that one is fat, one is ugly, one has bad hair or one has bad whatever.  In addition, as Annie mentioned, for me on a personal level the thing with people having babies and appearing five minutes later on social media in a bikini is truly detrimental.  There is the incidence of post-natal depression, especially in isolation during Covid-19, and then seeing an image of somebody like that online.  Even though one knows it is fake and that the person has a personal chef and has taken 27,000 shots in order to get that one shot, the rational part of one's brain is put to the side and that other part just comes to the fore.  One partly believes it and one still feels negative about oneself.</p> <p>  Our goal from the start has been education and to get to young people early.  In one of the schools we visited, Clonegal National School, my son was in the class.  He had heard me, not that he ever listens to me, talk about this project since we started.  However, it was only when Darragh, Annie and the rest of the class came in and showed them that they listened.  They listened to young people; they did not listen to me.  I tell them all the time that something is fake, but they listen to the young people.</p></speech>

The picture we found the most shocking was one of Prince George.  It was on the front of US tabloid weekly.  There was a before and after picture of him and it showed how they edited and Photoshopped it.  Prince George at the time was perhaps a year old.  They changed his eye colour, made his hair blonder and changed his skin, all for a perceived notion that this is what the American market wanted, whereas the picture in another market would be totally different.  It just shows the lengths people will go to create this fake image.</p> <p>  To answer the question, get the information to them very early, so primary school is the key to this.</p></speech>

When they are faced with an issue, sometimes a political issue, they look online to see the opinion of the people they follow online on it.  How do we tackle that, to get people to think for themselves from a young age?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.426" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Peak" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062800002#K00600"><p>I have some background in this because I taught politics and sociology for a number of years in Northern Ireland.  I was fairly well versed with the media, although it was approximately ten years ago so social media did not have the same impact.  Education and critical thinking are key to it.  Many of the things we do in YSI encourage young people to be more critical thinkers, to engage with a variety of media sources, to identify those they can trust and to think about things such as reliability and validity.  They need a type of toolkit whereby they can look at images and information and work out for themselves who are the authentic, reliable and valid voices.  That is very important.</p> <p>  What is also important is that all this comes down to social justice.  It is all about enabling young people to fulfil their potential and live the most empowered lives they can regardless of the social issues that the young people choose, whether it is about body image, mental health or racism.  Every year we see a plethora of subjects.  It is all about social justice and enabling young people and everybody in society to reach their full potential.  Social media is an important part of that, but it is very important that we get young people to understand that they can use their agency to assert some control over their lives and to have an impact on social, economic, political, cultural and community life.  That is the essence of what we do.  That enables young people to be more critical thinkers and enables them to have more of an understanding of all facets of life, which will empower them as they go through their lives.</p> <p>  Increasingly, society is characterised by uncertainty and precarity so young people need to be critical thinkers and they need to be resilient, creative, adaptable and innovative.  Learning those things in school and encouraging them to behave in those ways will help them as they navigate this society that is characterised by uncertainty, flux and precarity.</p></speech>

I would not normally ask to do this but we have an important issue in the Committee on Environment and Climate Action as well and I always feel like I am juggling these two committees and important topics.</p> <p>  I have not been a teacher and I have come from a self-learning background.  There are probably no fewer people now who cannot think for themselves than there were previously.  It is not to do with social media but it is to do with the education system and that is why we are here.  I have kids who are generation Z and generation alpha.  YSI is being a leader and the results of what it is doing will be seen by generation alpha because they are the ones who were born in 2010 and after, and as the witnesses have said, it is about getting to people early.  They are all looking at "Love Island" and all of those things and they are seeing what is coming up on Instagram around those people.  There are many more pressures on boys now than there ever were before.  I never experienced that when I was young and it was all about girls and women and what they looked like.  There was not the same professionalism in sport before but people are in the gym all day long now because they get paid for it and then young boys are expected to behave like that.  I admire that Mr. Rawson brought that point up because he is doing a huge service for an awful lot of boys and young men out there.  Part of what I wanted to say is to ask what our young guests can do as advocates.  It should not just be about changing the system and we have a number of opportunities that I would love to come back in on.  There are opportunities for us to have young people mentoring young people and to do so throughout our education system so that it is not, as was said, about older people like me talking to young people.</p> <p>  I am conscious that Senator Flynn wants to come in and I want to make sure that she can so I will ask my other question and then allow her to come back in.  We have a number of Bills going through the Houses and I am more than willing to speak to the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, on behalf of our guests on the ideas they have around online imagery.  We have the online Bill coming before the Seanad the week after next and I will bring up those ideas with the Minister.  Maybe there is an opportunity to do it through the commissioner rather than just through legislation.  We should leave it with the commissioner to decide what we should do.</p> <p>  There is also the matter of education, which is separate in some ways, and the education system needs to be changed.  I know our guests are here to talk about their programme but any time I ask anyone who comes in here about transition year, including officials and Department staff, I say that schools in general should look more like transition year.  We need to have mentors and these opportunities for young people in every school year, not just in one year out of their lives.  They constantly revert to the idea that we should do that during transition year.  Is there a recommendation I can come out with from this committee to show how this can be done in first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth years?  I would love to hear our guests' ideas around that.  I am sorry that I have to run to the other committee and I thank our guests.</p></speech>

I am a qualified youth worker and I love young people.  We heard questions like whether young people can think for themselves.  They bloody well can and they can do it well.  I support the call for young people to be able to vote at 16, as my colleague spoke about earlier.  Two weeks ago we had children from a YSI programme in to talk about what has been happening with mica.</p><p>Why would they not be able to speak very eloquently and also talk about the issues that are impacting young people in Donegal?  Young people know the answers.  I am listening as a mother of two very young girls.  There should be something in place in order that our young people feel safe and the Ireland that they are in today should not have to put pressure on them to look a certain way on social media and behave in a certain way.  Our young people are very unique in their own way and very clever and intelligent.  As adults, we undermine our young people an awful lot.  Young people are fairly undermined in here, as well.  I am privileged to be on this committee, because from the two years I have been sitting on it, I know that young people are at the heart of the conversation in education.  That is great to see.  I would support any legislation to protect our young people online.</p><p> With regard to YSI, it would be powerful for our young people from ethnic minority groups also to be among the young innovators.  When I was 17, I was on a student youth forum which really empowered me, as a member of the Traveller community.  I was educated and able to be an educator to the group.  I would be interested to hear about that.  This committee will support in any way it can, as will I, in terms of protecting young people online.</p><p> The lives of Billie and Lacey are much better for having young people such as the witnesses who are well able to speak up.  The young people never let anyone take that from them.  I will give advice.  I remember being asked, when I was very young, why I would be the sheep that follows when I could be the leader that leads.</p><p> I wish to know whether the witnesses have discussions along with Northern Ireland projects.  Are they engaged in any cross-Border programmes?  Is there anything else they very much wish to get across to the committee?</p></speech>

She is saying that we are speaking up on behalf of our school.  At the start of the year, we thought it would be just that.  We never thought we would be hear today to speak on behalf of the young boys and girls of Ireland.  Our project could make a difference.  Aside from education, we could help with legislation change, no matter what way the Senator can get it in to legislation for us.  The sooner the better.  It will have a significant impact on Irish young people in order that we will be a step ahead and have more confidence to speak out and talk about it in years go come.</p></speech>

As Ms Collier and Mr. Peak have said here today, the purpose of YSI is to show students that they have the power to make change in the world.  We did YSI training in which we were told that the one thing the facilitator must pass to his or her students is that they have the potential to change somebody's life with what they will do in class today.  It is not that one cannot do that in every other class, but a facilitator has to let students believe that they can make the change.  In recent years, because of Covid and for various other reasons, students have not had that opportunity.  For Mr. Rawson, Ms Sheppard and the students in our school and our community to see the change these students have made, and to hear the discussions we had in the art room of Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de at 9 a.m. on a Thursday morning happening in the media or on national radio, shows the power of student minds and what they can achieve when they work together.</p><p>To answer the question about how it can fit into the school curriculum and where it can be fit in across other years, there is massive potential in that regard but it must be student-led in order for it to be as powerful as it is in transition year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.440" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rachel Collier" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062800002#N00200"><p>Following up from what Ms Sheppard and Ms Murphy have said, we have recently done research on social innovation education which shows the power of youth voice.  Youth voice is not an outcome of the well-being of students but is actually an enabler of well-being among young people.  They need to be heard and they need to contribute.  That is interesting.  For all the factors that have been researched on the well-being of young people, this is the first time it has been shown that youth voice is integral to well-being.  That is interesting.</p> <p>  Senator Pauline O'Reilly asked what we can change in education.  We have schools that adopt a whole-of-school approach to social innovation.  It is integral to what they do and how they embrace youth-led learning and youth voice in the schools.  They use the community of students to solve problems inside and outside the school.  There should be more project-based work allowed and space provided for it in post-primary schools.  The purpose of all those projects can be for societal good.  Why not?  We promote profit-making businesses in school without a problem.  We promote science and technology.  Why do we not promote all of those things for societal good?  It can happen.  Our school in Lebanon has trained all its teachers and it is core to all their subject areas.  Any project is done with societal good in mind so the young people learn those values very early.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.441" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Peak" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062800002#N00300"><p>The argument about this type of learning being crammed into transition year has been well rehearsed and was put forward by many organisations when the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, did its consultation.  In other parts of post-primary education, there is simply not enough space in the curriculum to focus, for example, on social justice and the things that really interest young people.  Particularly in the final two years of the senior cycle when students are preparing for their leaving certificate examinations, it does become a race for points for university entrance.  That means there is no space in the curriculum for young people to do things that give them joy and pleasure, and which make an impact on the communities in which they live.  We consider that very important.</p> <p>  From my own experience of the university and college admission system in the North, I know university places are offered on the basis of a student's personal statement, which includes the community work and sporting achievements of a student.  Students are, therefore, incentivised to do those things whereas the system in the South is very much focused on points.  There can be changes in the education system that incentivise young people to do this type of learning because we know it has benefits for them.  Using their voices and agency can have an impact.</p> <p>  We also know there is a correlation between educational attainment and different types of thinking, such as systems thinking, design thinking and critical thinking.  Those are the things that are lost in a lot of mainstream education.  Creating the space to allow young people to do those things will have an impact on them as individuals and the communities in which they live.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.442" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1640" speakername="Pat Casey" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2022062800002#N00400"><p>I thank the Chairman for inviting representatives of Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de to make a presentation on their Be Aware, Don't Compare campaign.  It is a privilege for me to welcome Ms Sheppard, Mr. Rawson, Ms Cullen, Ms Hynes, Ms Mulroe and Mr. Jordan, and indeed Ms Murphy and Ms Dunne, the principal.  It is my second time to welcome them to Leinster House.  I am here not to question them but to thank them for their campaign.  I will support them into the future to see can we bring some form of legislation through this House in response to their requests.</p> <p>  The most recent occasion on which representatives from Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de came to Leinster House, we had a great engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, visited Col&aacute;iste Bhr&iacute;de in Carnew and the students had two minutes to make a pitch to her.  That was when they grabbed my attention initially.  Since then, I have been honoured to be involved with this important campaign.</p><p>It is important that we listen to their needs and to what they are asking us to do in Leinster House to address this issue.  It is a simple ask.  They have asked us to introduce legislation to provide for the labelling of photographs that have been cropped, adjusted or filtered and for that to be clearly identified.  I congratulate these students on their massive PR campaign, which included the local press, the unveiling of a billboard in Gorey when we had a great day out, their engagement with Ryan Tubridy on the "The Ryan Tubridy Show" and their engaging with two Ministers, one in Leinster House and one in Carnew.  It is very special and a privilege for them to make it to a committee hearing today and I wish them the best of luck with their proposal.  Theirs is a simple ask.</p><p> When it comes to our physical health, we have no issue labelling products that cause harm, be it food products carrying a label with a fat or sugar content, alcohol products with a label indicating the damage alcohol can cause or cigarettes with a label indicating smoking is harmful.  The students have raised the impact photographs have on their mental health.  Why can such photographs not be labelled in terms of protecting young people's mental health and addressing the issue from a health perspective?  It would also have an educational and online impact.  The simple way to address it might be to introduce a legislative measure from a medical point of view and from the point of view of the impact such images have on young people and others.  We all know the impact social media has on our lives and how disturbing it can be.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for allowing me to contribute on this issue.  It is big honour for me as a Wicklow person to welcome students from a Wicklow school to this committee hearing.  I will support the students in whatever way I can to introduce legislation on this issue through the education system, through online media regulation or through the health area.  The students' ask is simple.  Let us label photographs that have been cropped, altered or changed.  All they are asking us to do today is to introduce such legislation.  We know the impact such images have on our mental health.  I thank all of our guests for coming to Leinster House, especially, as my colleague said, during their holidays.  They did not even get a day off school today for their trip to Leinster House.  I thank them for working with me and it has been an honour to work with them.</p></speech>

It is important a voice is given to young people in Leinster House.  This is a great example of how young people can effect change.  We had another theme, which I mentioned, on the issue of sexting.  I was completely unaware of the impact it had on young people until they told us.  They subsequently met the Garda Commissioner, who will examine the guidelines on that.  The legislation around sexting is totally inappropriate for young people.  Often young people see things we do not see because we are not exposed to them.  They see things way ahead of time.  They were a major force in the marriage equality campaign.  LGBT rights have been talked about by young social innovators for years.  They see things in advance of the rest of us.  Therefore, it is good to give them a voice.</p></speech>

I reckon I will cover what I want to say in the allocated eight minutes.  It has been very refreshing to listen to all the students.  Senator Pat Casey is an incredible advocate for the school and what they are doing.  He shared with me a video that they put together, which is excellent.  I commend them on that.</p> <p>  In terms of social innovators in general, YSI is an incredible movement.</p><p>It is so important all our young people, no matter where they are, have the opportunity to learn about social entrepreneurship and the importance of teamwork.  I often think teamwork and collaboration is so important when we go into the world of work and no matter what we do, we cannot do it in isolation.  Yet, when we are in school and marked in our State exams, there is nothing really to give the opportunity for that type of collaboration to be tested.</p><p> This particular committee has spent much time over the past two years looking at reform of the leaving certificate.  This should be one of the areas in which we should be able to consider examination in some other way.  It is such a big part of life and yet we are marked for going in and completing a paper in isolation.  I am interested in general in comments relating to that.</p><p> That the witnesses have chosen this area is really important.  I am very proud to be a member of this committee but I am also a member of the education committee for the Council of Europe and that is where 46 countries come together.  There were 47 countries but after 24 February we booted out Russia because it was no upholding the principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law.  We have the opportunity to look at different areas that affect education.  I was in Strasbourg last week and we spoke much about online communication and cybersecurity.  With the permission of the delegation, I would be delighted to be able to bring this project to the attention of my colleagues and the secretariat so we can have a discussion with colleagues from Norway about the legislation and what difficulties they may have had.  I note from the presentation that the UK tried to do this but was not able to bring it through.  We must see what are the potential pitfalls.</p><p> The work done on body image and body shaming is very important.  Every political party has a think-in every year and I happen to be a member of the same party as Senator Casey.  Last year, after our think-in, an article was written that body-shamed and clothes-shamed a number of representatives, particularly women.  There were six women named in that article and I was one of them, and we were slagged about what we were wearing.  Some of the men, although they were not photographed, were mentioned as well.</p><p> A number of women contacted me afterwards because they felt it was a really bad message for young people and particularly young girls that politicians were being judged on what they wore as opposed to what they were saying or the key matters on which we were meeting.  I want to give the witnesses some time to respond on that.</p><p> I love that Ms Sheppard finished by saying "love who you are" because it is such a strong message that cuts across everything.  It cuts across gender identity, ethnicity and all of that.  The projects that came in first, second and third place are really important.  They concerned food waste, mica and menstrual disorders.  We in the women's caucus have put much work into efforts against period poverty and it is in the programme for Government.  I hope measures against it will be introduced in September.</p><p> Generally speaking, this is a wonderful programme and I wish all the witnesses well.  Perhaps Mr. Rawson or others would like to comment on some of the remarks I made around value in marking exams that take in elements of collaboration and teamwork.  I also asked if I could be given permission to bring this forward on a European level.</p></speech>

We could not thank the Senator enough if she brought that up on a European level because it is the only way it will expand and grow.  The Senator also spoke about marking exams.  I am not too good in school from an academic perspective but I enjoy group work.</p><p>I play team sports and everything, including camogie and football.  I feel that at the end of the day, it is all just pushed into one exam.  We sit at our own desks with our own paper and we are marked on this one paper.  It does not give us the chance to reflect who we are as people outside of academic results.  Therefore, I definitely agree with the Senator.</p></speech>

It was the same with YSI this year.  None of us would do anything by ourselves.  If there was an interview, we went in twos and threes.  We refused to go by ourselves.  As a group, we can make our point.  If one person forgets something, the others can help out.  When we go in to sit a State exam, we are on our own.  Someone who is sick, for example with a headache, has to sit an exam that could be the difference between becoming a doctor or becoming a blocklayer.  The points we get can dictate the rest of our lives.  In Northern Ireland they have personal statements, where students can say how they are in communities.  We found with YSI that some of us like speaking in public but others do not.  Some people prefer the quiet approach.  I think the examination format for the leaving certificate, with everyone all by themselves, is very harsh.  I would like to see some form of teamwork brought into that.</p></speech>

Darragh did not mention that we did a class election and we nominated a project leader and a project vice leader.  Molly who is in the Visitors Gallery is our project leader.  Each of the students pitched to the class on how they would direct the project, what they would do and what their leadership style would be.  The students decided who should lead the project, based on the merits of each individual.  Molly and Darragh have done a fantastic job in steering the class.  The students are clever.  They know each other's strengths.  Within our class we had individual groups working on design, logos and content for our school app and social media.  Working within groups allowed the students to work to their strengths.  Different people have different strengths.  An exam-based system only works for some people.  I am thinking of that famous cartoon where they have lots of different animals together and they tell them that success is getting to the top of a tree.  In the same group of animals there is a goldfish and a monkey.  The exam structure at the moment does not suit every student but group work allows students to shine who would not necessarily shine on an exam paper.</p></speech>

The committee has done a lot of module work on school bullying, including a report the witnesses might have seen, and on leaving certificate reform, as Senator O'Loughlin has mentioned.  The issue that came forward in both modules of work was social media and its effects on mental health, as Senator Casey has said.</p> <p>  We do not want to mention the dreaded word of suicide but we all know people who have died by suicide because of social media, secondary school students especially.  I have encountered it in my own constituency of Wexford.  We have had families communicating to this committee whose son or daughter died by suicide as a result of bullying on social media.  Did that form part of any of the research the witnesses are doing around social media?  There are a lot of people who do not want to talk about it, but I think it is so important that we talk about it and we make people aware that there is a lot of help out there.  There was an item on Ryan Tubridy's radio show this morning about a third year student at Maynooth University who committed suicide, although the show did not say it was because of social media or anything like that.  There is a lot of help out there but often people are afraid to go and ask for it, or maybe they are afraid it is not there.</p><p>Did that form part of our guests&rsquo; research?  Did it form part of their conversations with fellow students?  Did it form part of their research on social media companies?  Do they have any interaction with social media companies such as Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook?  Was it just based on research within their student cohort?</p></speech>

I do not think we would get very far with them, to be honest.  To go back to what the Chairman stated in respect of suicide and things like that, the problem is that it is difficult to accept that one needs help and then go and look for it and find it.  Unfortunately, some people think it is easier to just-----</p></speech>

Our class know the help is available but not everyone knows that.  Our class is only a group of 22 students in County Wicklow.  There are thousands of students in Ireland who probably do not know.</p></speech>

Alternatively, is it that the student believes he or she is too big and a macho man &ndash; I am not sure what the equivalent term is for women &ndash; and does not need help?  Is it down to confidence or is it because of peer pressure?  Are students worried about what their peers will think of them for looking for help?  Nowadays, people can privately look for help, which is good.  They can talk about it if they go to seek help.  They need the support of other people.  Some people think they do not need the support of other people.</p></speech>

Personally, I would be too stubborn to go for help.  If I managed to get to that stage, I would keep convincing myself that I was okay or whatever.  On another level, I feel like people do not have the confidence to go and look for help.  They are either too embarrassed or they want to deny that they are not okay.  We know it is out there but I do not think it is shown enough that it is out there for people, especially young people.</p></speech>

They think that if they admit it, then they are not okay.  They refuse to think they will ever be okay.  In my opinion, if people get to the stage where they might need help, speaking to somebody, even once, to get it of their chest could make a big difference.  We recommend advertising it more.  It is a big problem on social media that people get shamed for the way they look or dress, or even things they say.  It is all peer pressure.  The confidence level of teenagers nowadays has dropped significantly as a result of social media.</p></speech>

I have spoken to the INTO on this and in recent days I spoke to the clerk to the committee on it as well.  There is a programme running in the south of the UK.  I hope the committee will discuss this in September and visit the UK to look at the programme rolled out there in respect of therapeutic counsellors.  The therapeutic counsellor would be a person who is on-site in primary and post-primary schools so that a student does not have to make a phone call to get help.  For example, a therapeutic counsellor could be in the school in Carnew on Mondays and Tuesdays and in Gorey Community School on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.  It would depend on the size of the school.  This person would be very well known to the students and teachers.</p> <p>  Home-school liaison officers have made an immense difference in schools.  I presume there is a home-school liaison officer in our guests&rsquo; school.  They are there to find out if there are issues back in the home.  The therapeutic counsellors would be on-site in schools.</p><p>Do the witnesses believe something like that would be of assistance to students and that students would be more comfortable in going to talk to someone on-site who they know is there for them and who is fully confidential?</p></speech>

When people know that everything said is confidential and they can get help, it will make a difference.  Still even at that, if you were going to visit them, you would not want anyone to know that you are there.  If I was to visit them, I would not like anyone else to know just in case.  I am not saying you are going to get slagged but you could get slagged because people will wonder why you are there.  If your visit and what was said were completely confidential it would make a big difference in schools.</p></speech>

It would be about getting comfortable and trusting the counsellor more than anything.  As Mr. Rawson said, we now live in an age when you would get slagged for seeking help.  It has reached the stage where you would be teased or slagged.  Boys especially would be considered weak, instead of it being just accepted that they need help.</p></speech>

She is amazing, fantastic and a wonderful support to our students.  To go back to the first issue on bullying and social media, one thing I took from this project is that for the majority of young people, their entire lives revolve around social media.  We very rarely hear a conversation that does not start with, "Did you see that online?" or "She said that online".  Every conversation they have revolves around online media.  When something negative about them is put online, because their world is social media, their world crumbles down.  They do not have the sense of how transient and short-lived things are online that it will blow over in two or three days.  When you are in your world and something bad has been said about you online or a picture or post or whatever it is that has caused someone to go to that dark place, it seems like their entire world has turned against them.  The fact that it will blow over in two or three days and there will be another bikini thing or something to talk about down the line, the young people do not understand that.  Counselling would be of massive assistance to them.</p></speech>

Did they come to the researchers with ideas?  Did the researchers seek their opinions?  Was research done by a questionnaire in the school?</p></speech>

No matter what we needed from the school, they gave help.  Between the radio interview with Ryan Tubridy and the publicity in the school, we were nearly like celebrities walking around for a while.  We went around one day giving out stickers we got from the Young Social Innovators group.  We got balloons and banners.  When we did that, it lightened the mood in school.  On the days when the billboard went up-----</p></speech>

I do not recall that we actually used the library for anything.  We did have many meetings in the library.  Our library space is quite big.  In respect of information, though, we were lucky that we had the Internet at our fingertips.  We used Microsoft Forms for our surveys.  We had 969 students in our school as of September, and the majority of our surveys received 700 or 800 responses and we got them immediately.  From an environmental perspective, there was also no paper trail.  To answer the Chair's question, we did not use the library for research purposes.</p></speech>

Regarding the YSI and programmes North and South, and I know there is a big difference in the respective sizes, how would activity and impact compare in this regard?</p></speech>

We had them involved a few years ago.  Mr. Peak may be better positioned to address this question, but I think Northern Ireland schools have a much tighter curriculum and do not have any space for this kind of work.</p></speech>

Not to put too fine a point on it, transition year is a godsend to us and organisations like ours.  It gives schools the space to undertake these kinds of programmes.  In Northern Ireland, a somewhat similar programme is run by Co-operation Ireland, I believe.  Again, that is very much about citizenship and active citizenship.  What we do, however, is unique because it is about the innovation aspect and the learning that comes with it.  I wish we had a presence in Northern Ireland because young people there would really benefit from the programme.  We talked about uncertain and precarious futures and there is definitely a cohort of young people in that category.  We need support on the ground.  We need somebody in Northern Ireland to help us out, help us to navigate the school curriculum and identify where this programme would be best positioned.  It could be that it would fit in with what in Northern Ireland is called key stage 3, which would be similar to the junior cycle here.  We have not given up and I am sure there are opportunities.</p></speech>

We cut across the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Department of Education.  The latter Department, through the Dormant Accounts Fund, is trying to help us to scale up the programme and introduce it in more post-primary schools.  We also see an important role for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in the youth participation sphere.  Additionally, the Department of Rural and Community Development is a major player and supporter for us because of the generation of the voluntary effort among young people in particular.  That is a very important in the context of the national strategy on volunteering as it gets young people involved.  Much of the time, their involvement and work as volunteers are not captured.  It is important for us that those young people begin to get recognition for the voluntary work they are doing.</p></speech>

I also thank the students in the Gallery, including Adam Jordan, Molly Hynes, Chloe Cullen and Hannah Mulroe.  I thank them all very much.  Darragh and Annie did the speaking, but I know all the students played their part.</p><p>They were all influential in the programme and in the research.  I thank the principal, Ms Linda Dunne.  When I took the chair of this committee, I made a commitment to have as much student interaction as possible.  Students as young as 14 years of age have appeared.  With the agreement of all the members, for the first time ever, students have been very much a part and parcel of the committee's work.  We have engaged with students from throughout the island of Ireland.  It is very important the student voice is heard.  I thank them for coming before the committee today.  It has been very interesting and enlightening to meet them all.  In particular, I commend the students on their interaction today and on having the confidence to appear before the committee.  They should be very proud of themselves.  I know the teachers have had a huge influence over the students being here today and being prepared but, more importantly, so too do their parents.  Having support from home is hugely important.  They are a credit to their parents, teachers and, more importantly, to their school.  They have done a fantastic job of work.</p><p> My thanks also to Ms Collier and Mr. Peak from YSI and to Mr. Fitzpatrick who was unable to attend today.</p></speech>

It is lovely to have Young Social Innovators students from Col&aacute;iste Br&iacute;de here.</p> <p>  I absolutely understand and fully appreciate Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's motivation in bringing forward this Bill.  Equally, however, I am very conscious that schools have put a considerable amount of work, time, effort and energy into developing the new school admission policies, which have taken root in our schools only in the past academic year.  A key feature of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act is that where schools are not oversubscribed, they must accept all applicants.  The vast majority of our schools are not oversubscribed.  Equally, schools have the opportunity to opt out of the provision.  My view is that there is insufficient evidence available to us at this point to indicate that the provision this Bill proposes to delete poses difficulties for those seeking admission to schools where it is in use.  I note also that the pre-legislative scrutiny report of the committee recommends not only deletion but also the setting up of an expert group.  I believe that the establishment of an expert group to review the impact of the provision of the Act would be a useful first step.  I consider that a reasonable approach.  I therefore signal my intention to table on Report Stage an amendment to the Deputy's Bill which will establish an expert group to examine the impact of subsection 62(10)(b) on school admissions and provide a report detailing the expert group's findings.</p></speech>

It flies completely in the face of what the Minister is trying to do this week in respect of section 37A of the Education Act.  We are told to rush through legislation this week in order for it to be ready for September, yet we are told that schools cannot change their admissions policies for this September or even the following September.  The Minister tells me there is no evidence this provision has any effect.  Why is it there, then?  The very basis of the argument is that if even one child is disadvantaged by the provision, it needs to go.  I am blue in the face making the same argument over and over again but I will make it again.  This provision was inserted at the behest of those who are trying unfairly to keep an elitist bloodline running through certain schools' admissions policies, from grandfather to father to son or from grandmother to mother to daughter.  It is patently unfair on, for example, children of early school leavers, children whose parents are not from the area and, indeed, children whose parents are not from Ireland.  We can say all we want about Ukrainian students in this State, but I ask the Minister to imagine if even one Ukrainian was not able to access a second level school place on the basis of this provision because there are greater rights for those whose parents or grandparents went to the school in question.  The lack of energy or understanding on the part of the Department on this baffles me because there is no argument against what I and the committee and people such as Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, who supported this Bill, are trying to achieve.  This provision should not have been put into law in the first place; it should not still be there.  I ask the Minister to imagine even one family in this State saying in years to come: "We had hoped our child might be admitted to second level school A, but it was not possible because my parents did not go to school."  In a Republic, it should make us all deeply ashamed that such a provision exists.</p> <p>  I remember the previous debate we had on this in the D&aacute;il.  I walked into the Chamber and was excited as to what the Minister might provide.  I remember my first contribution being to the effect that I hoped she had come to the table with some level of understanding as to how we could collectively work together.  I was crushed by her presentation because I believe in these Houses of the Oireachtas and I believe there is no opposition, really, to what we are trying to achieve here.</p><p>Education is everything.  It is all that has benefited some families to break out of poverty.  Education is the only opportunity unless one's parents have money.  This is why it is so emotivel and so important.</p><p> I would ask the Minister to reconsider her position and the Department's position on this.  The Minister could easily row in behind this.  The provision could easily be deleted.  Every school in the country only has to change its enrolment policies for September 2023.  It is as simple as that.  One no longer gets to choose a child whose parents or grandparents went to this school over some other child.  It is as simple as that.</p><p> It is having an effect in areas that I represent or on parents who come to me from all over the country.  It is patently wrong and patently unfair.  The argument that we cannot be sure how many people are affected by it does not stack up.  It should not be there and it needs to go.</p><p> In summary, I have been leading this process.  I was delighted to be in the position to bring it forward.  The Department told me that the Minister would delay Second Stage for 12 months in order to do all the groundwork that needed to be done and I waited patiently from November 2020 to November 2021.  The Minister knows that is true.  We delayed the passing of Second Stage for 12 months.  We are in a position where the Minister comes back to this table and I am patiently waiting here for this Bill to be passed, but we want more reviews and we want to see how schools can have a number of admissions cycles to work through it.  What the Minister is doing is wrong.  The Minister knows it is wrong.  The Department knows its wrong.  I do not know what lobby group has such a hold over the Department that this needs to stay.  I can imagine who they are.</p><p> On this issue, the Minister needs to change her position.  The Minister needs to row in behind the Bill.  This section of the Act needs to be deleted.  We could all go back to normal and look children in the eye in September 2023 and say that it does not matter who one's parents or grandparents are.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.494" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2022062800002#B00200"><p>I reiterate my support for this legislation.  I commend Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in on his work in relation to it.</p> <p>  We had pre-legislative scrutiny of this legislation.  There is no coherent argument against it.  There is no argument that ultimately holds any water.</p> <p>  On the argument around most of the schools being undersubscribed, the problem, as with anything, in relation to admissions and who is admitted will only arise when a school is oversubscribed.  It is for that reason we have regulations as such.  It is for that reason we have admissions policies.  If no school was oversubscribed, we would not need admissions policies at all and every child would simply have a place.</p> <p>  The circumstances in which this applies - maybe in most schools it is not an issue because they are not oversubscribed - arise in the schools which are oversubscribed.  There are parts of the country where there is severe competition for school places in areas where there is a large young population.  In parts of Cork, much of Dublin, Kildare, parts of Wicklow and parts of County Meath there is a significant young population.  In those places, what the current legislation allows for is that where there are a limited number of places and there is a decision to be made between a child who lives 15 miles away but whose father or mother attended the school and a child who lives five doors away, it is the child who lives 15 miles away who will be preferred.  That is objectively true under the current proposal.  It provides that a school takes up the scope and the powers that it has to put in place such an admissions policy.  That being the case, that is the child who will be preferred.  That should not be acceptable to us in any way.</p> <p>  It is perfectly reasonable, in terms of families and their arrangements, etc., that preference is given to siblings.  That is a reasonable proposition, but in relation to parents, and even grandparents, one is potentially disadvantaging the local child.  It is the local child who should be at the centre of any decisions made on admissions.  Every child should be in a position to attend his or her local school provided that there are adequate spaces and if there are not, decisions about who gets in need to be made on a fair basis.  It is not a fair basis to prioritise those whose parents or grandparents attended.  One will continue to have a school tradition because many families will still live in the local community and many children will attend the school their parents and grandparents attended; the traditions, the culture and the history of the school can continue in that way, but it should not be at the expense of the child who lives five doors away from the school.</p></speech>

I clearly hear the points the Deputies are making and I acknowledge the good faith in which they make those arguments.  I also acknowledge that it has always been my intention to work to the best of my capacity and ability with the Deputies here.  I am appreciative of the manner in which the Deputies work with me.</p> <p>  On this, I would have to say that there is a body of work to be done in terms of gathering the data.  It was a recommendation of the pre-legislative scrutiny report from the committee that an expert group  be established to review the impact of the provision and that is a useful first step.  I am cognisant of the amount of work that goes in when a school has to devise a new admissions policy, which was done, in fairness, by the schools and has been enacted since September 2021, which means this was the first academic year for that admissions policy to take root.</p> <p>  I am simply asking that we would allow sufficient time for the expert group to meet, for it to have an opportunity to review the cycle of admissions over a period of time, to present that back, and then we will make an informed and adjudicated decision as to how to move forward.  That is all I am asking for.  I am not taking away from the genuine nature of the arguments and proposals the Deputies make.  I am simply saying that it is important that a fully informed factual account is presented to the Department by this expert group so that an appropriate decision can be made.  It may well be the decision that the Deputies were advocating for but it is important that the evidence be allowed to be put forward.</p> <p>  It is my proposal that we allow time for the expert group to be established and that the group would specifically examine the impact of the section on school admissions and provide a report detailing the group's findings.</p></speech>

I welcome the Chair of the Committee, Mr. Oleksandr Merezhko along with the Deputy Chair, Ms Maryna Bardina, and their colleagues.  I also welcome the ambassador, H.E. Ms Larysa Gerasko, ambassador of Ukraine to Ireland, in the Gallery.  She is most welcome.  The format of the meeting is in the usual manner.  We will hear any opening statements the witnesses wish to make, followed by discussion with questions and answers with the members of the committee.  I ask members to be concise in their questions to allow all members the opportunity to participate.  There will be a second opportunity for members to come back in should they so desire.</p> <p>  Witnesses and members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make that person in any way identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity.  Therefore, if statements are in any way potentially defamatory in respect to any entity or person, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that any such direction be complied with.</p> <p>  For witnesses attending remotely outside of our Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present might.  Members are also reminded that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex, that is, in offices or here in the committee chamber.</p> <p>  I now call on Mr. Merezhko to make his opening statement. </p></speech>

I recall with great warmth the visit here recently, which was friendly and warm.  I appreciate that the colleagues of committee members came to support us in our darkest hour.  The situation in Ukraine is very difficult.  We continue our struggle despite the fact that on the ground we are outgunned and outnumbered by the evil empire, Russia, which is trying to destroy us.  Russia's ultimate goal is to erase Ukraine from the political map.</p> <p>  I also wish to express my deepest gratitude to members and their colleagues for Ireland's support for Ukraine's candidacy for the European Union.  To us, Ireland plays the role of advocate, strong supporter and ally.  We really appreciate Ireland's help and support.  We feel it.  When the Irish representatives came to Kyiv. they mentioned the phrase by the American President John F. Kennedy who, in 1963 addressed the Irish Parliament and said that countries should not be neutral when there is a struggle between liberty and tyranny.  I see that Ireland is not neutral.  Ireland is on the side of liberty, freedom, and understands that Ukraine nowadays is defending not only itself but the freedom and democracy of all of Europe.  Russia openly states that it is waging war not only against Ukraine but against the West.  For instance Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said this openly.  Russia perceives this aggressive war as a war against the whole of Western civilisation and democracy.  Russia is waging war in the territory of Ukraine but at the same time, it is waging war in a hybrid manner against all democratic states of Europe and global democracies.  I would like to thank Ireland again for its support of our EU candidacy because it is extremely important for us.  For us it is also a matter of our security.  We made a choice to become part of the European Union and we are paying a very heavy price.</p><p>We have already paid a heavy price.  Russia wants to subjugate Ukraine because we want to be part of the European Union.  It is one of the primary reasons for the war raged by Russia against Ukraine.  We want to be part of Europe.  I ask Ireland to continue to be our advocate and supporter on our road to fully fledged membership of the European Union.  I understand it might be a difficult road.  We are committed to reforms and we are conducting reforms in Ukraine.  We are conducting them in the very difficult conditions of war.  You can imagine how difficult it is to conduct economic and political reform when you are fighting for your survival, struggling to survive.  Nevertheless this is what we are doing and we hope you can help us make this way to membership as short as possible.  It will help us a lot and I am sure it will allow us to defend ourselves more effectively and to stop Russian aggression.  Being a part of the European Union, being part of this space of freedom, democracy, economic development and prosperity will help because behind each member state is the collective force of the full Union.  There is collective solidarity and this is one of the reasons why we want to join the European Union as soon as possible.  I ask you to please continue to support us.</p><p> The second thing I would like to mention is that two days ago, Russia hit a civilian residential area in Kyiv, which is not far from where I am.  I was awoken by the sound of explosions at 6 a.m. and then I started to count the explosions. There was a very strong second explosion and then a third and a fourth.  Later, I realised from the news that there were people injured and one person killed in the residential house hit by Russians.  This house is basically on the same street as I live on, downtown and very close to my place.  Yesterday we had another horrendous, disgraceful and absolutely inhumane act of state terror when Russian missiles hit a shopping mall in Kremenchuk.  We are still counting the dead.  We already know several dozen people were killed and many, including children, were injured.  I would like to mention that since 24 February, Russian forces have already killed 340 children.  This means that each day since then, Russia has killed several Ukrainian children.  This horror can not be described in words.  I ask your Parliament to adopt a resolution to recognise Russia as a terrorist state.  Russia is not waging war against the Ukrainian army, it is waging war against the Ukrainian civilian population.  It is deliberately targeting civilian objects and civilians and this is happening every day.  According to the office of our general prosecutor, Russia commits several thousand war crimes every day.  Russia not only commits crimes like war crimes and crimes against humanity, but general overarching crime which also includes genocide against Ukraine.  We are grateful for recognition of Russian crimes as genocide.  It is important because it is the truth and it should be known all over the world.  In the near future, the State Department in the United States will decide on whether to recognise Russia as a sponsor of terrorism.  It is important in terms of sanctions and I ask my Irish colleagues and friends to support and to help to persuade our American friends to do this as soon as possible.</p><p> My final point is that we need to continue to make sanctions tougher in order to stop Russian aggression.  We also need to introduce so-called secondary sanctions against those countries which are trying to help Russia right now to avoid sanctions.  I ask that Ireland continues to support us.  I thank the committee members for their attention.</p></speech>

We are very sorry for what is going on in his country at the moment and we totally recognise the reality of the situation.  I take his views on board in relation to recognising Russia as a terrorist state and applying pressure and greater advocacy in relation to classifying it as sponsor of state terrorism as well.  I appreciate those comments.  It is great to get some specific requests from Ukraine.</p> <p>  I have two questions to ask.  The first is in relation to weapons and ammunition.  I note that Ireland is not providing any weapons and ammunition yet.  Were weapons and ammunition to be provided from Ireland, is this something that Mr. Merezhko would welcome?  </p> <p>  Second, in relation to Ukrainian grain in Odesa and in the ports, what are Mr. Merezhko's views on establishing a safe corridor through the Black Sea that could be secured by international community warships to ensure freighters could come in, pick up the grain and distribute it around the world.  </p> <p>  The third question is to ask how he sees this situation playing out for the rest of the year, particularly in the next few months?  Where does he see the conflict in October, for instance?</p></speech>

Our top priority right now to survive is weapons.  We need heavy weapons, especially multiple launch rocket systems, MLRS, high mobility artillery rocket systems, HIMARS, and long-range artillery.  It is crucial because we are outgunned and outnumbered by Russia, which uses heavy artillery.  Russia uses jets first, then heavy shelling, bombardments by artillery, then mortars, then tanks and only after that does it use infantry.</p> <p>The Russian technique is to completely destroy everything in front of their troops by using artillery and then they move in.  They move in gradually, sometimes they might move 1 km or 2 km but it is a tactic of total destruction.  This is also about our casualties, of course.  We need to help our soldiers to survive and our civilians, who are also being targeted.  This is why we desperately need heavy weaponry.  I understand there are countries which might not have what we need but we appreciate every effort, including financial support, which allows us to obtain heavy weaponry.  As far as I know, we have only 10% of what we need right now.  We need to reach parity in terms of heavy weaponry with Russia.  Otherwise, we will have many casualties.  </p> <p>  Grain is another serious problem because Russia is blackmailing the world.</p><p>It is trying to take hostage the whole Continent and the many countries that depend on food, grain and wheat produced in Ukraine.  As we know, Ukraine is one of the bread baskets of the world.  Russia is doing this deliberately.  It is deliberately blockading our ports and is not allowing our grain to be exported.  Russia and Putin understand that their approach allows them to blackmail the whole world and to demand the lifting of sanctions.  On the other hand, Russia is using that approach to economically destroy Ukraine.  What is the way out of this difficult situation?  I do not know right now.  I know that we are considering several options.  One is de-blockading our ports and escorting-----</p></speech>

However, we should be very careful about that approach because Russia is deliberately targeting our civilian infrastructure.  That might create problems.  We should do everything we can because it is a matter of the food security of the whole world.  This crime does not have a name but it is considered to be a serious war crime.</p> <p>  Russia has done this before in the history of Ukraine.  There was the Holodomor of the 1930s - the great famine in Ukraine.  Ireland understands well the meaning of a great famine.  Russia has already used these tactics to stifle any opposition in Ukraine and to destroy the Ukrainian population.  Russia is continuing to do it.  It is stealing our grain in the occupied territories.  It is trying to sell in the market this stolen Ukrainian grain.  It is trying to create another great famine for Ukraine and for the whole world.  That is why we see the continuous pattern of Russian criminal behaviour against Ukraine and the whole world.  Russia's criminal pattern continues.</p> <p>  What might the situation be in two or three months?  The next weeks and months might be crucial.  It is difficult for our army to hold out and to continue to defend us because it is hair-raising.  It has been truly heroic defence.  Of course, it is difficult to keep defending when there are casualties and brutal shelling, and when your enemy has superiority in its heavy weaponry and number of personnel.  The committee can imagine how difficult it is.  We count on our resistance every day, and every day is an heroic day for Ukrainians.  I am sure that Russians will never be able to occupy most of the territory of Ukraine for a very simple reason, that is, we are defending our homes and families.  We have no choice.  Surrender is not an option for us.  We should defend no matter what, and we are doing so.  However, it is difficult and without the support of the civilised democratic world, it will be very difficult.</p> <p>  I hope that in two months' time Russia will be exhausted.  We can already see certain signs of that.  It has defaulted on its debt, for example.  If we get what we were promised in heavy weaponry, the situation might change crucially.  In some areas, despite the preponderance of the Russian military, our army continues to find success in counterattacks and counteroffensives against Russian troops and is liberating our territory.  Of course, the committee will understand that to fight against an enemy that has such a preponderance of military personnel is extremely difficult.  That is why it is difficult for me to foresee what the situation will be in two months.</p> <p>  I am certain of one thing, which is, we will never surrender.  Russia will not be able to take over big Ukrainian cities such as Kharkiv, Odessa and Kyiv.  The Russians were defeated in Kyiv and Kharkiv.  These cities are like bastions.  They will never be taken or occupied by Russia.  At the same time, the situation is very dangerous.  We keep fighting.  I am sure that, strategically, Putin has already lost.  It is a matter of time until Ukraine will emerge victorious but to do that and to save lives, we need help.</p></speech>

I am sure life in Ukraine is anything but pleasant at the moment.  He made the point that Ukraine is fighting the war of the West.  I sometimes wonder if Ukrainians feel they are left isolated with lots of promises that do not necessarily manifest themselves in hardware on the ground, for want of a better phrase.  My colleague, Deputy Berry, spoke about weapons.  It is a matter of some concern to me that we have weapons here that we could send to Ukraine, a fellow neutral country, if we want to claim the neutrality tag.  Neutrality did not do much for the Ukrainians when Putin decided to attack.</p> <p>  I am wondering about a few things other than weapons that we might be able to send.  Vehicles, for example, might be an option.  I understand Ukraine is having difficulty in moving people around the place now so vehicles would be, I assume, important.  I and my colleague, Deputy Barry, have often spoken about the fact that we have a number of naval ships that are about to decommissioned.  We do not think they are necessarily suitable for the Black Sea but we believe they would be suitable for Ukrainian naval crews to maintain their skills and train on.  We wonder if they would be of any value.</p> <p>  With infrastructure being destroyed throughout, in particular, eastern and southern Ukraine, how is Ukraine's stock of Bailey bridges and the like in order to replace bridges that have been taken out?  Does Ukraine have Bailey bridges, or similar bridges that can be quickly erected, available?</p> <p>  I watched a piece on television in Ireland last night.  The commentator, who was speaking on behalf of Ukraine, was a commander on the ground.  He was explaining that many of his experienced soldiers, men and women, had been wounded or fatally wounded, and that he was now using what might be regarded as the second line reserve, who are not as professional as the soldiers he has had under his command for many years.  Is Ukraine experiencing difficulty with respect to the loss of life of its best qualified?  There were many questions there.</p></speech>

I will invite Mr. Merezhko to respond in a moment.  I want to point out that as a committee we can recommend certain things to the Government but we cannot promise to make decisions.  We can make recommendations.  I want to make that clear.  Mr. Merezhko can take the floor and respond to the Senator's points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.517" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Oleksandr Merezhko" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2022062800002#D00600"><p>The Senator asked about promises that have been made.  One of our colleagues from Ireland who recently visited Kyiv used very wise words.  He said that words are empty and that what really matters are deeds.  I understand that the Russian war against Ukraine has shown us who are our true friends and who are unreliable or sometimes reluctant partners.  There are states, unfortunately, which could be true European leaders and provide us with all necessary help but they are not doing it or they are dragging their feet on the delivery of supplies by making promises.</p><p>To tell the truth, I am bitterly disappointed in these big countries, unfortunately.  They have damaged their own credibility by promising to do something.  Maybe they do not want to understand that each day of our resistance costs us lots of lives of our soldiers and civilians.  Each day of delay is translated into terrible grief for the families of the people of our soldiers who were killed or injured.  This makes it a very emotional and painful issue to me.</p><p> On the other hand, there are countries such as the United States which proved to be a reliable friend and partner.  It understands our situation and delivered weapons within one day.  They help us.  The countries which support us wholeheartedly are not countries who need to be persuaded and where military aid has to be squeezed out of them.  They are countries who have come to us and asked us "What can we do for you?"  Among these countries is the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and Ireland.  These are our reliable friends.</p><p> Unfortunately, sometimes other countries are hesitant or less than enthusiastic, if I might put it that way.  There are countries that can do a lot and which can really help us.  They have the capabilities, economic and militarily, but for some reason they do not.  I do not know how to explain this.  Maybe there are politicians in those countries who are not eager to provide us with military help in the hope Russia will break us and we will have to agree to the ultimatum and demands of Russia and the governments will return to business as usual with Russia.  They will continue to buy Russian gas and Russian oil.  Maybe Russia has politicians in those countries and maybe they are influential enough, unfortunately.</p><p> On neutrality, I quoted Kennedy.  I heard a phrase from one of the Irish colleagues that there is no neutrality in the face of struggle between evil and freedom.  When you give weapons to a victim of aggression and help to defend the victim of aggression, it is a very noble thing.  This is what humanity and conscience is about.  There can be no neutrality.  When you see a hooligan killing an innocent person, there should not be any neutrality.  The committee will excuse me for using this metaphor, but in international relations it also happens.</p><p> On vehicles and ships, one of my colleagues was in the United States talking to one of the governors.  They asked what they should ask the Government for to help the Ukraine army.  I sent the message to my colleague who is more knowledgeable.  He gave me a simple, one-word answer to what the army needed: everything.  It is true.  We are grateful for every kind of help and support.  It means a lot to us because we are in a situation where everything can be helpful to withstand this enormous pressure of Russian aggression.  Of course, we are grateful for every kind of support.</p><p> On bridges, I am not knowledgeable for these kinds of things but I live in Kyiv and I have spent all these days there from the 24th.  Especially at the beginning, my concern was that the bridges were blown up around Kyiv and I was afraid of a blockade and that the city might be starved to death.  But then the bridges were restored very quickly.  I am not a specialist or an engineer but I saw they were restored very quickly, perhaps with makeshift bridges.  We need these kinds of temporary bridges which help us bring food, necessary resources and so on.</p><p> On how we are coping with the loss of lives, it is a problem.  When you are fighting against the second biggest army in the world, the best and most experienced soldiers sometimes have to sacrifice their lives.  It is a problem for us.  Every person to lose their life is a huge tragedy, not only for the family and loved ones but also for the whole country.  Yesterday, the shopping mall was hit.  Watching the footage was really heartbreaking.  We have to live in this.  We are peaceful people and we want this war to end as soon as possible but there are certain red lines.  The problem is at what cost.  For us, the red lines are our territorial integrity, our freedom and our right to choose to be part of the European family.  It is also about our security.  What can stop the war and prevent future loss of life?  Only heavy weapons.  Heavy weaponry is the best kind of humanitarian aid.  For us it is also a humanitarian issue.  Putin only understands a language of strength.  The more we are protected and the more heavy weaponry we have, the more effectively we defend ourselves and the fewer casualties there will be.</p></speech>

I hear what he says about the tragedy of any life being a loss.  As a father of four young sons myself, I can only feel for the sorrow and anguish of many families and parents who have lost young people in the war and then the other citizens who are suffering.  It is important we keep this message to the fore because sometimes it is inclined to slip back.  We have seen the attacks in recent days in Kyiv, in the shopping centre, which Mr. Merezhko brought to our attention.  We will keep in contact with Mr. Merezhko, with the ambassador, and we will continue to do what we can at UN and EU levels to support the sanctions and the other actions for which Ukraine has called.  We will continue to send humanitarian aid to Ukraine and non-lethal weaponry and support.  I thank Mr. Merezhko and his colleagues for their time this afternoon and the ambassador for being here.</p></speech>

I thank the members for the invitation to meet with the joint sub-committee to provide an update on the Linn Dara CAMHS service.  I am joined by my colleagues, Brendan Doody, Mary O'Kelly and Kevin Brady.</p> <p>  I will provide an overview of the HSE Linn Dara service.  CAMHS provides specialist mental health service to those aged up to 18 years, who have reached the threshold for a diagnosis of moderate to severe mental health disorder that requires the input of a consultant-led multidisciplinary mental health team.  CAMHS inpatient units offer assessment and treatment to children and adolescents up to the age of 18, with severe and often complex mental health difficulties.  For those aged over 18, general adult community teams and inpatient units provide these services.  Approximately 2% of the under-18 population will require a CAMHS intervention at any given time.</p> <p>  Linn Dara CAMHS in Dublin south, Kildare and west Wicklow provides the following services: community mental health teams; a community eating disorder service; Linn Dara approved centre, inpatient unit; ADMiRE-ADHD pathway; consultation and liaison psychiatry at the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght; and two mental health intellectual disability teams for mental health of intellectual disability services.</p> <p>  In line with the HSE CAMHS operational guide 2019, the Linn Dara approved centre provides acute, emergency and specialist inpatient child and adolescent mental health services and treatment on a tertiary basis for children and adolescents with severe and complex mental illness.  The approved centre is registered, regulated and inspected by the Mental Health Commission and subject to regulatory inspection in relation to care and treatment, facilities and premises, staffing and governance.</p> <p>  The Linn Dara approved centre is a 24-bedded unit, which is configured into three wards - Rowan, Oak and Hazel.  The Rowan and Hazel wards both consist of 11 individual beds and the Oak ward has two beds, which provide high dependency and care.  The Linn Dara approved centre provides services on a regional and national remit.  Our primary catchment area is community healthcare organisations 6, 7 and 8.  Linn Dara also works with the other specialist inpatient mental health services to provide services on a national basis as the need arises and where clinically appropriate.  The 24 beds in the Linn Dara approved centre are as follows: two high-dependency CAMHS beds, eight specialist eating disorder CAMHS beds and 14 acute or emergency CAMHS beds.</p> <p>  The Linn Dara approved centre provides eight specialist eating disorder beds, SEDBs, to level 4 care and treatment for children and adolescents with severe and complex eating disorders.  Level 4 in the HSE model of care for eating disorders is classified as the most intensive treatment setting.</p> <p>  I will outline the service developments at Linn Dara CAMHS.  The Linn Dara community eating disorder service was officially launched in September 2019.</p><p>It was the first Irish community-based dedicated eating disorder service for children and young people under the age of 18.  The team operates at levels 2, 3 and 4 of the stepped model of care, providing specialised outpatient, day patient care and support to people with eating disorders with an enhanced range of treatment options.</p><p> The ADMiRE ADHD pathway, which stands for assessment, diagnosis, management initiation, research and education, is the first public specialist service for children and adolescents with ADHD in Ireland.  Set up in September 2018 in south Dublin Linn Dara CAMHS, the primary goal was to reduce waiting times and provide early access to evidence-based assessment and management for young people with ADHD.</p><p> On the Kildare and west Wicklow community CAMHS team, in 2021 Linn Dara established a new community CAMHS team based in the Athy primary care centre serving south Kildare and south-west Wicklow, bringing the number of community CAMHS teams in Kildare and west Wicklow to a total of five.  Linn Dara has also established two specialist teams to deliver specialist mental health service to the mental health intellectual disability, MHID, community across the CHO and continues to develop this service through the national clinical programme.</p><p> Regarding new development posts, building on existing services and investments in CAMHS, in 2022 Linn Dara was allocated an additional &euro;950,000 to recruit nine new additional posts across the service, with recruitment currently ongoing.  These posts were targeted at the further development of the ADMiRE ADHD team and the community teams in Kildare and west Wicklow.</p><p> There are challenges in this area.  The Linn Dara approved centre treats complex and high-dependency cases that require intensive input from experienced and specialist staff.  Nursing posts account for more than 75% of the multidisciplinary staffing complement of an inpatient service.  The ability of the service to provide the necessary standards of quality care on a sustainable basis for patients over a 24-7 cycle depends on the necessary nursing staffing being in place.  Unfortunately, due to the level of current and projected core HSE nursing staff vacancies, the service was left with no choice but to reduce the number of operational beds on a temporary basis.  Extensive efforts continue, both nationally and internationally, to recruit nurses to these vacant posts.  This temporary reduction in bed capacity is being done strictly on the basis that the beds that will remain operational are available with a safe and sustainable staffing ratio, on a 24-7 basis.</p><p> Post Covid, there has been an increase in referrals to both to community and inpatient services within CAMHS.  Such an increase in referrals will have an impact on the level of service delivery, with the likelihood of increased waiting lists.  The response of CAMHS to the public health emergency has brought about some benefits, such as a rapid adoption and effective use of telehealth and video-enabled care.  It also created a public discourse about the importance of mental health to personal and societal well-being, thereby strengthening the case for continued investment in CAMHS and service developments to meet these increasing demands.</p><p> Since opening in December 2015, Linn Dara has continued to develop a number of services, as I have outlined, using models of care supported by clinical evidence through the national clinical programmes.  Notwithstanding the improvements, we are very aware of the continued need to further develop services and deal with identified challenges, including staffing vacancies, which impact on service delivery.  We will continue to work with all stakeholders in this regard.</p></speech>

The Senator referred to the south Kerry CAMHS situation.  Since then, as members are probably aware, we have initiated a number of reviews.</p><p>The Mental Health Commission is engaged in an audit of the 73 CAMHS teams and has been in two of the community healthcare organisations, CHOs.  We are working with them on that.  A medication audit has also commenced, with a pilot undertaken in four of our teams across the country.  That is feeding into the wider audit that is happening over the next six months.  We have two further initiatives ongoing, one of which is a stakeholder review that we have been running with University College Cork, UCC.  The second is a review of the CAMHS operating guidelines.  All of the teams have been asked for information, including Linn Dara community CAMHS.  In summary, we have been engaging with the internal reviews as well as the review being conducted by the Mental Health Commission.</p></speech>

It is important that there be turnover.  The Senator asked about waiting times for admission to the unit.  If we break down the 153 admissions, 22% - 34 young people - were admitted on the same day of referral, a total of 56% were admitted within two days of referral and more than 70% were admitted within six days.  The majority of young people who are admitted are admitted in a timely manner, although we have young people waiting longer than that for a bed.  The group who are usually waiting longer are primarily those with specific eating disorders.  There is not as quick a turnover in our eight specialist eating disorder beds as there is in our other beds, so young people sometimes have to wait longer to be admitted to those.  Just 10% of our admissions waited more than three weeks to be admitted.</p></speech>

Does Dr. Doody find that Linn Dara does not see young people again after they have been treated in and discharged from the eating disorder unit in particular or are there repeat presentations?</p><p>What would the figures be for that?</p></speech>

If you take 2019 for example, our specialist community eating disorder team had 47 referrals and in 2021 it had 197.  There has been a huge increase in the number of people presenting with eating disorders specifically.  The vast majority of eating disorders are treated in the community and a small number will require inpatient admission.  As one would expect, one of the reasons for inpatient admission is that treatment in the community has not been effective.  Young people who are admitted will be admitted because they require the treatment package that can be delivered in an inpatient setting.  Some young people will re-present, given the severity of their conditions.  The children who will be admitted are more likely to have severe and chronic disorders.  A proportion will be readmitted but the majority of our admissions will be one-off admissions.</p> <p>  Inpatient services are dependent on the availability of community services to provide that level of intensive input at community level.  We are fortunate at Linn Dara that we have developed the specialist community eating disorder service, which is on the Cherry Orchard campus.  We work closely with that service and we transition young people.  When there are services in the community, readmission will be less likely.</p></speech>

It is difficult to put it down to one factor.  In recent years we have seen an upward trend in young people presenting with eating disorders and we have seen that they are presenting at an earlier age.  We also noted that the pandemic accelerated this increase.  There was an upward trajectory and we would feel that if you look at our referrals there is a correlation.  We have looked at referrals to the inpatient unit and in admissions and we definitely saw a Covid pandemic affect.  The impact of the Covid pandemic on the mental health and well-being of young people was negative and we saw an increase in a range of disorders, particularly anxiety-type disorders.  On that spectrum we also saw an increase in eating disorders.  That is not just something that we have seen in this country but internationally we have seen a huge surge in demand for services for young people with eating disorders.</p></speech>

I refer to family supports.  Does Linn Dara have any family support programme for its inpatients and for the people it engages with?</p></speech>

Working with the family is key because the goal after the admission of any young person into an inpatient unit, from the day they arrive, is to plan for their discharge.  Part of that involves working with the young person and another part of that involves working with parents.  We actively involve families and we work with parents.  Through our multidisciplinary team, which includes family therapists, there is a strong focus on families and on working with families.  Within the unit there is education as well and there is a school linked to the unit.  That is about young people and it prepares them for returning home and going back to what young people do, which is attending school and being at home.  Everything is geared towards working with families and working towards discharge.  You work with the young person and the family at the same time.  The families are part of that process.</p></speech>

It is hoped that in the autumn the committee may have representatives of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, before it to talk about what they are doing, their mental health programme and how they can support the work Linn Dara does.</p> <p>  Finally, there is the issue of aftercare.  Does Linn Dara have aftercare or is it at such a level that aftercare is under a different ambit?</p></speech>

Linn Dara community services have a remit for south Dublin, south-west Dublin, Kildare and west Wicklow, whereas we will admit young people from our primary catchment area, which extends from all of County Dublin across Kildare and Wicklow and into the midlands.  We also take young people under the age of 18 years from north Leinster, Cavan and Monaghan.  When a young person is being admitted, part of the discharge planning is working and planning with the community team with regard to the supports the young person and his or her family will need post discharge.  We are working with community teams across all these counties.  In some cases, for example, where the young person is attending a specialist eating disorder service or a community one, we are working with whatever team the person is engaged with in the community.  We work with them and part of the discharge planning is planning for the package of supports that the young person will need following discharge.  In other words, if the person is going back to a Linn Dara service, it is within our service remit.  Again, however, we are taking children from a much broader area and from other services.</p></speech>

Is there an ask, essentially?</p></speech>

There is a particular pressure in staffing, which my colleagues can also discuss, with regard to the provision of nursing.  As we said, more than 75% of the multidisciplinary staffing in an inpatient setting is nursing staff.  In other words, for us to be able to continue to provide that service, and it is a very specialist inpatient service, we must have adequate staffing.  From an inpatient perspective, our ask is to look at what the fixes are with regard to being able to provide adequate nursing for the inpatient service.  That is probably a much broader question.  Some of the things are within our control and some of them are outside our control.</p> <p>  One difficulty has been that as we develop services in the community, and we talked about developing our community specialist eating disorder service, developing our additional community team in Kildare-west Wicklow and developing our ADHD ADMiRE pathway, often one is pulling from a small resource to begin with.  In other words, staff, rather than leaving the service, are moving to other opportunities within the service.  As we develop services, the ask is for the workforce planning to match that so we can be assured that we have the staff in place to fill these services, rather than taking staff from other services.</p></speech>

It is great to put a face to some of the names because I see a lot of the people mentioned in the replies I receive to parliamentary questions.  I thank them for all the responses I have been receiving from them during my time in the Oireachtas.  I know the decision to close the beds in Linn Dara was not taken lightly.  I thank the staff who work in CAMHS and other front-line mental health services.  I had the privilege of meeting Ms O'Kelly in the primary healthcare centre in Tallaght recently as well as the staff there.  I found them absolutely brilliant and very passionate about the work they do.  Sometimes I am critical but I do not want that to be seen as critical towards staff or even to the witnesses.  I also pay tribute to the nursing staff who are on the front line of all this.</p> <p>  However, the reality is that the decision to close 11 inpatient beds in Linn Dara is another abject failure of the Government to address children's mental health services.  According to the latest figures I have, there are 308 admissions of children into CAMHS.</p><p>Of those 308 admissions, 138 went to Linn Dara, which seems to be the primary place for inpatient admissions.  There are only 53 beds throughout the State at present.  A reply I received to a parliamentary question on 16 June indicated Linn Dara went down from 24 to 13 beds, St. Vincent's dropped from 12 beds to ten and Merlin Park in Galway has been reduced from 20 to 14 beds.  The only unit that had no change is Eist Linn in Cork.  The reductions seem to be almost right across the board.  We have heard from stakeholders and parents who are all very concerned that this closure of beds could lead to a further decrease in the services children get.  It could also lead to the placement of children in adult psychiatric facilities, which is another concern they have.</p><p> To return specifically to Linn Dara, this is the second time in five years this has happened.  The last time beds were closed in a similar situation was 2017.  What lessons have been learned?  What is being done differently this time?</p></speech>

It is much appreciated.  He is right that the decision to reduce the number of beds in Linn Dara on a temporary basis was not undertaken lightly at all.  It is an excellent inpatient service and one we rely on heavily.</p> <p>  We are in an entirely different space compared with the last time this happened.  Dr. Doody and Mr. Ryan spoke about the additional services provided in the area at present.  At the time beds were previously reduced, we did not have our Assessment, Diagnosis, Management, initiation, Research and Education, ADMiRE, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, team.  We did not have the additional teams we now have in community, which is all part of that Sl&aacute;intecare work we are progressing.  We did not have an eating disorder team or mental health intellectual disability, ID, services.</p> <p>  We are in a space where we know that, nationally, 25% of nurses who qualify do not take up a job.  When we look at higher education in the context of the number of graduates, 25% of them do not take up jobs. </p></speech>

We have additional services for the 75% who take up jobs.  As Dr. Doody said, when people want to move, we try to accommodate them within our services but we are in a competitive environment internally, externally with other providers, and with the fact that borders are opening.  Since we are in the Dublin area, we are also at a disadvantage with regard to people not being able to afford rent and mortgages in that area and having to travel long hours, which they cannot commit to on a long-term basis.</p></speech>

It is not exclusive to mental health in our community healthcare organisation, CHO, area.  We are at a disadvantage geographically in working in the greater Dublin area, with house prices and rents being what they are.  In addition to prices, there is a lack of availability.  That is something for consideration.  I have brought up that matter with the Deputy previously.  To Senator Conway's point, it is an ask to look at Dublin weighting for staff who have to pay over the odds for accommodation or mortgages, whatever it is, in that area.</p> <p>  The team has been very creative.  Its members have instituted a piece where they look at the rosters every nine to 12 weeks so they are planning ahead all the time.  We have a mixed methodology for staffing, which is something we have to do, that is a combination of permanent, temporary and agency staff.  We look to work with the same providers, when we need to go to an agency, to ensure we have continuity on the ward or in the inpatient unit because it is specialist.  We look for the same staff who have the knowledge, expertise and experience in those units.</p></speech>

We have been running a rolling campaign for the past number of years for staff nurses in the area.  It has yielded little across the full CHO that I am responsible for, that is, mental health services in St. James's, Tallaght and Kildare and CAMHS.  People have a choice in where they work, which poses a significant challenge.  I will pay credit to the director of nursing and the nurse management staff who have been very creative in determining how to incentivise people, notwithstanding the issue that Ms O'Kelly mentioned, and engage with higher education institutions, for example, making site visits, providing lectures to staff and showing how good the service is.  It is a flagship service and its facilities are second to none.</p></speech>

We are actively engaged with nursing students throughout their four-year programmes.  It is important to take into consideration their skills and competency to work within the area and determine how we can support them in moving from being graduates to staff nurses.  The staff speak highly of the opportunities they have been given in the inpatient unit through working with senior staff, who buddy up with them.  We have developed clearly defined nursing career pathways, clinical nurse specialist, CNS, posts, advanced nurse practitioner posts and nurse prescribing.  We have personal development plans for the staff that we engage and invest in considerably and we provide significant training for them.  The regrettable part of that is that, when some qualify and go for interviews with us, those are actually their exit interviews because they are leaving for other services around the country, which is a major challenge for us.</p></speech>

I will move on to another matter because as I only have a little time left.</p> <p>  Dr. Doody mentioned that a small number of young people with eating disorders needed to be admitted to eating disorder services.  When I asked a parliamentary question, the reply I received &ndash; it was actually signed by Mr. Ryan &ndash; stated that 49 children had been admitted to Merlin Park or Linn Dara in 2021 but that, in the same period, 115 children whose primary presentations were for eating disorders had been admitted to non-eating disorder inpatient public acute mental health facilities.  I have spoken to parents whose children are going through this process.  Their children are brought in and are not getting the specialist treatment and food intake supervision that they need.  All that seems to be done for them is to increase their body mass indices, at which point they are released, but it is a vicious circle, with them going back in and back out again.  While I welcome that there were places for 49 children to be admitted to specialist eating disorder units, there were another 115 children who needed that specialist help but were not getting it.</p><p>Is anything being done to address that?  I find it quite startling.  It is a red-flag issue.</p></speech>

I have been involved in the service for more than ten years.  We had very little services ten to 12 years ago.  What we are seeing now is a response to that.  The challenge is that there has been a very significant increase in demand over the last few years, as Dr. Doody mentioned earlier.  We are running to catch up.  A few years ago there was significant criticism of the practice of transferring young people abroad for the treatment of eating disorders, in particular.  I do not think anybody has been treated abroad in the last three years, which is a significant improvement.  That does not mean we are meeting the demand that is there at the moment.  Dr. Doody might speak to that issue.  It is about the journey we are on, particularly in relation to community care for patients with eating disorders and inpatient care.  Perhaps Dr. Doody wants to add to that.</p></speech>

The figure supplied for 2021 was 115.  That is an increase from 97 the year before.</p></speech>

We have eight eating disorder beds.  Obviously, that is a finite resource in respect of the number of young people we can admit.  Due to the fact the beds are specialist eating disorder beds and that we also offer the option of nasogastric, NG, feeding, we are able to admit young people who are much more unwell from paediatric ward settings.  We can treat them in a service where they are getting more than just the nutritional treatment, but also all of the other therapeutic interventions and the comprehensive therapeutic care package.  The team assesses all children with eating disorders who are referred to the service.  We make an assessment and prioritise the young people who we feel require and would benefit from inpatient care.  Given that we now have a specialist eating disorder community service, there may some cases where the needs of the young person can be met by that service.  We talked about the number of referrals earlier.  Looking at the figures from the community eating disorder team, the number of children that the community eating disorder team is referring on for inpatient admission is usually less than five per year.  The national clinical programme is about the need to provide specialist services in the community to enable parents to access specialist treatment in the community such that their child does not require to be admitted to hospital or an inpatient CAMHS setting.  On the one had, thinking back, when A Vision for Change was launched all those years ago there was a view that nationally, all we would require would be four inpatient beds for eating disorders.  Looking at what has happened over the last few years, we recognised the increased demand for the services, but we did not anticipate the degree to which the demand would explode.  We are obviously, in a sense, trying to catch up with something that is increasing.  It is important that we take a whole-system approach, particularly given the fact that the majority of young people with eating disorders can be treated successfully in the community.  Those specialist services need to be there.  The fact we have that specialist community service in Linn Dara is really positive.  It enables the young people and families to access specialist treatment at a community level, without having to wait for it.  That reduces the likelihood of negative outcomes.  We know that the longer an eating disorder persists, the more likely it is to become chronic.  The young people who are more likely to require inpatient treatment are those who have a disorder that persists.  In other words, the key is being able to access the specialist treatment in a timely fashion in the community.</p></speech>

According to the information I have, one third of referrals to CAMHS are not accepted.</p><p>There were 21,000 referrals to CAMHS in 2021, which shows how busy it is, but only 14,000 of these were accepted.  I have met with parents of children who have autism who feel their children are falling through the cracks.  They are being told to go to another service due to their children's autism.  They want me to make it very clear to the HSE that children with autism can have acute, moderate or severe mental health difficulties as much as any other child.  What services are provided in Linn Dara for children who are due a diagnosis of mental health difficulties and autism?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.591" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Ryan" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022062800002#K00200"><p>I will take the first part of the Deputy's question.  He may have heard of CAMHS operational guidelines, which have been in place since 2019 and which we are currently reviewing.  That review was intended to look at what exactly CAMHS does.  Part of that is about defining what it provides as a service, and part of it is about the difficulty people have in saying CAMHS does not meet their needs.  We acknowledge that.  When we look at the number of young people who may not be accepted as meeting the criteria for CAMHS, certainly within the HSE we have a responsibility to try to provide the service for young people who do not meet the criteria for CAMHS but who absolutely need a service.</p> <p>  We are not saying they do not have a need.  We are saying that the 2% Dr. Doody mentioned earlier - internationally it is normally 2% to 3% - who require CAMHS may fall outside of it but that does not mean they do not need services.  I will ask Dr. Doody to address the Deputy's point specifically.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.592" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Doody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022062800002#K00300"><p>The first point to acknowledge is when children are referred to CAMHS there is an identified need.  Children are not referred without a need.  A question arises when CAMHS believes that need does not fall within its acceptance criteria.  For families, that does not mean a child does not have a need that needs to be met by services.  The reasons community CAMHS will not accept a referral are that the young person's presentation is such that he or she does not require the accessing of specialist mental health services, or the child's needs primarily require other interventions, as the Deputy said, with regard to disability services.  He specifically mentioned children with autism.</p> <p>  Again, the Deputy is correct that if children have a neurodevelopmental disorder, that does not mean they cannot have a mental health problem as well.  It is about steps with us.  We have looked at forums, which the chief officer can also talk about, regarding how we as a much broader HSE service - we are one part of a service - integrate the various components of HSE service work more closely together such that families do not feel, as the Deputy said, they have slipped between the gaps of two services.  Some of that is about recognising that these children have needs.  We then need to look at resourcing primary care, which we also talk about.  Sometimes the issue can be one of gaps in primary care, for example, if there is not adequate resourcing of primary care psychology services.  Young people are then referred to a specialist service, when their need would be much better met at a lower or primary care level.  It is something within the CHO area for which there is an acknowledgement of how the wider and broader range of HSE services meet the needs of this group.</p></speech>

I thank the CAMHS team for coming in.  I thank them for the work they did and for their availability during Covid.</p> <p>  I have a question on treatment versus outcomes.  How do CAMHS measure that?  In other words, let us say, a child or adolescent comes in for a period and Linn Dara does its work.  Is that then it, when it comes to monitoring?  If additional assistance is needed, does that child or adolescent go back to the end of a queue?  Is there an ongoing facility, structure or protocol in place for them if they remain vulnerable?</p></speech>

We talk about young people, for example, with eating disorders, for whom, clearly, the primary goal of inpatient is weight restoration and normalisation of dietary intake such that the young person is able to function and return to be with their family and in the community.  In a sense, when it comes to a clear outcome, that would be the target for a young person with an eating disorder.</p> <p>  All young people who are admitted will have care plans, which identify the goals of treatment and admission.  These are updated on a regular basis.  During the admission, the team will work closely with the community service to which the young person will return to on discharge.  That is very important because the inpatient setting is very intensive and stepping down to a community setting can at times be both daunting and challenging, that is, going from a very intensive service to a community service.  Again, it is very much about identifying what additional supports will facilitate and allow for that transition.  That transition obviously takes working with the young person, the family, but also the services in the community.  Are there additional supports that can be provided within the service that the young person is attending? </p> <p>  With regard to the young person reintegrating, our school is also a very important part of our service.  The Linn Dara schools will link with the young person&rsquo;s school to make sure that young person has a smooth transition back into his or her school and assess if a different type of schooling is required.  We also run a kind of a transition school programme.  Young people can step down within our educational programme.  That is, again, very helpful in that transition from inpatient back to the community.  Should a young person require readmission, and a proportion of our admissions every year will be readmissions-----</p></speech>

We could ask why a young person needs to be readmitted.  It could be a function of his or her illness.  If he or she has a relapse and requires more intensive treatment, we have to look at whether it is that.  We have to look at whether the level of support that the young person requires in the community perhaps is not readily available.  Alternatively, it could perhaps have to do with something outside this.  Sometimes the reason for readmission could be something outside the family or treatment system.  There may be another breakdown, let us say, in school attendance and the young person&rsquo;s level of functioning.</p> <p>  It should be remembered that the vast majority of young people who attend specialist CAMHS are never admitted and do not require admission.  The group that requires admission are-----</p></speech>

Is it any particular age group or any particular presentation of symptoms that perhaps has to return a bit more?</p></speech>

If someone is being admitted to an inpatient unit with an eating disorder, it increases his or her likelihood of needing to be readmitted because, again, the nature of his or her illness is such that he or she required inpatient admission and, therefore, is at a much greater likelihood for readmission.  Clearly, our goal related to services where he or she can have intensive intervention is to not allow, for example, the eating disorder, to develop a more chronic nature.</p><p>It is important that we have that intensive intervention.  For example, for the eating disorder group of patients in Linn Dara, we have a specialist community service so that when a young person is admitted, they are stepped down to a very intensive specialist service.  We would say that is going to reduce the likelihood of readmission but it does not mean it will never happen.  We will have some young people who, due to the nature of their condition, require periods of inpatient treatment.</p></speech>

That can sometimes make for what appears a rude intervention but it is not meant that way.</p> <p>  If, as Deputies and Senators, we were to take away a rough rule of thumb, it is that for those who present for a second or third round of treatment, it can, more often than not, be in the realm of eating disorders.</p></speech>

There is a recognition that, given the nature of the condition, the best response to community treatment is through the provision of specialist services.

We were fortunate that the first child and adolescent community eating disorder service was developed in Linn Dara.  Services have also been developed in Cork and there are plans to develop a number of other services, and also to develop services for adults because not all of the people involved are young people.</p></speech>

They will express interest in where they want to go and we have to look at that.  We also have an ongoing recruitment campaign.  In saying this, the relatively short notice was due to extenuating circumstances regarding sick leave, maternity leave and attrition.  As a team we have agreed we will look at this constantly.  If we receive CVs, we will interview and recruit.  We have a problem with the multidisciplinary teams and recruitment in general, but as we get more nurses on board, we will revise the numbers.  If we were to get a cohort in the coming weeks, we would increase the numbers.  We are looking at it constantly.</p></speech>

Are we speaking about graduates going into these positions?  The service has been under pressure and has had a dearth of staffing.  These graduates will be going into a very pressurised environment.  We speak a lot about pay scales with regard to attrition.  Often it is the quality of the work and people being under pressure.  Graduates are particularly vulnerable.  Is work being done by the HSE to support new graduates who are going into services that are under particular stress?</p></speech>

We have a targeted well-being programme for the team in Linn Dara at present, understanding the pressure they are under.  We are working with their health and well-being colleagues in the CHO.  The staff on Mr. Brady's team are also working on this.</p></speech>

It is very therapeutic and a good reflective practice for staff.  It is important there is protected time for this reflective practice in Linn Dara given the staff's significantly challenging working environment.</p><p>It is not easy work but, as I said, they have the buddy system.  They are very much supported from a senior staff perspective because it is not only about recruitment but about retaining those staff.  If we create that environment and we build on it, we will see the fruits of that labour the director of nursing and the senior nursing management staff are putting in and in which we are investing.</p></speech>

We literally bought additional places in the third level colleges.  We spend &euro;6 million a year on doing that.  That gives us an extra 130 nurses.  It is a four-year cycle and 2020 was the first year in which we saw an additional benefit from that.  That was about trying to increase the pool of people who were available.  We have obviously had to work on the process.  As Ms O'Kelly has said, we have tried to reduce the length of time from one stage to another.  The pool bit is very important because that increases the numbers coming through from the colleges.</p> <p>  We have also invested in 40 additional postgraduate psychiatric nursing positions every year.  What we are trying to do is make sure that when we put in new developments nationally, which we have spoken about, whether it is Sharing the Vision, A Vision for Change etc., because many of those posts tend to be at promotional level and we denude our basic care level, there are people coming out of college who are able and willing to take up those posts.  Interestingly, our west of Ireland services tend to find it easier to recruit staff nurses.</p></speech>

It would seem we do not have those beds in the children's services.  Where are those children being moved to?  Why is there a big fall-off?  By the way, I am happy to see the fall-off.</p></speech>

Professor Doody chairs a group every Tuesday morning that is triaging all the referrals into the four units.  We have a national system whereby, every Tuesday morning, we have, to use the jargon, a bed meeting.  Essentially, it is triaging any referrals for inpatients that would be made during the week to any of the four units.</p><p>Each of the four units have their individualised regional areas they would be referring into but if there is a situation where there is no bed available in that unit it then can become available for the other three units to see if it is more appropriate.  Dr. Doody knows this day in and day out.</p></speech>

Obviously if you look back, in 2010 more young people were being admitted to adult units than to child units.  As a percentage of admissions it is now down to 7% of admissions to HSE.  There was a total of 361 admissions in 2021 and 27 were admitted to adult units.  Of those, 16 subsequently transferred to CAMHS units.  If, as Jim has said, we have the national tele-call - if a young person is admitted to an adult unit they are seen and assessed and what we find is on average a young person is three or four days in that adult setting and then either transferred to a CAMHS unit or discharged.  Last year, 60% of those admitted to an adult unit were subsequently transferred to a CAMHS unit and again the average age was 17 and a half years.  The vast majority of these young people are actually aged 17 years.  Although it is 7% of admissions if you look at actual bed days it is much smaller than that.  Clearly, one would like to reduce this as much as possible.  However, I do not think it is realistic as in a crisis situation admission to an adult unit may be in the young person's best interest but again, if that occurs it should be for the minimum amount of time and the young person should be transferred as soon as possible.</p> <p>  Within our particular primary catchment area we have had very few admissions to adult units in the past two and a half years.  However, again the focus should be not only on reducing the number of admissions but also ensuring if an admission occurs the young person is assessed, triaged and transferred if that is appropriate and if they are not, that they are discharged, so it is not that young people are spending extended periods of time in adult units.  They are either transferred or discharged within four days.</p></speech>

It is similar to what happened a number of years ago, as Deputy Ward has indicated there, back in 2017.  That is the plan and we are sticking to that.</p></speech>

This is not a criticism.  I understand there are mitigating circumstances in the health services and especially mental health ones.  There are reasons this is happening but why was it not envisaged that this could happen again?  It happened four or five years ago and the same situation has arisen again.  Surely with facilities such as Linn Dara, which is a vital service, this is down to planning and seeing what could happen in the future.  Surely this could have been averted in some way?  Notwithstanding the mitigating circumstances around the retention and recruitment of staff, why has it happened again?</p></speech>

The team in Linn Dara works very hard and, as I said, forecast on a nine- to 12-week basis, but it has been very difficult to recruit in recent years.  We have never achieved full recruitment to the 50-plus posts.  We do have a combination of strategies in place, including agency work.  Recruitment has become particularly difficult in a very short time span over recent weeks due to a number of factors, including, as I said, competition from other providers.  We try, where possible, to stick to the same cohort of procured nurses, that is, the same agency, because they have built up an expertise.  That agency has also found it difficult to recruit, which has not happened to us before.  Borders have opened, so people have resigned and left.  We also had some sick leave.  It has been a perfect storm in recent weeks; hence our present position.  It is not a decision we took lightly, but we had to look at the skill mix on the ward and in the units, and we were in such a position that we could not, unless we took this action, guarantee safe, quality care for the service users of the unit.</p></speech>

I know it is a difficult question, but for those families and young people who use vital services such as Linn Dara, when the beds are reopened come September, could the same issue with recruitment and retention of staff arise again in three to four years' time?  Obviously, if seven beds are not being used, young people who need intervention are not getting it, and time is of the essence with services such as this.  That is why many public representatives are deeply concerned about facilities such as Linn Dara having to suspend temporarily some of the inpatient beds.  If that has happened, it will have a ripple effect not only on the staff who work there but also on the young people who will need the services.  Can Ms O'Kelly guarantee this will not happen again?  People will want to know whether we will be in the same situation in two or three years' time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.690" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary O'Kelly" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022062800002#Q00900"><p>We cannot guarantee that.  We do not like to be in this position at all.  Mr. Ryan spoke very well about the increase in the number of higher education institution, HEI, places for psychiatric nurses.  We are being as creative as possible in this area.  We absolutely acknowledge we are having difficulty recruiting across the CHO area and not just in mental health.  People are interested in working and willing to work, we have excellent services, and they want to come to work in those services, but they are unable to afford to live or rent in the area.</p><p>We have staff driving from the midlands and west and that is unsustainable.  They are all the matters we are looking at organisationally.  As Paul Reid mentioned in his interview on Sunday, there is a lot being looked at nationally in terms of facilitating staff to work in the areas they would like to but cannot afford to work in.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.692" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1565" speakername="Gino Kenny" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022062800002#R00200"><p>That is a very important point.  There is no doubt that graduates want to work in the Irish health system, but because of circumstances regarding the proximity to the workplace, rent and so forth, it is not viable.  If it was made viable for graduates, they would work in the Irish public health system.  Circumstances are not allowing them to do that.  If those issues were addressed, we would not have this perennial situation in which facilities, such as Linn Dara, have to suspend some of their inpatient services.  Hopefully this will not happen again and the beds will be reopened in the autumn so that we will not be in this circumstance.  It is no good to anyone having a service, such as Linn Dara, in a situation where it cannot offer inpatient beds for the young people who need them.</p></speech>

I accept that CHO 7 has the best record in the State for not admitting children into adult facilities.  I am concerned that the closure of Linn Dara could lead to more children entering adult facilities.  The HSE's stance was mentioned whereby children are admitted for the least time possible.  In CHO 9, for example, one child was admitted to an adult facility for 13 days and two children were in an adult facility for more than a week in 2021.  In both cases, the reasons given by the HSE were that there were no beds available in CAMHS units at the time.  When I looked at the beds that were filled during the same time as these children were admitted, there seemed to be capacity available in CHO 9.  I am aware that is not the same CHO, but I am concerned that this could happen in CHO 7, an area in which this was not happening much previously.</p> <p>  It was mentioned that eight children had been in adult facilities this year.  Were they in CHO 7?  Are the two children currently in adult facilities also in CHO 7?  What is being done to make sure this does not happen?</p></speech>

Of the two young people, one is in CHO 9 and the other is in CHO 5.  When a young person is admitted, I immediately know because a note must be sent to me and the Mental Health Commission when a young person is admitted to an adult unit.  It is protocol that must be followed within the approved centre in order to make sure that the children are appropriately looked after.  This means they are treated and nursed separately from the adults on the unit.</p> <p>  On whether the closure of the beds in Linn Dara will impact on the CHO&rsquo;s ability to manage, it would be useful to talk about the assessment process we have to triage and prioritise on a weekly basis.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.695" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Doody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022062800002#R00500"><p>It is a very reasonable concern.  If 11 beds are taken out of the system, be it done only temporarily, there is less of a resource available.  Is that a risk?  Yes, it is.  If a young person is admitted to an adult unit, it usually happens in crisis.  They are not planned admissions.  If it happens in our area, we will see that young person straightaway and make an assessment.  Sometimes the crisis passes and he or she does not need to be transferred to a CAMHS unit and can be discharged.  As was the case last year, 60% did require transferring.</p> <p>  The cases are discussed on the national call.  Our primary catchment area extends from south Dublin CHO 6, CHO 7, and half of CHO 8.</p><p>We take all under-15s for CHO 9 and all of CHO 8.  There is a discussion with regard to assessment and we have the weekly tele-call.  A child in an adult unit is seen and coded as a priority.  Each unit will have its own primary responsibility linked to that area and that unit will have the responsibility of finding a bed.  On occasion, we have taken children from adult units outside our catchment area.  Even though each unit has its own defined catchment area, it is not that it cannot admit a child from another catchment area in such a situation.</p></speech>

Proportionately, the number of children with eating disorders in the remaining beds has increased.  Now, more than one third of the young people who are inpatients have eating disorders.  Those beds have lower turnover and longer lengths of stay.  When the number of beds is reduced, even though all of those beds are occupied, the number of admissions will drop because, by the very nature and mix of cases, the patients will be those with more severe conditions who require longer lengths of stay, so beds are being taken out.  All young people are assessed.  If a young person is admitted to an adult unit in our catchment area, consultants and members of the team will assess that young person and make sure that if he or she requires transferring, the transfer is prioritised to our own unit or we would seek a transfer to another unit, if there was capacity nationally.</p></speech>

All I can say is that what would happen in our catchment area is we would prioritise the young person so that he or she would be the first young person to be admitted to the next available bed.  With our having a larger unit of 24 beds, we may have a greater capacity to so do, with the unit fully functioning.  I can only comment on what we would do.  Within our primary catchment area, there has been an extremely limited number of young people admitted to adult units in the past while.</p></speech>

Hardly any accommodation can be had now.  There are mile-long queues of people looking to rent.  When the witnesses look at that issue, how do they think the HSE can make itself a more attractive employer, in general, bearing in mind there is an ongoing housing crisis?  What is the answer?

We have done a few things over recent years.  There is an increasing demand for health services generally, and our ability to meet that demand has to be met in different ways.  One of the things we have done in mental health is around e-health and e-mental health, and that is a way in which we can reduce the number of young people or adults who need to go up the line.</p><p>Under the tiered model of care, we are trying to have as many people as possible seen at the lower level.  Taking youth mental health as an example, we have a service agreement with the likes of Jigsaw, Turn To Me, MyMind, SpunOut, etc.  All these organisations are able to pivot very quickly.  They can upscale their operations.  That is an attractive way for young people to access services when traditionally they might have come to mental health services.  We have attempted to take that approach over recent years, and mental health was one of the initiators of that approach.  It has made a big difference.  The numbers attending Jigsaw are increasing significantly.  It has the same issues that we have about providing bricks and mortar services but it is able to upscale its online service much quicker because people can work from home and work more flexible hours, as we mentioned earlier.  We must do a combination of things.  We must ensure our secondary and tertiary care services are delivered by professionally qualified and appropriate staff.  We must reduce the numbers moving up the system through our services and by working with non-governmental organisations, NGOs, which have a significant role to play.</p><p> I worked for an NGO in Tallaght as a youth worker years ago.  Treatment from an NGO makes a considerable difference because young people are in their own communities and within their own settings.  We are trying to reduce the numbers of people moving up the system.  On the point Ms O'Kelly made earlier, we will have to look at some way of trying to incentivise some services.  Other people will come in here and say we are not prioritising their area.  We are in competition with the likes of enhanced community care.  "Competition" is not the right word.  Citizens need more services and we are trying to deliver them.  The way in which we provide services must include face-to-face consultations but the other ways of doing it online will make a difference.  Rather than seeing those alternatives as less positive, we should instead be saying how much more positive they are.  We have many examples of that.  Some young people much prefer texting and online consultations to face-to-face consultations.  Rather than seeing that as a problem, we should see it as a benefit and take advantage of social media and different ways to try to deliver services.  We are not going to be able to deliver services for everybody in every part of the country in the manner people might have thought we could.  Consultants in more peripheral areas of the country find it difficult.  South Kerry was mentioned earlier in that regard.  It is more difficult to get consultants in such areas.   However, remote consultation works quite well.</p><p> A combination of approaches is required.  There is no silver bullet.  We need to prioritise certain of our services and that is why we have found the need to prioritise the 2% of young people who require secondary care and those types of services.  Those are the sickest young people we have from a mental health perspective.  I do not believe there is any one solution because if there were, somebody else would have thought of it before me.  We must continue to do those type of things.  It is about trying to broaden the way in which we deliver services.</p></speech>

We are a population of more than 700,000 and a large part of the area is socially deprived.  Families are striving hard with children in secondary education.  The first academic primary care centre in the country is in the Russell Centre, Tallaght, which Deputy Ward visited recently.  Trinity College Dublin is its academic partner.  One of the pieces we would like to look at is being able to grow our own within our population.  There is an anchor of people who live in the area.  We had that discussion.  There are people who live in the area and who are passionate about working in their local communities.  That is definitely something to consider from a national point of view.  Deputy Ward will be sick of hearing me say this but we must consider being able to assist people with accommodation and a weighting in addition to basic pay.  We need to recognise that we are comparable to international cities in expenditure.  London and other European cities have a weighting on top of basic pay for people who live in areas where rent and mortgage repayments are higher.</p></speech>

We deal with families who are impacted because someone they love has an addiction problem.  An awful lot of family members come to the RISE Foundation with mental health issues.  Initially, we would not have thought online consultations would have worked but they are actually working better from a therapeutic point of view.  The foundation has fully qualified therapists and the service is working better from a therapeutic point of view, whether it is one to one, a group dynamic or aftercare.  It is definitely working, which was a real eye-opener for us, and it expands our services countrywide.  People do not have to travel from Donegal anymore, for example.  They can avail of our services in their homes now.  We find that very beneficial.  It is one of the ways forward but, obviously, it does not suit everyone.</p> <p>  More and more people are being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD.  This is an area in which I have a specific interest.  Many of these diagnoses are of adults who suffered greatly in educational or workplace settings because their needs were not recognised.  This definitely demonstrates the importance of early diagnosis.  Will the witnesses tell me a little more about the assessment, diagnosis, management initiation, research and education, ADMIRE, ADHD pathway?  What level of demand is there for this service and is it adequately resourced?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.712" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Doody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022062800002#U00200"><p>When we looked at our services in our base in Cherry Orchard, Dublin, we developed the ADMIRE pathway because of the need to provide a pathway with a robust and evidence-based assessment and treatment process.  It is about how we improve the service and, following the programmatic approach, assess children in a comprehensive, effective and efficient manner to ensure a diagnosis is made and treatment is initiated.  We found that we often do well in the diagnosis service, but the quality of aftercare and treatment, which will often include medication, needs to be looked at and optimised.</p> <p>  The pathway, which is linked academically with Trinity College Dublin and is led by Professor Jane McGrath, is new and innovative and looks at taking the best from models abroad as to how to deliver for this group of children.  A diagnosis of ADHD for children and families can be life changing.  It gives families an understanding that their child's difficulties are something over which the child does not necessarily have full control.  The thing about ADHD is that it is not just a condition.  If left untreated, the outcomes for young people going from childhood to adulthood are not good.  Children with ADHD often have other difficulties that need to be picked up on as well.</p> <p>  Our pathway has won a number of awards.  For families, the link between academic and research has been very important.  When we were allocating a new development post, we saw that we needed to develop and strengthen the ADHD pathway team further because of the level of demand and throughput.  As a service, the pathway has been developing and putting together assessment packages that will be widely available.  Professor McGrath has received a lot of interest from services around the country as to what they can learn in regard to providing the best possible assessment and treatment for this group.</p> <p>  Children with ADHD make up a significant proportion of those who attend CAMHS services.  It is important we optimise the diagnosis, treatment and aftercare.  As was pointed out, it is often the case that when parents attend services with their children that they recognise they had those difficulties when they were a child.</p><p>We now need to develop services for adults because we have children who are being diagnosed and treated reaching their 18th birthday but where are the adult services to take them on?  That is one group.  You could say the young people are graduating.  There are also adults who, for the first time, are realising they need access to a treatment service.  The need to develop this has been recognised within the clinical programmes.  Once upon a time there was a belief ADHD was just a condition of childhood and that when you reached adulthood you grew out of it.  For a proportion it lessens in adulthood but for some their difficulties continue into adulthood and there is a need to not only diagnose it but also treat appropriately.  That is something for the national clinical programme and Mr. Ryan can perhaps talk about the development of services for adults.</p></speech>

It is for the Dublin south-central St. James's-Tallaght service.  The national programme was allocated an additional five posts for CHO 8 and the Kildare portion of our CHO as well so later this year, all going well, we will have those two teams operational.  That will support the transition Dr. Doody alluded to as well as adults who need the service themselves.</p></speech>

How could somebody access that or how do they get to find out about it or know about it?</p></speech>

The consultant post is just being recruited in CHO 7 at the moment.  The closing date was only in the past week or two, so as soon as that is ready to go we will be doing media campaigns on social media and giving information out about things.  We recently had a communications officer appointed in the CHO.  To go back to the initiatives that were talked about, he will be working with our director of nursing and our HR colleagues on looking at how we make Linn Dara look attractive in terms of the services it provides.  We may get staff to do personal testimonies about their experience of working in Linn Dara to try to get that extra little piece to support Linn Dara and get up to that 51 members of staff we have been alluding to over the last while.  Again, that goes across the full NDT with the clinical posts but nursing is our critical gap as well.  If the Chair wants to contact me afterwards I can give her an up-to-date briefing.  I corresponded with Deputy Ward recently on the development of that team as well.  That will be later this year or early next year.</p></speech>

We have one for the catchment area for St. James's.  That is the South Inner City Partnership.  We have one for the Tallaght area and one for the Kildare area of the CHO.  Dr. Doody and Mr. Brady regularly come to those meetings with GPs.  We roll out that information through our own networks but also our partners, like our GP practices, our public health nursing and our local primary care centres.</p></speech>

I thank the officials so much.</p> <p>  I want to talk about families, which Senator Conway touched on.  Obviously mental health waiting lists are very long at the moment.  It is particularly stressful for families in the context of the CAMHS.  How could families be better supported as they wait for the care?  You can imagine what it would be like for a family that has a child who is suicidal or who has an eating disorder.  How can families be supported while they are waiting for that service?  I ask because we get a lot of family members asking where they should go and what they should do if that child has an eating disorder or an addiction problem or is maybe on the way there.  How do we support the families?</p></speech>

One of the things I want to say is 94% of urgent cases are responded to within three days across the country and the 73 teams.  The Chair may recall a couple of years ago there was an individual situation that happened that was tragic and that we responded to.  We want to say that where a young person comes forward they are actually responded to very quickly, the vast bulk, because we are aware of the point the Chair made.</p><p>We also try to make sure that where information that will support parents in the meantime may be available, it can be made available immediately.</p><p> Dr. Doody wanted to come in on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.722" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Doody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022062800002#W00200"><p>One would hope that all young people would be seen in a timely fashion.  When a referral comes in, it is triaged.  It is not the case that everyone goes to the back of the queue.  Urgent cases are prioritised.  A child who is suicidal or a child with a serious eating disorder absolutely would be prioritised.  The concern about children who just meet the threshold is that a young person's presentation may not be seen as being as severe or as acute.  In other words, the concern is that the priority cases will forever jump to the top of the queue.  As for those on waiting lists, things change and families are encouraged to make contact and to speak to the team involved.  The Chairman talked about eating disorders, for example.  Currently, in our community specialist eating disorder service there are 15 on a waiting list, but 13 of those have an appointment and are seen in a very timely fashion.  The children who have that more acute presentation will be seen.  Sometimes the children waiting are those whose presentation is not as severe or as acute.  The case is made that if the children are waiting, things will deteriorate because they are not getting intervention.  That is a very valid point.  When our overall number of referrals are climbing and climbing and the complexity of the cases attending or being referred is increasing, we have to look at how we, as a service, meet the needs of all the young people who are referred.  It is challenging.  The children with more acute or severe presentation are seen and prioritised.  All referrals are prioritised, and those with the greatest need will be prioritised to be seen.</p></speech>

We have only ten minutes left.  I wish to follow on from the discussion about ADHD.  This is probably more from a therapeutic point of view, but are children who have ADHD more inclined, when they get into their teenage years, to pick up substances?  I am talking about the link between ADHD and - I will not even use the word "addiction" - let us just say substance misuse or alcohol misuse.  Is there a strong link in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.724" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan Doody" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE32022062800002#W00400"><p>There is evidence that untreated ADHD increases one's risk of developing the very conditions and difficulties you have described, Chairman.  There is a cost to the individual of not being diagnosed and not being properly treated.  We know that young people who are not diagnosed and treated are more likely to experience difficulties at school and to drop out of school.  What we are about is how we help young people to achieve their full potential.  It is important that if children have conditions such as ADHD, they are detected, diagnosed and treated.  That will improve their chances of achieving their potential.  It will also decrease the likelihood of their developing addiction problems, so there is a link.  It is not that every young person who has ADHD will go on to develop those problems; it is just that those young people are more likely to do so.</p></speech>

We might ask if costs are increasing, and they are, but the important questions are whether costs are making housing unaffordable and what can be done about it.</p> <p>  Tender prices reflect what the market will do the work for and they are a factor of the market conditions, economic cycles, risk and sentiment.  The latest Project Management Institute, PMI, report states that construction firms continue to face severe delivery delays due to material shortages, shipping issues, the war in Ukraine and Brexit.  The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, reported tender inflation of 13% in 2021.  The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, has introduced measures to manage contract inflation.</p> <p>  Materials are just one part of a tender price so although the SCSI index shows tender prices 80% above 2010, it is noticeable that it is only 30% or 40% above 2007 levels for non-residential work.  The EUROSTAT construction cost index shows labour and material costs are not significantly higher than 2007.  However, it is a lagging indicator.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, wholesale index shows that the prices of materials are very volatile, with significant inflation in some materials.</p> <p>  More broadly, the problem is uncertainty.  Risk is being priced into tender prices and this can include risks such as the pandemic, Brexit, availability and transport of materials, energy costs, labour, skills shortages, capacity constraints, procurement practices, regulatory policy, delays in utility and infrastructure, and risk allocation in contracts.</p> <p>  Are costs making housing unaffordable?  According to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, hard costs are approximately &euro;183,000 for a three-bedroom house and &euro;210,000 for a two-bedroom apartment.  A material cost increase, therefore, of 10% across all materials would add approximately &euro;10,000 to a typical new home.  From 2010 to 2022, the median new house price rose 9% nationally from &euro;247,000 to &euro;270,000.  However, in Dublin it increased almost 50%, from &euro;305,000 to &euro;450,000.  Outside the city, private developers are currently selling new three-bedroom homes from &euro;235,000 and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and local authority records confirm this order of cost.  Although inflation is an issue, building materials and regulatory standards are not what is making housing unaffordable.  The development costs, the soft costs, can add up to &euro;200,000 in speculative development, compared to costs from &euro;30,000 in contract build that would be more typical in the public and non-profit sector.  Speculative development is very high risk and means high costs.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, calls this a dysfunction and states that affordability should be an explicit objective, that the supply of housing is not in itself a reliable and sustainable means of making housing affordable and that Ireland must engineer affordability into the supply of housing.</p> <p>  What can be done?  In 2010, the EU Commission stated that land price inflation alone cannot explain high house price inflation since land prices represent between 17% and 30% of house prices.  Construction cost inflation cannot explain it either because it was relatively low in the years leading up to 2020.  Taxes, levies, fees, finance and marketing costs have not surged.  Therefore, high inflation values may be partly explained by an increase in margins which may indicate insufficient competition.  To address this, focus must shift to stabilising the housing system.  The solution is not to be found in supporting inefficiencies with high subsidies.  Capacity building and competition can raise quality, lower prices and temper the boom-bust cycle that is so damaging to employment, skills and the wider economy.  It also has an impact on future capacity.</p> <p>  Capacity constraints in the provision of infrastructure, water and utilities are also a problem and causing delays.  Overly complex procurement, financing and approval systems, particularly in the public sector, are adding cost and risk.  Recent regulatory change in both planning and building control have been inflationary.  In late 2015, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage had a policy objective to reduce standards, aiming at two-bedroom apartment sales prices of approximately &euro;200,000 to &euro;260,000.  By early 2018, the Department had increased that to an affordability range of between &euro;240,000 and &euro;320,000, and by 2021, the benchmark for apartments in the new affordable housing scheme in Dublin was raised to &euro;500,000.  As the Dublin market shifted from assets valued on 25 to 30 years of mortgage payments to the rental sector, where asset prices are assessed on 50 to 60 years of high rent, the price doubled.</p> <p>  In 2018, Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage stated that construction costs for a two-bedroom apartment in Dublin could be reduced from &euro;205,000 to &euro;158,000.  Yet, within three years an industry report claimed that the all-in cost of an urban two-bedroom apartment in Ireland is &euro;450,000 to &euro;615,000.  These industry estimates are not substantiated or independently audited, and are not supported by independent data.  Some property sector reports have made unevidenced claims of a very high cost base without acknowledging that it is the high-risk, high-cost speculative business model that may be unviable rather than the construction cost of homes and apartments.  Dublin City Council published costs for recent schemes without highlighting that the majority of its examples were for non-standard procurement with particular technical requirements and on complex sites.</p> <p>  In urban areas, planning changes for high-density, high-rise and reduced apartment standards have in general added to construction and finance costs.  Previous standards recognised that six storeys is a sustainable density and is cost-optimal for residential development.  This scale of building is both easier to finance and phase, and safer and more liveable for residents.  Under Housing For All, no housing is planned in Dublin city for households earning over &euro;36,000 and under &euro;80,000 per annum.  In fact, two thirds of all new homes in Dublin city are to be fully publicly funded or heavily subsidised, with the other one third only affordable to very high earners.  In this context, the difference between the Exchequer paying production costs and market prices in Dublin alone may be in excess of &euro;4 billion, and higher again if public housing is leased.  This has wider implications for the economy, competitiveness and sustainable growth.</p> <p>  Housing policy is undermining some climate and energy policies.  When city housing is unaffordable, as it is planned to be, and unsuited to families, it results in a push to the commuter belt.  In 2021, for every new house built in Dublin, almost two were built in commuter counties because the demand is for affordability and space.  City housing for families is not currently a policy objective, even though half of all households have children.  In the pursuit of low costs, apartment standards for space, amenity and safety, including fire safety standards, have been cut.  The drive for speed and lightweight construction in the short term has not been adequately assessed against the long-term investment and the need for new housing to be climate resilient, safe and sustainable for the next 100 years.</p><p>Issues with supply chains and energy costs are outside of immediate control but a broader economic analysis and active risk assessment of housing policy is now critically important.  Policy responses of nudging viability with piecemeal interventions have been very damaging.  Housing standards needs to be evidence-based, holistic and with a long-term view.  Many lobby-driven interventions are not evidence-based and have had unintended and negative consequences.</p><p> Procurement policies and practices are adding to risk, cost, delay and the administrative burden.  Bundling, outsourcing and unquantifiable risk allocation are disincentives to tendering and competitive pricing, particularly in the public sector.  These practices also militate against capacity building, skills and more sustainable employment practices. </p><p> The residential construction sector has not been supported to recover from the crash and has limited capacity and skills, both in design and construction.  Pressures of skills and capacity risk substandard and non-compliant work.  Now more than ever, quality controls need to be more independent and more robust.  Time is of the essence: cost control should be devolved to those with expertise who are best placed to actively manage risk.  That is to cut out delays and the further impact of inflation.  </p><p> New housing has to be the right supply, in the right places and at the right price.  It must be affordable to both the residents and to the Exchequer.  It is not sustainable or scalable to subsidise high market prices, to load new homeowners with a second mortgage or to be over-reliant on international speculative investment that is delivering to niche markets.  </p><p> As the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, has stated, the current housing delivery system is a land trap where sites tend to be acquired by the most optimistic with the highest expected sale prices and so property tends to be developed close to the margin of viability.  As sales prices rise, so land values increase.  Land values do not drive sales prices; high sales prices drive up land values and these higher values are baked into to land valuations immediately.  This is the land value trap.  When costs increase, as now, the margin is lost, and it may be too risky to develop and development may stall.  In 2016, that margin of viability was around a sales price of &euro;250,000 and now, in Dublin, it has doubled.  That is not due to inflation in building materials.</p></speech>

While I want to get to discuss the costs she spoke about,  I want to correct a point.  She stated that "Under Housing For All, no housing is planned in Dublin city for households earning over &euro;36,000 and under &euro;80,000 per annum."  We are talking about affordable housing there.  The latest Dublin City Council housing report shows that on top of 10,000 social homes that are in planning, construction or whatever already, there are almost 5,500 additional affordable homes.  That is a combination of 1,800 affordable purchase, more than 2,600 cost rental and roughly 700 through Part V provision.  Ms Hegarty might come back to that afterwards.  I am not trying to bombard her here but I think it is a really important fact.  A big objective of Housing for All is to deliver affordable housing in spite of the challenges with cost inflation.  If we can come back to that before the report is read into the record, or even after the meeting, that would be important.  </p> <p>  Inflation and its cost is a real struggle for us to get our heads around.  We are constantly battling the idea of trying to deliver affordable homes and legislation to use State-owned lands and remove or reduce the land costs.  Ms Hegarty's advice to us is that the taxes and levies are being kept to a minimum so there is not really room there.  Then there are the inflationary elements that are captured.  There is a myriad of indices but the CSO one is really stark.  It shows steel inflation at 50% to 60% with timber and wood at 50% to 100%, yet Ms Hegarty concludes that it is not cost inflation that is causing the increases.  Even considering the various indices, materials have to be a significant factor.  Is there anything at all that can be done?  Can anything be done to change the methods or processes of building or the materials?  What percentage does risk and uncertainty add to the cost?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.739" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022062800002#C00500"><p>To clarify the Dublin City Council housing provision, I am basing my breakdown on the housing needs demand assessment that was done by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as well as the affordable criteria that the Department published.  That is to state that effectively the affordable housing scheme is a subsidy that goes between the market price and the amount that people can borrow.  At the sales price rates that are in Dublin now, when you remove the subsidy available and divide the rest by what a mortgage can achieve, you are effectively looking at households earning over &euro;80,000 in order to have the mortgage to get them to the level where the affordability subsidy will bring them up to market prices.  I would stand over the figure I gave on that.  The affordable housing that is planned for Dublin will be very heavily subsidised, probably in the region of &euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000 per unit.  Depending on whether it is on public or private land, in the majority of cases it will effectively be a second mortgage for those homeowners on that scheme into the future.</p> <p>  On some of the other costs, I would not say that they are minimised.  They are real costs.  VAT, professional fees and so on are real costs.  </p> <p>  Changing methods of building or materials would be the wrong way to go at it.  Reducing standards in the short term just creates a long-term problem.  There is a lot that the State could do around procurement.  If the Senator looks at some of the material costs she just quoted, the price people are paying is a factor of industry capacity in some ways.  If you are looking at 200 windows or bathroom suites for a housing development you will get one price and if you are looking for 2,000 you might skip the queue and get a better price.  The State is in a position to look at procuring building materials at scale, particularly components, the vast majority of which are imported.  I am thinking of things such as bathroom or kitchen fittings, windows, doors or heating systems and those kinds of high-value items that could be procured at scale and possibly standardised in some housing schemes.  You are effectively being a smarter buyer rather than somebody buying low quality.  That is a better way to look at it.  That is not something that has been considered.  Given that the State is looking at a high level of provision in the coming years, it is in a very good position to do deals across Europe on procurement of materials because it would be guaranteeing a supply chain to producers and would likely get good prices because it would be de-risking that industry for the producer in that country into the future.  That is one small suggestion of what could be done.</p> <p>  On the cost of risk and uncertainty, it is very difficult to say what percentage it represents.</p><p>In preparation for today I spoke to four people directly involved in delivery: one in a local authority, one in private practice, one in an approved housing body, AHB, and one in a co-operative.  Some of my comments are drawn from some of their level of involvement at the moment.  When people in construction talk about risk, it is multiple factors but it comes down to the fact that if people are asked to price work and to commit to that price in a construction contract, which is generally over quite a considerable time of maybe one, two or more years, they need to make an assessment of market conditions in the future.  They need to make an assessment of whether they can get subcontractors to do the work and at what price, whether there will be delays on materials and whether there will be difficulties in the supply chain.  Much of that pricing and risk is a factor of the terms under which they are being asked to sign a contract.  When people, particularly in the public sector, are being asked to take on a lot of risk for price certainty, which has been the policy in public procurement for about the last 15 years, they must allow enough in their price now that they will not put themselves out of business during the course of the contract and then be able to meet those contract terms.  If that risk is managed better, and in construction that means there is more latitude in the contract for negotiating risk as it arises rather that allocating it at the beginning, keener prices will be achieved.  The more likely a contractor is to be able to renegotiate if there are particular difficulties, material changes or inflation in the future, the keener the price will be at the beginning.  However, that is not how most public contracts are set up at the moment.</p></speech>

Starting with the Irish Council for Social Housing, the committee would be interested in what our guests are hearing from their members about what is happening on the ground at the moment with respect to both what I call own developments, usually Part 8s but also turnkeys, and Part Vs.  I am referring to projects that are on site at the moment or potential developments for which the council is in the beginnings of negotiating, especially for turnkeys and Part Vs that may not be commenced yet.  What is the picture?  Is there a difference between Dublin and outside it?  I am very much hearing there are significant challenges outside Dublin of a different nature than the ones we are used to hearing in here.</p> <p>  The second issue is the Housing Finance Agency's, HFA, interest rate hikes.  Obviously, some of the council's members were very critical of those and we were all quite surprised when they happened.  I think the position of the HFA is it is a little more sanguine and thinks the council's members have the capacity to absorb them.  If Mr. Doyle and Ms Donaghy could talk the committee through that, it would be helpful.</p> <p>  Turning to Ms Hegarty, and we may have a chance in this round, but if not, we will come back in the second round, much of what she has said, none of which I disagree with, is from my understanding very appropriate to the dynamics in Dublin and to a lesser extent in Cork.  When I talk to SME builders who are building a lot of what are essentially turnkey developments for the AHB sector outside the cities, their model of development is not as speculative and therefore the impact of costs and material inflation is more significant for their viability.  I would appreciate Ms Hegarty commenting, if she could, on those types of projects.  I am not talking about the big speculative ones she is referring to in the main but rather the dynamics as to how cost-price inflation could be having an impact on housing supply, especially for the social housing sector but also for the affordable housing sector outside the city.  Her points about developments, particularly in Dublin city, are well made.</p></speech>

Last year the Irish Council for Social Housing delivered about 3,800 units.  That was up 14% on 2020.  New units made up 75% of the total.  We have been meeting our targets and growing our numbers every year, year on year.  Under Housing for All, social housing will be 40% to 50% of the overall targets, and given the direction and trajectory over recent years, we consider ourselves to be very much in line to meet that at the time.</p> <p>  Much of what has been said by the previous speaker is what is now facing our members.  The uncertainty is the biggest thing.  I believe the council will hit the targets this year and will get the appropriate number of Part Vs and so on, but looking at how long it takes to gear up, we have concerns about 2023, 2024 and hitting those targets.  The reason for that is the uncertainty.  It has been mentioned already that it is down to those tendering to price in the risk.  If we had been here last year, none of us would have seen the risks that have emerged from 24 February onwards.  Many people who are currently delivering on fixed-term tender projects and builders or developers I talk to say they are doing this for nothing.  Some of that is true and some is not, but they have been really squeezed now.  That has made people nervous and uncertain about whether they want to commit to a fixed-price tender.</p></speech>

There is a big reluctance on what the Deputy called the turnkeys, which we would call a new-build development agreement.  We have developers who have opportunities who are bringing projects to the market that would not otherwise come to the market, but there is a reluctance to engage until there is some sort of certainty around some evidence-based flexibility on costs as they progress.  I suppose it is the fear factor Ms Hegarty mentioned, the uncertainty and pricing in the risk.  They cannot do that from the outset because that would just scare the horses, the local authorities will not engage and the projects will not be viable.  There is this circle of one problem after the other.  We are in what anyone could describe as a perfect storm with regard to costs.  We will have it with projects under our control as well.  I am about to go to tender on a Part 8 development in which we have been in very lengthy negotiations to achieve, and what I hear is there is a bit of interest in tendering.  However, on the flexibility around fixed price, the Government contracts committee for construction, GCCC, contract only allows for fixed price.  There is no flexibility.  All that risk and all that uncertainty is built in from the outset.</p></speech>

That is under the public works contract, PWC, and our GCCC contracts are fixed price.  There is no flexibility.

That is going to make others nervous coming forward.  We have been told by the Department that we will get access to the information and there will be some flexibility and cushion built in on new ones, but it is about getting that message out there.  Like housing providers talk to each other, developers talk to each other, and the ones currently on the ground delivering are being squeezed because of what happens, so it makes everybody nervous to price going forward.  Some people have said they will not be entering into fixed pricing.  Some people on the turnkeys have come back and are looking to renegotiate that now and are threatening to pull.  It is just very risky at the moment, and that creates an uncertainty.  That makes everybody just slow a bit.  As it is slowing a bit, the concern we have is around 2023 and 2024 and the targets for 2024.</p><p>It is kind of like a big ship.  It takes a while to speed up.  If it slows at all, it takes another while to catch up.  We are doing everything we can to look at what Ms Hegarty was talking about, with new models of working and new methods, including modular housing and factory builds.  We have been looking at some of those costs.  One is still dealing with labour costs, timber costs, imports and energy costs.  All of those costs are there.  To answer the question about the Housing Finance Agency, I am the president of an organisation with more than 270 members.  I know the committee had a number of members in.  I  have to speak for all members.  The interest rate hike was in line with interest rate hikes elsewhere.  There was nothing abnormal about that.  The speed and communication of that may be a matter for reflection.  It was certainly a reasonable hike.  It was in line with what was going on in other markets.  People were taken aback by how quickly it moved.  It seemed to move ahead of some other announcements.  When they were made, it was in line with them.  We will have to get used to that.</p><p> Our members have asked us to raise the issue of building endurance into the schemes in the future, including payment and availability, rental and capital advance agreement schemes.  Maintaining properties to a certain standard and meeting loan repayments all requires flexible, moving payments.  We have been promised a review.</p></speech>

I will start with Mr. Doyle and Ms Donaghy.  They summed up matters when they talked about uncertainty and how, this time one year ago, we could not have foreseen this level of uncertainty.  It is encouraging that, against that backdrop, they are confident they will hit their targets for this year.  I commend them and their teams on that.  I appreciate that, next year and the year after, there will be further uncertainty.  How do they feel we can help to provide them with the opportunity to meet those targets?  In their opening statement, they called out the review of the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, in Housing for All being moved from the fourth quarter to the third quarter.  That is welcome.  What are they hoping or expecting to see when that comes forward?  Do they think there will be much to help to set them up for success ahead of next year?</p> <p>  I was particularly interested in appendix 1 of the document provided by Ms Hegarty.  She outlined a few recommendations and a number of actions that she feels can be taken which would have big impacts.  One related to State-led master planning, both of housing developments and of infrastructure.  Is she talking about strategic development zones?  Does she see them naturally linking in with Project Ireland 2040 or does she feel that there is a disconnect?  If we connect things better, would that have an impact?  She also talks about the unbundling of projects.  She is offering smaller tenders to potentially smaller builders.  From the perspective of practicality or an administrative process, would that slow progress down?  Would there be a risk?  If there is not any administrative burden, having public contracts in small lots sounds feasible.  What would Ms Hegarty categorise as small lots?  She also called out mass procurements.  Large builders obviously have much more capability to engage in that and therefore much more ability to build economies of scale into tendering and pricing operations.  How can the Government help to deliver that opportunity to smaller providers?  There are many questions there.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked what we can do.  One thing we might consider doing, which I have not had a chance to put to the Minister, is something that has been done in the UK to renovate derelict sites and bring back properties.  The VAT rate has been reduced.  If one is bringing back a derelict site or old building, the VAT rate is reduced to 5%.  There is no VAT in some jurisdictions where a development is 100% social housing.  That would in some ways reduce the burden and the cost.  It would counteract some uncertainty if people knew that did not have to be paid.  Will Ms Donaghy address the CALF?</p></speech>

We want to make what we manage more sustainable in the long term, because we are in this for the long run, as Ms Hegarty and some Deputies mentioned.  We want our homes to be on the marketplace for 100 years.  We hope the stresses and difficulties we are experiencing at present are short term.  To alleviate them, we might need to look at lengthening the financial model on a short-term basis, such as the CALF and the payment and availability schemes.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned the challenges with the HFA's increase in interest rates.  It caught some of our members unaware because they had no headroom.  I had a &euro;22 million project on the cusp of starting.  It was just awaiting project approval.  Everything had been lined up.  We were hit with an interest rate hike. I was lucky to be in the position of having a bit of headroom.  I was at my maximum rental for that area, which is not that high, but I had not maximised the CALF.  It allowed me to increase the CALF by a very small percentage, of 1% or 2%, which covered the interest rate.  That is where many members were caught.  It is a difficulty.  We do not want this to happen because it slows the process.  We have to feed back to the developers and builders that the process has been elongated.  Time has been added, which increases uncertainty and cost.  The developer has to price it in.  It is about better engagement.</p> <p>  I do not think we will cover them today but there are many alternatives we can look at.  We need to look at alternative contract forms such as PPC 2000 which is more of a partnering contract.  We need to talk about supply chain management and to engage with larger developers who have larger buying capacity, if they are prepared to sign up to a longer term deal where we can have repeat business and fixed key performance indicators that will reduce costs, terms and time.  There are obvious things we can build in.  Our system is very rigid.  We have a GCCC or a new build development agreement with the contractor.  At times, we to hold them to account.  We ask them to tender and operate on an open book basis with us.  We want the assurance that what we are getting value for money and it does not just run away, because it must be sustainable.  We can use various approaches that would give us greater confidence that we are getting the best deal we can, as well as to build some resilience into our system and not allow the costs to run away with themselves.</p></speech>

Some of these are getting into planning issues.  Strategic development zones are a way of unlocking land.  The comment I made on it was in the context of the Land Development Agency and other policies on the development of larger sites in Dublin such as O'Devaney Gardens and Oscar Traynor Road, where the procurement policy has been to do a very large, very high risk deal with one developer.  This takes an extraordinarily long time and is high risk since one is putting all the eggs in one basket with regard to quality, price and whether it is a success.  Unbundling the sites into smaller lots spreads the risk and brings in competition.  More important, it is not only competition of people trying to get the work finished quickly on their lot and getting another lot.  This model has been used successfully on the Continent.</p><p>It also gives competition in the labour market and that will tend to favour better employment conditions.  What has not been talked about here in some of the procurement policies is that they tend to favour poor employment practices because, by favouring lowest price and giving work to the lowest price all of the time, it tends to damage employment terms and apprenticeships and training and lead to bogus self-employment and those kind of issues.</p><p> Generally, in terms of the larger sites, the important thing to remember is we do not really have big builders.  We have a few big development companies but we have lots of small builders.  In fact, somebody as a large entity getting a large contract is merely managing hundreds of smaller contracts.  The construction industry is made up of sub-contractors and sub-sub-contractors.  Effectively, the procurement process for each project is individual.  It is a supply chain that is built on-the-fly with people as they are available and having more people up the chain and a larger entity is really adding another layer.  It may not be bringing value to the proposition at all.  Traditionally, house builders brought a lot of value.  They were people who were skilled and experienced in the construction industry.  I refer to the pre-crash house builders who brought a lot of value to the process because they had a lot of relationships with sub-contractors and suppliers and they were doing multiple deals across multiple projects.  That was how they engineered the value and the profitability into their business.  We are increasingly seeing people who have a management structure and maybe are bringing finance, but do not have that value to bring across managing a supply chain, and they themselves are, in fact, tendering out to the market.</p><p> There is a lot - it is difficult to describe it now - in there in procurement policy.  I suppose it goes to the earlier question from Deputy &Oacute; Broin as well on procurement.  Construction is inherently risky and the procurement process is effectively complex.  In order to manage that, we have so-called "traditional procurement" whereby there is a contract in place that manages that risk and it tries to balance the risk on both sides so that the contractor has certainty of being paid for the work they do, that unexpected things will get paid for if they arise and that the person who is the commissioning body at the top of the chain has certainty that they will deliver and that they have the tools to enforce good quality and various other mechanisms.  Construction contracts, traditionally, are complex with a lot of levers for those changing conditions.</p><p> We effectively in the public sector now have less sophisticated contracts - that has been so in the past 15 years - where they attempt to transfer risk early on.  We say to the contractor that the contractor should make allowance for all of these things that might happen and price it in at the beginning, and if it arises, we do not want to look at variations or additional cost, and it is the contractor's problem.  The difficulty is the conditions in the past 15 years have probably masked the danger in that.  We have had a period of fairly flat inflation in construction, labour and materials and we have had adequate capacity in the industry to keep expanding in the past few years so that people were available to do the work.  In terms of people who took on contracts then, they had certainty that they could find people to do the work and they had certainty about the future price of materials and, therefore, they could to some extent price in that risk.  We now find ourselves in conditions where it is different.  The industry is at capacity in a lot of areas, the risks have increased and we do not have a contract mechanism that is sophisticated enough to manage a lot of that.  We also have centralised controls in terms of approval of costs.  The purse strings are held in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and in a lot of cases that is what one might call micro-managed to some extent in that people have to spend an inordinate amount of time getting approval and going back looking for a certainty that just is not out there.

For the sake of fairness, I need to keep to the time slots for people.  We were up to 12 and a half minutes on that slot but there were some interesting points in it.  The next slot is a Green slot and I will take that.</p> <p>  I am sorry I did not get a chance at the start to put the meetings in context.  This is the second meeting we have had on construction costs.  The first meeting we had was purely on construction costs.  In the second meeting, we want to look at the impact of inflation on construction costs.  We hope to publish a report on that.  Ms Donaghy stated there are areas that she probably thought we might not get into today but I assure her we are open to these suggestions and any of the research that Ms Donaghy has done, or any credible suggestions at all.  We are willing to ask for consideration of those and I ask her to not feel constrained in any way to discuss any part of affordability in construction today.  It is key at the end of the day, if we manage to produce 33,000 houses or 40,000 houses per year, or whatever it is, that they are affordable for people.  That is the critical point.</p> <p>  I will ask a question on refurbishment, over the shop accommodation and bringing derelict properties, either formerly residential or formerly commercial buildings, back into use.  The Peter McVerry Trust is doing quite a lot of work in this area.  We had a committee report published and it was suggested that there were costs with refurbishment of the second and third storeys of commercial buildings that were making it prohibitive in many cases because there were a number of different stages that one had to go through with accessibility certificates or where it might require a conservation architect, etc.  What is Mr. Doyle's experience of it in the Peter McVerry Trust?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.764" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Doyle" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022062800002#F00500"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I am glad he brought it up.  I will keep it to ten minutes.</p> <p>  We have developed a particular skill, I suppose, in the Peter McVerry Trust, as have other members.  The Sophia Housing Association is doing some work in this area as well.  I have to speak for other members too.  We have developed a particular skill in relation to derelict and second-hand properties and commercial buildings and the transfer of them.  There are many challenges in it, but the benefits, for example, are that one is reusing existing resources and they have 80% less impact on the carbon footprint than going to a greenfield site and starting again.  It is like the old recycling model of reduce, reuse, recycle.  There are great benefits there.</p> <p>  There are other benefits because many of these buildings are central to towns and villages the length and breadth of the country.  Kilbeggan, for example, could barely support the commerce in the town but, under the planning laws a number of years ago when they were building new residential units at the edge of the town, the ground floor needed to be commercial.  We were able to apply to take five disused shop units - in fact, they had never been used in that development - and turn them into nine one-bedroom apartments.  They were able to be done, affordably, quickly and simply within planning.  The challenge was to identify them and get a hold of them and in the preparation of the work because one is looking at fire exits, disability access, etc.</p> <p>  Going up to two-storey buildings, that is fairly doable as well.  For example, we have taken a number of old banks and old, two-storey monasteries.  We have taken a number of old schools where there was amalgamation of, maybe, three schools in an area and there was an old school.  We were able to convert them.  We currently have four pubs in four different counties that will bring in 18 units.  It is small in terms of the numbers the Chairman is talking about, but those will never go back to being pubs.  It is good for the environment and good for the town.  It is breathing life back into the town and gets rid of dereliction.  In one of the towns, this was a landmark building and every child passed this dereliction on the way to school every day.  Now it will be social housing and homes for families.</p></speech>

In Townsend Street, for example, we took a three-storey old tenement that was closed for years.  That meant going out the back, building new lift shafts and adding on glass atriums to build the lifts.  That is where one's costs increase.</p></speech>

Last week, we talked about universal design, houses and wheelchair-liveable homes in the context of adaptable construction.  The groups represented were of the view there were certain practical issues regarding some of the second- and third-floor buildings, because of their limited size, existing staircases etc.  There should be full accessibility, however, where building is starting from scratch on a greenfield site and where work is being undertaken on the ground floors of commercial properties.</p> <p>  Regarding the work being done by the ICSH, how can we encourage more builders to get into this space?  If the ICSH has been able to do this and has found it a viable approach that can be done affordably, then this type of work would probably suit small builders rather than large commercial building outfits.  What do we need to do in this space to make it more attractive?  The census figures are coming in and possibly 160,000 homes are vacant.  We would of course have to break that figure down.  Some of these homes are perfectly liveable.  They may be holiday homes and people might be working from home.  What does Mr. Doyle suggest we could do to assist the ICSH and others in this regard?</p></speech>

We came across 204 vacant homes.  When we took out those houses included under the fair deal nursing home scheme, those that were the subject of a dispute and those owners who were just not interested, we were then down to about 24 or 30 houses.  Having the keys to 24 or 30 houses in every community and town like Monasterevin, however, could get us to the required numbers of homes.  It will not be possible to get the numbers in one go, but it will be possible-----</p></speech>

Carrot-and-stick approaches could be used.  The vacancy tax could be increased.  If we leave out all those properties I mentioned, there were 24 owners interested and ready to go.  The Government schemes are in place.  Those are particularly appealing to small builders.  In Athy in County Kildare, and I keep talking about County Kildare because I live there, we were able to bring back into use several prominent disused buildings and that work was done by small builders.  The aspect we must look at here is the VAT rate.  If these are purely social projects and we are revitalising disused buildings, getting rid of dereliction and helping the environment, then many boxes are ticked.  In this context, there should be some type of reward or leverage in respect of reducing the VAT rate.</p></speech>

All the schemes I am talking about are doable with two-storey buildings.  Regarding tackling third storeys and above, we need changes.  Regarding the project I mentioned in the context of Dublin City Council, for example, and no disrespect is intended to that body, we had to make every floor and every level accessible.  It was required that 100% of the occupancies were accessible in respect of disability, ageing and other similar issues.  The work was undertaken on that basis.  I am not sure whether we need that level of occupancy to be possible all the way up, because that increased the costs and the technical work required.  It is also extended the length of the project.  In schemes where it would be possible to stipulate that 66% of occupancy was fully accessible in the context of disability, we would surely think that would be doable.  If we were to go to any European capital city, every small space available is being used.</p></speech>

Regarding social housing in Limerick, such a policy would discriminate against many people.  The reason is we cannot even build social housing because we have no infrastructure.  The Land Development Agency, LDA, was referred to a few minutes ago.  It is only looking at locations within a 15-minute proximity of Limerick city, which includes Croom, Adare and Patrickswell.  Everything else is counted out.  This leaves out more than two thirds of County Limerick.  There is no sewerage capacity in Dromcolliher, Hospital, Kilfinane or Askeaton.  Therefore, bringing this measure in, with all the best will in the world, is not going to build social houses in County Limerick because there is no capacity.</p> <p>  Then we have people who want to build houses themselves.  Those supplying their own sites, sewerage capacity and water supply and building their own houses are paying 13.5% VAT.  Those people are no burden on the State at all.  On one hand, then, it is being suggested we should have a 0% VAT rate on social housing, while on other hand, these people who are no burden on the State should continue to be charged a VAT rate of 13.5%.  Those building an average house of 2,000 sq. ft in the countryside, which is a nice-sized house there, pay approximately &euro;40,000 in VAT.  Mr. Doyle wants people living in the towns and cities to pay a VAT rate of 0%.  Even then, this could not happen in Limerick because we have no infrastructure.</p> <p>  Regarding Croom, I spoke to a developer on the way here this morning.  He is waiting on Irish Water to provide a water supply.  When we had representatives from that company before this committee, they gave us guarantees that things would be put in place for phase 1 of this development of 56 houses in Croom.  Those are being held up.  We were told those houses would have a water supply and that contracts would be in place in this regard for the first quarter.  The contracts have been signed by the contractors, but there is still no water supply.  This site is 15 minutes from Limerick city and 56 houses are being held up.  There are also contracts for 24 houses and 12 houses and they also cannot be built because there is no infrastructure.  This initiative we have been discussing will benefit people where there is infrastructure, but it will not benefit the people I represent in Limerick.</p> <p>  Another point mentioned by Mr. Doyle, and one I agree with, was living over shops.  An undertaking was mentioned where four or five shops that were never used were removed and the buildings done up.  We stopped that in a couple of towns in Limerick.  We want to rebuild towns and villages.  In one of the locations I referred to in Limerick, taking out the shopfronts that were not being used would have meant we would have been left with only three shops on the main street.  We had more housing, but we could not then encourage people to come back in to open sustainable businesses.  Even though we were going to have extra footfall, we were not going to have any businesses.  The situation was encouraging people to build shop units outside that town.  Shops would have been taken from the main street and brought out to the outskirts of the town.  I agree that people should live over shops.  I do not agree, however, that shopfronts should be taken away.  I believe everything should be done on the second and third storeys in this regard.</p> <p>  I should have mentioned at the outset that I am a building contractor.  I was on the site this morning before I came up.  I am on sites all day, every day before I come up to Dublin.  I can see first-hand the weekly price increases.  I got a letter last week notifying me that the price of insulation produced by Kingspan was going up by 25% on 1 July.  The situation is out of this world.  Last week, I said that prices in Limerick were at approximately &euro;180 per square foot.  Now, they are close to &euro;200 per square foot.</p> <p>  Another thing is the cost of trades.  For the first time, I had a stall at the Charleville agricultural show last weekend.  Many young people told me they could not afford to do their apprenticeships or to go to work.  Those included apprentice blocklayers and plasterers.  Young people of all ages, and many girls and young women, came up to me.  It was not only those young people and their parents who were talking to me but also younger children aged 13, 14 and 15.  They were now feeling the pinch because they could see their parents feeling it.  Now, these children are starting to feel it as well.  They were at an agricultural show.</p><p>A total of 98% or 99% of the machinery there comprised fossil fuel vehicles and machinery that was made using fossil fuels.</p><p> That brings us back to building.  Housing for all must mean housing for all.  We cannot exclude social housing or people who want to buy homes.  We cannot discriminate against people.  We need to build a lot more social housing.  I want to build social housing and rebuild our towns and villages in Limerick.  My hands are tied because of the lack of vision from previous governments which have not invested in infrastructure.  We have Croom and some capacity in Kilmallock, Newcastle West and Adare.  After that, we are gone.  Over two thirds of people in County Limerick have their hands tied, so to speak, which means social housing cannot be built there.</p><p> As I said, I am a building contractor.  A person contacted me yesterday regarding five houses in a town.  The person contacted the local authority to tell it they would build the houses and come to an agreement, but the local authority told them it has enough houses.  We have a housing crisis.  I have received four phone calls from people who have said they told local authorities they would build houses for people with special needs.  They have sites to build on, would come to an amicable fee and build housing, but local authorities have told them-----</p></speech>

We represent the Irish Council for Social Housing.  For us, it is all about social housing so I ask the Deputy to forgive me if we have not talked about other housing.  I am well aware of the needs of those who are working full-time, perhaps have two jobs, and yet still cannot afford to buy or cannot find somewhere to buy.  For the purposes of the council, we are involved in social housing.</p> <p>  The trust is refurbishing four units in Askeaton in Limerick.  We are developing 12 units in Mallow Street and are turning an old pub in St. Joseph's Street into four apartments.  We are doing that work on existing sites.  There are more such sites out there where we could use the existing infrastructure.  If we allowed a reduction in the VAT rate to 5%, as happens in other jurisdictions, to incentivise people to reuse what is already there, that might very well give us the infrastructure we need.</p> <p>  We face the same frustrations at times with the ESB and Irish Water.  The development in Mallow Street involves an old Office of Public Works, OPW, building with infrastructure in place, and we are turning it into 12 units which will provide social housing to people in Limerick city.  We recently signed for 12 units in Charleville.  The infrastructure is already in place for most of the units we are signing for.  We are bringing units back into use.</p> <p>  I am glad the Deputy gave me an opportunity to come back on disused commercial buildings.  I fully support and agree with him.  There is no way that the Peter McVerry Trust or any social housing provider wants to decimate towns and villages by taking out what little commercial activity they have.  In the example I gave in Kilbeggan, we would not touch the main street.  The main commercial activity in areas like Kilbeggan will remain untouched and people can continue to shop there.  My point referred to commercial units on the edge of a town that have never been occupied.  If they were occupied, they would compete with businesses in the town centre.  Turning such buildings into nine units of housing brings more footfall into existing units.</p></speech>

He referred to 204 vacant units identified in Monasterevin and said that only 24 owners were interested in development.  Regarding breaking down the other vacant units in terms of fair deal, disputed and, in particular, those who are not interested, can he expand on the non-interested cohort?</p></speech>

There were three areas. The first was fair deal.  The second involved disputes or legacy issues that could not be decided.  In a small number of cases, nobody knew who owned a building and we relied on An Post and others to help with that.  We have a breakdown of all of that information.  The third cohort comprised those who were not interested, and that is where we need a carrot and stick, as the Chair said.</p></speech>

I thank Ms Hegarty and the Irish Council for Social Housing for coming before the committee.  In her statement, she identified the land value trap as a major issue in terms of why construction often stops and we have a stop-start approach.  That approach involves huge costs and major skills losses.  What measures does she think are needed to address the land trap value cost?  It seems to be a particular feature of the Irish housing system.  Does the same happen in other jurisdictions?  What is her take on that?</p></speech>

We have no issue with that.  It is a model we have used very properly in the past.</p> <p>  I would draw a distinction between such a model and an over-reliance on it, whereby it can serve, and function for, the private market.  It tends to follow the ups and downs of the economy and a boom-and-bust cycle whereby the industry will produce a lot and then stall because conditions change.  We will then see a decline in building, followed by an increase.  That often involves a seven-year cycle.</p> <p>  An over-reliance on that model means the whole situation is precarious in terms of delivery.  Traditionally, the public sector evened out that process by ramping up investment in the public sector in a downturn, which maintained employment in the construction industry and meant the State got keener prices when the market was good.  When the private sector picked up again, the State could wind down its investment and construction workers and, importantly, skills could be retained because people would work through the cycle.</p> <p>  In principle, there is nothing wrong with the speculative market.  However, we now have particular conditions whereby there is an over-reliance on this model and limited capacity.  There has been no effort to build capacity in the residential construction sector since the crash.  We have not rebuilt the native small builder sector.  There have been high barriers to entry.  It is been very difficult for such builders to get finance and land.  That means it has been difficult for builders to start building.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to smaller and more regional builders, turnkey operations, and the comment that houses would not be built if it was not for the State stepping in and buying them as turnkey properties.  The reason they would not have been built is because smaller developers find it very difficult to get finance.  That has been a barrier.  In effect, rather than procuring housing through contracts which have mechanisms for dealing with inflation for builders and all of the things that traditionally would have been in place to help the current situation, the State has gone for a model whereby it will agree a fixed price at the beginning, be it on a Part V, turnkey or other such arrangement.  That was all very well when the conditions were stable, but it is not working when they are not.</p> <p>  We need more sophisticated mechanisms to manage that because builders have real costs.  Keeping people on their knees or putting them out of business is not the way to re-establish a national residential construction sector.  The sector has to be supported to regrow and ensure people have good terms of employment, apprenticeships and skills training.  Putting builders into high-risk situations with fixed-price contracts and tenders where the lowest price wins the bid is very damaging to the sector in terms of quality and employment.  It is also risky in terms of how the cycles go because, as the Deputy can see from the feedback earlier, small builders are being pushed into very high-risk conditions due to the fact we do not have contracts for them which have the mechanisms to manage the situation.</p></speech>

I can take from that that the weakness of the public sector side of delivery as a counterbalance and counter-cyclical part of housing delivery is a key issue.  The access, or lack thereof, of small builders to finance for land is a key structural weakness that needs to be addressed, as well as other ways to support smaller builders, and that is a key part of delivery.</p> <p>  In her opening statement, she said the drive for speed and lightweight construction in the short term has not been adequately assessed against the long-term investment need for new housing to be climate resilient, safe and sustainable for the next 100 years.</p><p>I understand that lightweight construction includes using more wood-framed construction, for example.  There are potential environmental benefits to using these materials.  Will Ms Hegarty expand on her concerns in order that I can fully understand them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.795" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022062800002#J00200"><p>To provide some context, there have been several rounds of changing regulations, particularly for apartment standards, since 2016.  I have very serious concerns about the changes to the apartment standards.  This is not just in terms of space being squeezed.  It is also in terms of public health and safety.  As an example, in the build-to-rent sector now a two-bedroom apartment has 20% less a volume than it would have had under the early regulations.  This is a public health issue in terms of the pandemic, people's health and ventilation in buildings.  We have also changed the standards whereby apartments are located down both sides of a single corridor in a hotel style.  This means that cross-ventilation is no longer possible in the majority of apartments.  Travel distances to fire escape stairs have been increased.  Lobbies have been removed.  Kitchens have been separated from central corridors and bedrooms.  All of these cumulative changes have not been adequately assessed in terms of the longer-term implications.</p> <p>  In terms of the lightweight construction, there needs to be more of a balance.  Policy is being driven by speed and cost, without really stepping back and saying that whatever we invest in housing now, and it will be considerable, has to be in housing that we will still have in 100 years' time and that will still be sustainable and usable in 100 years' time.  Many of the decisions are being made on spreadsheets, almost as accountancy, on where costs can be shaved or where a week or two can be taken off the construction.  We live in a climate that is very vulnerable to water ingress and deterioration of fabric.  It is very damp.  We are not used to denser housing in terms of fire safety.  We have a poor record where we have had denser housing.</p> <p>  We are now moving to hyper-dense housing without balancing the requirements for it.  In some cases we are moving to lighter construction, and I include timber-framed terraced housing in this, without an adequate assessment of whether we have robust enough quality controls to ensure that it is safe and well built.  More broadly, in the rush to deliver numbers, perhaps sight is being lost of the main objective.  Any new house built will have to stand for quite a long time and the mortgage relating to it will have to be paid back over a long period.  We do not want to risk a situation where we are still paying for some of these houses when the buildings are no longer habitable.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, there are examples where it has not been done properly.  I would not have full confidence that all of the lessons have been learned yet.</p> <p>  Ms Hegarty referred to six storeys being cost optimal.  With regard to reasonable density, a very strong argument has been put forward by others, including Lorcan Sirr and the Irish Home Builders Association, that sometimes it is better to have duplexes with a ground-floor apartment than four-storey apartment buildings.  In these three stories very reasonable density can still be achieved.  It can also be more cost-effective which means it can be more affordable.  What are the views of the witnesses on the three-storey duplex model and the six-storey apartment model?  Is there a strong case that we should be looking at three-storey buildings with duplexes if four-storey apartments are not affordable to build and, for the slightly higher options, we should be looking at six storeys?</p></speech>

I will run through my questions quickly.  Mr. Doyle made some very interesting points on developments that were priced in 2018 and 2019 being impacted by inflationary costs and pressures.  I am aware of some social housing projects that were priced and have not gone ahead.  Essentially, the developers involved have pulled out because they cannot afford to build.  Does Mr. Doyle have indicative figures or lists of developments where this is happening?  Does he have the number of developments and social housing units impacted?  I am aware of one case in D&uacute;n Laoghaire where the builder pulled out.</p> <p>  Both witnesses identified that this goes beyond the inflationary costs of construction and I am interested in teasing this out.  It goes more into cash flow and financing.  This is something arising for builders, developers and home buyers.  Do people have access to money?  They could afford to pay back loans but they are not able to get them.  Builders are having cash flow problems.  Developers feel that the risks involved in certain developments are too high.  What changes would the witnesses make?  What proposals do they have on financing and cash flow to free up these blockages and problems?</p> <p>  To come back to the costs arising from connections, especially Irish Water connections, is there a particular problem or blockage that Mr. Doyle can identify?  Are the costs associated with it prohibitive?  Ms Hegarty made some interesting points on house price increases and the regulatory impact.  I went to the links in the footnotes to see if I could click into them.  Will Ms Hegarty send them to me?  There are quite a number of footnotes in her submission.  It would be handy to be able to click on the links to get an idea of the context of where they are coming from.</p></speech>

By and large, we hear that most people who won the tenders are delivering on them.  They are concerned and giving out, but they are delivering.  We do not have a big list of defaults.  What we have been working on with the Department for new and upcoming tenders is that there will be a cushion whereby people can go back and seek unforeseen costs.  Most people are delivering.  The bigger issue, as I said earlier - I am not sure whether the Senator was here - is with regard to planning for the 2023 and 2024 pipeline and whether people will commit to a fixed tender price when there is so much uncertainty.  This is the challenge.  We are delivering and our members are not reporting any lack of delivery.</p> <p>  Irish Water costs are a challenge.  There was one particular project where changes needed to be made and a second application had to be made.  The costs changed between the first application and the second application.  Everybody is aware of the cost.  We are not having as many problems as one of the Deputies mentioned earlier with regard to Irish Water connections now because there is a representative from Irish Water on the high-level working group the Minister has put together and it is working.  We probably need the same level of representation from the ESB for connections as we do from Irish Water.  Irish Water will make its own case, but I would say, and this is anecdotal, that the costs for Irish Water and ESB connections are very high and add significantly to the overall costs of a project.</p><p>We need to eliminate this thing where you are penalised if changes are recommended by engineers or if there have been unforeseen changes to the site.  I do not think some of the costs were justified.  You were always making a fresh application, and it was a different rate from what you had previously.  We need to watch that.</p><p> When it comes to finance, many developers and people can only get the finance they need if it is a CAS or CAS-funded project with an approved housing body.  That goes back to what the Deputy from Limerick said to the effect that social housing schemes people may be able to get the money because they have the backing of a Government scheme, but small builders who would, in years gone by, on a site on which they would have built three units, made a profit on one and put that into the next site, are not getting the finance.  Our other speaker has said that as well.  We need to give greater access to finance for those smaller developers and builders to build one, two or three houses on the edges of towns and villages.</p></speech>

It can be a fantastic resource.  Where other funding is not coming forward, HBFI has funding and the relevant mechanism, but is not that well known.  I have spoken with our marketing people and said to get it into our next conference and do a bit of marketing.  We engage with small builders and landowners and if they can engage directly with HBFI in a separate commercial transaction and agree on terms, while they have a guaranteed contract with us, it is a way of bringing product to market and getting funding, but we need to press that home.  HBFI has increased exposure recently but it is still not enough and these are desperate times.  We all know privately, individually, personally and commercially that lenders do not just lend money any more.  They assess risk and they do not want to be in the business.  If banks could get out of doing mortgages, they would not do them.  That risk management around lending has been the case for a long time.  We have a great relationship with the Housing Finance Agency regarding how it services into our sector and provides loans.  HBFI should concentrate on social and affordable housing.  There is work we could all do to improve that.</p></speech>

I am waiting for Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; to return from the D&aacute;il, but can we go back to the question Deputy O'Callaghan asked about apartments.  The evolution-of-space graphic Ms Hegarty has is interesting and shows starkly where we were in 2020 in terms of apartment sizes.  I have often heard statements that people do not want to buy or live in apartments.  It is often seen as a transitional thing.  It is all about home ownership and the three-bed semi.  That is no wonder when we have apartment standards of the type that are in place.</p></speech>

One is that our space and general standards are poor.  Second, we have a poor history of safety and build quality with apartments that has not helped.  We have not had an objective of more dense housing that is suitable for families, though half of our households have children.  The apartment standards we have, including those that were downsized in the context of studios and very small homes, are geared to a certain age cohort who are probably not in those buildings most of the day, are working and need somewhere to sleep.  They are certainly not geared toward family living or people who spend more time at home, such as the elderly or those with disabilities.  That is a major disincentive.</p> <p>  The problem is that the policy has favoured two types of housing, neither of which is really sustainable.  One is commuter-belt housing for families at low densities, which means that people are driving, it is damaging the environment, eating up agricultural land and demanding of new infrastructure.  The second is hyper-dense, inner-city apartments.  Dublin City Council had more sustainable apartment standards that looked to accommodating a broader range of people over the long term in liveable buildings, but we have now moved to incredibly dense buildings.  It is the same density as Shanghai on some sites.  It is difficult to live in those buildings at such a northerly latitude where you do not get daylight and sunlight and ventilation is difficult.  You are living very close to neighbours because the space standards are so low.</p> <p>  What is sometimes called the missing middle is a sustainable density that is neither of those.  It is about making inner suburbs with buildings that have a density of between three and six floors, that are geared not to one demographic but to a broad range of demographics in mixed communities and that are family friendly.  The latter means that there are amenity spaces.  At that density, you can support public transport and have shops and schools close enough for people to walk.  That model is common.  People would be most familiar with the Netherlands having that type of density where planning is carefully managed.  Unfortunately, neither of our models, the dense apartments we see in SHDs or the commuter-belt housing, constitutes a sustainable housing future.</p></speech>

We have two extremes.  We are still doing a lot of low-density, unsustainable development, as well as poor-quality, high-density developments with which there are numerous problems.  We should be landing generally on three to six storeys in most areas.  That would make sense in terms of having a good-----</p></speech>

We could achieve a huge amount in that range in most areas.  That is Ms Hegarty's view.</p></speech>

Much of the new development has gone to the other extreme.  People have also confused height with density.  You do not need height for a sustainable density.  Prior to the deregulation, Dublin, for example, had between six and nine storeys permitted in most of the city, which is probably about the right range for liveability and optimising construction costs.  At those kinds of densities, you can phase a development more easily, build in slices and occupy the building.  A difficulty with the very dense new SHDs is they are incredibly difficult to finance because they cannot be phased.  By removing stairs and lifts, it makes it very difficult to phase the development.  That means hundreds, notionally, of complete ready-to-occupy units that cannot be occupied until the rest of the building is finished.  The developer then has to carry the finance costs for much longer for all of those units.  All these things, rather than reducing size and cost, were done simplistically and have added to cost and made development more risky on those sites.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses and apologise for coming in and out while carrying out my important role as a super-sub for Deputy Gould.  I am a poor imitation of a Corkman.</p> <p>  I will follow up on some of what has been said.</p><p>I find it very interesting that height is not necessarily density.  Every local authority is speaking about compact growth and almost every developer is adding a little more height so he can take something off to then be able to get what he actually intended through.  We all know the difficulty that we do not necessarily have the planning piece in play for the type of homes we would like to be delivered, without even getting into the numbers.  That is one thing.</p><p> Has the relationship with councils changed in the last while?  My local authority in Louth at one stage almost deferred all building to AHBs on the basis that they could draw the money down more easily and the council was not going to be encumbered, as the council saw it, with having to stump up the money for maintenance because the local authority had an insufficient budget for that.  In the last while, however, it has got its own targets and I am told in some cases it is pushing some of the AHBs away and is seeking to take that on itself.  In fairness, that is okay.  Once we have the funding streams for maintenance in place, I would be delighted with that.  I believe there is a wider issue around estate management, but I will return to that piece.</p><p> They all have said that fixed contracts is the difficulty.  I think Louth local authority's build for social housing this year, between AHBs and itself, is to be 650.  We heard it was going to be 400 and then one of the councillors told me the other day, and I met the director of services two weeks ago, that it could be 300.  They said it is not so much that people cannot get workers but that they cannot get supplies.  Again, nobody wants to take on contracts.  What are the witnesses' view on the tendering systems?  The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, has spoken about F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale Des Ing&eacute;nieurs-Conseils, FIDIC, contracts and I believe there is another contract too.</p><p> I have asked enough questions.  They would probably take 45 minutes to answer but I ask the witnesses to do their best.</p></speech>

The Land Development Agency, LDA, has targets and the approved housing bodies have targets.  However, the targets have risen hugely in response to needs so there are enough to go around.  The main thing is that we are not in competition with each other and that we are not chasing the same site, development or turnkey.  That would be counterproductive.</p></speech>

I am sorry to interrupt, but I am terrible and I always do it.  The fear there always was with AHBs was the fact that down the line, the AHB owns the asset.  What happens at that point in time?  It is something that arises regularly at council meetings.</p></speech>

We have approximately 1,000 units and we operate in Louth, Limerick and so forth.  We are not empire building anyway.  On many an occasion over the years we would look at a site or a property and the council would say it is already looking at it, or we might say we are looking at it and the council might say that Fold Ireland is looking at it and it is more advanced in doing that, so we would pull back.</p> <p>  The local authorities have their targets.  They are very familiar with our targets and our pipeline.  They know where we are operating and where we plan to operate.  The challenge for the future is that we need to know where the local authority is operating and where its pipeline is going so we do not all accidentally waste time looking at and investigating similar developments.  Time will tell on that but there is something of a challenge there now because we now have the local authorities, the LDA and ourselves.  We need to make sure it is not a competition and it is not about who gets the biggest portfolio.  We are growing units and we have made a significant contribution.  Our members have 50,000 units across the length and breadth of the country.</p> <p>  The one thing it is safe to say the councils will not be going after is the specialist units for Housing First, the specialist units for disabilities, the specialist units for seniors and the specialist units for Travellers.  That is where they will need our help.  Even this week the Irish Council for Social Housing together with the Department co-hosted a meeting on Traveller accommodation.  In my opinion what we will see in the targets for local authorities in the next year will be in the general units.  Is it fair to say that Ms Donaghy?</p></speech>

What we have now is a more streamlined approach across the supply chain of social housing right from the top.  The local authorities have a tracker.  All the housing bodies engage and we have a protocol with the various local authorities in whose areas we want to work.  It is a process whereby we apply and say what our capacity is both in terms of ability to deliver and the financial capacity.  We put in a bid for what we can deliver, whether it be five houses or up to 100 houses.  It is up for renewal at present and we are working collectively with the local authorities to get the new protocol in place, and the Housing Agency is co-ordinating that.</p> <p>  Then there is the tracker.  If somebody came to me with a site today and the person was at the Peter McVerry Trust with the same site, as soon as I telephone the local authority it will tell me that the Peter McVerry Trust was there first and it has an engagement there.  We do not want to compete with developers, housebuilders and landowners.  That will only end up pushing up the price.  Likewise, the local authorities call the shots because they are the sanctioning authority for all our funding through CAS, CALF and the payment and availability, P and A, agreement.  They have to sanction everything that we do.  There is absolutely no way we will be competing with them.  If they have the finance and want to take the units on, we have to let that go because they are our bread and butter and are bigger than us.  We work very well with the local authorities.  We engage with them and make sure that what we are delivering is what they want, is going to meet the needs of the people on the housing waiting list and can enhance the communities in which we operate.</p> <p>  Housing is our main gig; that is all we do.  We can bring forward a very professional housing management and maintenance service that is dedicated to and bespoke for the client group with which we are engaging.  We work very well with the local authorities and we are happy to look at any opportunities they may want us to look at, for example, if they think it is specialist they will ask us to look at it because it is not really for them.  Likewise, if it is a Part V or something they want to do themselves, that is fair.</p></speech>

The witness spoke about dealing with specific cohorts and so forth where the AHBs may have needed additional resources.  An awful lot of people blame local authorities and say they have not delivered for them because somebody ends up living beside a difficult neighbour, to put it nicely.  However, the fact is the local authorities cannot access the resources.  They do not have a set of rules which they can determine with regard to estate management and the like.  The AHBs can to a greater degree and even, not that I am calling for this, go down the road of eviction where it is necessary.  If the local authorities do so, those people will stay on their books, for want of a better term.  Does Ms Donaghy think there is a need for any change?  My view is that there is a lack of resources to deal with the huge issues we have.  It can create real difficulties and people can be unfortunate with who is living beside them.</p></speech>

One of the most challenging areas of housing is housing management and I take my hat off to people who do that job daily.  It can be very frustrating.  In Ireland, there is a reluctance to use the ultimate sanction of eviction.</p><p>That is an area to which we do not want to go.  We want to support tenants to remain in their homes.

Ms Donaghy said that Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, needs to be publicised more and there needs to be more engagement in it.  I would be happy to look at that on behalf of people who approach me for housing and who went to local authorities who have said that they are not interested in the area.  I would be interested in getting contact details for that.  Were Ms Donaghy to email me afterwards with the details, I could engage and then I could help people.  This could be a way of bringing in housing.  It might be a way of getting them into the housing market.  I would be delighted to help in that way myself.  It will also help cash flow.</p> <p>  Mr. Doyle mentioned Askeaton and the refurbishment of four existing units.  They have been waiting for 33 years on an upgrade on the sewerage system in Askeaton.  It is supposed to be in 2026, that is the next time.  What is there at present is broken.  I compliment the Irish Council for Social Housing for doing up the building in Askeaton but it is being connected back to the existing broken system.  It is an environmental problem in itself.  We have that in all other areas as well.  </p> <p>  On the issue of bringing older buildings back into production, Kilmallock has 14th-century listed buildings.  However, there is one conservation officer in Limerick.  He has only so much time to go out and to visit these buildings.  For people try to bring buildings back into production in the likes of Kilmallock is a costly experience.  I actually worked on the credit union in Kilmallock recently.  It took us two years to complete it with conservation in order to bring it back into production.  I would love to see the likes of Kilmallock rebuilt and going back into production.  There are many buildings there that uneconomical to rebuild.  However, I would love to keep the street structure and to modernise the back of them.  Once they are not an iconic building, I would like them to be brought back in a more sensible way.  This is so they will work for the people and get people and footfall back into the towns and villages in the likes of Limerick again.  </p> <p>  I would like to hear more about HBFI and about how it can help people from a financial point of view.

We were talking about it with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, in the D&aacute;il last week.  He said that never had as many applications gone through planning as have done so in the past 12 months.  He is actually right but not even a quarter of them will be built.  That is my worry as so many planning applications are going through.  Much of the surge in planning was from the change in the planning laws.  Everybody was looking for planning, no matter where they were.  They were trying to get it back in.</p> <p>  The issue of rising of buildings arose in a discussion I had on site this morning.  I had it with a quantity surveyor this morning.  There is the matter of rising of buildings to a third storey.  People imagine that when a first storey and second storey are done, the third storey will be much cheaper to put on.  The only basic costs that you are actually saving in this situation is on the foundation.  Everything else has to be covered, such as fire regulations, concrete floors and it depends on what you are going on.  The higher you go, the more expensive it gets.  The lower you are, the cheaper the build.  Once you pass the second storey you are into a different world.  Again, the more we can do to help people to finance that side of it, the better.  Many buildings could be built if the proper financial packages and if the right agencies were put in place.  I want a situation whereby if a local authority states it does not want a particular building and if a certain agency is looking for it, it will feed back into the housing people.  If Ms Donaghy can give me the information, I will go back out and encourage the people.  </p></speech>

The Irish Council of Social Housing has 50,000 units.  Every year, we do a community awards scheme.   We look at best practice and what our members are doing in best practice.  That is available on our website.  It is worth five minutes on that website, because some of the awards that have been won over the last couple of years have been for the very types of buildings that the Deputy is talking about.  They have been bringing back old convents and old monasteries.  The Peter McVerry Trust itself brought back an old Dominican priory in Athy, for example.  There was a community hall chapel there, and we brought that right back.</p> <p>  Under the social end of things, you have to go tender.  Within the tender scheme, you have to have a grade 2 conservation architect.  The architect that we use, for example, was the architect who rebuilt St. Mel's Cathedral in Longford when it had been destroyed.  I think that was the biggest capital project that had been ongoing during the recession at one stage.  Millions of euro went into it.  On the social end, we have to have those competencies within our team for the very reasons the Deputy outlined, such as that counties like his own only have one such officer.  What they want to do in respect of the applications is to be sure that everything has been covered and that they are only reviewing it, rather than managing it.</p> <p>  Old convents, old churches and many of those buildings are now being brought back.  Sophia Housing, which is one of our members, has been really good on that.  We have being doing a lot of work on that.  Tiglin did a bit of that in Wicklow.  Cl&uacute;id is doing a bit.  There will be members on the phone tonight saying, "You never mentioned me", but if you go on our website, you will see them.  That is what we need to do.  Even this week alone, I spoke to two religious orders about the possibility to re-use their old building.  That will require us to pay attention to the environment and to conservation.  </p></speech>

This point leads me to return back to Ms Hegarty.  Mel Reynolds attended the committee and spoke about the difficulties in second and third-storey refurbishments in terms of streamlining building regulations.  This is not about reducing standards but about streamlining the process so that one does not have to go through three separate hoops and, if there is a failure at any one of them, that will set the project back to zero.  Does Ms Hegarty have any views on how we make the regulations simpler and the process less expensive, without reducing standards?</p></speech>

In fact, it has been approximately five and a half years since I first appeared before this committee on this issue.  I was also here for pre-legislative scrutiny on a Private Member's Bill in relation to it a couple of years later.  This issue has therefore been around for quite a while.  There are technical solutions that are pragmatic and worth doing.  Again, it is important that we have strong, independent quality controls on that process.  It would not be feasible to demolish every building that exists.  Many buildings have been successfully occupied for 100 or 200 years in this country.  They should continue to be occupied.  We can also re-occupy many of the buildings that are underused.  There was mention earlier of the vacancies that have come up in the census.  However, that does not count buildings that are not in residential use.  There are upwards of 30,000 commercial addresses that are vacant.</p><p>These could successfully be converted with the right regulatory framework and controls, which have previously been a barrier to the over-the-shop and other schemes.</p></speech>

Why has it not been done?  If this were simple and affordable, it would have been done a long time ago.  Are those regulatory issues a barrier?</p></speech>

The figure of 4,000 available spaces for apartments in buildings between the canals came from the Dublin City Council planning department a number of years ago, so some of them may have been reoccupied since.  These buildings can be turned around quickly.  The infrastructure is there.  More importantly, they are integrated into communities and already have services.  People would have public transport, local shops and access to schools in many of these areas as opposed to waiting for new infrastructure to be built for suburban areas in the commuter belt, meaning they are much quicker to turn around.  This relates to the capacity constraints we have discussed in the construction industry.  The same number of people can turn around existing buildings much quicker than they can build new ones.  In this way, we could use the available capacity in the construction sector much more strategically to turn around buildings properly.  In some instances, it would address crisis areas on the social housing waiting lists.  Given that families are favoured, many smaller households of one, two or three people are at the back of the queue for social housing and would be suited to this type of housing.</p></speech>

At one of our sessions, Mr. Odran Reid from Technological University Dublin said that it was not just about the quantum of units being brought back into the sector, but also the economic benefits that doing so would bring to towns and villages, restoring life and vibrancy to those that had been hollowed out.  Why is it not being done, though?  We have been discussing this for years.  We know the vacancy figures and that they do not take into account spaces on second and third floors.  Is the issue down to the multiple ownership of these units?  Is it down to traffic management?  Is it down to the bespoke nature of the work involved, with greenfield construction being easier?  How do we stop these being the reasons?</p></speech>

At this meeting, we have heard the words "builder" and "developer" being used interchangeably.  That speaks to people's confusion around this issue.  Building and development are different businesses.  When the State goes to procure a school extension, hospital extension or new library, it does not approach a developer.  It approaches a builder.  Builders do not have to get finance.  They build under a contract, are given a specific set of instructions, there are mechanisms for price variations in materials and there are mechanisms for delays.  Builders are paid monthly as long as they deliver and the work is done as instructed, meaning that they do not have to finance anything beyond their own equipment and overheads.  That is how the State procures buildings everywhere except in housing.  In housing, it supports the speculative development sector.  This is a policy decision to seek cost certainty and outsource to developers.  Developers take on finance for the development, may not be paid until the end or over a long number of years, and have control over quality, which is why we have had quality issues in the past.  Often, they also control what they deliver, where they deliver it and into which market.  This means that there is a great deal of uncertainty at State level about what it gets back from a housing programme, given that it cannot control the development.</p> <p>  This over-reliance on developers rather than builders means that the State is paying high finance costs.  This has to be questioned, which relates to my suggestion of a full economic analysis.  To my knowledge, there has not been an economic analysis of Housing for All to examine even simple matters like the cost of finance under these various mechanisms, all of which have the intention of outsourcing to the development sector and supporting the property sector rather than the construction sector, which are two different sectors, to recover.</p> <p>  As the committee will have heard from the ICSH, there is significant complexity in the funding mechanisms and approval processes, all of which is adding delays.  Instead of having a year-long approval process through the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, it would be much better to give the people at the coalface in the approved housing bodies and local authorities who know the mechanisms of construction delivery a contingency of 10% or 15%, approve the process and let them manage it.  By delaying for six months, there is probably tender inflation of 10% on some of these jobs, yet we are getting no extra quality for that increase.</p> <p>  We need to draw a clear distinction between builders and developers.  Builders will be available under good contract terms.  The problem that builders have currently is that the contract terms transfer too much risk and there is too much uncertainty in that.  Let us have more clarity around risk allocation and better mechanisms for managing risk through the contracts.  I think-----</p></speech>

There was a group outside Leinster House and I wanted to attend to them.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for appearing before is.  I was here for the meeting's beginning but missed its middle, so I apologise.</p> <p>  One of the principal issues around the cost of delivery is that it impacts our ability to deliver &ndash; that is stating the obvious &ndash; and particularly the affordable part of Housing for All.  The social housing programme is what it is and the numbers are starting to be delivered, but the real question is around the ability of local authorities and approved housing bodiess to take on the new tools under Housing for All to deliver local authority-led affordable housing.  I would like to speak about this structure and how we might reduce costs and inflation.</p> <p>  There are two sites in my area - sites 12 and 14 in Ballymun - on local authority lands.  Under Housing for All, they will be developed by Dublin City Council for affordable purchase housing.  They will all be available to people with incomes of above &euro;36,000 or, if they have larger families, &euro;42,000, but the question that arises is whether their prices will be within the &euro;80,000 that Ms Hegarty, in light of previous developments, has estimated will be the income that someone borrowing from the council will need.  Each of the two sites involves 100 houses and no apartments and one would hope that both of them will be simpler than O'Devaney Gardens or the Oscar Traynor Road site.  If each unit's construction cost to the builder comes in at &euro;400,000 and the subsidy from the State is up to &euro;100,000, the borrower would require &euro;300,000.  Obviously, the borrower would need a deposit of &euro;30,000.  The combined income to purchase that home, be it a two- or three-bedroom house, would be &euro;77,000.  If the construction cost was &euro;300,000, the combined income required would only be &euro;51,000.  That is a significant difference.  The State is providing public land to the homeowner and &euro;100,000 per unit, which is a massive subvention, and the local authority is developing it.  How much more can the State do to make housing affordable on these sites when such vast amounts of public money are going into making them affordable?  These are small, uncomplicated sites.  The purchase price might even be below the building cost, given that one can purchase homes in Finglas and Ballymun for &euro;260,000, &euro;270,000 or &euro;280,000.  The cost of building would be above the market price and we are providing a subsidy of &euro;100,000.</p> <p>  How should we persuade approved housing bodies to start delivering on these figures?  They should be responsible for delivering affordable purchase housing for social mix purposes if nothing else.  If the construction cost comes in at &euro;300,000, the council will be providing affordable homes for people with incomes of between &euro;36,000 and &euro;80,000.</p><p>If it comes in higher, the council will not.  It is a fair assessment.  In the context of an entirely public transaction, where could we save on the costs?</p></speech>

There are very few moving parts in a construction contract.  There is land, build cost and run costs, which include design and consultancy fees, etc.  We can control one of those with State land, so land cost is out of it.  The other two elements are construction costs and run costs.</p> <p>  We could have cookie-cutter fixed design and have that as what we want built, and that would be replicated in many areas.  I do not totally agree with that, and we could have a bit of a mix because we want to build attractive and desirable homes for people to live in.  We can pin down the design and land, so really that just leaves construction costs.  That is about having a partner.  Ms Hegarty spoke about house builders and developers versus builders.  Maybe it is time we bring in a number of them and put proposals to tender.  We could indicate the set designs and we know what is needed for a three-bedroom semi-detached property or a two-bedroom terrace.  We could indicate the size and ensure it meets the standards mentioned by Ms Hegarty; we should build to those and not cut standards.  We could ask parties to tender to that on a competitive basis or negotiate on how much it would cost to build such properties on an open-book basis.</p> <p>  Moving parts would reduce and we can also talk about getting funding, including through HBFI.  Ms Hegarty has suggested breaking down the number of units so instead of building 100 at a time, they could be broken into smaller tranches.  Perhaps they could be done in tranches of 30 so we could pay over stages or builders could be paid as units are released and sold in various tranches.  There are obvious ways of doing this.</p></speech>

That is how I would define affordable housing.  Unfortunately, affordable housing, both in policy and the Land Development Agency, has been defined as a subsidy to bring prices up to a high market level.  That is not scalable because the money will run out before need is met.</p> <p>  If we want to talk about what level the State could have housing delivered at, I agree that a price under &euro;300,000 is doable for three-bedroom houses and two-bedroom apartments.  In order to do that, it must be the objective, and it is not currently the objective.  The current objective is to keep market prices high so investors are attracted to Ireland and subsidise the gap.  We need a rethink in that regard.  I have done a fair amount of analysis on costs over the years, particularly costs from local authority-----</p></speech>

They are in Kildonan and many other sites planned by Dublin City Council that will form public housing on public land.  They are all part of Housing for All.  The worry is that inflation in construction costs will evaporate the affordability we have built in.  I accept Ms Hegarty's point on the &euro;100,000 subsidy and how sustainable it is.  The alternative is to leave housing unaffordable but we are not willing to do that.  We want builders to build in partnership with approved housing bodies and local authorities on public land to deliver the cheapest possible housing.  Effectively, Housing for All delivers below-cost housing on public land.  It is what we are doing.</p></speech>

I suppose we are talking about two slightly different things.  The Deputy is talking about sites where people who can get a &euro;200,000 mortgage may be able to buy their own home.  More broadly speaking, in Dublin the intention is that people will be paying over &euro;300,000 and there would be a public subsidy on top of that, particularly when it comes to apartments.  I can reference schemes like those at O'Devaney Gardens and Oscar Traynor Road in that regard.</p></speech>

They were developed by the previous Government and they did not have the &euro;100,000 subsidy or the affordable purchase fund.  The biggest problem at O'Devaney Gardens and the reason we could only deliver 80% public housing on the site was that the Government of the day was not willing to fund public housing on that land.  The difference in Housing for All is that it is willing to fund public housing on public land.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.880" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022062800002#O02900"><p>I will pick up on Deputy McAuliffe's point because this is an important discussion.  Dublin city will have a problem both on affordable cost rental and affordable purchase under the affordable housing fund.  Deputy McAuliffe outlined price ranges and if we go to the suburbs or the project mentioned by Mr. Doyle earlier, they are generally out of inner urban Dublin sites in various ways.</p><p>That is how you get those.  If you look at the tender prices Dublin City Council has been receiving for its social housing projects of schemes of more than 50 or 100 units in Dublin city, you would be lucky to get &euro;400,000.  In fact they are coming in at &euro;420,000 or &euro;450,000.  Those two sites mentioned will be very interesting to watch because if they are not coming in below &euro;400,000 then we have a real challenge.  Likewise with cost rental.  This is more relevant to the housing bodies.  Currently we cannot deliver cost rental anywhere in urban Dublin because the all-in development cost of those apartments is so high.  Even with the cost rental equity loan we cannot do it.  It is currently not possible, being subject to ongoing negotiations between an approved housing body and the Department and Dublin City Council for O'Devaney Gardens.  The real issue is why in the past couple of years before cost inflation was a matter of discussion, the tender prices that AHBs and Dublin City Council within the canals were getting were so much out of kilter with areas elsewhere, albeit further out from the canals and closer to the suburbs.  If we cannot get those hard costs inside or close to the canals, not just to &euro;300,000 but down to the &euro;270,000s, &euro;260,000s or &euro;250,000s we will not be delivering anything that is affordable for people either to rent or purchase.  That is an important question. </p><p> I have a couple of quick comments and then some final questions.  On Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, I have spoken to many small and medium-sized builders who say not only can they not get access to loan finance but even when they get offers, it is too expensive.  It has shifted its approach to financing large institutional investors rather than the small and medium-sized builders for which that fund was designed.  Not only should the Irish Council for Social Housing, ICSH circulate information to members, I think members should be part of that growing lobby of people in industry saying that HBFI should have added value of the small and medium-sized builder sector and until it does that, it is not doing its original mission.  It is way off course.  I encourage the committee to do that.  On competition, I do not think any of us is concerned about competition between the approved housing bodies and the local authorities for social housing because the relationships are so well established.  Some of us may be critical of some local authorities we think find it easier to give more work to the AHBs but that is a separate battle.  The concern we have, and Mr. Doyle alluded to it, is the increased competition that will come from Project Tosaigh particularly when the pressure is on to deliver targets, and Cost Rental Equity Loan, CREL.  That is the difficulty.  It would be much better if there was a single State agency in each geographical area that everything was filtered through, without being overly bureaucratic.  As the pressure mounts to meet the targets particularly in respect of turnkeys - they are still a large part of delivery, I am not complaining about that - we could get competition albeit from the cost rental side because the LDA will be able to spend more per unit than ICSH members will be; that will be a problem.  If we want the ICSH sector to get into mixed tender developments with social and affordable rental and maybe some special needs in there as well, it will want some of those bigger schemes and the LDA can outbid.  I am not asking for an undiplomatic response but I am just putting that on record.  </p><p> In regard to the speciality housing, I am not suggesting that for example the model the Peter McVerry Trust has at the moment, that kind of pepper-potting particularly of ICSH Housing First, is a problem.  It is not and it works very well.  However, in speciality housing, as we get to larger-scale developments we need to have greater mixture.  That means a mixture not just of what traditionally was called special needs housing.  That is going to require a single point of approval in the Department to make ICSH members' lives really easy or for them to be able to sit in alongside a local authority or another AHB to manage it.  Currently I understand that is really tricky.  We have to tackle that. </p><p> My questions are to Ms Hegarty whom I also invite to come back to the earlier question that was asked.  I think her critique of the speculative level of the large developers in our big urban centres is fair.  I do not think it applies to the same extent outside of Dublin and inner city Cork.  Has she any observations on that?  In regard to Mr. Doyle and Ms Donaghy, I hear Mr. Doyle's remarks on VAT but in some senses VAT in the public sector is circular.  You have to charge it but you get repaid by the State for it and it repays itself for it.  Would it really make that much difference?  If I thought it would, I would be interested in it, but it is a circular payment.  How does Mr. Doyle think that would make life easier for the non-profit sector?  That is the first question.  On the payment and availability agreements, there was a review.  Do we know where the review was done?  Has there been any engagement with the sector or are we still waiting?  As I have said at this committee before, my view is it should be from cost recovery.  It should never be pegged to market rents.  It costs X.  You need X plus management and maintenance, plus sinking fund.  That is the payment and availability.  All I am saying is that its full cost recovery should be the model, whatever it is.  Is there any update on the review?  </p><p> Finally, Ms Donaghy mentioned two acronyms.  We hate acronyms in this committee so we will ask her to explain them, as they sounded very interesting: PVC2000 and GCCC I think she mentioned in terms of different contract types.  If she can either explain them to me or give some information to the committee I would be interested to hear.  To come back to Ms Hegarty, it is the same question.  I refer to that contractual complexity of which she talked, and more sophisticated contracts.  Obviously one of the issues that give rise to nervousness when people like me hear that is how to prevent cost overruns.  The one good thing about the incredibly over-bureaucratic management of costs in the social housing sector is we do not get overruns.  There are cost ceilings above which you cannot go.  I am open to making our contracts more flexible so long as we do not get into the difficulties that other public sector bodies have with albeit more complex projects in terms of egregious cost overruns.  How do we manage that tension?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.882" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla Hegarty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HPJ2022062800002#P00200"><p>That is always the tension in construction contracts whereby somebody does not want to be ripped off by paying too much for something.  The difficulty is if you do not get the balance right you may end up driving costs too low and there is not enough money then to do the job, in which case you get corner-cutting and substandard work, or a contractor who goes out of business.  That is always the tension.  It has to be managed because construction contracts run over a long time.  That is why the people who are at the coalface of delivery, who know how to manage construction contracts, should be given contracts that allow them the mechanism and the tools to do that effectively.  In terms of the State trying to manage costs on that, clearly for the past 15 years there has been a priority in policy for cost certainty over value for money.  The premium that had to be paid for cost certainty has not been that high in a recessionary period and therefore the issues with paying that premium for cost certainty has been masked to some extent.  It has now been unmasked.  The State needs to switch back to value for money and less cost certainty over having cost certainty at the beginning.  That means managing the costs more effectively through the job.  It means empowering with contingencies people who are at the coalface, who can make decisions and keep things moving rather than have the stop-start and delay that adds cost and is a disincentive to people tendering at the moment.</p> <p>  In regard to the smaller and the regional contractors, I accept it is very difficult for people who are trying to build businesses locally, again coming out of recession, to re-establish themselves and build capacity and maybe get work for turnkey or whatever.  As was mentioned, HBFI really has gone in a direction that was not intended.  As far as I am aware it can lend up to &euro;75 million to one entity.  That was not the original intention.  A similar type entity in Scotland has a limit of about &pound;1 million on what it will lend to contractors.  That mechanism could be very useful if the money in HBFI was devolved into broadening the market and establishing a firmer market that is more diversified.  Lending &euro;1 million to a small developer would allow him to build four houses.  That would allow the business to become established, take on apprentices and be capitalised for buying equipment.  Then it sells those four houses and has seed funding that lets it build the next phase.  I would like to see some of that used more strategically with a view to supporting the construction industry and the SMEs outside of Dublin in many cases, where these tender inflation issues are biting very hard.  They are doubly hard because builders are trying to finance the job under terms the State has set for them and they are in an inflationary period with contract terms that transfer the risk onto them.  It is a risk they cannot bear.  The risk for the State now is that people will not want to tender on those terms.  </p> <p>  On VAT, taking VAT off can look attractive in a simplistic way of reducing cost but the mechanism of that in reality may be difficult and unworkable.  Having different VAT rates across different types of construction would be open to abuse and probably administratively very difficult.  I would have concerns about that.  Also, cutting VAT overnight would not necessarily reduce the cost of private homes.  The price of homes would probably stay at the same level and the value of land would go up immediately overnight.  A VAT cut would lead to a windfall for land holders.</p></speech>

In all the Part Vs available, we have never been offered a Part V for Housing First.  That is a missed opportunity.  We need to build that in now to developments, that a certain percentage are Part Vs.  Some 55% of homeless people are single.  Housing First is the approved model and has been supported by every Government for the past number of years and the Part Vs need to come in under that now as well.</p> <p>  On the LDA, it is not factual, but my worry is that we have to communicate everything we are doing in an area.  We do not necessarily know what its plans are in the area.  We just need to make sure and watch that the communication that we have with the local authority continues and we get that with the other players as well.</p></speech>

It is difficult to have different VAT rates in different areas.  However, we have it in the hospitality sector, for example.  What I am particularly interested in is on the repair and lease and the second-hand over-the-shop stuff.  We have caps from Government of &euro;60,000, but that includes all of that.  We could put much more into the unit.  For example, the majority of the money that was available in this scheme could go into the unit rather than having to put some of it into VAT that goes back and it is circular.  In other jurisdictions, such as the UK, for example, it is 5% for bringing back dereliction and over-the-shop and stuff like that.  It might just encourage that.</p> <p>  Finally, the reason the over-the-shops have not been developed inside the canal is because every one of them is an individual application and it takes time.  Some of us are doing it and are prepared to put that time into it, but if we are going to encourage more to do it, we need to be able to do it in bundles and streets.  For example, there needs to be a scheme for a specific street so that we can do it more quickly with five or six over-the-shops together, rather than doing each one separately.</p></speech>

From an embodied carbon point of view, in particular, linking lower embodied carbon residential developments with a reduced VAT rate makes an awful lot of sense.</p> <p>  I was asking about VAT for new build social housing because that is kind of different.

It is not market rent.  I can have a market rent of &euro;2,400.  It is much more beneficial for me if I go in at a market rent of &euro;1,500 and get 95% than going in at &euro;2,400 and getting 50%.  The whole basis of the viability sits with debt-service coverage ratio.  That is where our barometer sits now.  It is not about market rents.  There is no race to the top to see who can get the highest rent.  That does not work like that.</p></speech>

When we carry out a viability exercise, and why I am saying zero VAT on new build as well will help with that, we are looking at our costs from day one for the duration of the loan period, however long that needs to go on, and any housing body.  We are talking about Dublin and it is a very good financial system.  I have worked in Northern Ireland in housing and in London and the surroundings in the UK.  This is the best financial model one can have.  One would be looking for the lifecycle cost and looking at the lifetime of the building, so we would be looking at 60 years minimum.  This model works on a 30-year maximum.</p> <p>  However, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin rightly said, this services our loan.  It also turns the light on for us everyday.  We look at our cyclical maintenance, our day-to-day maintenance and our long-term major repairs responsibilities and a sinking fund.  All of those costs factor in.  There are all sorts of various exercises that we do within organisations because we know what our costs are and whether we tender our maintenance processes or whether we have to go out and do it and-----</p></speech>

The only thing I will say is the local authorities do not get that money at that point in time, which is why we are currently talking about demolishing apartment developments from the 1950s and 1960s.  That grant funding model is both underfunded and incredibly inefficient.  What is good about the P&amp;A and why there is a case to be made why it should just be how we fund public housing generally, is because it takes all of that into account in a much more efficient manner.  If the Irish Council for Social Housing could combine a large-scale affordable cost rental with P&amp;A social housing on the current model, when its cost rental loans have matured, it then has an additional revenue surplus to recycle into the post-40 or 50 years maintenance of and recycling of its stock.

This is taxpayers&rsquo; investment.  They are investing in our social housing infrastructure and we want to make sure that it is well management, well maintained and fit for purpose for future generations.</p> <p>  I wish to come back on the acronyms.  Back in the day when the wheels came off in 2008 and 2009, the construction works management framework was renegotiated.  That was when they came up with Government Construction Contracts Committee, GCCC, contract.  Professor Hegarty probably knows much more on GCCC than I do.  At the time I was coming from a different jurisdiction.  I was coming in after working for a very large housing body in London and we had much more flexibility around procurement.  It was all about value for money, reinforcing what the professor said.  We were looking for value for money, projects that could be replicated and building relationships with developers and house builders.  We had very tall orders of developments to be done.  At that time, they were streamlining the delivery partners in the UK as well, so they were cutting the number of housing bodies down to a minimum.  That is when we had a contract called PPC2000 and it was a partnering contract where perhaps one tendered one&rsquo;s first project.  The benchmarks within the procurement or the pre-qualifying conditions were greater than just cost; they were about replication, reduction and a set of key performance indicators, KPIs, that would be measured and monitored throughout the progress of the project and further projects.  One looked at cost saving as one replicated.  It would work well for something like the-----</p></speech>

At the time that the deregulation happened around 2016-2017, I warned that if Government made something more attractive, all of the money would chase that and it will out-compete everything else.  Effectively, co-living and build-to-rent apartments had standards reduced.</p><p>They were made far more attractive than build to sell and they set the market.  The land value is then determined on the basis of how much rent can be recouped from the number of build-to-rent units that can be fitted on a site.  The height caps were removed, which inflated land value further.  It has meant that model has outcompeted build-to-sell apartments.  The Department started out with a target sales price of under &euro;260,000 for a two-bedroom apartment in Dublin and produced figures to show that was doable in 2016.  Although the intention was to sell two-bedroom apartments in Dublin at between &euro;200,000 and &euro;260,000, the rounds of changes and deregulation have encouraged what we have now, which are these very dense strategic housing developments, SHDs, that are predominantly build to rent.  The rental income from those units over the long term, which is very high, has determined the land value and has basically killed the market for build to sell.  It is a very difficult situation at present.  Since so many of these permissions are on these sites now, unless there are very high returns on sales and rental prices, they are not viable to build.</p></speech>

Of course, we will always need rental units, which are part of any normal housing system.  What can we do to get more apartments built for build-to-rent for families?</p></speech>

That was a misstep.  If we want people to live in apartments for the long term, all of them need to be liveable, with a decent space size, decent safety standards and decent levels of amenities.  All of those were deregulated.  In architecture, we do not always make the distinction between houses and apartments.  We talk about density and the number of people or units per hectare.  We start with that and then we see what form of building that might take.  We then get a mixture of apartments and houses that reaches that density.  As I said, that can be done between three and six floors so that a sustainable density site may have houses and apartments on it.  We certainly have plenty of inner suburban and suburban sites that would be suitable for that.  If we think of the amount of surface car parking in some places and underutilised land, there are certainly opportunities for that scale of development on much of that space.</p> <p>  What we have seen, however, is a lot of permission in the cities for very dense developments that are probably not attractive to purchasers.  It is difficult to see that purchasers would pay &euro;450,000 or more for a two-bedroom apartment in one of these blocks without many amenities when they can get a very good house in suburban Dublin for less.  If we want mixed communities in the city, we have to make these developments attractive to purchasers as well as renters.</p></speech>

If we do not have a build-to-rent standard or a build-to-sell standard, and go back to the higher build-to-sell standard, what would be the result of that in respect of supply and affordability?  I know it is a hard one to answer.</p></speech>

We saw what happened when it was deregulated.  Some of the volume going through An Bord Plean&aacute;la in recent years relates to sites that had permission.  There were sites that had ready-to-go permission for build-to-sell apartments at five to nine floors that were then knocked off track by the raising of height caps, SHDs and build-to-rent standards.  These changes might seem simple on paper but they can be extremely disruptive in the market.  That relates to my earlier point about a risk assessment of policy.  I do not think policy has been risk assessed.  The broader shaking out of this, including the what-ifs and making sure these things are closed off, is very important because in speculation the money will all follow what is most attractive.  We saw what happened with ghost estates.  Just because it was viable to build one estate of so many houses in an area, it did not mean it was viable to build 2,000 of those houses, yet people borrowed, got planning permissions and raised land values.  We then saw it did not wash out.</p> <p>  There is now a concern that the implications of any changes need to be very carefully assessed.  There needs to be a look at transition arrangements relating to that.  My point is there are technical solutions to this affordability challenge and there are solutions to the capacity challenge, but they need to be technical solutions.  It is not enough that there be high-level policy decisions.  There has to be a technical solution involving the people who are delivering and who know where the blockages are.  Broader high-level policy needs to have some vision.  What is the intention for what the housing system will be in 2030 or 2040?  Is it a model where the vast majority of people in Dublin rent, pay a very high rent and there is a Government subsidy for the long term?  Is it the case that, again, we will have an issue with sprawl into the commuter belt?  People do not find that attractive as what they want.  Will we have a surplus of SHD high-density units that are not attractive and that maybe become large developments of social housing that do not have sufficient amenities for residents?</p> <p>  There is risk in all of this.  The policy response has not often considered that what is right for one site may not be right for the city.</p></speech>

It was more that I had seen there was some element of pushback, but it has been said there is enough room for everyone to survive because we do not have enough houses.  We will move on from there.</p> <p>  I was going to deal with what Ms Hegarty spoke about regarding the necessity for economic analysis of the financing of Housing for All but she has gone into a wider issue.  I was going to ask whether anybody has made submissions to the Attorney General's review of planning.  I was thinking specifically about compact growth being in the wrong place but, in fairness, what was talked about earlier would require a review with a greater remit, which probably needs to happen, and is something that can bring us to a solution.  If the representatives could come up with that in their answers to me, I would be only too delighted.</p> <p>  I will also get some sort of answer, which Mr. Doyle was about to go into, regarding estate management.  What is the Irish Council for Social Housing proposing for where we are now?  Do we use the International Federation of Consulting Engineers, FIDIC, or one of those types of systems when tendering for building houses from here on in?</p></speech>

I mentioned there are more than enough targets for all of us to live with.  I have some concerns around communication to make sure local authorities and the LDA know exactly what we are doing and where we are doing it.  We just need to make sure we do not take it for granted and that we keep the communication flow going both ways so that we are not all competing with each other.  There are more than enough targets to deliver on in very challenging times.</p> <p>  The Irish Council for Social Housing has 50,000 members.  We do a residents' survey every two years or so.  The satisfaction rates are very high.  Our speciality is in management.  It is not who we manage but how we manage.  We have specialties in managing clients for which some of the local authorities do not necessarily have the staffing or the resources to follow up on.  There is 24-hour staff availability in some of the specialist approved housing bodies.  There would be a fridge magnet on someone's fridge with the 24-hour numbers.  If a person, or his or her neighbour, is in trouble, or someone is witnessing trouble, people can ring about estate management issues, maintenance issues, anti-social behaviour issues and so on.  Some people ask why we need approved housing bodies and what is different about them.  One of the hidden but very successful differences is that we estate manage very tightly.  We have a very good satisfaction rating among our tenants and very few evictions.  Some of us in the sector never evict at all.  Some do if they feel it is necessary, but our eviction rate is very low.  It is about how we manage and not who we manage.</p><p> The final question was around planning and tendering.  That is a huge challenge.  I would like to see the planning process pay more attention to what the need is rather than what the desire is in a particular local authority.  A total of 55% of the people requiring a house on the social housing list require a one-bed or two-bed dwelling.  We should be looking at more duplexes.  We should be looking at more apartments that are lived in for life.  We need lifetime apartments in which people have space and proper areas to put their bikes or their children's toys and so on rather than trying to squash families into apartments that are built really for people who live in them during the week and travel at the weekend or whatever.  On the planning side, therefore, there is a disconnect at times between what the planners want, desire and demand and what the actual need is.</p><p> Anywhere State funding is being paid for social housing, it should be assessed against three criteria.  I am not necessarily speaking for all members on this, though.  The first is that housing applied for with State funding is in line with the typology of what we need to do, which is one-bed and two-bed dwellings for half of those.  The second is whether duplexes have been considered on the land.  The third is whether the housing has been poverty-proofed.  Members probably have not heard that before but they do it in other jurisdictions.  Has the housing been poverty-proofed?  Some of the housing designs that are going in at the moment have windows from the top of the stairs to the bottom of the stairs.  There is a cost of putting a blind on that.  We see estates where developments have won awards for the designs but the tenants have sheets hanging up on the windows because it is cheaper.  The windows are from floor to ceiling at the front of the building and people just cannot afford the blind.  We provide that in many approved housing bodies but we do not in many council houses.  We need to be assessing against the need, poverty-proofing and the typologies.</p><p> I cannot understand how the State pays so much for housing and does not demand more one-bed and two-bed dwellings within that.  The State is paying for it.  It should be making sure that what we are building is in line with what we need.  Families who are homeless require four and five bedrooms.  Traveller families who are on the housing lists require four and five bedrooms.  We need to be smarter in the planning and criteria for drawing down State funding.</p></speech>

In terms of planning, we work really closely with local authorities.  We only address where housing need is.  In my organisation specifically, we work with older people and we are a specialist older person housing provider.  Therefore, our space standards would be larger.  We have many criteria.  It is not just about space.  It is about useable, effective space that allows people to remain in their property if their mobility or care issues change throughout their lifetime.</p> <p>  We have very close working relationships with local authorities.  We have at times not stuck to planning policy to the effect that 30% must be one-beds or no more than 30% can be one-beds.  We have examples where 100% are one-beds.  We opened what we think might probably be one of the largest housing developments for older people Crumlin in which there are 102 units that are all one bedroom and all social housing.  It was allocated very fast and we worked really closely in partnership with Dublin City Council.</p></speech>

First, it is important to remember the distorted social housing need for one- and two-bedroom apartments at the moment is a factor of how the waiting list and backlog have been managed and that, in terms of sustainable housing in all communities, we need a mix of homes.  It is not true to say we have a surfeit of family homes and we only need small apartments.  That is a recipe for unsustainable growth in the city and, again, pushing families into the commuter belt.  As I said, that is 50% of households.</p> <p>  It is very important that meeting the backlog is balanced out with the needs of family formation and new families, and that adequate-sized homes also accommodate different care needs and disability needs over a lifetime, which are not met by very small housing units.</p> <p>  If the Chairman could give me two minutes, I will read the acronyms into the record if that would be helpful to the committee.</p></speech>

It has a set of contracts that are public works contracts, PWC.  It would be fair to say they are not very popular in industry for any number of reasons, including risk transfer and the fact they are lowest cost bids, in many cases, and tend to result in much adversity and dispute over variations.</p> <p>  Other alternatives are available.  The F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale des Ing&eacute;nieurs-Conseil, FIDIC, contract was mentioned.  That is an international engineering contract that is used extensively worldwide and has its own precedents for resolving disputes and the detail on those.  New engineering contracts, NEC, are also in use in the UK and, increasingly, collaborative contracts that specifically move away from this adversarial claims culture are available now.  It would be extraordinarily helpful if we could move in that direction in construction procurement here because it would de-risk the process for the contractors.  It would give a better mechanism for resolving disputes and variations.  Generally all round, it would get better prices and give more certainty over time for both sides in the equation.</p></speech>

I will call a halt to the meeting now as it is 6 o'clock.  The initial meeting was to do with inflationary costs in construction.  I think we covered a huge amount of ground in that regard.  It has thrown up more questions for us that we must set out in our work themes from September onwards.  We will have to return to this issue of costs in construction.  I do not know where we will be in three months in terms of inflationary costs and potential mortgage interest increases, which obviously create affordability issues for people.</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned poverty-proofing and the poverty assessment.  We tend not to look at transport costs.  A person living in his or her home has destinations to go to, whether it is school, work or for recreation and might be car dependent.  This comes back to compact growth and densification and how we will build the designs in which people want to live in compact growth without this excessive small apartment-type scenario.  Let us get away from that.  We talked about duplexes.  That is an area in which I am also very interested to see how we can get that better mix of design in there.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Hegarty, Mr. Doyle and Ms Donaghy.  That was fascinating and very interesting.  We also invited the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to appear before the committee because, obviously, they are the lead Departments in the construction of affordable and social housing.  We will probably have them in in September and then, after that session, we may have a fourth; I do not know.  We would hope to compile a report, however, a copy of which we will certainly issue to the witnesses.  I thank them for their contributions and help to the committee today in dealing with this issue.</p></speech>

We are meeting today for Committee Stage of the Garda S&iacute;oc&aacute;na (Compensation) Bill 2021.  There are 35 sections and there are no amendments so this should be a relatively straightforward consideration.</p></speech>

As the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, mentioned on Second Stage, there are a few minor amendments needed to the Bill, which she intends to introduce on Report Stage.  These relate to sections 11 and 16 and the requirement for the form of the application to be prescribed by way of regulation.  It is proposed to remove this requirement and to allow the Garda Commissioner to determine this.  This is because the form will be closely linked to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, form, which is subject to changes from time to time.  It would be too difficult to make regulations each time there are changes to the PIAB form.</p> <p>  Department officials are also examining whether a small technical amendment may be required in section 2(2) due to the likely commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015.  I wanted to make Deputies aware that this is another amendment which we may need to introduce on Report Stage.  The Minister had hoped to have these amendments drafted by now but it has not been possible to have them ready in time.</p> <p>  I wish to address the question of the extension of the scheme to civilian staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which was raised by some Senators and Deputies.  The Minister and I have looked at this matter and officials have engaged with stakeholders on an extension to the scheme.  A number of difficulties have arisen in this regard due to the status of civilian staff as civil servants.  The interaction between this scheme and existing occupational injuries schemes and supports that already apply to them is not straightforward.  To attempt to extend the scheme now will delay the passage of the Bill significantly.  We all can agree that there is a need to progress this Bill as soon as possible, as reform of the Garda compensation scheme is long past due.

It is the final draft for 2022 to 2042.  In accordance with the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the National Transport Authority, NTA, recently forwarded a draft strategy to committee for consideration.  I am very pleased to welcome, on behalf of the committee, Ms Anne Graham, CEO, and her colleague, Mr. Hugh Creegan, deputy CEO, NTA.  I thank them for coming in at an unusual time.  Nevertheless, the time does not make it any less important.</p> <p>  I must read a note on privilege.  Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.  Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks.  It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members of the constitutional requirement that they be physically present in the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings.  I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not able to meet this constitutional requirement.  Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be reluctantly asked to leave the meeting.  In this regard, I ask any member participating using Microsoft Teams to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making his or her contribution.  Members attending in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p> <p>  I invite Ms Graham to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.940" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022062800002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chair and members of the committee for the invitation to attend.  I understand that the committee wishes to focus upon the Draft Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2022-2042, which I will refer to as the draft transport strategy.  To assist me in dealing with members' subsequent questions, I am joined by Mr. Hugh Creegan, deputy chief executive with the NTA.  As the committee will be aware, the NTA published the draft transport strategy for public review and feedback in November of last year, with the period for submissions running until 10 January last.  The NTA received 1,020 submissions in response to this consultation process.</p><p>The main issues raised, in no particular order, were as follows: ambition and delivery timelines; public consultation and engagement; details of the cycle network plan; fare structure on commuter rail services; Navan rail line and the Dunsany rewilding project; MetroLink and Charlemont station; metro to south-west Dublin; BusConnects network and core bus corridors; details of the DART+ project; delivery of DART+ tunnel; extension of DART+ services to commuter towns; new rail stations; accessibility and catering for disabled people; safety and security of the transport system; equality in transport; and enforcement of traffic laws.  Beyond these 16 main issues, which covered the vast majority of representations made, there were a large number of other matters raised across the spectrum of transport and planning themes.</p><p> All the submissions were carefully reviewed and considered.  Arising from this process a number of changes have been made to the draft transport strategy.  While a considerable number of amendments have been incorporated, many of these are minor in nature and, overall, the amendments have not altered the fundamental features of the transport strategy.  It is also worth noting that a considerable number of the submissions raised items that are more appropriately dealt with at the project development level, rather than at the strategy level.  Many of the changes which have been made are in the nature of clarifications, making clearer the intent of the particular measure proposed.  In other cases additional measures have been added, such as requiring sustainable transport to be a critical consideration in the site selection process for new schools.</p><p> Various additions and changes have been made to the cycle network proposals, informed by issues identified in submissions.  Other sections of the draft transport strategy were expanded to take account of feedback received, such as the section on equality in transport which has received further elaboration.  The draft transport strategy was also updated to take account of additional transport policies, such as the national sustainable mobility policy which was published earlier this year.  In addition, an explicit provision has been included requiring the NTA to prepare and publish a demand management scheme in accordance with the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, within two years of the adoption of the strategy, to ensure the achievement of the transport emissions target for 2030.  In accordance with the relevant legislation, the draft transport strategy has been now been forwarded to the Minister for Transport for his consideration and determination.  We look forward to the outcome of the process and the subsequent progression of the various proposals set out in the draft transport strategy. </p><p> That concludes my introductory statement.  I trust that I can answer any queries that arise.</p></speech>

First is Deputy Matthews, who has ten minutes.  However, I will be quite liberal with the timing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.943" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1626" speakername="Steven Matthews" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022062800002#C00300"><p>The point of this meeting is that the committee has assessed the draft strategy and from this meeting we can make our recommendations or observations to the Minister before he approves the final plan.  That is my understanding, and my questions will all relate to the document provided to us.  I thank Ms Graham and Mr. Creegan for attending the meeting.  They have always been very generous with their time to members and we appreciate that.</p> <p>  I will move to the document that was presented to us.  The first item I wish to raise is the timelines for projects.  Depending on the answer we could make a recommendation to the Minister.  We need very clear and consistent timelines for transport projects.  When the draft strategy was produced there was some confusion and I believe a press release was issued by the NTA clarifying the greater Dublin area, GDA, strategy proposals.  The public and public representatives expect to have clear and realistic timelines for projects.  We have fallen foul of unrealistic timelines in the past.  As well as realistic and clear timelines, there are the different stages within the timelines for the delivery of a project.  For example, where there is a project to be completed by 2040 or 2030, what has to be set out is what the different stages would likely be, such as design, planning, compulsory purchase order, CPO, processes and so forth, so we have a clear breakdown of the different stages within a timeline, the reasons those timelines exist and the rationale behind apportioning two years for planning or two years for design or whatever it may be.  Also, I suggest that a document such as this should suggest ways in which those timelines may be reduced, for example, parallel processes within a project.</p> <p>  There is a section which commits to decide and provide.  It is an improvement on the predict and provide model.  We often look at these projects and say that when we have reached saturation point, for example, on buses, then we will update the rail system, knowing full well that people prefer to travel by rail.  If we went with the decide and provide method, we would probably decide that we are going to put in rail before we wait to exhaust the current transport proposals that are in place.  It is a build-it-and-they-will-come scenario.  I realise the NTA has to support its decisions with evidence and research and that it is public money and must go through a public spending process, but we know from many projects that when it gets built, it gets used and that the use might not be completely apparent or obvious when one builds it.  The Phoenix Park tunnel link, for example, reached very high capacity, much higher than we expected.  Even on the western rail corridor the numbers just shot up.  I would like Ms Graham to comment on the decide and provide aspect because the NTA seems to commit to that, but then it seems to rely on the predict and provide methodology.</p> <p>  The climate emissions target in it is set for 2042.  We raised this previously when the draft strategy was in place.  I am sorry, Chairman, these may not necessarily be questions, but they are points that I would like to have recorded that we could pass to the Minister.  This target is set for 2042.  It sets out the emissions from transport in the GDA to be below one 1 megatonne equivalent of CO2 by 2042.  However, we do not have information on what emissions reductions would be achieved by 2030, which is a Government marker in time when we want a 51% reduction in emissions.  That is not clear to me in this.  In addition, it does not set out clear scenarios.  We will have to cut emissions by 51% across all sectors.  There are a number of ways of doing that, whatever way one is going to slice the sectoral pie or within those sectors themselves.  What would be helpful would be the scenarios that we could suggest or choose to give a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030, and to design a range of options.  Those who decide what options to go with can choose from those options.  Regardless of what suite of measures they may choose in terms of public transport, active transport, demand management or whatever it might be, they could rely on the fact that they can choose the right range of options.  It is much like what one does in energy retrofit of a home.  One is given a range of options which will give the energy cut.  That is what we need to do in terms of emissions.</p> <p>  Regarding how the DTA assesses a project, that is, the way the DTA calculates a project, assesses whether it is going to be successful or deliverable or whether it should invest in it, it appears to focus a lot on time-based savings.  In other words, somebody takes a car journey and the journey takes the person 30 or 40 minutes whereas the alternative might be a ten-minute walk and a 30-minute, 35-minute or 40-minute bus service.  Then, through BusConnects or other improvements, that bus service becomes more reliable with a faster journey time, and measures we might put in place, such as with BusConnects in Dublin, where we might restrict or reduce car accessibility through an area, the car journey time becomes less favourable and the bus and walking time remains consistent.  Does the NTA assess projects on the basis of the cumulative impact of measures that we take?</p> <p>  There is a section on page 172 on roads.  It suggests a link road, the M3 to the M4, parallel to the M50 - I think it is the M50 over-bridge at Liffey Valley - as a parallel or alternative route to cater for accidents or blockages on the M50.</p><p>It is my understanding that the link road was removed from the county development plans of both local authorities but the NTA has still included it in this draft strategy.  Why is that the case?  I know the reasoning for it but I believe it was removed from both county development plans, although I may be corrected on that point.  The proposed road goes through some sensitive areas, which is concerning.  Would that road only be used in the event the M50 was blocked?  What stops us from inducing demand onto that road if we provide it?  In taking traffic from the M50, that road could become just as full and busy as other roads.</p><p> Part of the text of the strategy relates to home zones.  I cannot find the relevant notes but from memory, the draft strategy refers to the vulnerability of users, including children walking to school, cyclists and pedestrians.  The text of the 2021 draft states, "A Home Zone is [a] street or group of streets designed to meet the needs of pedestrians, cyclists, children and residents and where the dominance of the car is reduced."  It is stated on page 181 of the final draft that a home zone is a street or group of streets designed to balance the needs of pedestrians, cyclists and children with those of motorists.  That is a retrograde definition.  I prefer the text in the 2021 draft and suggest we keep that definition of home zones.</p><p> The section on school site selection was also amended.  The 2021 draft included stronger wording.  It stated, "In the site selection process for new schools sustainable transport shall be a critical consideration."  I do not need to read it out; our guests are familiar with the text.  What was produced in the later document is weaker.  I suggest we keep the original drafting of the school site selection definition for school placement.</p><p> On the freight section, is there mention of how we would support rail freight connection in Dublin and the conflict that arose in Dublin Port last year when rail freight seemed to be sidelined?  Has that been analysed sufficiently?  What is required in Dublin Port to maintain rail freight connectivity?  I will return to the issue of freight.  Will I have a chance to come back in?</p></speech>

Members can then take it as a guarantee that we will come back to them.  Rather than 20-minute slots, we will initially stick to ten to allow everyone the chance to come in at an early stage.</p></speech>

Will our guests give the committee an update on Navan rail, where it stands and what the next steps will be?</p> <p>  I am conscious that a number of the submissions related to the Dunsany rewilding project and concerns about route selection.  I am very concerned that no matter what decision is made in that regard, we will end up in a planning quagmire.  Where are we in that regard?  What will be the next steps?  How will issues such as route selection that are related or unrelated to the Dunsany rewilding project be handled?</p></speech>

More granular detail now needs to be developed.  There will, I am sure, be a couple of options on the table.  There will be a consultation and out of that we will select the preferred route.

We are undertaking a comprehensive review of fares on our regional bus services and our regional rail services.  We have spoken many times about the problem where the short-hop zone goes into the intercity rail fares.  There is too big a jump and it is not as fair a structure as we would like.  Work is ongoing to see can we smooth that out and provide a more balanced and fairer move between the short-hop zone and the intercity fares and avoid a jump in price at those boundaries.  That work is still ongoing.  It is quite a complicated piece of work.  We want to be in a position to put forward what is required to be done by the end of the year so that can go into the budgetary discussions because, obviously, an increased public service obligation, PSO, could be required to implement that.  That is where we are on those.</p></speech>

I saw the NTA respond to some of those issues on RT&Eacute;'s "Prime Time" last week.  There are a couple of specific issues I wish to raise.  The NTA has done this review of maximum fares, which will kick in during August.  Ms Graham indicated that there will be a recruitment campaign.  However, I hear very clearly from those in the taxi industry that there are issues related to the ten-year rule and the number of vehicles, more than 5,000, that will be off the road at the end of the year.  The transferability of plates and how it is impacting people who might be eager to transfer their licences is also an issue.  Is the NTA looking at either of those areas?  Will Ms Graham speak to those points?</p> <p>  Public transport providers are eager to take on additional 24-7 routes.  Does the NTA have any immediate plans in that regard?  Parts of the BusConnects plan involve 24-7 routes.  Can these be expedited?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2022-06-28a.972" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Graham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2022062800002#E00200"><p>On the question of the age of vehicles, as the Deputy will know, in light of emergency Covid-19 restrictions, we made allowances for vehicles older than normally allowed under the regulations to operate.  This was an attempt to protect and retain as many drivers and vehicles within the industry as possible.  We still need to focus on maintaining the fleet operating in the market in good condition to ensure quality, however.  That is something we continue to do.  We do not believe that there are significant barriers to entering the small public service vehicle, SPSV, market in Ireland, particularly for the last two decades.  There is no cap on the number of SPSV drivers or the number of licences issued.  Any person or vehicle meeting the prescribed criteria, which we believe are reasonable, may be licensed to provide SPSV services.</p> <p>  In 2011, there was a widespread Government and stakeholder review of the taxi industry.  That was at the height of the recession.  Even then, the maximum age limits for vehicles were considered in depth and subject to full public consultation.  In that same year, given the importance of the matter to the industry, we carried out a separate public consultation on vehicle standards with an emphasis on the question of maximum age limits, which was included in the overall review.  The review found that the vehicle age limit for standard taxis and hackneys should be less than ten years and that the limit for wheelchair-accessible vehicles, WAVs, should be less than 15.  This means that, when a standard taxi or hackney reaches its tenth birthday, it must be replaced with a younger vehicle.  However, this replacement does not have to be brand new.  Most vehicle licence holders tend to choose a replacement vehicle that is three to five years old.  Data from before the pandemic show that 51% of SPSVs were to be five years old or younger at the end of 2021.  This proportion has fallen to 35%.  </p> <p>  With regard to international comparators, the age limits that apply to SPSVs in different jurisdictions vary but Ireland is on the end of the scale that allows for older vehicles.  In the UK, local authorities usually apply either an age limit or an emissions standard.  This age limit rarely exceeds ten years for saloon vehicles.  Where emissions standards apply, diesel vehicles usually must meet or exceed the Euro 6 standard while petrol vehicles must meet or exceed the Euro 4 standard.  In most regions in continental Europe, age limits lower than ten years apply.  A limit of seven years is common in France and Belgium.  We therefore think it is reasonable to ask the industry to return to a limit of ten years on the age of vehicles.</p> <p>  The taxi industry has always raised the issue of transferability.  It is possible to identify a family member to whom a vehicle licence can be transferred on the death of the holder.  We are not looking at any other transferability measures at this time.</p> <p>  On public transport, we have always wanted to extend public transport services, particularly in our cities, and to offer a 24-hour service, seven days a week, across key routes in the city.  As part of the roll-out of BusConnects, we have put a number of such services in place.  Even in advance of this roll-out, we had a number of 24-hour services in operation.  These have proven to be very popular.  We want to extend those as much as possible but whether we can make those increases and alleviate the problems customers and the people of Dublin and our other cities are experiencing at peak times, that is, the two hours on Friday and Saturday night when demand is at its highest, will come down to driver resource availability and funding.</p></speech>

In my opinion, 2011 was a different time.  Vehicles will still have to be tested for suitability and their standard maintained.  Many of these vehicles have been off the road for an extended period because of the Covid pandemic.  The price of second-hand vehicles in 2022 is very different from what it was in 2011.  The availability of electric vehicles at this time is also an issue.  We know there are supply chain issues.  There is a strong argument to be made for an extension.  This would help us in our transition to an electric fleet.  I will leave that with Ms Graham although I may come in again.</p></speech>

I am always happy to meet with representatives of the NTA.  I thank them for their public service.  I want to raise a number of issues.  I raised one of these with the deputy chief executive outside.  We are going to follow up on that.  It related to buses in the constituency.  I thank him for his commitment on that.  I will leave the question of BusConnects and additional routes for that meeting.</p> <p>  I have a question on taxis for both the CEO and the deputy CEO.  I do not believe taxi drivers and organisations are of the view that the NTA is on their side and is protecting them.  There is obviously a dearth of taxis at the moment.  Will the witnesses briefly outline the impact of the Covid pandemic because it is clear that many taxis did not return?  Coming home from Croke Park the other night, I hailed a taxi and then had to hail a second taxi.  The driver would only take cash, by the way.  I only had plastic on me.  The witnesses might comment on that.  As a punter and a real supporter of taxis as public transport, I find that unacceptable.  I also want to represent very strongly the concerns and anxiety of taxi drivers, particularly with regard to what are known internationally as ride-sharing services.  The most popular of these is Uber.  These are not regulated.  Given the shortage of taxis, which has a significant impact on consumers travelling in and out of cities from a safety perspective, without mentioning the movement perspective, I would hope that the NTA shares my view that this is not something we should enter into with our eyes shut.  Taxis are regulated.  There is a certain amount of vetting and other things that people have to go through.  New apps allow people to know who the driver is and provide a record of the journey for them and for the driver, which provides security for people who might feel vulnerable using this aspect of public transport.</p><p>What are the NTA's plans around the shortage of taxis?  I am not sure that I favour the ride-sharing model.  It is a kind of free-for-all thing.  On the ten-year element, in the past two years of Covid when I have requested assistance or remuneration for taxi drivers I have found the NTA challenging enough to deal with in that respect and in communication.  The NTA has the right and entitlement to rebut that.  That was the kind of feeling I had.  It was very difficult to get answers from the NTA and particularly around taxi concerns.</p><p> I took a taxi recently.  The taxi driver had bought a brand-new electric car.  It is not hybrid, it was just electric.  The taxi driver was sharing it with another member of the family.  He said, "We are guinea pigs and it is running 24 hours a day."  It is saving them &euro;250 per month.  The drivers are very pro that and they are very thankful and grateful for the considerable grant but they did have to top it up with a credit union loan.  I have made this point previously in the D&aacute;il Chamber and it applies also to many energy and retrofitting schemes, including much that is in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, space.  The taxi driver told me that they went to the garage they purchased the car from.  Say, for example, the car cost &euro;50,000 and with the grant it cost &euro;30,000: &euro;50,000 is unaffordable to them but &euro;30,000 might have been affordable.  The garage charged them &euro;30,000 for the car and the garage pursued the grant.  I do not believe it is widely known that this is allowable.  Suddenly it makes a new electric car much more affordable because a person can pay for it without the grant included.  It can reduce the price for an electric car for taxi driving from &euro;40,000 to &euro;28,000 or from &euro;50,000 to &euro;30,000.  Is that practice widespread?  Clearly, it is allowed.  Has it been advertised among taxi drivers that if they have X amount they do not need to borrow it and that the garage will pursue the grant?  It makes it much more affordable for taxi drivers.  I would welcome the NTA's comments on that.</p><p> My next question is, very respectfully, directed at the Chairman. For a number of months the metro to south-west group has sought a brief meeting with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications.  The group represents close to 40 residents associations.  The group wants to make a short 30 minute pitch.  They made a pitch to Oireachtas Members in the audio visual room, which was facilitated by Senator Seery Kearney.  They also made a pitch to the Fianna F&aacute;il parliamentary group for Dublin.  They just keep getting acknowledgements but time is running out.  I appeal to the Chairman's very good nature to facilitate this if possible before that the D&aacute;il recess.  It is actually coming to a critical time.  They all know that a metro to south-west is not going to be built tomorrow, and that some of them will never see the sod turned on it.  As a strategic piece of infrastructure they, and I as their public representative, want the National Transport Authority to look at it and take them more seriously.  They have built up quite a body of work on this and especially around where the metro coming from the north will stop in the city.  The committee is familiar with this.  The group's argument is that it goes on to Charlemont and then there is the possibility of it turning south west and serving areas such as Rathmines, Harold's Cross, Terenure, Templeogue, Rathfarnham, Knocklyon, Firhouse and maybe connecting with Tallaght; it becomes a forlorn prospect because of the direction of the boring machine.  There are plenty of issues on the table.  Will the Chairman be able to respond to that request?</p></speech>

On 4 May, in reply to a question from Deputy Steven Matthews, Mr. Creegan stated that for the NTA to look at transport initiatives they must be within the transport plan.  Arising from that I want to look at the transport provisions within the plan.  Section 12 of the plan sets out all the really big ticket items such as the MetroLink to the airport and to Lucan-Poolbeg, and the second line to Bray.  There is no provision in it for the south-west city.  The most recent census figures for those areas show: the south-west inner city population is 49,000; the Rathmines and Terenure population is 42,000; the Crumlin and Kimmage population is 41,500; the Templeogue and Rathfarnham area population is 43,000; the Ballyboden and Firhouse area population is 42,700; and in Tallaght the population is nearly 68,000 people.  There is a great anxiety, which has already been articulated by Deputy Lahart, that a metro to south-west gets put into this plan as an addendum.  We can put forward what we would really love to be put in as a paragraph.  Like Deputy Lahart, I implore this committee to exercise its power under section 12 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act to make recommendations to the Minister: that metro to south-west be included; that we have an overturning of the feasibility study, which was inadequate; that there is a proper and fully comprehensive feasibility study put in for the inclusion of metro to south-west; and that this be included in this plan.</p> <p>  On top of these figures, the city edge development is being talked about.  That is planned to be in place in ten years, which will add another 75,000 to 85,000 people resident there.  The NTA has already acknowledged that it may need two Luas lines for that area.  Within that, there are planned disruptions in the construction of BusConnects, which is reasonable and required to deliver on that.  There will also be Luas construction on the same streets that will have just been set up and disrupted over a number of years.  There is also potentially other forward planning for the likes of a metro to south-west, or otherwise.  It makes much more sense to have a comprehensive overview of all of these provisions for the south-west area of the city.  I would strongly ask that we would engage in that and to include it so the NTA can consider a metro to south-west in some form or other, even if it is in forward planning.  Otherwise, this is going to be kicked down the road.  It does not make sense to move ahead with other provisions when there is a very comprehensive possible solution here that should be included.</p> <p>  Attendant to that, I ask that the NTA comment on and reply, hopefully positively, to my next question.  In early June, subject to a motion from Councillor Anne Feeney in Dublin City Council, an invitation was issued to the NTA to come into the council to discuss the issue of the MetroLink Charlemont terminus and the significant impact it has for commuters in the area and future transport needs.  That was unanimously approved by the councillors.  I ask that the NTA would reply positively to that invitation.</p> <p> I apologise that I missed the NTA's opening statements as I was at another meeting.  The draft plan was published in November.  We are here now and there have been thousands of submissions in the meantime.  The NTA encouraged those submissions, for which I am very grateful.  Can the NTA give us a summary of what has changed on foot of those submissions?  What changes have been put in place because of those particular submissions?  I would really appreciate that.</p> <p>  A Deputy referred to timelines.  Within that, I note the original timeline for BusConnects was for six applications by the end of June.</p><p>There were only two.  What is the timeline now for BusConnects?  How can that be delivered so that we have a definitive future plan and idea?</p></speech>

One relates to the road objective in chapter 13, which outlines the strategic importance of the M50.  An area between the N4 and N3, close to the toll bridge, is regarded as having inadequate resilience.  The plan states: "The NTA, in collaboration with TII and the relevant local authorities, will seek the development and construction of an appropriate road link between the N3 and N4 national roads, which can provide a satisfactory alternative in the event of incidents arising on the M50 between Junctions 6 and 7."  The problem is that it will not only be used for that.  Eleven possible routes have been identified.  Eight go through Liffey Valley, which is a special amenity area.  One, which was formerly identified in the Fingal county development plan and the Kildare development plan, was removed in the review of the development plan following significant involvement of local communities.  St. Catherine's Park and Lucan Demesne is a relatively recent development, being approximately 30 years old.  The land was purchased by the State and jointly developed by three local authorities.  The communities on either side raised funds for playgrounds and other amenities.</p> <p>  The Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly submitted concerns, citing climate action as an issue, about the development of new roads in the Liffey Valley area.  Councillors removed the indicative line from the Kildare and Fingal county development plans in 2017.  A third world war would erupt if there was an intention to take away a park that people feel invested in and that is heavily used.  A road there would bisect the park and make it unusable.  There are 11 possible locations, but none of them is easy.</p> <p>  The second issue I wish to raise relates to timelines and low-hanging fruit.  DART+ is to be extended to Kilcock.  It is described as a new station west of Maynooth.  In fact, there will be a depot 350 m east of Kilcock.  Rail will be laid all the way up to that depot.  The only thing that will not be available when the depot is developed is a place for people to access the train.  That is a very short distance.  There is a project under way with a railway audit and separate process.  This could be combined with a small extension under a different process, which it could be done in conjunction with.  It would connect quite a sizable town that has developed on both the Meath and Kildare side.</p> <p>  There is confusion about whether the station 1.1 km west of the existing station in Sallins is a new station or additional to the existing one.  Clarity on that would be useful.  The population in the area of Naas, Sallins, Kill and Johnstown in 2016 was in excess of 42,000.  One would wish to keep that traffic out of the city.  It is a commuter area.  There is a fair argument to be made for an extension to Newbridge too.  It is 24 miles, or 39 km, from Dublin.  In 2016, it had a population of 22,000.  People drive to the Sallins station and park their cars there.  The matter requires consideration.</p> <p>  I have raised the DART tunnel since the 1990s.  A timeline is essential if we are going to have a networked service.  The Phoenix Park tunnel is useful but it has limitations.</p> <p>  Regarding BusConnects, railways will be key, but the workhorse of the public transport system is bus services because they are much more permeable.  A combination of both is important.  There is an issue relating to reliability of bus services, whether Go-Ahead, Bus &Eacute;ireann or Dublin Bus.  People will not use public transport to go to work or wherever else they want to go if they feel they cannot get back.  There is a significant issue at the moment.  I know it is an operational issue rather than strategic.  If there is to be a significant investment, it has to be reliable.  I know I keep annoying the NTA about this.  I experienced one of the first BusConnects routes and there are problems.  It is not working in some locations, though it is working well in other areas.  Lessons can be learned from the roll-outs and how quickly aspects that are not working can be rectified.  The witnesses know about the issues I have raised with them on a number of occasions.</p> <p>  The population of County Kildare is now 246,000.  It greatly exceeds the population of Limerick but it tends not to be noticed because it does not have a city in the middle.  There are many commuters.  County Meath has the same issue.  They are rapidly growing areas.  When the Dublin Transportation Initiative was embarked on all those years ago, the population of Kildare was half its current size.  Not having a consolidation in the centre was not an ideal spatial scenario.  The reality is that it is there and has to be provided for.  Much additional traffic is being generated by the growth in population.</p> <p>  The Sallins bypass is a great benefit to Sallins but it has had knock-on consequences on towns such as Clane.  AA Roadwatch now mentions traffic jams in places that did not have them previously, where the Sallins bypass and the roads from it, or the roads to Maynooth, are acting as a national secondary route more than anything else.  That requires additional consideration because it has already manifested.</p><p>As we are looking at a strategy with a 20-year horizon, consideration must be given and factored in at this point as to how it can be dealt with.</p></speech>

I wish to pick up on an issue raised by what Deputy Catherine Murphy described about the Sallins bypass and the knock-on effect with the issue in Clane.  It proves that when we build these roads and bypasses, they just beget more roads and more bypasses, so we need to think differently about transport.  I welcome the NTA's strategy for the GDA.  There is different thinking in it around transport and a lot of good stuff in there.</p> <p>  My reason for popping down to the committee was to ask the officials about the gap between the emissions targets we have nationally and the gap in the GDA strategy currently.  I think the latter is a 35% cut by 2030, so there is still a significant gap.  I was chairing the climate committee earlier and we had officials in from the Department of Transport.  They were not really able to tell me whether they had appropriately or adequately modelled for, or considered, the potential for electric bike uptake to meet the ambitious emissions reduction targets.  We know from quite recent research from UCC that 40% of all our transport emissions are caused by private car journeys of up to 8 km.  Many of those in the upper end of that range, say 4 km to 8 km, might be cyclable but they are certainly doable and comfortable by electric bike.  Has the modelling that underpins the GDA strategy considered the potential for very ambitious uptake of electric bikes?  We are seeing across Europe and the world that where safe networks are provided, people are using e-bikes for those mid-range journeys.  Is that part of the answer to filling that gap?  I am not a member of this committee but should it be recommending to the Minister that he explore all possibilities around electric bikes and do all we can do as a Government and a State to facilitate their uptake and usage?</p></speech>

We have had much engagement from members of that group and principals in that area who are articulating strong views.  The officials have received a couple of emails, as we have as correspondence, from that committee around the whole Dublin transport authority and Dublin transport plan.  I welcome Ms Graham and Mr. Creegan once again.  They seem to be permanent fixtures at our committee.  They could both take up residence here, no bother at all.  They may be surprised that I, a Cork person, am speaking on Dublin but I have a number of points I want to raise on behalf of Councillor Joe Neville, who has engaged extensively with me on the matter, as well as Councillor P&aacute;draig McEvoy, to which I will come back in a second.</p> <p>  In a manner similar to Deputy Catherine Murphy, Councillor Neville has expressed concerns on the issue of St. Catherine's Park.  The Deputy is correct the three local authorities took a deliberate stance on that development and I support the remarks she made.  I thank Councillor Neville for his engagement with me.  The concerns he has raised are articulated in the context of the previous plans and references to putting a road through the park.  There is genuine concern at a residential level and at a local authority level because St. Catherine's Park is a special area of conservation in the Liffey Valley area.  As the officials will know from the remarks this evening and their own extensive deliberations, it is bordering counties Kildare and Dublin and everybody is concerned that we should not allow it to happen.  Councillor McEvoy is a member of the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly, EMRA.  It met yesterday and considered the NTA transport strategy for consistency and has put forward amendments around the "Measure ROAD8" proposal.</p> <p>  In the context of what has been said today, I wish to articulate on behalf of Councillors Neville and McEvoy that neither Kildare nor Fingal county councils supported a roadway development between the N3 and N4 across the Liffey Valley in their county development plans.  The objective was not added and was removed from the respective plans.  The big thing with the NTA's draft transport strategy for the GDA is it has an objective in Measure ROAD8 to develop a new road as a resilience alternative to closure of the M50 between junctions 6 and 7.  We have done much work on the committee on changing speed limits on the M50 already but the EMRA continues to have concerns.  Deputy Catherine Murphy rightly made reference to climate action in the context of the development of a new road but the concerns expressed to both Councillors Neville and McEvoy rest with the county development plan going back as far as 2017.  There is an issue around the transport strategy, given the climate emergency, with additional road development. There is the matter of recommending alternative studies be undertaken if we are talking about reducing car journeys and movement and the whole issue around Measure ROAD8 remaining in the latest draft of the transport strategy.  As a committee, and with the NTA, it is about having the Department and the Minister give their attention to the real concerns of local communities.  To be fair, both Councillors Neville and McEvoy are outstanding public representatives who rarely engage in terms of the level of concern around this piece of work.  I ask that the NTA, in the context of the proposals, give consideration to the full range of options and that it would either engage with the councillors in question or meet the EMRA as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>  As we have heard not just today but on an ongoing basis, it is important to getting it right that there be consultation and co-ordination.  There has been on the draft.  We have had the Metro South West group engaging extensively with us and Senator Seery Kearney has articulated that but I wished to give a platform to members of the local authority on the issue before us tonight.</p></speech>

I suggest the officials, in this first round, go back to the questions put by members and other Oireachtas colleagues.  We started with Deputy Matthews, then went to Deputy O'Rourke.

It is important to say at the outset that, in terms of our legislation, we have two related documents that get produced.  One is a transport strategy that takes a look at what needs to be done over the next 20 years.  As soon as that is adopted, we are required within nine months of that to have completed what is called an implementation plan, which takes the first slice of six years and provides more detail in that time period about how we are going to deliver the strategy over that period.  That is the place to put in the type of details the Deputy was referring to, in order to give greater detail on what is happening in the first six years.  At the end of that six years we have to do a new implementation plan covering the next six years, and so on.</p><p>We have shaped the strategy in the way we have done knowing that we need to do this separate implementation plan immediately once it is adopted.  It must focus on delivery.</p><p> We have put in a commitment that decide and provide is much better than predict and provide.  Transport must be policy-led as opposed to purely demand-led - certainly in terms of cars.  We think we have used that tool correctly.  By predict and provide, we do not mean that we look at what the State is like 30 years from now and decide we need to provide it but that we make sure we are providing something that will last for a reasonable design life, for example at least 15 or 20 years.  In the case of all the BusConnects corridors, we are comfortable they can cater for the next 15 or 20 years.  Members will have seen in the strategy that we believe we need to transition to light rail lines or something else at a point in time.  That is part of the decide and provide scenario.  </p><p> Emissions reductions are set out in the transport strategy.  In 2018, the geotechnical design report calculation had about 3.2 million megatonnes equivalent of CO2.  We did a calculation to find out what it would be if it was business as usual by 2030 taking account of various other things and we got 3.4 megatonnes.  The strategy infrastructure and services measures, the planned electrification under the Government's plan and the biofuels transition only reduce it to 2 megatonnes.  I am overcomplicating that.  The target we should have by 2030 is 1.6 megatonnes.  Everything in the strategy only gets us to 2 megatonnes so there is a shortfall of 0.4 of a megatonne.  It does not look like a lot when you put a decimal point in front of it but it is actually quite hard to achieve it.  We set out three scenarios in the strategy about how it could be achieved.  Some of them are outside our ambit like fuel pricing.  In theory, we could electrify further if that was possible and that would deal with it.  The third approach was to do more demand management measures, be they parking restrictions, tolling, low-emissions zoning or congestion charging.  In the strategy, we committed to using one of the tools in our legislation, which is the tool to do a demand management scheme.  Within two years of adopting the strategy we will produce a demand scheme, the objective of which is to set out clearly how we will bridge that gap to get down to the 2030 target.</p><p> I will finish off by saying that we think we have done all the positive things we can do to deliver the change that is required.  The cycling infrastructure is the right infrastructure and the bus infrastructure is the right infrastructure along with rail and Luas.  All that can be done by 2030 will be done.  After that, it is more on the minus side where we are going to have to put in more parking restraint, some additional charging in some places and so on.  The strategy does all the infrastructure and services sides that are needed.  The demand management scheme will have to set out what additional measures are required to meet that target but that is the objective.</p><p> The N3 to N4 road link was mentioned by several members.  We included it because we think it is the right thing to do.  That is why we put it in the strategy.  We think there is a case for requiring that road link for the resilience of the M50.  If the old West Link Bridge collapsed on the M50, there would be no good alternative and it is the only segment of the M50 where you do not have a reasonable alternative so it is a significant issue from a resilience point of view.  We also think there is orbital movement that needs to be catered for in the growing areas of Kildare that is not currently catered for.  We are not saying the road needs to go through St. Catherine's Park.  At least 11 options have been identified so far.  It will be a matter for whoever is taking the project forward to tease their way through those options and come up with the best option.  Nowhere in our strategy are we proposing to go through St. Catherine's Park.  Of the 11 options, from memory, I think only two involve going through the park.  There were a number going east and west of that.</p><p> Regarding home zone change, we got feedback on the strategy and took on board what we felt was appropriate.  We got some feedback in that area.  The main change involves the word "meet".  I think we used the word "balance" and instead of changing the word "car dominance", we just said "motor vehicles".  I do not have it in front of me but it is something like that.  I take the point.  The original wording might look better.  I do not think there is much difference between the two.  I would be happy with either of them.  </p><p> We got feedback on school site selection.  I thought we ended up with quite strong language saying that in selecting the site for a school, you must take account of the sustainable transport needs to serve that school.  That is in there as a measure.  That is something that has troubled us for a long time.  Schools are being built in places where we are finding it very difficult to put in the type of connections that are needed to make it sustainable.</p><p> We recognise and committed in several places that rail freight will have to increase.  It is definitely going to be part of the tools to meet the climate change target.  I am not familiar with the issue in Dublin Port so there are probably details that are beyond what should be in the strategy.</p></speech>

We have made the case that this methodology should be changed to assess projects in a different way, which would then provide a lot more benefits for those sustainable projects, particularly walking and cycling projects.  At the moment, the methodology is as set out so we are obliged to follow that at this time.</p> <p>  I think we responded to Deputy O'Rourke's questions.  Obviously, we will respond further if there is any further follow-up.  Deputy Lahart also looked at the taxi industry.  I will give some facts and figures regarding where we are in terms of the numbers of vehicles in the industry post Covid.  We are down about 11% in terms of vehicle licences from pre-Covid.  Out of that, there are a number of inactive vehicle licences so there are about 3,200 that could return to the industry in the next 24 months post expiry - they remain connected to the industry and we hope to see as many of them as possible coming back to the industry.  The number of those who are available to drive in Dublin has reduced by 5.5% since 2019.  We are undertaking a driver recruitment campaign to encourage new applicants to take up driver licences.  We hope that this campaign results in new driver licences, as was the case when we did a campaign a number of years ago, so that we can start building back up the sector post Covid.  There is no doubt that it is still having an impact on availability at those core hours on Friday and Saturday nights.</p> <p>  As to whether it would make any difference if we were to allow what we would consider a more deregulated market in terms of ride hailing, there is a misconception that the old-style Uber, which was what it was offering, still operates in the UK and western Europe.  This involved unlicensed drivers and unlicensed vehicles.  In fact, in the UK, the regulations have been changed to permit only police-vetted and licensed drivers to operate even for ride share in London.  The same is true for Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain and France and many cities further afield in which Uber operates.  Uber does not operate with unlicensed drivers in London.  It is regulated by Transport for London in the same way as any private hire offering.  Drivers must have a private hire vehicle driver licence from Transport for London.  We would suggest that this regulatory model would also be used in Ireland so that Garda-vetted drivers would be used in terms of Uber services.</p><p>That is currently the case with licensed taxi drivers.  We would encourage that this remain the case for vehicle licences going through the regulatory model as well as driver licences.</p><p> Deputy Lahart spoke about communication around electric vehicle grants.  We will ensure that we communicate more around the fact that we can pay the grant directly to the garage rather than the individual.  The Deputy made the case that this seemed much more affordable for the taxi industry.  If that is not clear in our guidelines, we will make it clearer.</p><p> Metro south west was the next issue.</p></speech>

A piece of work that we have done - I appreciate that not everyone agrees with it - indicates that metro south west does not stack up economically at the moment.  That may change.  The terminal point of the tunnel for the MetroLink, assuming it gets the go ahead and is built, is designed to facilitate a connection going either to the green line or to the south west.  Alternatively, it could head over to UCD slightly circuitously.  However, it most definitely facilitates a connection to metro south west, so it does not preclude such a connection in the slightest.  Some groups are concerned that, by bringing it to Charlemont, we are effectively trying to prevent it from going to the south west.  Absolutely not.  Equally, there is an idea that St. Stephen's Green is the better location, but it is not.  The location we have chosen allows the MetroLink to connect with the green line, if required in future, or into the south west, which is more likely.</p> <p>  In reviewing the strategy, which we have to do every six years, we have given a commitment - it is on page 143 of the strategy - that we will assess the requirement to provide additional metro lines in the greater Dublin area based on the updated forecast for travel and demands, emerging significant changes in line use, etc., including previously considered options for extending MetroLink southwards towards UCD, along the existing green line or towards south-west Dublin.  We have committed in the strategy to re-examining the matter at the next review, which will be six years from now.  Assuming MetroLink is allowed to proceed, nothing we are doing now will preclude a metro link from going to the south west.  I hope this gives some comfort.</p></speech>

The metro south west group has sent us a great deal of documentation and has made a suggestion, that the witnesses are probably fully aware of, that it would like to see included in the draft strategy.  Its correspondence reads:</p> <blockquote> 	Metro South West Group would request that the text beneath goes into section 12.3 dealing with light rail as this is where the Strategy deals with both Metrolink and Luas type projects.  We suggest that a new paragraph 12.3.15 be added dealing with the south west city and that this conclude with a Measure LRT14.  Here is the suggested text: <br /><br /><i>&ldquo;Paragraph 12.3.15: </i><br /><br /><i>The provision of public transport in the south west city was the subject of many submissions in the consultation process leading to this Strategy.  The specific issues in the south west city include: </i>  	<i>- The population in the area between Red and Green lines of nearly 350,000 people </i>[I believe from the recent census that this has increased]<i>;</i><br /><br /><i>- The predominantly narrow road infrastructure in the area;</i><br /><br /><i>- The excessive concentration of buses in Terenure and Rathmines;</i><br /><br /><i>- The greater modal shift to public transport needed to meet the city target;</i><br /><br /><i>- The implications of the City Edge development.</i> <i>Measure LRT14:: </i><br /><br /><i>NTA will in the early stages of the plan examine the extension of the Metrolink into South West Dublin.  This work will include a full reconsideration of the document entitled &quot;Metro to Knocklyon Feasibility Study&quot; and an extensive public consultation on the options available.&rdquo; </i> </blockquote> <p>I am assuming that the witnesses are familiar with this.

It has a number of BusConnects corridors.  In looking forward 20 years, we believe that the right measure will be to upgrade two of those corridors to Luas lines instead of pursuing a metro solution, which would be very expensive.  However, we are committed to revisiting this decision.  If it needs to be changed in future, it can be.  Right now, though, the strategy boils down to the need to get on with building the BusConnects corridors and delivering something.  There is the potential for light rail in the longer term.  If we need to reconsider the metro, we can do so.  That is what our position boils down to.</p></speech>

I appreciate it.</p> <p>  A couple of issues are arising that are likely to affect the plans for the bus corridors, for example, large-scale developments.  I support the encouragement of public transport, given the closeness of public transport.  A proposed development in Terenure has 364 apartments and is likely to have nearly 1,000 residents, but only has 120 parking spaces.  The plans for BusConnects are based on current and predicted traffic.  There will be future growth.  The development in question is only at the application stage, but were it to proceed, there would likely be an overspill of cars parked in the local area.  On 4 May, I hounded the witnesses about the double yellow lines on Fortfield Road.  We will need to return to a time of double yellow lines being needed because of an overspill of cars.  Future elements will affect the effectiveness of BusConnects.  There are concerns about that, which I hope that we will revert to.  If the witnesses gave me a timeline on the three corridors, it would be great.  If we were pursuing MetroLink, we would not have such concerns because it would not be on the road and would not be dependent on factors that we cannot-----</p></speech>

Regarding the invitation to attend the council, it was actually an area committee.  We struggle with our availability to attend all area committee invitations.  It has written to us again and we still have to respond.  We try to meet councils in their full format once per year to go through many issues.  We get invited to more area committees and other committees than we can manage to attend.</p> <p>  The Senator is correct about BusConnects.  There are two submissions with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and another is on the way, with a notice appearing in the newspapers tomorrow, namely, Blanchardstown to the city centre.  It is being submitted tomorrow, we might say.</p><p>The fourth one, from Liffey Valley to the city centre, will be submitted in about two weeks and we hope to get in two more during July.  It will be the second half of the year before we have a further six to go, which will include several in the south east and south west of the city.  I do not have dates for them but our target is to get them all in by the year end.</p><p> In summary, by tomorrow we will have three in, in two weeks' time we will have four and we will then try to build on that.</p></speech>

There was reference to 11 options, only two of which are going through St. Catherine's Park, but genuine concerns have been articulated during this meeting, although I appreciate the demands on the authority&rsquo;s time.</p> <p>  My other point is a housekeeping one.  I do not mean to be precious about this, but if there is to be a launch of BusConnects in any part of the country, will our guests invite public representatives, particularly members of the Oireachtas transport committee, to attend it, if that is not too great a request?  I appreciate there is to be a virtual meeting and a physical meeting in Cork on Thursday, but it would be unfair to us as members of the committee that there were a launch and we were not invited.

The national development plan, our transport strategy and probably all the local development plans provide for it being to Maynooth, and we do not want to walk into An Bord Plean&aacute;la with something that leaves us open to legal challenge.  Irish Rail intends to submit its planning application within the next two months.  Our intention, as we have said before, is that it will be a short extension to get from the depot to as far as Kilcock.  Some steps are required but they are definitely doable, and we see no difficulty in doing that as a parallel project and in having it come on stream when DART+ West is completed or shortly thereafter.  What we do not want to do is delay or cause a problem for the main DART+ project as it goes through its planning process.  I hope that within a number of years, we can get that project out to Kilcock given, as the Deputy mentioned, it is a short distance.</p> <p>  On extending it to Newbridge, we do not have that in the strategy.  We have only as far as Kilcock in the strategy.  On the Sallins question, the intention was that there would be new stations along the bypass.  We considered relocating the existing station but it would be too great a move for people who live in the village of Sallins to go up to-----</p></speech>

Perhaps the park-and-ride could have a service starting there and the mainline service might stop in Sallins village.  That is to be worked out, but we believe the correct step to take is to put a second station on the Cork side of the existing Sallins station.</p> <p>  On traffic congestion in other areas, I think we will pass that back to the local councils to see what needs to be done.  We are not going to resolve it in a strategy; that is for sure.</p></speech>

When we carry out modelling work, as we do for all these things, we have roughly 1.4 million public transport trips a day in the Dublin region.  When we test with and without the DART tunnel in place, there are about 10,000 additional trips due to the tunnel.  The tunnel will have lots of people coming through it but they come off the Phoenix Park tunnel link, in the main, and off the bus system.  Because the Phoenix Park tunnel link is open, the case for that DART underground is not immediately strong.  As we say in the strategy, we think it will be required in the future and we think the line should be preserved and the issue should be revisited and reviewed.  When we analyse it in depth, that is what we are getting, although that is different from the situation six or seven years ago, before the Phoenix Park tunnel link was opened.  Once it opened, it changed the possibilities and we will now, I hope, have the DART running through it in three or four years.</p></speech>

We are seeing a reduction in kilometres operated of an order that is not acceptable at the moment and we are not happy with the level of lost kilometres, which is impacting on the reliability of the services.  It is an operational issue.  We are finding that driver absences are at a level that, even post Covid, we do not feel is acceptable, and it is impacting on the delivery of services.</p> <p>  Driver recruitment is also an issue during this period of effective full employment in Ireland at the moment.  All operators are finding it difficult to recruit drivers and the attrition rate for drivers in our bus operators is also very high.  All of this is impacting on reliability and we have a number of actions with the operators to try to improve the recruitment timeline for drivers, but we are also looking at our service levels and seeing whether there are places - the Deputy already has identified some for us - where we might move services from one alignment to another to improve the reliability of those services.  Even during the summer months, where the demand is not as high as it would be in September, we might reduce services to improve the reliability, given our operators are struggling with driver resources.  That is an issue we are tackling with our operators at the moment.  The contracts are structured such that they are not paid for services they do not operate, which we thought would be a sufficiently strong incentive to ensure we would get that level of performance, but at the moment, unfortunately, they are all struggling in this space.  We have to apologise to our customers because the service is not at the level of reliability at which we want it to be.</p> <p>  On the delivery of the C spine of BusConnects, Deputy Catherine Murphy asked us to look at the lessons to be learned, which we will do, and we will also look at how quickly we can rectify aspects of the services.  In terms of the underlying growth in passenger numbers that we have seen over the implementation of the C spine, it has grown by 11% to 12% above what would be a normal growth and recovery after Covid.  There has certainly been a good response to some of the services and changes, while recognising there remain some issues on which we will need to revert to the Deputy in regard to how we will respond to them.</p><p>I think that we covered Deputy Leddin's question about the electric bikes.</p></speech>

Our transport model includes a facility to model the propensity of people to use cycling more, including the use of electric bikes.  That tool is available and we have used it.  On it being part of the answer to plug the gap, it undoubtedly is but we are finding we need to move the longer distance trips to non-combustion engine powered trips, whether public transport or electric.  The demand management scheme that we have to prepare will have to tackle that and propose measures that push that changeover more strongly than is the case without it.</p></speech>

Much of what I would have liked to have said about the strategy I have told them in previous meetings.  No doubt Deputy Lahart and Senator Seery Kearney have articulated very strongly the metro south west proposal which I have seen.  I live in Dublin Rathdown.  I have mentioned the upgrade of the existing green line Luas to our guests before, from Charlemont onwards, although it is not part of this strategy.  I do not want to see it being shelved or relegated any further.  I would like to see it come back at some point or other versions via UCD and potentially the eastern bypass corridor, which I will return to.  In this strategy the NTA is talking about an extension of the green line to Bray.  What is happening in Cherrywood and in Sandyford is very substantial.  That line is under enormous pressure.  I take on board all the points about increasing capacity, the length of carriages and increasing the frequency but the green line is a very popular line.  All Luas lines are very popular.  They are like magnets.  They suck people in because they are so reliable that people are willing to walk or use other ways of getting to those lines because they know they do not have to worry about timetables or it being every half hour because it is just so frequent.  They are brilliant but we do not want them to kill themselves by being so popular that they are impossible to use.  There were people getting on at Dundrum, going up to Kilmacud to cross the tracks and come back into town because they just could not get on at Dundrum to head towards town prior to the pandemic.  I know that happened and I am sure our guests did too.  I do not want to see metro south west replace it.  There is space for both metro south west and a green line upgrade or a version of the green line upgrade.  In terms of the green line being extended to Bray, it is already under pressure.  Cherrywood is only starting to take off and it is not remotely close to its capacity.  Sandyford has endless amounts of potential.  That is before we even mention Dundrum and all the places around it, including Goatstown and all the other areas.  I could not sit here without mentioning that the green line needs attention, watching and managing.  I accept people might look at this strategy and say it is 2022 to 2042 but we had a strategy from 2016 to 2035 six years ago.  It is not that we lock this in now and we never touch it again until 2042.  As was pointed out by the NTA, the strategy is a six-year rolling review.  It is effectively a living document that gets tweaked and adjusted based on populations, growth, development plans and all the other things.  That is important.  People might say that we are stuck with this until 2042.  Where will we all be, if we are lucky enough to be here at all, in 20 years' time?</p> <p>  I was at an event earlier in Cabinteely.  I cycled out there and the whole way back in.  Here I am now and I will cycle home later.  I am doing my bit for active travel as best I can.  I have the best, most secure car park in Ireland on this campus but I know that many people, particularly with the better bikes people have been getting on the cycle to work scheme and so on, are deterred from cycling by the uncertainty that if they lock their bike to a Sheffield stand, or other type of railing or fence, that it will be there when they come back.  That is a huge problem.  There is reference to secure parking but I do not know how that mechanism works.  I do not know how it works in other countries.  The weather is not the barrier for a lot of cyclists - it is not the barrier for me because it is not as wet as we might think - but rather if I go to the cinema or a meal will the bike still be there when I return.  In many relatively safe places people's bikes go missing; they are stolen.  Many more safer places are needed whether they are guarded, locked in a bike-locker type system or in car parks where a credit card or swipe card is needed to get in or out.  It is really important that we give people fewer reasons to not use the bike.  I probably went for 20 years without being on a bike but am back on one for the last ten.  People will realise how quick it is to get into town or to go from A to B on a bike and that is before we even talk about electric bikes, which I kind of feel is slightly cheating but are a real solution for many people and which takes up much less road space than anything else.  </p> <p>  Many people will have been to places such as Vienna or Prague where there are huge amounts of civic space.  That is not entirely the NTA's remit but it has invested in improving the civic space and public realm generally.  The more attractive it is made for cyclists then the more people will shift to it.  That does not mean you need to make it less attractive for cars, although there is an element of that.  They will move because it is good for their health and their pocket.  As petrol gets more expensive, the less you have to buy the better.  I am not asking people to cycle in from Maynooth, although I know some people do but there are many journeys that people make in the urban area.  I was a councillor for Stillorgan for 12 and a half years and I know that many people make a lot of journeys that are less than 2 km or 3 km that they could probably do far more quickly cycling when you factor in getting to the car, congestion, parking and walking to where you are going.  This is a strategy and it is a high-level document and I accept that.  I accept many of the points that were made that the public submissions were more operational than strategy but you need to get the small stuff right and you need to have people on board.  With BusConnects, people must understand it better.  My part of south Dublin has not seen too much of it yet.  I think people are willing to embrace it but they need to understand that it will not make their system worse and that it is designed to make their system better.  People are fearful of change but then all of a sudden there is a sense that it is fine.  There was a big hoo-ha about the number 10 bus being gone and becoming the number 39A.  People moved on.  There is fear of change so the communications strategy is important.  </p> <p>  I mentioned the metro.  I am sorry that the green line is being not moved on.  I make the point again about the eastern bypass corridor.  The proposal for the motorway is gone, that is understood - there is a very significant reservation that cannot be lost or built on because that will never come back - but whether it is a Luas, a linear park with a cycle way or whatever, there are lots of opportunities there.  The trip generator is between Sandyford, Dundrum town centre, across to UCD, RT&Eacute;, St. Vincent's hospital right down to the DART line.  They are enormous trip generators.  There should also be an off-road route.  Other countries have done it and we are trying to do it with greenways, although they have been more tourism greenway.</p> <p>  I met people from D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council some weeks ago and I am not overly convinced that Mount Anville Road is the best road in the world to put a dedicated path on because the gradient is so steep.  Maybe it will work for electric bikes but I know if I was going to go from UCD to Goatstown I would not climb Mount Anville Road to do it.  I would go another way that would get me from A to B but without that gradient.  There is an opportunity along that eastern bypass corridor with less of a gradient and I would like the NTA to talk to the D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council about this.  There is also the bit heading towards the city but the bit I am talking about is all in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  There is scope there for a very high-quality off-road linear park with a pedestrian walkway and a cycleway.  There is so much traffic and trip generators, particularly to UCD.  It is an enormous generator of traffic.</p><p>It is also an enormous generator of parking difficulties around the campus and on all of the neighbouring estates on every side of the campus, including the Blackrock, Clonskeagh and Roebuck Road sides, and even towards Donnybrook.  Anything that could make it easier to get to those places must be done.</p><p> RT&Eacute; is a very significant employer.  There are around 20,000 students and 5,000 or 6,000 staff at UCD.  We must make it easier to get to and from the campus and connect it up, mainly by cycling if that can be done.  A bus corridor or Luas line would be a good idea.  We have talked about that a little.  There is scope for the green line extension to be brought up to the eastern bypass corridor and along the dual carriageway, up from the DART and on to Sandyford.  Currently, the biggest generator of Luas traffic is Sandyford, as the witnesses will acknowledge.  Cherrywood will be similar to Sandyford both in terms of residential population and business.  It will create more traffic towards Bray.  I was asked by councillors in south Dublin and Greystones about building a twin track on the line between Bray and Greystones.  I spoke to Deputy Matthews about it, who said it was not possible from an engineering perspective.  Maybe that is case, or maybe not.  Councillor Jim Gildea contacted me about it and there was a meeting of the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly yesterday to discuss the issue.  I was the first chair of the assembly a long time ago, so I am familiar with the work it does on regional and spatial economic strategies.  If there was a possibility to introduce a twin track on that line, it would be helpful.  If not, the issue deserves attention.  We are trying to get people to move from aviation travel to travelling by boat and using Rosslare Port.  The better that railway line is and the greater the frequency of trains, the greater the modal shift will be.</p><p> I apologise for giving the witnesses a long spiel.  I ask them to respond to the points I have made as best they can.  The strategy is a 236-page document.  There is a lot of good stuff in it.  I believe there is a reference in it to the option of introducing metro south west or something else.  I would prefer to see metro south west and something else.  It looks like it is being presented as an "or" scenario.  I would like to see all of the projects progressing, the extension of the green line in particular.</p></speech>

My understanding is that the line as far as Bray is a double line and from Bray to Greystones and onwards, it is a single line.  Once again, the most important question is why a double line was not considered.  Is the NTA going to have a feasibility study of the plan?</p> <p>  I do not know if my next point was raised earlier.  Councillor Sharon Tolan has highlighted the issue of fair fares and the 90-minute fare.  I ask the witnesses to address why an extension of the application of the fare outside Dublin was not considered.  I think some were asking for it to be extended for travel as far as Drogheda.  That particular issue has been raised in numerous areas.  In my capacity as a Deputy representing Limerick city, I must highlight that the Minister for Transport wrote to the NTA about the draft Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy, LSMATS.  Did he do anything similar with the greater Dublin area strategy?  Has anything in the strategy been included at the request or on the direction of the Minister for Transport that would not otherwise have been included in the view of the NTA?</p></speech>

As the Senator is aware, we have the ability to add capacity but at some point, more is needed.  As the Senator rightly said, it needs attention.  When that intervention is required, plans will be put in place to deliver it.  We will wait and see what the plans are.</p> <p>  On the issue of bike parking, there is a whole section in the strategy on bike parking.  The Senator is right that bikes are getting more expensive now, particularly electric bikes, and theft is an issue.  The strategy addresses the issue of bike parking.  On a more practical level, we support local authorities and Irish Rail in putting in secure bike parking places.  Irish Rail, in particular, has installed secure bike lockers at various stations around the country, which we have funded.  We will and must do more of that.  We accept the Senator's point entirely.  We need the local authorities to work with us.  I know Dublin City Council has extensive plans to put a lot of off-street cycle parking in different places.  That will be needed.</p></speech>

There are plenty of bike locker solutions that can be put in place.</p> <p>  On the eastern bypass reservation, the Senator is probably aware that we have included in the strategy a commitment to carry out an assessment with D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to identify sustainable transport use for that southern corridor that runs through D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  We have engaged with the council on the matter.  The council is anxious to use the corridor for the same purpose.  There is no deviation there.

I will continue from where I left off and acknowledge there are some positive freight measures.  I got caught up discussing rail freight and I want to discuss the last mile of freight or cargo delivery.  The strategy suggests that we should examine the feasibility of how we introduce those, which not only cuts down on emissions but improves road safety.  We should go further by identifying and tackling the barriers, and develop the incentives to have low-emissions cargo-bike-type freight last mile delivery.</p> <p>  Another issue is parking charges, which is quite extensively mentioned both in this and the previous document.  We know that low parking charges or free parking at workplaces and shopping centres encourage people to drive.  How does the NTA assess the benefits and where is the best place to introduce them?  </p> <p>  The Safe Routes to School programme is very positive and I know from the document that it was introduced in 2021.  Has the NTA identified the barriers to creating safe routes to school?  The strategy mentions: "To accelerate the delivery of walking and cycling infrastructure".  The delivery of safe cycling infrastructure encourages uptake and creates a safe route to school, not just cycling infrastructure, which we know has been quite poor in the past and, therefore, it is about creating segregated safe routes as much as possible.</p> <p>  I will review some of the answers.  I raised the issue of the timeframe and the witnesses said that in nine months there will be an implementation plan that sets out a six-year timeframe and give more detail on the delivery of projects.  How does the NTA decide what goes into the six-year plan?  Is that information set out anywhere?  What influences the authority's decision?  Is it emissions reduction, a modal shift or what gives the best return?  Is the information on the best return used by the authority to decide what to introduce first?  2030 is not far away and is getting closer the whole time but transport emissions are not reducing.  That aspect must be a guiding principle when it comes to the deciding the timeframe.  Similarly, with decide and provide.  There is induced demand when a road is built and it fills up with cars but the same is true for public or active transport.  As we have seen in many places, when infrastructure is built, demand is induced and it fills up pretty quickly.  It is difficult to accurately work out what is going to happen but we have seen enough examples to say that if infrastructure is built, people will use it.</p> <p>  On a further emissions reduction of 0.4 MtCO2eq, the witnesses mentioned that there are demand management measures required to reach the target of zero emissions.  After two years of the plan being passed and published, the NTA will introduce demand management measures to reduce the 0.4 MtCO2eq but how long will it take to introduce the measures?  I ask because these measures are critical but will not happen for two years, 2030 is looming and we will probably be into the next term of government.</p> <p>  Reference has been made to orbital movements for the N3 and N4 national roads.  I gather from what the witnesses have said that the measure facilitates car orbital movements.  Essentially, it is a road that will create more car use in the area.  If we have learned one thing from the way that we build roads is that they fill up with cars.  I understand why the NTA feels that there is a possible weak link on the M50 at the Liffey Valley Bridge and that traffic would be in chaos if an incident were to happen.  If that link road were to be used purely for public transport or active travel links and in the event that an incident happened on the M50, we could probably consider it more favourably but at the moment it is not something that I would favour or see as being required because it facilitates more car usage.</p> <p>  On page 136, there is a map of regional bus corridors and I think that the regional bus corridor ends where the page ends.  Where exactly does the regional bus corridor end or was it simply a case of fitting the map nicely on the page?  We talked about the Bray to Greystones rail service.  For years, I tried to get an assessment done in order to improve rail services or have electrified rail services to Wicklow but it was never in the strategy so it could not be accounted for in an N11 roads assessment.  Again, does the regional bus corridor go further than what is displayed on the map?  Is the map for indicative purposes or can one rely on it to show the actual bus corridor?</p> <p>  Deputy Leddin asked a question about electric bikes.  Of course, electric bikes will play a role but we need to reduce our long distance journeys by providing bus and rail services.  In addition, a high percentage of car journeys last between 4 km and 8 km.</p><p>We have made it convenient for people to jump in a car and to drive those short distances.  We must make it much more convenient and safer, in the context of e-bikes and scooters, for people to have the choice to go on safe infrastructure.  That is where we will get that modal shift.  We must assess what road infrastructure and road allocation will be required to put in that safe infrastructure to facilitate people to travel safely.  If we do that, then people will use those forms of transport.  It is a recommendation I suggest as well.  As Senator Horkan said, there is some good stuff in this document.  I wish we had seen something like this 20 years ago and that we could have implemented it.  We would be refining it even further now.  It is a very good document, though, and I thank the witnesses for presenting it.</p></speech>

That is fine.  Turning to a few things that have come up, and again concerning the modelling, is there any decent study or information of which Ms Graham is aware that explores the relationship between service frequency and demand?  If a service runs more regularly, does that increase the demand for it?  Is that something the NTA sees?</p></speech>

We examine the census data to see what trips people are making.  If they are making a proportion of those trips by car but there is potential to increase the frequency of public transport, then we might get a shift from the car to public transport.  This is what Connecting Ireland is all about.  It is concerned with trying to improve the frequency of services, to provide new services where there are none to try to encourage people to use public transport, and to make those services as frequent as is reasonable for the local demand.  Anywhere we have increased frequency across our urban services to our rural services, we have seen a good response in the numbers of people using those services.</p></speech>

I would have presumed in the context of Ms Graham's response that it is all relative.  My question should not really depend on how many people live in an area.  If my question is about whether there is a correlation between an increase in frequency and an increase in demand, then there could be a smaller increase in demand relatively speaking.  I wonder about this point.  It would be an important consideration in developing services if we had that information and to know if it exists internationally.  The Connecting Ireland context refers to services that run three times a day.</p></speech>

Service development is usually done on a very local basis.  The team would look at the circumstances in the local area.  They would examine the public transport services there now.</p></speech>

If the models do not adequately factor in human behaviour, we could underestimate or overestimate.  The big risk is to underestimate the modal shift opportunity that is there.</p> <p>  Returning to the late-night economy, taxis and public transport, the situation every weekend, particularly in Dublin, is not satisfactory.  The system is broken in terms of transport for people.  Will the witnesses spell out where they envisage it going?  We are coming into July.  The witnesses say in September the increased taxi fare will come in.  When will the NTA  introduce the campaign to recruit people into the industry?  Notwithstanding increased fares and the recruitment drive, I hear from the taxi industry that, due to transferability and the ten-year rule, there might be a drop-off on the other side and we might not be in a better scenario.  The NTA has to do calculations on that but that scenario may arise.  How is the NTA continually reviewing this?  Will it review transferability or the ten-year rule?  What if there is not a significant uptake on the recruitment drive and the new fare structure does not bring people out during those important hours?  I have a personal concern about the taxi industry, which I see reflected in the industry generally.</p> <p>  A related question concerns when the public transport options will come on stream.  We meet with transport providers and they say they are ready to go and if the NTA gives them the green light, they will deliver.  The witnesses may have a different perspective and I would be interested to hear it.  We are in an unsatisfactory situation.  The witnesses are aware of that and have been contacted by the media and others in relation to it, including, I am sure, public representatives, and, I hope, the Minister.  Will they project forward the solution?  At what points will they consider everything I am outlining in terms of transferability and the ten-year rule?</p></speech>

We do not believe the licensing and regulatory system is broken.  We are still recovering from the Covid period.

They currently have no licence fees to pay.  We believe entry to the industry is at a relatively low level and cost.  The driver recruitment campaign we are about to undertake will begin immediately.  We will give information to the public to encourage new drivers into the industry to boost the general availability.  There is no doubt that the drivers in the industry are not attracted to operate at night time between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m.  The maximum fare proposal that has been approved is set out to incentivise that by providing they will be paid at a higher rate for operating at peak hours, which are 8 p.m. to 8 a.m.  We hope that will encourage more drivers to operate at that time.  A number of supports are available for entrants to the industry.  We provide grants for the provision and conversion of vehicles to be wheelchair-accessible and now the e-SPSV grant as well.</p> <p>  On the public transport side, we are committed to providing additional bus services which operate on a 24-7 basis.  Our operators are struggling to provide the services they are contracted to operate at the moment.</p><p>While we can try to do as much as possible with the resources that are available to see if we can extend the working hours of our public transport services, we must be realistic about what driver resource is available to be able to do those additional 24-7 services.  However, they are built into the improvements in BusConnects.  One more 24-hour service was put in place recently, the N4, and there will be additional services provided this year.  We said we would look at the Nitelink bus services to see if we could extend them and have them operating more frequently.  We are also looking at the fares charged on Nitelink to see if we can encourage more usage of those services.  We will do as much as we can on the public transport side to provide for additional service and to provide for that additional demand as we grow and encourage the taxi market to grow and recover post Covid.</p></speech>

Regarding the notion that the system is working or is not broken, people are waiting an hour and a half for a taxi or are unable to get a taxi.  Then there is the idea that it is just four hours at the weekend.  It is like the Dublin Airport Authority appearing before the committee and saying the system is working fine apart from 7 a.m. until 12 noon, when there are thousands of people outside.</p></speech>

It is not working for those people, and there are thousands of them.  They are on social media and will contact public representatives, particularly in this city.  It is not a satisfactory or acceptable position.  I firmly hold that view.  With due respect, it is the NTA, the Department and the Minister who have responsibility to ensure that services are provided for people, or at least to regulate so we have a healthy taxi environment and public transport system to respond to people's needs.  What Ms Graham is saying is really unsatisfactory in terms of the waits that people have, the frustrations and the delays.  Those delays have potentially serious implications.  Some of them might be hospital trips or other important trips.  For me, that is a system that is not working, even if it is for just four hours at the weekend and is localised in the city.  It is a problem that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

To follow up on that, if the NTA takes these measures, and I see it is limited in the levers it has to the fare structure piece and the recruitment campaign piece, and we end up in a situation, at the end of October coming up to Hallowe'en, that is no better than it is now, will the NTA consider the ten-year rule?  There will be 5,300 vehicles off the road before this time next year, which is going to compound a difficult situation.  Will the NTA look at that issue and at the transferability?

The Deputy asked if we set an optimum number in terms of the availability of taxis in an urban region such as Dublin.  We do not set a cap on that but we compare ourselves and the numbers of available SPSVs <i>per capita</i>both in Ireland and in Dublin.  For all of Ireland there are 3.7 SPSVs per 1,000 population.  That far exceeds the number for most countries in Europe.  The average number of SPSVs in western Europe is 1.3 SPSVs per 1,000 population.  Only in the UK is it more than that at 4.4 SPSVs per 1,000 population.</p></speech>

Cities of comparable size such as Oslo, Hamburg, Vienna, Seville and Brussels have between 0.6 and 1.9 SPSVs per 1,000 population.  If we are compared to other cities and other regions, we should be considered as well served in terms of the numbers of SPSVs per head of population.  However, as I said previously, there is still an issue with demand at a particular time.  While we have that availability, they are all not coming out at the peak time.  That is why we are undertaking the measures I outlined earlier to encourage drivers to be available at those peak hours.</p> <p>  There is another activity that is running in parallel.  It is part of the night-time economy working group under the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin.

It would mean there would be less of that peak, and it is difficult to serve that peak because everyone is coming out at the same time.  Along with the actions being taken by other Departments and by us in trying to encourage more activity in the taxi sector, as well as trying to provide as much as we can with the driver resources we have on our bus services, and we are committed to do more where we can, we hope that it will meet customers' demands.</p> <p>  On the other regulatory suggestions the Deputy made regarding the vehicle age and transferability, it is not something we are going to consider at this time.</p></speech>

It would be fair to say, however, we have an awful lot less public transport provision than cities such as London, Berlin, Rome or Paris, which have metros, overnight metros, night buses and all kinds of other transport.  The taxi service is doing everything from about 12.30 a.m. onwards.  There is nothing else in town.  There are a couple of Nitelinks-----</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Creegan for that, as far as it goes.</p> <p>  We talked about safe routes.  There are so many housing estates where there is a wall or something that stops them.  Local authorities are looking at this.  These routes can sometimes be controversial because people think they will have the Tour de France going through their estate every day, but is there an element of permeability?  Sometimes, when these things are opened, people say they never realised they could get from there to there.  It takes 25 minutes in the car or in traffic, or an hour to walk but, all of a sudden, if the wall is knocked down, it is different.  Does the NTA do any work on that?  Does it fund local authorities doing work on this?  Does it promote that kind of thing? </p></speech>

We think these projects are super-useful for the reasons the Senator outlined.  There are walled estates where nobody can access the bus service.  People can almost throw a stone at it but they cannot get to it.  As the Senator is aware, it is very controversial.  We have not been able to do as many as we would like.

I remember being a councillor at the opening of the old Harcourt Street line through to Leopardstown.  It was said this would be the end of the world but it is now there.  Fences are gone from places that had them and people are using the route, which is brilliant to see.  It is so cheap, delivers such a good service, and people can get to the Luas, DART, BusConnects and cycling.</p> <p>  On new bus routes, the 175 is the kind of route we look at and wonder why it was never there before.  Admittedly, I looked at it a couple of days ago and two buses in a row were cancelled.  I accept that is possibly related to Covid.  Who looks at new routes and who plans them?  Do Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead representatives come to the NTA to say they think a particular route will work?  Does the NTA plan these routes?  Who does that work?</p></speech>

In our early days, the operators came to us with improvements for routes, but we now set out the plans for new routes.  That is what BusConnects is all about.  At present, we are not doing any new routes in Dublin.  Our focus is on delivering BusConnects, which will take a number of years.  We did all the multiple consultations associated with that.  We believe we have a network of services that can meet current and future demand.  As I said to Deputy Murphy, we are always willing to look back to see if there are things that looked good on paper in terms of delivery but may not be working on the ground.</p></speech>

It is something worth looking at and continuing to look at.  Factories, offices and schools appear.  People in that demographic then realise that if they can get from place to place on a particular bus, they will not need to be driven to school, football, rugby or whatever it happens to be.</p> <p>  The safety and security of public transport is quite a controversial issue.  I will not rehash all the taxi issues raised by Deputy O'Rourke but I certainly agree with much of what he said.  There are challenges.  I have been on late-night Luas trams -not very late but the last one home or whatever.  People need their wits about them.  Where does the NTA see that at present and where does it see it going?  We have to make sure public transport is not just safe for able-bodied young people but for everybody, including those who are older and may not be as agile, slightly infirm people in wheelchairs, and those with rollators, walking sticks and so on.  I am not saying it is unsafe but it is not as safe as people would like it to be.  What is the NTA's take on that at present?</p></speech>

To get a good sense of how people feel about safety on public transport, we monitor that sentiment.  We survey regularly how people feel about their safety at the bus stop, on their bus service, on their Luas service and on their DART and rail services.  The perception of safety is relatively high overall, even for night-time services.  It is slightly lower for women, which we expected.  We saw a fall in the higher level of perception of safety, as in people feeling very satisfied with their level of safety.  The overall levels between "very" and "good" did not drop significantly, but the higher levels dropped during the Covid period.</p><p>We will run that sentiment survey again later this year to see whether the perception of safety has improved as a result of some of the activity we have undertaken with our operators and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, working very closely together to ensure there is more visibility not only in the city centre but also across the public transport services, particularly at night-time.</p></speech>

When does the point come where light rail is considered over BusConnects?  The document states there could be a transition from BusConnects to light rail.  What is it?  Is it down to modelling?</p></speech>

If there are only two people on a corridor, a taxi is needed for them.  If there are 10,000 people, it is a DART or metro.  In between those two, a bus route will serve between 2,000 and 3,000 passengers per direction in an hour.  With a figure above that, one goes to light rail.  That will take 7,000 passengers an hour.  After that, one moves to metro or heavy rail.</p></speech>

People do not get car sick and are not caught in traffic.  I know there are bus lanes.  Has the NTA looked at modelling that?</p></speech>

We have a factor built in, based on empirical research, on what needs to be applied to reflect the higher likelihood of people using a rail solution.</p> <p>  On the last-mile delivery for goods, because of our remit, our strategy is predominantly focused on passenger and people movement.  There are lots of parties involved in the freight side.  We think that for the last mile or final section delivery for goods, an emphasis will have to be placed on low-emission use, whether it is cargo bikes or electric vehicles.  We believe we need to insert in the demand management scheme I mentioned requirements about what needs to happen for deliveries in certain areas, such as times and modes of deliveries.  We envision that we will do a chunk of research and insert its findings in the demand management scheme.  That is largely because a very large part of the residual emissions will come from freight vehicles by 2030.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked how we carry out the assessment on parking charges.  I know I keep mentioning transport models but we have the tool that can assess what happens if parking charges are changed or applied where they are not in place.  We use that assessment tool.</p> <p>  On what goes into the implementation plan, it is largely driven by the national development plan.  There are also other factors such as the funding that is available over the six-year period because that is a subset of the NDP.  That is the biggest driver of all.  We end up replicating a segment of the NDP for it.</p> <p>  We addressed emissions reductions earlier.  The Deputy asked when the demand management scheme would be available.  We have committed to publishing it two years after the strategy is adopted but we will hold a public consultation in advance of that.  I expect that we will have something published in 12 to 15 months.</p> <p>  On the regional bus corridors and the drawing the Deputy picked, he should take it that it is an indicative map.  There are a good few corridors that slice off at the end of the graphic.  The Deputy will be aware that on the N11 corridor we hope to bring bus priority down as far as the Glen of the Downs and see what happens then.  </p> <p>  We accept entirely the need to support e-bikes more.</p></speech>

That will form part of the assessment of how we are doing on the safe routes to school.  There is a significant number of projects that we need to get on with and get delivered.  Once we see those delivered, we will review them to see what is stopping the remaining schools from having the frontage of the schools become safe, while recognising that it is not just about the front of school but also about having safe walking and cycling infrastructure to get to the school too.</p></speech>

It is very positive to note that the first of 41 intercity railcars, ICRs, left Korea yesterday to be shipped to Ireland.  When these come into operation we will see additional rail services in many parts of the country that need them, so that is good.  We also expect to see 95 electric units which are probably in production at this stage.  I thank Ms Graham and Mr. Creegan for their time.</p></speech>

This is important.  Dublin is the only are where the plan is statutory.  What is the difference and what are the implications?  The NTA document is quite high level in one sense but it is also quite specific.  BusConnects has impacts on people's homes, so there is a human dimension.  Do the local transport plans in any way feed into BusConnects or are they separate?</p></speech>

The NTA has a particular policy statement in the strategy indicating it will start the review, particularly of light rail, in areas including the south west.  Is there a mechanism to identify early on how the initiatives are working and to examine population shifts in the first year or two of the plan?  This could show that volumes are at a level that would allow the NTA to move to light rail for some areas,  Rather than setting the examination at the end of four years, can we not do some continual assessment?</p></speech>
