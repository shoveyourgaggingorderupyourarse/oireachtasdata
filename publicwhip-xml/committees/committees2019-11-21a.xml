    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#B00200"><p>We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the committee and he is joined by Ms Maureen Mulligan, senior auditor.  No apologies have been received for today's meeting.</p> <p>  We need to agree minutes for previous meetings.  We met on Tuesday, 5 November regarding greenhouse gas and financial transactions with witnesses from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  We had our normal weekly meeting on 7 November, for which certain details have been circulated.  We had a private meeting on 12 November to consider our periodic report.  A note on that has been circulated.  We also had a normal weekly meeting on 14 November, last week.  Can we agree and publish those minutes?  Agreed.</p> <p>  As no matters arise, I will move to correspondence, starting with category A, briefing documents and opening statements.  Nos. 2552 and 2562 from the Charities Regulator are briefing documents and opening statements for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish these.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2564 dated 20 November is the opening statement from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment for the session this afternoon.  We will note and publish this.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Category B is other correspondence.  Some items that we published last week have been held over in case members wish to raise any matters.  The first of these is No. 2530 from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 7 November provides information requested by the committee following our recent meeting with Caranua on 17 October as follows: a report on the consultation with survivors of institutional abuse; information regarding pension liabilities incurred by Caranua under the public services single scheme; and details regarding four properties that were initially offered by religious congregations under the 2002 indemnity agreement and accepted for transfer to the State which subsequently had to be rejected, mainly because of title issues, and cash amounts equivalent to the agreed valuation accepted instead.  We agreed to note and publish this last week.</p> <p>  No. 2532 from Caranua, dated 7 November was also noted and published last week.  It deals with salaries paid to the acting CEO and non-acting CEO during the period of overlap in 2018; a breakdown of the cancelled payments returned to Caranua; details of when the 2018 accounts came before the board; details of expenditure of &euro;80,000 under the human resources heading in 2016; breakdown of expenditure on consultancy work; details regarding 317 outstanding applications; any surplus or interest accrued on contributions received from the Christian Brothers; details regarding statutory redundancy payments and the amount set aside for redundancies; details regarding statistics on phone calls to Caranua; a note on Caranua's total administrative costs since its inception; a breakdown of administrative costs for each year since Caranua's inception; and a note on ongoing mediation involving construction companies and alleged defective work.  We have already agreed to note and publish this.  If any member wants to discuss it, that is fine.  If not, it has been circulated, members have it and are free to discuss it among themselves in any forum they wish, but we have already published it.</p> <p>  No. 2544 is from Mr. Paddy O'Keeffe, tax appeals commissioner, dated 8 November providing the regular update which we require from the Tax Appeals Commission.  The value of the top ten cases amounts to &euro;2.558 billion.  All bar one relate to corporation tax issues.  One relates to the environmental levy, which was subject to a recent Supreme Court decision and parties are now reviewing that judgment.  All the other cases have been listed.  There is a proposed timetable for February 2020.  In one or two they expect progress to be reviewed this month.  The schedule is there.  We note and publish it.  There are no details of names of individuals or companies.  Many of them are in respect of items that could potentially be more than &euro;100 million.  The total is provided.  It is in line with the previous report.  We are getting reports on a regular basis.  We will note and publish that and people can make observations on that.</p> <p>  No. 2545 is from Mr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General, Department of Children and Youth Affairs, dated 8 November providing an update requested by the committee on pending claims being managed by the State Claims Agency on behalf of the Department, including a geographic breakdown.  In particular, I draw attention to the 57 active claims relating to Oberstown detention centre, 49 of which are claims from members of staff.  We will note and publish this.  It contains information we were seeking regarding our discussion with the State Claims Agency.  It is very worrying that 49 staff members have claims against the Department in respect of Oberstown.  We will note it.  That is a serious matter for the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, and Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

I know we got details for Oberstown but not for the other areas, whether it be service users, staff or whatever.  I believe that was part of the request.  Could we request further information on that?  The letter lists the numbers but not the reasons or who made the complaints.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#B00600"><p>We will certainly do that.  That is noted and published.  We will follow that up.</p><p>No. 2546 is on the school transport scheme.  It contains two sentences which I find almost mutually contradictory.  It is from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 8 November responding to our request on whether Bus &Eacute;ireann's auditors are satisfied that profits from the school transport scheme have not been used to cross-subsidise Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; advises that reimbursement to Bus &Eacute;ireann is on a cost-recovery basis for a range of costs identified as being incurred in the operation and administration of the scheme, together with other direct and indirect costs attributable to the work carried out for the Department, referred to as the transport management charge.  A separate account for the school transport scheme is audited each year by independent auditors in Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The Department is satisfied that the appropriate assurances have been received from Bus &Eacute;ireann that all moneys in the school transport scheme are retained within the scheme and expended only on the requirements of the scheme.  We will note and publish this.</p><p>However, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; also contradicts that statement in his letter.  The essential element of what he is saying is that reimbursement is on a cost-recovery basis under an old agreement going back to 1975.  The letter refers to that.  The last paragraph on the first page states:</p><blockquote>The C&amp;amp;AG report referenced a surplus in the Transport Management Charge element of the costs.  This amount was held by way of an uncommitted reserve by Bus Eireann to be used solely for the purposes of the school transport scheme.  The uncommitted reserve was repaid in full to the Department in December 2018.</blockquote> <p>I cannot understand this letter stating there is not a surplus and it is on a cost-recovery basis.  I can understand that there might be a surplus one year and it goes into the next year to meet known costs coming up in that year because it cannot be cut off at the end of the year.  There is a follow through.  However, at the end of all that the letter states, &quot;The uncommitted reserve was repaid in full to the Department.&quot;  Why would it hand money back to the Department if there was not a surplus?  I do not understand that sentence.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#B00800"><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General has been all over this and produced a special report.  I ask him to explain how the Department is claiming there is not a surplus and that it is just cost recovery, yet Bus &Eacute;ireann repaid an uncommitted reserve to the Department.  It is either one or the other.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#B00900"><p>It depends on whether it is defined as a profit or a surplus.  If Bus &Eacute;ireann accepted that it was due back to the Department, which it appears to have done, it could not be recognising it as a profit.</p></speech>

It has excess money and is saying it is a surplus, but because it handed it back, it was never a profit.  Is that what it is saying?</p></speech>

I just do not understand it.</p></speech>

A number of things have happened.  The Department carried out a review.  It did not give us the results of that, but told us what it did as a result of it.</p><p>It did not say what difficulties it discovered with the apportionment methodology.  It also said it was never a profit because it had to be used for school transport.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#C00200"><p>That is the essence of what it is saying.  While it was over-funded, let us say, in one year relative to what it was spending or what it needed to spend, that money was not Bus &Eacute;ireann's to take to profit.  It was money that it was obliged to hold in trust and take less money the following year or to give it back to the Department.  That is what it is acknowledging.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#C00300"><p>So in essence, what is wrong with that?  It should be run on a cost recovery basis, should it not?  It is not a profit-making business so it should be run on a cost and they should be able to show this was the cost, this was the surplus.</p></speech>

Over what period was this surplus, as we will call it, and that ultimately was repaid to the Department built up?  What about the company deciding to return it to the Department?  Was that the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General?  Had his office not done it, was it going to keep this money in its own bank account year on year?  What brought it about that this extra money that was over and above the cost recovery basis that it had been paid, what brought about that being returned to the Department?  That is all I am asking.</p></speech>

There are big issues here in terms of value for money as a subject in terms of the challenges we face separately.  This net issue is about whether the money was a profit or a surplus.  Clearly it was not a profit and clearly it was a cost recovery.  The only question is the one the Chairman is raising.  At what stage should the surplus be repaid or what is the mechanism for it to go back?</p></speech>

We are going to ask the Department to give us the straightforward history on a year-by-year basis since the scheme was introduced of the amounts that were returned to the Department.

If it had never happened before and only got highlighted, that would mean Bus &Eacute;ireann was sitting on that money until whenever somebody highlighted it.  We need to know the full history of any repayments to the Departments of an uncommitted reserve and over what period those uncommitted reserves built up.  That is what we need.

It should not take the actions of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It has independent auditors and the Department is over the scheme.  There was no compulsion on the Comptroller and Auditor General to do the report.  Had he not chosen to do it, that money may well have remained sitting in Bus &Eacute;ireann's bank account.  That is my point.  Surely it should have its own mechanism in place to identify those matters.</p><p>I am going to associate another item of correspondence, No. 2556C from a private individual.  We will note it because it deals specifically with this and highlights a parliamentary question published on 12 November asked by Deputy MacSharry, a member of this committee, in respect of this issue.  The reply is suitably vague.  We will note that item.  We will not publish the name of the person but we will publish the parliamentary question and reply because they are a matter of public record.  We are satisfied that we are going back to the Department on this issue.</p><p>Next is No. 2547B from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE providing information we requested regarding Daisyhouse Housing Association.  There is an ongoing issue.  Issues were highlighted.  They have given us an extensive briefing note in respect of the structure of what Daisyhouse does.  We will note and publish this.  They deal with 15 residents for residents to successfully move into long-term housing.  They work with 14 tenants in long-term accommodation and have provided 32 people with access to health and well-being opportunities.  In respect of funding to Daisyhouse, &euro;237,000 is 51% of their funding and comes from the HSE under a section 39 agreement.  They receive donations of 26% and receive some rent themselves and have some fundraising activities.  Following the issues raised, they had a meeting in August 2018 and the social inclusion teams in the relevant areas in Dublin city and Wicklow met them.  This organisation has now been included on the 2019 agreed audit plan by the HSE.  There is a audit ongoing and we will ask to be kept informed of that audit when it is completed.  We note and publish that.</p><p>Next is No.<b></b>2548B from Mr. John O'Sullivan, chief executive and Commissioner of Valuation, dated 12 November 2019, providing the information we requested in relation to the valuation of public utility undertakings.  Mr. O'Sullivan advises the global valuation process relates to the physical network occupied by certain public utilities for its principal purposes, mainly the supply of gas and telecommunications, issues like that.  They have an overall valuation of &euro;970 million which is designated as public utility undertakings for the purpose of the valuations.  I just want to explain this to the public who will find it interesting.  Global valuations apply where there are major organisations providing public utilities.  They can be private companies providing public utilities across the vast majority of local authorities.  The way the Valuation Office does it is to value the total assets and then apportion this to the relevant local authority areas in which there are assets of that organisation.  This is so people will know what we are talking about.  They have issued very good information here on a county-by-county basis for each of the following companies: 2RN, formerly RT&Eacute; Transmission; BT Communications; Eircom; EirGrid; Eir Mobile; ESB Networks; Gas Networks Ireland; Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann; Irish Water; Three Ireland (Hutchison) Ltd.; Virgin Media Ireland Ltd.; and Vodafone.  The highest valuation is in respect of ESB Networks across the country.  The next highest valuation was Irish Water.  The next highest was Gas Networks Ireland.  Eircom was the fourth highest.  The other ones are down the line.  They give a breakdown of the valuation for each of those companies by local authority.  People will know by looking at this that the 31 local authorities are split showing the valuation.  Gas Networks Ireland has only 27 local authorities because there are some counties that have no natural gas network.  It is not included.  Eight local authorities have not had a recent revaluation and they are listed on the right hand side as a separate amount.</p><p>What I want to stress, because it is not covered in the letter - and perhaps there is an assumption that we know it but the public will not know it - is that while it gives the total global valuation of these organisations as &euro;970 million, which is almost &euro;1 billion, members of the public watching should know that is not &euro;1 billion for local authorities.  The local multiplier is applied in each local authority area in respect of the valuation designated by those organisations.  We all know about counties that have had revaluations.  People got a figure showing what the valuation was and they panicked.  Then they went in and the local authority multiplier might have been 0.25 or 0.23 or whatever the case was.  That is not money for local authorities from rates.  It is the valuation and each local authority has its own local multiplier.  The amount for local authorities is a fraction of this and it can only be obtained by getting the multiplier in each local authority area.  Irish Water is the one that raised this issue in particular.  There is great information for people who want it.  I have run through it so the people watching understand what this correspondence and discussion is about.</p></speech>

Through no fault of their own some of these local authorities have found themselves significantly short-changed.  Local authorities in Dublin, Waterford and a couple of others happened to have the revaluation process when Irish Water was established.  Prior to this, I understand most, if not all, local authorities had a nominal charge on rates because it was just money in and money out for them.  Taking Waterford as an example of a revaluation of the rates done after Irish Water was established, the contribution from Irish Water was &euro;4.7 million.  It was paid in the first year and then, because of the difficulties with Irish Water, it stopped paying the rates and compensation was paid by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Each local authority has received this until now.</p> <p>  The Water Services Act was amended in 2017 to allow Irish Water to pay rates again.  Because of the global valuation, which is not based on the infrastructure in any local authority area but on population, some local authorities have been hit with massive reductions, such as &euro;8 million in Dublin and &euro;3.3 million in Waterford.  Through no fault of their own, they now have to take an axe to cut services or increase rates.</p> <p>  When the revaluation was done in all local authorities, there were some winners and losers.  The pot of money remained the same but that is eaten bread and it has been forgotten.  What is now happening is that ratepayers and those using local services are being affected.  This is quite a serious issue.  Dublin City Council cannot pass its budget and something similar will happen in Waterford.  There are ongoing discussions with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p> <p>  We should go back to the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Planning and Local Government to ask about the history of this and how it came about.  Some authorities, through no fault of their own, just happened to go through the revaluation process at the time.  Waterford City and County Council was given the figure of &euro;4.7 million and did not come up with it.  It was built into their income over seven years and taken away from them with all of the consequences of that.  Dublin City Council's proposed budget included an increase in rents on local authority tenants and an increase on toll charges and rates.  This will have an impact on a lot of people.  It is not the case with every local authority and, in fact, some local authorities gained.  Some were winners and others losers.  For those who are losers it is not their fault but they are taking a hit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General does not audit local government but do we audit Irish Water?</p></speech>

Last week, I raised this issue and the issue of rates income foregone.  Following that, I asked a parliamentary question on the amounts paid by the Department to local authorities over the past five years.  The Department came back to me and helpfully pointed out the Comptroller and Auditor General publishes a report on central government funding, that the most recent report was in 2018 and provided a link.  God bless them.  Two can play at that game.</p></speech>

There are wide variations.  For example, in Waterford, it was almost &euro;4.6 million last year; in Louth, it was &euro;584,000; in Tipperary, it was &euro;427,000; and in my county, it was &euro;308,000.  In Galway city, it was &euro;98,000 while in Galway county, it was &euro;10,500.  There are wide variations.  Council budgets will be done over the coming weeks.  As the Chairman said, it is very useful to have the global valuation with regard to applying the multiplier.  In my county, where the budget will be dealt with on Monday, the figure is not in the budget book yet.</p> <p>  I asked this question last week.  I asked for us to write to the Department which, in previous correspondence, said it was actively monitoring the situation as to the impact on local authorities.  Have we received a response?  I want to know the impact on each local authority's budget book.  The Dublin city manager, Owen Keegan, stated publicly that he had an understanding with the Minister that any shortfall would be met by Exchequer funding.  It is unusual for a member of the County and City Management Association to make such a public statement.  This is not happening and, as I said last week, that issue alone is leaving Dublin City Council with a substantial shortfall of &euro;8 million.  We just do not know yet what the situation will be with regard to the liability of each county and where it stands.  We must remember the central allocation by the Department of Finance to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government out of the overall pool is &euro;35 million.  There is no wriggle room for the Department to try to intervene and help local authorities in this situation.  They are faced with having to find it from elsewhere.  Do we have a response from the Department on its active monitoring of the situation?  It is well aware of the correspondence.  It is keeping in contact with all of the directors of finance in each county and where we stand with regard to the overall figure for each council's budget.</p></speech>

Five months away from an election, a Minister is saying he will get the council over the hump for this year.  This goes back to the substantive issue of how we are funding local government or not funding it.  We give a council &euro;2 million to get it over the hump for this year and then it will be in the same hole next year, and will have to stretch across all the services.  One then receives an answer stating that the Comptroller and Auditor General publishes a report and to look at that.  It is disgraceful.

I assume that if Dublin and Waterford just happened to be going through the revaluation process at the time Irish Water was established, the Valuation Office looked at the water infrastructure in those local authority areas.  Waterford has wastewater treatment plants that service the region.  Is it the case with the global valuation, if it is based on population, that it is not actually based on the infrastructure in local authorities at all?</p></speech>

We have had various Bills on global valuation and the Valuation Office over the years.  The logic is that the other way of doing it is to have the Valuation Office value every single asset in every individual local authority one by one.  The Government felt that was an excessive use of resources at the time.  It said to do a valuation and that this would be divided by population.  It is not exact but is probably the quickest-----</p></speech>

Some counties, if there is no gas network, do not come into the global valuation for Bord G&aacute;is, for example, or Gas Networks Ireland, but most of the big counties do.  There are some very big pieces of infrastructure in certain local authority areas.  It was a simple way of doing it but is not an accurate assessment of the assets.  That global valuation system is one that we here in the Oireachtas have dealt with and amended since time immemorial.  It is up to the Oireachtas if we want to do it on an asset-by-asset basis.  These are commercial bodies.  We all know that lots of other public bodies have schools, courthouses and hospitals, which are not rateable at all because they are non-commercial.  We will follow up on that with the Department, Irish Water and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  No. 2549B is from Mr. Jim Meade, chief executive of Irish Rail, dated 13 November 2019 providing further information regarding the use of the public services card for rail travel.  Figures about the value of debt are included.  We will note and publish this.  He refers to my earlier comments.  He understands that what was said at this meeting by myself and others was reasonable on the basis of the information that we had.  Irish Rail has now provided further information, which helps to clarify the issue.  We will come back to the matter of the public services card and free travel in our next periodic report.</p> <p>  No. 2550B is from Mr. Colm Hayes from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and is about the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme.  We needed to clarify some matters for the periodic report, which we are launching next Tuesday.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  No. 2551B is from Mr. Nick Ashmore, chief executive of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, about the number of employees or number of jobs assisted.  He takes our point but says that the corporation will explore the viability of seeking additional data at the time of application about the number of jobs to be assisted.  However, he says that its preference in such matters is to gather the minimum information needed from small and medium enterprises which are borrowing to meet policy, state aid and founder requirements to keep the application simple and straightforward.  If that is the approach it takes, that is fine.  It should not be publishing the other information regarding employment if it is not related to what it is doing.  My only gripe is that it was claiming some connection between a small loan to a particular organisation and total employment.  If it cannot do it and the amounts are small, where it involves small organisations which meet all the other requirements, that is fine but it should not be putting the employment figures in its annual report unless it can stand over them.</p> <p>  No. 2553B is from Professor Willie Donnelly of Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, providing details requested by the committee regarding the build-up of budget deficits in recent years.  There is much documentation and Deputy Cullinane might want to comment.</p></speech>

A number of institutes of technology are running deficits.  When we looked at it, I think Waterford had the highest deficit proportionally.  We are trying to understand the reason for that and what corrective action is being taken.  It seems that there a number of reasons, including consolidation of companies after a statutory inspection that took place in the institute.  There was regularising of certain income streams.  It noted the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General into how certain income streams were accounted for.  It also talks about cutbacks in funding for higher education.  I assume it is talking about the austerity years, when there were cutbacks.  It has an accumulated deficit of &euro;6.8 million.  The last line is worrying, where it states that despite making savings in both pay and non-pay, the institute could not match the income cuts with comparable expenditure savings.  It is essentially telling us that it cannot bridge the gap, which is a considerable deficit.  It looks like it is not entirely the institute's fault, if at all, if it was a result of significant cuts at the time.</p> <p>  If that has not been dealt with by the Department, that is a difficulty for the institute.  I know that a cost containment plan was put in place that resulted in significant reductions in services on at least one campus in an attempt to deal with it.  The problem here is that the institute cannot deal with pay, which is a big part of any institute's spending.  When it starts trying to cut non-pay expenditure, it becomes very difficult.  It is a very similar situation to a hospital.</p><p>It might be useful to look at WIT as a test case in terms of the other institutes.  Perhaps we could bring representatives of WIT in and look at what happened and the history of this.  WIT has set out very clearly for us the history going back to 2011 and how it ended up in this situation.  It is, it seems, trying to recover and to deal with the deficit.  There was a drop-off in student numbers.  WIT says there has been an increase again, which is helping.  However, I find the last line very worrying because this is an institute that, it is hoped, will transition into a technological university with Carlow yet it is carrying this big deficit and does not seem to be able to manage it, it seems, through no fault of its own because it just does not have the income to do it.  It cannot cut in areas in which it cannot cut, such as pay, obviously.  I request that we have a look at this as part of our work programme.  We did a lot of work on third level institutes and now we have moved on to other issues.  However, this is one of those legacy issues.  I refer to how WIT is funded; consolidation of other companies, which in this case happened; how that has played a part in the deficit; and, more importantly, the cuts in funding to higher education and how they are still biting for some institutes of technology.  Would that be a reasonable request, that we perhaps look at Waterford as-----</p></speech>

It says in respect of the financial year ending 31 August 2019, "The consolidated financial statements are currently undergoing a final draft stage and will be available for the C&amp;AG by the prescribed due date of 30th November 2019."  That is within three months of the year end.  I remember that a few years ago we almost suspended a meeting because the most recent accounts we had were two and a half years old.  Again, the input of the Committee of Public Accounts has certainly brought a bit of realisation to the boards of these organisations that there must be proper corporate governance, which includes producing financial statements in a timely manner.  WIT now seems to be doing so.  However, as Deputy Cullinane said, the last sentence reads, "The Institute, despite making savings in both pay and non-pay, could not match the income cuts with comparable expenditure saving."  I take it that that is the historic position, not the position into the future.  WIT is giving the summary of its past-----</p></speech>

There are still legacy issues resulting from the cutbacks back in the austerity years, which is a bit unfair if the effort is being made to deal with the non-pay elements of this, and it seems there has been an effort in conjunction with the Department.  I think the Comptroller and Auditor General is saying there was some growth in student numbers and that there has been some reduction in the deficit in recent years, so it is going in the right direction at least.</p></speech>

We will certainly come back to it at that stage.  We will note and publish that information in the meantime.  It is good to get it.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence - we are nearly there - is No. 2554B, from the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, dated 14 November, responding to our request for information regarding asylum seekers.  The information was requested by our secretariat as part of our periodic report work.  There is also the next item, No. 2560B, from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, dated 5 November, providing information requested by the committee on direct provision centres.  This is also to feed into our periodic report, which we will publish next week.  For the benefit of people watching the meeting, I wish to highlight a couple of matters.</p> <p>  In No. 2554B, which contains some useful figures and statistics, the Department of Justice and Equality states the following.  At the end of October there were 8,560 persons with active international protection claims in Ireland, with 4,198 applications being made between January and the end of October of this year.  There were 6,760 persons in direct provision centres at the end of October.  The number of asylum seekers in hotel accommodation was 1,433 at the end of October.  The number of individuals currently residing in direct provision centres who have been granted leave to stay in the State is 778.  The average length of stay in direct provision centres, the Department says, is 22 months.  There is a chart in the correspondence, which we will publish.  The Department goes on to state the average time it takes for an application for international protection to be completed.  This was new to me, but the Department refers to the cases that were completed in October, in the last month, and seems to be saying it is shortening the procedure.  What happens is that when people arrive and present themselves at the office, they are granted accommodation on the day and then, as soon as possible, they complete the questionnaire with all the information, making their application for international protection.  It states here that for prioritised applications there will be an interview scheduled within four to five months.  For non-prioritised applications it will take nine to ten months.  Then, after the interview, it takes about two months, depending on the complexity of the case, for a decision to be recommended.  The Department is saying that the processing time during October 2019 was 15 months and for prioritised cases it was 9.6 months.  What are the criteria to be considered in determining whether an application is prioritised versus non-prioritised?  That is new to me.  I had not encountered it before.  Members can see what the Department is saying.  The figures are there and they are useful.</p> <p>  This is complemented by the next item of correspondence, No. 2560B, from the Secretary General of the Department, Aidan O'Driscoll, again providing information that we will need for our periodic report.  He refers in this short letter to the numbers in direct provision, and I have given those figures.  He states, "Because of a shortage of places in centres, there are now, as of 29th October 2019, 1,531 people are in emergency accommodation in hotels and guesthouses."  He accepts that this is highly unsatisfactory and says that some time ago the Department put an advertisement in the national media looking for such centres.  The Department further states that it held a competition on a regional basis for people to provide emergency accommodation centres - that is, accommodation through hotels and guest houses - and that, following the regional competitions, the Department is now in the mobilisation phase in the south-east, the midlands and the mid-west regions.  Accommodation for the south-west and western regions is still on the way.  For the mid-east region, which I presume includes Dublin, the closing date for submissions was 16 September and the valuation will commence shortly.  I am providing all this information just by way of an update.  The issue is very clear: because the accommodation centres are full, the Department has been trying to get emergency accommodation in various centres around the county.  These are meant to be temporary.  The Department says it could take three months, but that could be one or two years at the end of the day, depending on the numbers coming.  The Department notes it has no control over the numbers arriving in the country.  It must deal with people on the day they arrive and present at the office.</p><p>That is interesting information, some which will be in a periodic report.</p><p> Did the Deputy wish to comment on that?</p></speech>

First, I welcome the information, which is helpful, particularly to local communities.</p> <p>  On value for money, I welcome also this.  The mean length of stay is 21.75 months.  Doing a quick calculation, according to the diagram on page three of this email, more than 30% are waiting longer than two years.  It depends on how one reads figures.  According to the emergency figure, in the space of two days, there is a difference of 98 people.  These are human lives.  I welcome the email, but I do not welcome that 1,433 asylum seekers are in hotel and guest accommodation.  People seeking asylum are being put up in hotels and guest houses.  From a public accounts assessment, is that value for money, besides any human considerations, which we discuss in a different forum?</p> <p>  According to the letter then, we are told that there are 1,531 people in such accommodation.  The difference is 98 people in the two days.  Have 98 people left this accommodation provision in two days?  </p></speech>

The numbers are not overwhelming.  More than 700 people with status are in direct provision.  If the system was working efficiently, they would be out in the community and there would be 700 spaces, which would immediately halve the number in emergency accommodation.</p> <p>  On every level, this is not value for money.  This was foreseeable.  It should have been reviewed on a regular basis.  We knew the numbers, which are not overwhelming.  I want that message to go out from me.  I ask people to read the detail in those letters.</p> <p>On the restricted remit that we have in respect of value for money, this is not value for money.</p></speech>

Most of the centres are former hotels.  Some of the hotels and guest houses are solely dedicated to emergency accommodation.  There are no other people in this accommodation, although a certain number of rooms are set aside in some hotels.  Any of the centres I have encountered are dedicated solely for emergency purposes.  We need to know what is the difference in the quality of service for the people who arrive here versus the other accommodation provided.</p> <p>  The other issue I wish to mention, which I believe RT&Eacute; highlighted, is that we had a detailed discussion regarding the costs of direct provision, and it emerged long after our meeting that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had allocated part of its overseas development aid, ODA, budget towards provision for people who arrive here seeking asylum for their first 12 months here.   We were never told that and I am disappointed at the way this Department works.  The public were entitled to believe that the committee had a full, frank and complete discussion on the cost of the direct provision centres with the Department of Justice and Equality and that that was the full picture.  It transpired shortly after meeting, according to a report published by RT&Eacute;, that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade expended considerable millions of euros in recent years from the ODA budget to meet our international targets for people who come to Ireland from these countries.  The first full 12 months of their accommodation is included in the ODA budget.  They are helping people from foreign countries, even though the service is being provided here.  For the 12 months after they have been granted status the Department can also include that in the ODA budget.  We are writing immediately to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for a complete breakdown on that.  On behalf of the committee, it is disappointing that this silo mentality is operating within the Government.  We could be here talking to the Department of Justice and Equality believing that we were dealing with full picture, and it fully knew that some of the funding for the direct provision centres was coming from another Department.</p></speech>

It is clear that the process is not working and that claims are not being processed anywhere near that time.  According to the figures, 766 people have been in direct provision or emergency accommodation for three to four years, and more than 500 for four to five years.  Many of them came here looking for work and could be working, earning, and paying their taxes but, instead, they are stuck in direct provision for that duration.  Towards the end of the correspondence, as referred to by the Chairman, it states that prioritised applications take four to five months.

That will complete our discussion on this matter.</p> <p>  No. 2555 is from an individual, dated 11 November, requesting that the committee make inquiries regarding personal information collected for the public services card.  We will write to the Department to ask for details on this.  The correspondence states that there is information on debt levels, SAFE levels, quarantine, welfare profile, and relationship collection.  This person has obviously made some inquiries.  We will ask the Department for a full response to the email we have received.  We will note that but we will not publish it as it is from a private individual.  </p> <p>  Finally, we will deal with financial statements and accounts received since our most recent meeting: Housing and Sustainable and Communities Agency, clear audit opinion but non-compliant procurement - a standard letter will issue to the agency on the non-compliant procurement; Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, clear audit opinion; Broadcasting Fund, clear audit opinion; Waterways Ireland, a North-South body, clear audit opinion; export guarantee account - inactive, clear audit opinion; National Library of Ireland, clear audit opinion; and motor tax account, which is a new account, clear audit opinion.  Will the Comptroller and Auditor General explain what a new account means?</p></speech>

The subvention required from the Horse and Greyhound Fund will have to increase if that accumulation of liability is to be staved off again.  The CEO's promise to provide the report was an indication that Bord na gCon was going to change tack and become commercially viable.  The point made is relevant in that the board was not washing its face with regard to revenue streams from attendees or commercial revenue.  The bar and restaurant were the only things coming in on the right side of the ledger.  That is an important point to consider before looking at the subvention, which is substantial, for next year or the year after.</p></speech>

We are joined by Ms Helen Martin, chief executive officer; Mr. Niall Scanlon, finance manager; and Mr. Eamon O'Halloran, head of registration and projects.  We are also joined by Ms Ciara Bates, principal officer, and Mr. Kevin Power, assistant principal officer in the Department of Rural and Community Development.  It is interesting that this is the first time the authority has appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is also Ms Martin's first appearance before the committee, having been appointed to her current role last summer.  We wish her well.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and the people in the Gallery that all mobile phones must be turned off or put into airplane mode, as merely putting them into silent mode does not prevent interference with the recording system.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded that under Standing Order 186, the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p><p>While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour, they can, and should, expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

It is responsible for the regulation and protection of charitable trusts and organisations.  It has been granted a wide range of powers and duties, including the power to conduct investigations into the affairs of charities.  Under the provisions of the Act, the authority holds funds in trust on behalf of charities that wish to participate in a common investment fund controlled by the authority.  Separately, it holds the funds of charities in a charity funds account.  My audit of the authority covers two sets of financial statements: the financial statements for the normal operations of the authority and the financial statements for the charity funds account.  The common investment fund is separately accounted for and is audited by a commercial firm of auditors.  The financial statements of the common investment fund are not presented to the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  The 2018 financial statements of the authority recorded total income of &euro;3.96 million, all of which is Oireachtas grant funding.  Its expenditure in that year was &euro;3.7 million, which included staff costs of &euro;2.1 million and other administration costs of &euro;1.5 million.  The authority reported an operating surplus for the year of &euro;47,000, after appropriation of &euro;236,000 for capital purposes.  A clear audit opinion was given on the 2018 financial statements.  Certain charity funds have been lodged for safekeeping with the authority or its predecessor, the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests, and are being held pending clarification of their proper use.  These funds are held by the authority in a separate charity funds account.  The authority uses the same account, as required, to receive and transmit funds between charities and the common investment fund.  The balance on the charity funds account at the close of 2018 was &euro;1.38 million.  Most of the balance related to funds of charities being held for safekeeping.  Receipts into the fund account during 2018 amounted to just over &euro;2 million, mainly comprising dividends from the investment fund and proceeds of investment units realised at the direction of participating charities.  The charity funds account payments in 2018 mainly represented distribution of the receipts to the charities concerned.  A clear audit opinion was given on the 2018 financial statements of this account.</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. Eamon O&rsquo;Halloran, who is the authority's head of registration and projects; and Mr. Niall Scanlon, who was recently appointed as the authority's professional accountant and finance manager.  The committee will be aware that the CRA, or Charities Regulator as it is known, was established as an independent authority on a statutory basis in October 2014 in accordance with the Charities Act 2009.  The board of the authority has 12 members and the authority has 37.5 full-time equivalent members of staff.<br/><br/>The Charities Regulator is funded by the Exchequer through a subhead of Vote 42 of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  In 2018, our budget was &euro;4.4 million and our total spend was just over &euro;4 million.  Pay accounted for approximately &euro;2.1 million of our overall spend and non-pay expenditure amounted to approximately &euro;1.9 million.  Monthly financial reports are used by senior management, by the finance, audit, risk and governance committee and by the board to monitor performance against key strategic priorities, objectives and yearly business plan targets.  We have a number of statutory functions, such as maintaining a register of charities, ensuring charity trustees comply with the 2009 Act, carrying out inquiries and investigations into the affairs of charities and issuing guidance and other codes to assist charity trustees.  We deal with applications by charities under the Charities Acts, 1961 and 1973, for services and assistance such as authorising <i>cy-pr&egrave;s</i>schemes and sales of charity lands.  When it was established, the Charities Regulator took over responsibility for administering a common investment fund scheme for charities, established under the Charities Act 1961.  The current value of this fund is approximately &euro;39.7 million.<br/><br/>Our first statement of strategy supported the establishment of the Charities Regulator and guided us through our formative years from 2016 to 2018.  Over this period, significant time was dedicated to establishing organisational structures, processes and procedures to ensure compliance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  During the period of our first statement of strategy, we developed an online public register of charities and established a contact centre for charity trustees and other members of the public to call or email us with any queries they may have.  Other key milestones during that period included the publication of a suite of practical and informative guidance materials to assist charity trustees, including guidelines on fundraising from the public, the development of a concerns unit and an online concerns process, the completion of a number of statutory investigations under the 2009 Act, the implementation of a new digital platform to support our regulatory and organisational activities, the launch of an enhanced website and a quarterly e-magazine to keep those involved in the sector updated on key developments, the formulation of a draft scheme for a charities (amendment) Bill along with associated draft accounting and reporting regulations and the launch of the charities governance code.<br/><br/>In 2019, we published our second statement of strategy, for 2019 to 2021, which aims to move us closer to realising our vision of a vibrant trusted charity sector that is valued for the public benefit it provides.  Strengthening public trust and confidence in charities is one of four strategic priorities under our second statement of strategy.</p><p>A key objective in this regard is to enhance further the public register of charities, which is a searchable online facility.</p><p> Charities are independent organisations run by charity trustees.  They play a vital role in our society and provide public benefit in diverse ways to communities in Ireland and across the world.  It is, therefore, essential that charities are transparent and accountable to volunteers, beneficiaries, employees, funders, donors and the wider public.  The register is intended as a point of reference for members of the public to learn more about individual charities.  There are currently 10,370 registered charities in Ireland and 65,904 charity trustees listed on the register.  According to research published by the Charities Regulator in 2018, the majority of charities on the register are small volunteer-led charities with income of less than &euro;50,000.  However, there is no doubt that registered charities make a significant contribution to our economy and society more generally, with income of &euro;14.5 billion, approximately 189,000 people employed in the sector and more than 300,000 volunteers.</p><p> Other general functions of the Charities Regulator include the promotion of compliance by charity trustees with their legal duties and ensuring the accountability of charities to donors, beneficiaries and the public.  In this regard, we work closely with charities, charity representative groups and other experts and stakeholders to ensure that the guidance materials that we publish are of practical assistance to those volunteering and working in the sector.  Examples include the guidelines on fundraising from the public, guidance for charity trustees, internal financial control guidelines for charities and, more recently, a governance code toolkit comprising templates and other guidance materials to underpin the charities governance code.  Promoting compliance with the charities governance code and working with charities to support them in its implementation will remain a key focus for the Charities Regulator for the period of our current strategy.</p><p> Our statutory remit also includes monitoring compliance by charitable organisations with charity law and carrying out investigations.  We actively monitor compliance with key regulatory requirements, such as the requirement for charities to submit annual reports.  Compliance rates in regard to this obligation have increased significantly over the past three years, with the overall compliance rate for annual reports due in regard to 2017 reaching 98%.</p><p> We also carry out inquiries as part of our concerns process.  In 2018, we received in excess of 686 concerns, which was an increase of 29% on the previous year.  Of the concerns received in respect of registered charities, over 50% related to internal financial controls and transparency and other governance issues.  We closed 722 concerns during 2018.</p><p> Other compliance activities in 2018 included 48 statutory directions to provide information or produce books, documents and other records for the purposes of our inquiries.  In addition, we published two inspectors&rsquo; reports into the affairs of two registered charities, GLEN and Solas&ndash;Galway Picture Palace, and we imposed intermediate sanctions on one registered charity.</p><p> Developing our compliance and enforcement function further is a key objective in terms of meeting our strategic priorities of providing proportionate risk-based regulation and protection, and promoting compliance within the sector.  Supported by our new IT platform, along with a number of important legislative amendments, which the Minister for Rural and Community Development is progressing through the charities (amendment) Bill, we hope to enhance our proactive monitoring capabilities further, using data to identify and anticipate risks to facilitate targeted and proportionate regulatory interventions and engagement with charities.  The charities (amendment) Bill is key in this regard as it will create a level playing field for all charities, including those that are companies, and will facilitate increased levels of transparency and greater accountability in regard to the finances of charities.</p><p> Since our establishment in 2014, the Charities Regulator has made significant progress in meeting its statutory mandate.  Through the hard work and commitment of the authority, its staff and those working in the charities sector, we have a strong foundation on which to build and deliver on our second statement of strategy.  We remain committed to working with all our stakeholders to fulfil our mission to regulate the charity sector in the public interest so as to ensure compliance with the law and support best practice in the governance, management and administration of charities.  I am happy to respond to any questions members of the committee might have.</p></speech>

Today, we have two sessions and we will have one lead speaker for each session, one this morning and one this afternoon, if that is agreeable.  The lead speaker this morning is Deputy Kelly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.195" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#L00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for coming in and for their opening statement.  I wish them the best of luck in their important work.  Given the number of charities, and there are those that come under two lists, that is, those that are registered and those that are not, and given the number of full-time staff in the Charities Regulator is 37.5 whole-time equivalents, does it have enough capacity to do this work?  It is a relatively new organisation and has had to develop and get structures in place.  While I believe this is a positive thing, and I do not say that regularly, it seems a small number of staff for the work it does, given there are 10,370 registered charities.</p> <p>  The Charities Regulator has had a turnover of senior staff lately.  That usually sets off alarm bells here.  Ms Martin might explain, so we can clear that up, why the three senior people left.</p> <p>  How often does the Charities Regulator liaise with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda fraud squad, the Data Protection Commissioner and the Companies Registration Office?  Will Ms Martin give us a flavour of that in regard to meetings and interactions, what they are about and how often they take place, sharing data, investigations and so on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.196" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Martin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#L00400"><p>With regard to the number of staff, we do not have enough staff and the complement should be about 53.  However, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, we have achieved an enormous amount, although that has been on the back of the real commitment of staff and focusing our resources on where we think we can have the greatest impact.  That would be in terms of supporting charities but also, at the same time, since 2016, building up our concerns unit.  In future, when we have more staff, we will look to move into the area of more proactive monitoring, and I will come back to that later as there are certain things we require in that regard.</p> <p>  We have managed to get staff over the past year, having lost some staff.  We have a new in-house finance manager, which we did not have before as we previously used a consultant.  I wanted to bring that role in-house so that person would be reporting to me, as CEO.  We have also got our head of communications and stakeholder engagement, which is another key position we have filled since June of this year.  In addition, we have a number of positions that are obviously key and which we absolutely need to fill, such as the corporate affairs manager, and we also need more legal resources.  On the legal resources, it is a very challenging marketplace out there but we are using the different avenues available to us and working with the Department on that in regard to seeking expressions of interest for secondment of people from within the civil and public service and drawing down from past panels that are available to us.  That is very much the focus at the moment.  Another key position was filled in recent weeks when Thomas Mulholland joined us as our head of compliance and enforcement.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, the CEO moved on to become CEO of the Mental Health Commission.  Our head of compliance and enforcement moved on.  At the time, his role was graded as assistant principal and we sought to have that regraded, but unfortunately he had moved on to a promotion opportunity within the HSE.  Our head of communications and stakeholder engagement had been with us on a two-year contract and, as a result, had wanted to move on, and he moved back into the charities sector.  They were the main losses that we had.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.200" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Martin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#L00800"><p>This was in regard to our interactions with other agencies.  The main agency we interact with is Revenue, with which members of our registration team would interact.  The Deputy might be aware from our briefing material that 6,500 of the charities on our register are there because they were deemed registered at the date the register was established.</p><p>The deeming was related to the fact that on that date, they held a charitable tax exemption so, effectively, they came on to the register.  We have over 3,500 others which are what we call section 39 bodies.  They are the charities that registered with us.  As a result of the fact that we have a huge number of section 40 bodies, the ones that are deemed registered, we would deal with Revenue a lot.  Where a section 40 charity that has been deemed registered loses its charitable tax exemption through the operation of the Act, it automatically comes off the register.  We have no input into that decision.  Once a charity loses its tax exemption, it comes off the register and must try to re-register.  That is why we interact regularly with Revenue.  </p><p> In addition, we would be in contact with the Companies Registration Office regarding our IT platform and the fact that we would draw down certain materials from its website regarding the accounts of those charities that are companies.  Our compliance and enforcement team would be in contact with staff from the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement where particular issues arise, for example, if we were dealing with a company that was not keeping proper books of account.  Unfortunately, under our Act at the moment, we would not be able to proceed against such a company for breach of the Charities Act because it is a company and is carved out.  That is something we are looking to address under the charities (amendment) Bill because we believe all charities should be equally regulated by the Charities Regulator.  It means that in those situations, we have to contact the ODCE because, obviously, it is an offence not to keep proper books of account under the Companies Act.  We are reliant on the ODCE to take action in that regard.  Similarly, we would have almost daily contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

What kind of powers does the Charities Regulator use to ensure that the money being left in wills to various different charities does what it says on the tin, namely, goes to the right area and relevant charity and is spent in the way the person, persons or organisations intended it to be spent?  Have there ever been instances where anyone in the legal profession has had to be investigated for ignoring or not following instructions 100% regarding the leaving of money to these organisations?  What procedures has the Charities Regulator used to follow up in such scenarios?  Does it ever carry out random checks in respect of these sort of donations to make sure the money is being spent appropriately to ensure public confidence?  I see that the section on donations in its guidelines for charitable organisations states that where donations are made for a specific purpose, the donor's request is honoured.  Can Ms Martin give us confidence that this happens?</p></speech>

As part of that, there is a requirement, which is the subject of a Law Society direction, that when a charitable donation is made, a receipt must filed with us.  The solicitor and executor must confirm with the Charities Regulator that the money or the bequest has gone to the relevant person or charity it was meant to go to.  We work with the Probate Office on that.  We would receive what are known as PAS 3 forms, which are the forms that are filled out by solicitors and executors regarding charitable bequests and donations.  We have a team that would go through those.  It follows up with solicitors and executors to see if they have receipts or something they can submit regarding the particular bequest or donation.</p></speech>

We are here to help the Charities Regulator in this scenario.  From a resource point of view, the committee does periodic reports and if members believe the Charities Regulator needs more resources, we will say that plainly.

Another major issue concerns the regulations for accounting and reporting.  They are dependent on us having this change made with regard to companies.  We cannot introduce regulations to require a level of transparency with regard to finances that would only apply to unincorporated charities and would not, therefore, apply to 60% of the charities on our register.  We have to wait until this amendment comes into force before we can introduce the regulations that, for example, would introduce something like the charities statement of recommended practice or SORP.  This is a statement of recommended practice for charities that would require charities with a certain level of income to give far greater detail in their financial statements that is currently the case.</p></speech>

I agree with Ms Martin 100%.</p> <p>  I looked at the percentages showing where donations went under headings such as education, religion, benefit to the community, poverty and economic hardship.

We have been around the houses in this committee on numerous occasions with issues relating to the third level sector.  We did a specific report on it, in fact, and there is a whole quagmire of issues relating to how third level funding operates in respect of third party organisations, etc.  We hear a lot about philanthropists funding various third level organisations.  We know that Ireland Funds and various other organisations are providing funding to third level.  We have had debates where representatives of colleges and universities have come in and said they are putting a sign over a building in Cork, for example, stating that the funding came from private funds they generated themselves, whether through donations or other income.  That is complete and utter garbage because the taxpayer has to provide funding in the first place before those bodies are able to access other sources of income.</p> <p>  If the witnesses do not have the information I am seeking, we will need to come back to it another day.  I will not stop pursuing the matter because I have a deep nervousness about how these funds are being given to third level colleges, what the Charities Regulator is and is not aware of in this regard, and for what purposes the colleges are using the funds.  Are they charitable donations or are they being given for research?  Are they being given to the various alumni associations that have been set up to assist in the funding of third level institutions?  We have a figure for 2017 but we cannot break it down.  Where are we at in regard to 2018?</p></speech>

Universities are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and we now know of other sources of income.  These foundations are outside the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General but do come under the Charities Regulator.  The funding goes through these foundations and comes out the other end, so we should be able to create a whole and transparent picture of what is going through all the third level colleges.  When Ms Martin can provide us with that information, we will have a clearer view of where all that funding is going, how it is being spent and how it is being matched with taxpayers' money.  I hope Ms Martin can provide us with as much information as possible, including totals and percentages across all third level colleges, in tabular form, and a commentary on each foundation or other organisation that is in place.  All of that would be useful.</p> <p>  Has the Charities Regulator considered running a public awareness campaign in regard to its work?  As a public representative, people often tell me that they do not donate to charities other than those which are local to them because they are confident of their bona fides.  I am concerned that a lot of charities are being painted in the wrong way.  There have been issues with the sector in the past, which I will not detail today.  There are one or two organisations that stand out at a national level because they are so large and well known, such as the Irish Cancer Society.  Some charities, however, are being damaged by association with what went on in the past, and potential funds are not coming to them because of this.  Could the Charities Regulator devise some type of campaign to engage and inform people?  It will be challenging because of the range of charities in operation, but it would be helpful.  We have discovered in the past that where people were collecting on street corners for certain charitable organisations, a large percentage of the funds raised were given to the collectors and only a small percentage to the charities themselves.</p></speech>

Specifically, priority No. 4 in our current statement of strategy is all about the need to ensure there is public awareness of what the Charities Regulator does and how the sector is regulated.  There is a focus on increasing standards of governance across the sector and working with charities to highlight how they can make the most of being a registered charity.  We are currently in the middle of a Meet the Regulator roadshow.</p><p>One of the key messages we are trying to get across to charities and registered charities is that not every not-for-profit is a registered charity and that charities should be utilising their registered charity number to let people know they are regulated.  We are working very closely with the charities.  I believe there is a piece of work there and we will be focusing on that.</p></speech>

I am aware that Ms Martin is bedding down the organisation.  I have gone through the opening statement and the corporate plan and have done some research on some of the work done by the Charities Regulator.  In her opening statement, Ms Martin referred to a number of "statements of strategy".  Initially, for the period of 2016 to 2018 the regulator was bedding down organisational structures, looking at processes and procedures in order to ensure compliance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The next part of the strategy for 2019 to 2021 will be, in Ms Martin's terms, to move "closer to realising our vision of a vibrant trusted charity sector [and] ... strengthening public trust and confidence in charities".  On that second piece of the strategy from 2019 to 2021, will Ms Martin clarify what the Charities Regulator will be looking at specifically?</p></speech>

The work is about ensuring the register has as much information as possible relating to charities in order that members of the public can check out the individual charity in which they might be interested and can see what the charity is about.  Hopefully, the public can also take some confidence that the sector is regulated.</p> <p>  We are also working with the charities on the charities' governance code.  This is a huge part of our strategic priorities over the next two years in particular when we will work with the charities on that.  This is about getting the charities to engage with the tool that is available to them, which is the charities' governance code, and to increase standards of best practice in governance.  We would hope to see that reflected in levels of trust and confidence.</p> <p>  We will be monitoring and doing our own research to establish a baseline early next year for what are the levels of trust and confidence.  The members may be aware that in 2012 it was at the highest rate, which was 74%, but it had fallen quite considerably over the last years.  In 2017 the level of trust and confidence was at 46%.  I want to ensure that we establish a baseline and then look at that in subsequent years.  In that way we can see if we can work out the impact of the work we are doing and see how it has assisted the charity sector.</p> <p>  On the other side, which is the compliance and enforcement piece, charities themselves will agree that they want to see the Charities Regulator holding charities to account when things are not being done correctly.  This is a key focus over the coming years also, and especially on the resources side.  New resources we get in over the next year certainly will be going into the compliance and enforcement area.  I have said before that one of the big things is that we would have access to the accounts of all charities and that they would be presented in a very particular way that is specific to charities.  This would give certain disclosures to charities with regard to what is suitable for them.</p></speech>

My questions will focus more on reporting and who does the reporting and how is it acted upon.  Consider an example of charity A, where the auditor finds there have been lapses in financial controls or finds some other problem or challenge.  Obviously, that would then be included in the audited report.  Does the Charities Regulator get a copy of those audited reports?</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General does an audit of a Department or an organisation that comes under his remit.  He does the audit, reports and there is an audited opinion.  If an issue arises, it is there for everybody to see.  In this situation, if one has a charity that has to carry out an audit - which they have to do - there may be a report or there has to be a report as a consequence of that, and it may well flag a problem.  If the Charities Regulator, however, does not see that audit report how does it know there is a problem?</p></speech>

Console was a real controversy.  All of us accept that the vast majority of charities do an excellent job where there are no difficulties and they provide an excellent service.  There are some, however, whether they were outliers or not, that had very serious challenges.  Console's problems were only highlighted when the HSE's internal audit looked more deeply at what was happening.  Flags had been raised, missed and not acted upon over a long period.  When they were acted upon it was the internal audit that established what was happening.  If the regulator does not have access to internal audit reports of organisations that could be flagging up some problems, then I am worried that the regulator is not across what might be happening in some charities in the way it should be.</p></speech>

If they are flagged up, then there is even more reason for the regulator to have them.  They would be in plain sight and the regulator could see them; it would not need any work done by the regulator.</p> <p>  I want to get on to the concerns process.  Ms Martin has said there is an online concerns process and a concerns unit.  It strikes me that this is based more on individuals, such as whistleblowers or service users who would perhaps highlight concerns, but this is different to actual processes where people go in to do audits and examine the financial controls that might be in place in organisations.  Earlier, I asked about an internal or external auditor who sees a problem.  Is he or she obliged to report this to the regulator or not, or is the organisation obliged to report this to the regulator?  If a problem has been flagged by the auditor to the organisation, is it then obliged to inform the regulator of the problem? Does this happen or are they obliged to do that?</p></speech>

If one considers the history of the Console issue, it went on for so long and people were trying to figure out how did it happen for so long.  It was because people were asleep at the wheel and it was not being examined in the way it should have been: credit card expenditure was off the chart; duplicate accounts were different for the same time period; and directors were also employees.  There were huge issues that were all missed but which were eventually found to be the case.  I am struggling to understand, as this happened.  There are other examples we could go into and while I do not want to spend time talking about the bad examples - as there are so many good examples of charities - we do know there was very bad practice.  This has an impact on the people who gave the money to those charities.  If the regulator is not across this, if there is no obligation on the auditor to inform the regulator that there is a difficulty, if there is no obligation on the organisation or charity itself to inform the regulator and if the regulator is not seeing the audited accounts, then I am concerned that we do not have the oversight we should have around financial governance and governance generally in charities.  When are we going to get to a point when this will be the case?</p></speech>

This is the difference between being reactive in our compliance work and being proactive in monitoring.  To have proactive monitoring, there are several elements and we have geared ourselves up for it with the new IT systems, in order we can have a system to interrogate the information we get.</p><p>First, we need amendments to the Charities Act to enable us to introduce regulations on accounting and reporting.  Once those are in place, there would be a proportionate requirement for certain standards of reporting and auditing for certain sized charities.

We also have internally generated sources, that is, situations where another regulator might contact us with a concern about a charity and we might start looking into it at that point but that would be in a minority of cases.  The cases tend to come in from the public.</p></speech>

Surely there is an obligation.  Take the HSE for example.  Some of these are section 39 organisations which have service level agreements to provide certain services.  Separately from that, if a charity was not such an organisation, it would be a charity that would be audited independently and an external audit would have to be done.  There is, however, an element of an audit for the moneys paid by the State to these organisations.  Given we have had problems with some of the section 39 organisations - I will not go through them all but I believe there was a difficulty in Harold's Cross and elsewhere - I would be surprised if at no point has the HSE or any other body approached the regulator to say it is coming across these problems and here is how those organisations were able to evade responsibility and accountability.  Going back to what Ms Martin said earlier, 2019 to 2021 is supposed to be about strengthening public trust and confidence in charities and looking at ways in which the charity sector can provide the trust that people need.  Part of that would be that the regulator learns lessons.  Whatever about any mistakes that are made, if we are not learning lessons there is a problem.  How is it the case that through all these scandals, and I gave two examples, that Ms Martin cannot tell me today she is clear that none of the organisations, whether the HSE or otherwise, has at any point alerted the regulator to any of the problems?  It is no good for Ms Martin to read about any of this in the newspaper or hearing it on the news.  What good is that to her organisation?</p></speech>

I am glad that the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned Trinity.  It decided to consolidate its accounts in the past few years; it is a new step and is an example to other universities.</p> <p>  Ms Martin has an extremely important job.  The figures she gave in her opening statement are extraordinary, with over 10,000 charities, almost 66,000 trustees and &euro;14.5 billion, not to mention almost 190,000 volunteers.  It is an extremely important area on every level, both on an economic level and on a psychological level for the work being carried out, and there is also what volunteers get out of it. </p> <p>  I will follow on from the last Deputy's concerns.  In her opening statement, Ms Martin noted "In 2018, we received ... 686 concerns, which was an increase of 29% on the previous year."  If we have learned anything in recent years, it is how difficult it is for someone to complain.  It is not in the interest of someone living here to complain, they suffer as a consequence.  That is why the processes and procedures need to be robust.  The breakdown of the figures as to where the concerns are coming from is key to help the regulator, as an organisation, to deal in a more proactive way.</p><p>We should be relying on whistleblowers and individuals to come forward as a tiny piece of the jigsaw.  The regulator is the vital piece in this and the Act is from 2009.  It is no reflection on the witnesses but it was years before the regulator became operational.  We are still waiting on amending legislation, and that is our fault.  Within this, what risk assessment has the organisation carried out to identify the areas that are suffering or exposed because the regulator does not have a full staff complement?</p></speech>

I would not put other resources into the concerns team as it exists; I would put them in the proactive monitoring piece.  We will have people in the area working with the systems to see what other information we might have while waiting for the accounting and reporting regulations to come in.</p></speech>

There was a serious problem with - I will put this as mildly as I can - the trustees&rsquo; awareness of their duties and responsibilities.  The regulator made a general finding that trustees should be ore aware of their duties and it has a role in that.  Another of the recommendations states "the Charities Regulatory Authority should consider furnishing a copy of this report as it deems relevant."

That is why we are focused on the next stage of developing the compliance and enforcement team, as well as introducing proactive monitoring.  We need certain tools to do that.  We need the information to be made available to us.  That is why we require the amendments to the Act and the accounting-reporting regulations.  To be able to do that proactive monitoring piece would be a massive move for us.  Hopefully, we would see flags and particular points in accounts where we would know there is something not right.  It would raise a flag and then we could hone in on it ourselves without anyone having to raise a concern with us.  We would be able to identify those charities ourselves.</p></speech>

There was a charity shop, Good and New, which was not keeping proper books of account.  We have the ability to impose an intermediate sanction where the contravention is publicised.  In some cases, we can remove the charity from the register for a period.  An intermediate sanction is used in a situation where there has been a breach and an offence committed under the Act in place of a prosecution.  We would see that as being more proportionate, particularly when it comes to charities.  We tend not to see charities doing things on purpose.  It tends to be an oversight or a case of simply not being informed.  We take a proportionate approach to those matters.</p></speech>

In 2017, there were discussions about the regulator providing information on who is running a charity and how donations are spent.  It provides information on the who but not on the donations.  It could provide that information if it chose to do so but it has not done so yet.  This is a matter of public concern or public interest.  People could see how charities spend their donations.  It would also help to ease the suspicion that has arisen because of the Console scandal.  If people could see where their donations were being spent they would not have those suspicions about charities.  I am surprised the regulator has not done it.</p></speech>

It is one of the reasons that in 2017 we proposed amendments to a courts and civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill and we managed to get our amendments included in the Bill.  We need further amendments to introduce standardised forms of financial reporting for all charities.  If we had those standards, we would have the detail the Deputy is speaking about.  Unfortunately, the courts and civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill in which our provisions were included did not go anywhere.  It has since been carved out into a separate charities (amendment) Bill which we hope will progress shortly.</p></speech>

The purpose carries the presumption of public benefit.  That is a statutory matter but there is nothing there for the advancement of human rights.  The church has better rights than Amnesty international.  I presume that would be a legislative matter.  It could possibly allow a lot of scope for bogus religions or religions that turn profits while not paying tax.  It is something that stood out for me.  Does Ms Martin have an opinion on this?

That is absolutely the case.  With regard to the advancement of religion, we receive applications from organisations that are religions but even though there is a presumption of public benefit, they go through a rigorous application process in the same way as all other types of charities.  I cannot comment on charities that are religious organisations that existed prior to our establishment.  They are also on our register but they came onto it along with thousands of other charities because they held a charitable tax exemption.  They were entitled to be deemed registered at that time.</p></speech>

It does not pay tax on the fees paid by parents.  I can only presume this is because it offers a handful of scholarships a year.

Once an organisation fulfils the charity test, ends up with a charitable tax exemption or was deemed registered back in 2014, it is on the register as a charity.  I am not aware of the particular example and whether the school was deemed registered.  I think it was deemed registered so it came onto the register automatically.  The advancement of education is a charitable purpose under the Act.</p></speech>

This is why we speak about the more than 50% that are registered charities.  We are reliant on concerns being raised.  Either we spot it or somebody comes to us having spotted it.  We will immediately try to contact the individuals concerned.</p><p>Obviously, it is an offence if it is holding itself out as a charity when it is not a registered charity.  When we follow it up, sometimes it transpires that the organisation is simply unaware that it was supposed to be registered.  Such cases are passed on to the registration team to enable the organisations in question to engage in the full registration process.</p><p> We work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on much more difficult areas like the house-to-house collection of clothing bags by bogus charities.  When we use the contact details on the plastic bags that are provided to households, we often find that the number rings out and we cannot get through to anybody.  We intend to undertake a public awareness campaign in this area.  We previously issued a public notice to let the public know specifically about this problem.  Ultimately, the public plays a role in this area.  When people think they are donating to a charity, we want them to check the register first to make sure it is a registered charity.  We have engaged in some publicity in this regard.  Next week, we will issue some public notices to alert people to the phenomenon of bogus clothing collections.  One of the reasons bogus organisations get involved in this area is that there is money to be made.  If people were not donating bags of clothes to these organisations and were instead ensuring they donated to charities only, some of this bogus activity would be curtailed.</p></speech>

It is really important that people feel confident in this incredibly important sector.  The work of the witnesses is incredibly important from that point of view.  When I went through the list of charities, I noticed that some of them have 19th century names.  People know the names of many of the big charities, but there are also local charities like schools that crop up on the list.  The number of charities is incredibly large for the size of the country.  Perhaps this is a reflection of the fact that the charitable sector in this country is providing services that would normally be public services in some other countries.  I refer to charities like Rehab, Enable Ireland and the Irish Heart Foundation.  Some of their work is promotional.  It is understandable that they would have charitable status.  In many other countries, the services being provided by a charity like Enable Ireland would be a matter of public provision.  I think there is a gap being filled.  Some confidence was lost when attention was focused on the amounts of money being paid to the CEOs of charitable organisations.  I assume that does not come under the remit of the Charities Regulator.  At a time when the public is being very generous but is seeing very large salaries being paid to CEOs, it is very difficult to retain public confidence in this sector.  Is any guidance available in this regard?  Some of these companies are very big and need to have good personnel.  Is there any guidance on engagement with some of the bigger charities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.503" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Martin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#T00800"><p>I can answer that more generally because it comes under the charities governance code and the whole area of private benefit.  When salaries are paid to the people involved in running charities, that is considered to be a private benefit.  The Act provides that the private benefit must be reasonable in all the circumstances, must be ancillary and must be necessary to the furthering of the public benefit that the charity entails.  We tell charities they must ensure the amounts of money they pay to members of staff should be benchmarked and should be reasonable.  They have to be reasonable and necessary.  It is obvious that a charity which provides healthcare services in the home will need nurses.  We consider that to be a private benefit which is absolutely required and is permissible under the Charities Act.  The charity would have to make sure it is benchmarked against what a nurse would be paid elsewhere.  That is where we would come across that.  People would be asking about that, and that would be our general advice in this area.</p> <p>  I would like to refer to research that has been done on salaries more generally.  We might consider a salary of more than &euro;70,000 to be a high salary for these purposes.  Research indicates that less than 1% of the workforce in the not-for-profit sector, which obviously is wider than the charitable sector, is paid more than &euro;70,000.  The relevant percentage is much higher in other areas.  I believe it is 13% in the rest of the economy.  There is certainly a perception out there.  We often see it when the results of research come back.  People want charities to be well run, but at the same time they do not think people in charities should be paid the same as they might be paid elsewhere.  Our view is that a nurse who is working in a charity should be paid the same as a nurse who is working in a hospital, if they are doing the same job.</p></speech>

We have been told that it has 37 staff on its books at the moment, but I can count 43 people on its organisational chart.  There are some vacancies as well.  The higher up the ladder one goes, the greater the proportion of vacancies.  There are vacancies for positions like head of legal affairs, regulatory lawyer and head of corporate affairs.  There are no vacancies down at the clerical officer end.  That is the point I am making.  Where would the additional staff up to the full complement of 53 fit in on the organisational chart?</p></speech>

There are certain areas we need to develop when we are talking about proactive monitoring.  They would certainly be going in there.  Ultimately, we are looking to resource the whole area of operations, IT and research as well.</p></speech>

It has been set out as a hierarchy in the organisational chart.  I am not saying that the organisation is hierarchical.  Ms Martin has spoken about teams.  I am trying to visualise how the 37 people who have been mentioned fit into these teams.  There is an overall administration as well.  The administrative staff are probably not part of one of the teams in question.  I am trying to visualise how the organisation is run.  The top two areas that are named before the chart moves on to the next tier are head of compliance and enforcement, and head of legal affairs.  Are all of the areas named there?  Will there be an additional stream that will go along with the authority's senior staff, even if they are not employed?</p></speech>

There is probably some confusion here.  At the moment, I am re-examining the organisational structure.  I can send the committee the original structure if it would like to see it.  The original structure was based on the preferred operating model.  Having gained experience over recent years, and having considered where we want to go with our strategy, my view is that we need more senior decision-makers in the organisation.  The review has not yet been completed.  That is why I do not have the updated organisational chart.</p></speech>

There are quite a number of small charities where there is an overhead to have an audit, and yet they are very small organisations and there are multiple charities in the same sector.  That can be seen in the list of charities and their functions.  Is consolidation discouraged, or if a body comes along and meets the criteria, is it automatically granted charitable status?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.522" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Martin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#U00700"><p>Yes, once it meets the charity test.  We do not seek to control the numbers that are registering.  If people apply and meet the charity test, then they will be registered as a charity.  We take the view that charities, as was mentioned earlier, are stepping into gaps.  Particular individuals who are setting them up can perceive a gap and want to step into that.  While on the face of it, it may look like charities are very similar, sometimes when one looks behind them, for example, in the area of animal welfare, it will be found that there are very different philosophies behind those particular charities.</p></speech>

Obviously people are asked, when making a will, to think of charities and such things.  There may well be people, in some cases, who do not have family members who will follow things up, and these are the ones who will be aware.  What would it take to be proactive rather than reactive in that particular sector, because it is likely to be a growing sector?</p></speech>

We do and we will follow this up with executors.  There is a proactive element in that.  If we have received a form from the Probate Office and we have not received a receipt from a solicitor, for example, from a charity stating that they have received the money, we will follow that up, so we absolutely do follow that up.</p> <p>  One of the issues we had and that I mentioned earlier is around the whole area of paper and the fact that it was very hard to deal with the masses of paper that we were receiving.  We worked with the Probate Office and have put that whole system online now.  That will enable us to do that proactive monitoring piece more easily as we will be capturing those data at source from the solicitors or executors who are putting the forms in.  That means we can analyse that, and it will also be useful for the Probate Office down the road, when it modernises its systems.</p></speech>

It is publicly funded in terms of the building of schools and the payment of teachers.  There is an inadequate amount of money provided to run schools, hence the reason fundraising is required.  It is would come as a surprise to people and they would not think that their national school, for example, was a charity.  Does the Charities Regulator's office look at comparisons with other countries in terms of what ends up being a charity in this country as opposed to, say, our European counterparts?  Is there a remit from that point of view that the Charities Regulator's office will fulfil?</p></speech>

It was set up in the 1980s or 1990s by the then Commissioners of Charitable Bequests and Donations for Ireland.  It was set up as a means, particularly for smaller charities, to be able to invest funds and earn a return on those.  It was closed, however, by the time we took it over, and before the Charities Regulator came into being.  There are no new members in that fund now.  We did a review on what we should do with the fund, such as whether we should wind it up, and different options were considered.  The preliminary view was that we would maintain it for the moment.  We are doing a number of exercises around it.  It is quite an old fund and there is a lot of administrative work to be done around it such as data cleansing exercises, anti-money laundering, and making sure we have the right details for people, etc.  Once all of that work is done, we will continue with the review and see what the next steps are.</p></speech>

The board is responsible for the strategic direction of the Charities Regulatory Authority, CRA, and in terms of that it is how they engage with the charity sector, how they regulate it, and governance.

I must say as a member of the committee, I think that it is shocking governance, without prejudice to the wonderful expertise of the individual we are talking about.  As a matter of basic rules, to give people the peace of mind to which they are entitled, the regulated should never, while continuing to be regulated, have a seat on the board of the regulator.  I ask the Department to give the committee a formal response as to why this has happened.  It would also be useful to know how many people applied for this position and what assessment criteria was used to make the appointment.   In terms of ticking boxes of expertise and qualifications, I have no doubt but there is a fundamental flaw in what has occurred here.</p> <p>  It it ironic that Members in the Roscommon area including Deputy Eugene Murphy and Senator Leyden have raised the issue of the Cuisle centre which is a holiday resort for people with disabilities and particularly wheelchair users.  That facility is set to close.  Say in the case where, for example, the IWA is a fantastic association, and Cuisle is a particularly fantastic part of the national infrastructure for people who are wheelchair users and so on, does the regulator have any competence on issues like that where it can liaise with the charity to ask that it keep such a facility open?  Can it ask what are the problems and why such a facility is being closed?   </p></speech>

Deputy Catherine Murphy might have mentioned it.  The witnesses referred to less than 1% of people in the charitable sector being paid more than &euro;70,000.  That compares to the private sector, where 13% are paid more than &euro;70,000.  The witnesses used a nurse as an example.  I do not think that anybody would expect that a nurse who is working for a cancer charity would be on less money than a nurse in a hospital.  The concern is the pay of the people at the top.  I do not think it really answers our questions to say that less than 1% are on more than &euro;70,000.

The Charities Regulator was contacted some months ago about it.  I cannot understand the delay in stopping it.  It is still active and live.  It is still collecting money.  How long would Ms Martin expect an investigation such as this to take?  It is a little complicated if a fund has been in existence since the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s but surely it is the job of the Charities Regulator to sort out a group that is not registered but marketing itself online as a charity today.</p></speech>

There is no question that there is a charity that purports to offer professional care to people under a charitable heading when it is not a charity.  This is extremely serious.</p> <p>  What role does the Charities Regulator have in highlighting risks to the public?  What comes to mind is the financial regulator advertisement from many years ago.  What does the Charities Regulator do to highlight to the public that they could be giving money to dodgy things?  What is the role of the Charities Regulator in advertising public awareness?</p></speech>

Earlier, I mentioned that we have a campaign due out next week on clothing collection, with regard to making sure people check the register to ensure the entity is a registered charity.  This is something we regularly do.  We try to come at it from different angles depending on the number of concerns, which are very high with regard to clothing collections.  It is something on which we focused because we could see a particular risk there.  Certainly, public awareness around these issues and people checking the register is one of our key focuses.</p></speech>

We are trying to get the public to be more proactive themselves about managing who they give money to.  It is about telling people there is a facility available for them if they want to check and that they should be aware there are organisations that are registered and other organisations that are not registered.</p></speech>

It is a statutory role.  I believe that even a family member or spouse on the board would be inappropriate.

With regard to process, where a body applies to us on top of its constitution, we look for a document that sets out its principles, tenets and faith to understand what it does in terms of worship, for example, where it holds worship.  We look for a lot more information from an organisation that sets itself out for the advancement of religion than we do in some other areas where the charitable purpose might be quite clear.  This is something we are aware of and we focus on the registration side where risks might occur.</p></speech>

Many of them come from new communities, who might be of a Baptist religion, for example.  Other areas where we see growth are animal welfare charities and environmental charities and this reflects what is happening in society.  That is where we see growth.  There are people in new church organisations that may not be involved in the traditional Catholic or Church of Ireland churches.  This will occur.  The register will always reflect what is happening in society.  Whatever is happening in society will be reflected in the types of new applications we see.</p></speech>

How does the Charities Regulator assess what is on the right or wrong side?  Whose skill set is that?  It is a bit like the religion issue.  It is subjective.  If a company purports to be the greenest of them all, who assesses this?  What is the level of expertise? High level people would be needed to be able to work out whether a charity would help to save the environment or whether it is just making a few euro.</p></speech>

It pays its taxes and is not a charity, just a private hospital.  The company I mentioned, which provides bogus counselling, is pulling people away from this legitimately-run hospital and may be tax-exempt.  Does the regulator have any role in that as there may be an uneven playing field, without mentioning the quality of service?  I refer to people trying to get ahead of the game by getting charitable status and tax exemptions, thereby disadvantaging a legitimate company operating without charitable status.

To follow up on what Deputy O'Connell said, we have heard about the investment policy the NTMA set with respect to tobacco and, a year or two earlier, the armaments industry.  It has a clear policy.  I believe the Courts Service has a lot of funds invested on behalf of wards of court and it also has a policy not to invest in those areas.

Almost all the charity tests we do are legal tests so a large volume of legal advice is required in that area.  We have a requirement for three legal advisers, but we only have one at present so we are reliant on using some of our funds to get external legal advice.</p></speech>

Consultancy costs include the cost of external advice to management and exclude outsourced business as usual functions.  Can you differentiate between paying somebody on a consultancy basis and an outsourced function?  What is the difference?</p></speech>

That is where we identified that we needed in-house financial support in terms of having an accountant.  It was decided at that time to do it by way of outsourcing, that is, to get somebody in as a consultant to do it for us.</p></speech>

I was worried that it might be a large number.  The CRA has consultancy costs of &euro;388,000.  The digital platform, which was mentioned earlier, is &euro;218,000.  Page 22 refers to consultancy costs of &euro;333,000.  The digital platform is a significant element of that cost.  According to page 8, the authority capitalised &euro;212,000 of it and only charged &euro;126,000 of it to its revenue account.  How does authority decide what is capitalised and what is charged to the revenue account?</p></speech>

The capitalised element is any of the expenditure directly related to the platform and the project management fees associated with the platform.  Of the &euro;218,000 for the digital platform, we capitalised &euro;212,000 of that.  Some &euro;6,000 of that related to training, which was put directly to the income statement.</p></speech>

We have already had a meeting with the Central Statistics Office and the Economic and Social Research Institute on this topic.  They have carried out some related research which was discussed by the committee and we are very grateful to both organisations for that research and for making themselves available to the committee.</p> <p>  We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the committee and he is joined this afternoon by Mr. Ciaran Crowe, senior auditor.  From the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment we are joined by Mr. Brian Carroll, assistant secretary, Mr. Frank Maughan, principal officer, Mr. Eamonn Confrey, principal officer, and Ms Catherine McGinty, assistant principal.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.  That means having them on airplane mode, as merely putting them on silent mode can interfere with the recording system.</p> <p>  I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.  I invite Mr. McCarthy to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Operating under the Department's aegis, the Environmental Protection Agency monitors and reports on the level of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>  Through its EU membership and participation in various international agreements, Ireland is committed to a number of climate action targets.  While some of these have been adopted voluntarily, others are binding and there will be significant financial consequences if they are not met.  Following on from these commitments, Ireland is pursuing climate targets through a combination of carbon pricing and taxation, payment of grants and subsidies, regulation and public awareness campaigns.  These activities give rise to financial transactions but because they are spread across a wide range of State organisations, the net impact on the Exchequer finances is not readily visible.  My objective in compiling this report was to present an overview of the key current financial transactions that are related to greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>  In the context of EU climate policies, a distinction is made between greenhouse gas emissions emanating from sectors of activity subject to the EU emissions trading system, ETS, and those of all other, non-ETS, sectors.  In Ireland, economic activity subject to the ETS accounted for about 28% of emissions in 2017, which is low by comparison with the EU average.  This includes power generation, manufacturing and industrial processes.  The level of emissions allowed for each operator declines each year, and if the cap is breached, carbon credits must be purchased through an EU-wide auction system.  Revenues from the auction of credits is divided between European Union member states, which must use at least 50% of the proceeds to finance specific climate and energy programmes.  Ireland's Exchequer has benefited from such sales to the amount of &euro;367 million between 2013 and 2018.</p> <p>  Since 2013, separate targets apply to non-ETS emissions, which accounted for 72% of Ireland's output of greenhouse gases in 2017.  This includes the agriculture, transport and residential sectors.  On the basis of projections that Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions for the period 2008 to 2012 would exceed the level committed to under the Kyoto Protocol, resulting in an obligation to surrender what are referred to as carbon credits, the State spent a total of &euro;121 million on acquiring carbon credits.  Ultimately, Ireland met its emissions target for that period, but mainly due to the contraction in economic activity as a result of the banking and financial crisis.  Just over one third of the credits acquired had to be surrendered at the end of the target period.  The balance of the credits remains to assist in meeting further obligations as they arise.</p> <p>  In contrast to the first Kyoto period, the Environmental Protection Agency projects that Ireland will not meet the non-ETS emissions reduction target for the 2013 to 2020 period.  The available unused carbon credits are not expected to be sufficient to meet the resulting obligations.  The Department has estimated that the cost of purchasing additional required credits in 2020 will fall within a range of &euro;2 million to &euro;14 million, depending on the quantity of credits required and the prevailing market price.</p> <p>  In terms of renewable energy, Ireland has a mandatory target for at least 16% of gross final energy consumption to come from renewable sources by 2020.  While progress has been made in that regard, it is expected the target will not be met.  Based on the likely shortfall projected by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, the Department estimates that the future cost associated with failure to achieve the target could be in the order of &euro;110 million.  Against a targeted improvement of 20% in energy efficiency by 2020, the latest projections indicate that the actual increase will be around 16%.  However, as the energy efficiency target is non-binding, there is no direct financial penalty for failing to achieve it.</p> <p>  Carbon tax is one of a number of environmental taxes based on the consumption of fossil fuels.  While other fuel-related taxes were introduced for revenue raising purposes, carbon tax is intended to have a disincentive effect on the consumption of such fuels by raising prices.  Exchequer receipts of carbon taxes in 2018 amounted to around &euro;431 million.</p> <p>  A range of State bodies are incurring substantial climate-related expenditure.  At the same time, the State is receiving significant income in the form of environmental tax receipts and revenue from the auction of emission allowances.  However, there is currently no comprehensive national account to capture this income and expenditure.  Even in individual accounts where climate-related transactions are recorded, there is little transparency.  The report concludes that it would be timely for relevant Accounting Officers to consider including additional information and disclosures on climate change initiatives in the statutory accounts they produce.</p></speech>

The chapter examines transactions associated with Ireland's participation in the EU emissions trading system and purchases of credits by the State for compliance with Ireland's commitments under the Kyoto Protocol between 2008 and 2012, and the EU effort sharing decision, which spans the period 2013 to 2020.  The report also briefly examines the revenues accruing to date from carbon tax.  The report notes that a total of &euro;121 million has been spent to date on the purchases of credits for Kyoto Protocol and effort sharing decision compliance, with a further amount of between &euro;2 million and &euro;13 million expected to be required to meet the costs of purchasing further credits for compliance with the effort sharing decision.  The report also examines the costs of compliance with Ireland's renewable energy targets for 2020.</p> <p>  The report does not examine other transactions or expenditure associated with the implementation of climate change policies, whether in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment or elsewhere.</p><p>The report recommends that accurate and comprehensive information on relevant costs, including costs of abatement measures and carbon credit purchases, and incomes, including auction revenues and tax yields, would assist in informing future decisions on climate change initiatives and notes that, in budget 2019, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform indicated his intention to introduce a green budgeting framework with the aim of embedding climate change in the budgetary process.  Implementation of this framework offers the opportunity to develop a comprehensive national account capturing income and expenditure relating to climate change initiatives.<br/><br/>The Department also notes and welcomes the recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding the provision of additional information on climate change related policies and measures in the statutory accounts of Departments.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment supports this recommendation which it considers will help to improve both the transparency as well as the robustness of evaluation of climate change policies across all Departments.<br/><br/>The Government published its climate action plan on 17 June.  The plan sets out, for the first time and on the basis on the best available evidence, the measures that are required to meet our 2030 targets, with the burden shared across all sectors.  The plan will also put us on the right trajectory towards net zero emissions target by 2050. <br/><br/>In respect of the of the Comptroller and Auditor General report's assessment of the distance to target for 2030 compliance, presented in figure 9.11, it is important to note that the report uses EPA projections that do not yet take into account the impact of the climate action plan.  The EPA is currently updating these figures as part of finalising the national energy and climate plan, for submission by the Minister to the European Commission by the end of 2019.<br/><br/>The climate action plan contains a strong focus on governance and accountability, including a commitment to publish progress reports quarterly.  The first such progress report, launched at the end of October, shows that 85%, or 149, of the actions due for delivery in quarters 2 and 3 of this year have been delivered, with the remaining in progress and due for delivery by the end of the year.<br/><br/><b></b>At the end of September, there was approximately 4,100 MW of renewable generation capacity connected to the national grid.  Of this, wind generation accounted for over 3,800 MW.  The most significant progress towards our 2020 renewable energy targets has been made in renewable electricity and we expect to be at or very close to the 40% sub-sectoral target for renewable electricity by 2020.  In the transport sector, we expect to achieve over 9% of the 10% target primarily due to the biofuels obligation scheme with electric vehicles also making a contribution.  The target in renewable heat is more difficult due in part to our dispersed population and our reliance on fossil fuels for a large share of our domestic heating.  The support scheme for renewable heat and supports for the roll-out of heat pumps under the national development plan are important measures to help us close the gap to target.<br/><br/>The fact remains that we are projected to have a shortfall to the renewable targets of approximately 3 percentage points based on analysis by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  Ireland will not be alone in falling short of our 2020 targets and there are compliance mechanisms available to us, known as statistical transfers, to enable us to purchase compliance.  The cost of purchasing statistical transfers should any potential shortfall in Ireland's target arise has yet to be established and will depend on a number of factors, particularly the availability of supply and market costs.  The focus of the Department is on maximising renewable energy in our energy mix by 2020 and on implementation of the comprehensive actions set out in the climate action plan that will enable our transition to a low-carbon economy.</p></speech>

We will figure it out in 2020.  It appears that we will not meet the 20% energy efficiency in respect of the 2020 target and that the actual figure will be in the region of 16%.  Those are the figures in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, the global figures under the Paris Agreement and the targets we have to meet by 2030.  We had representatives of other Department and other organisations before the committee and it appears we will not meet those targets either.  We are not in a good place in the context of reaching targets we either set for ourselves or to which we have signed up.  Will Mr. Carroll agree that would be a fair comment to make?</p></speech>

I mentioned the projections in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s chapter for 2030 are based on EPA analysis, which had not incorporated the measures included in the climate action plan published earlier this year.  When we were putting the climate action plan together it was based on analysis to bring forward the most cost-effective measures to ensure that we meet our 2030 target.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.894" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#NN01900"><p>There is a new climate action plan in place but before it came into being, the reality, as per the facts presented by the Comptroller and Auditor General, is that the State is failing to meet all the targets set out in his report.  Unless drastic changes occur as a consequence of implementing the climate action plan, and we do not know what that will mean, the assumption from representatives of organisations which came before us is that it is unlikely we will reach the targets we have set ourselves for 2030.  A problem I have with this, and I said this to the representatives of the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Central Statistics Office when they appeared before the committee, is that when we push a target out  for that length of time and have such a target for 2030, a representative appearing before the committee today in 2019 or in 2020 or in 2021 can say what will be done down the road might get us to 2030 target.  However, Mr. Carroll will possibly have left his position by that time and somebody else will most likely be telling the person in my seat, if I am not here, that we have not reached our targets.  The problem is that while we have long-term targets, we do not have short to medium term ones to allow us to properly assess what is and is not being achieved.</p></speech>

The first carbon budgets are to be in place from 2021 to 2025, 2026 to 2030 and 2031 to 2035.  There will be a role for the Climate Change Advisory Council on advising Government on an economy-wide basis what those five-year carbon budgets should be.  It will then be the responsibility of the Minister to recommend to Government and the Oireachtas the acceptance of those budgets and the division of them on a sectoral basis.  They will provide annual ceilings that sectors will have to remain under in order to meet the climate obligations.</p></speech>

This committee carries out look-back exercises in respect of previous year, two years, three years or five years.  Today, we can  benchmark Mr. Carroll's Department and the State against targets they set themselves five years, ten years or two years ago.  Leaving aside what might happen in the future, I accept that there is a new climate action plan and that there will be more scrutiny and more targets set for each line Department.</p><p>I sit on the committee which will be responsible for scrutinising the Department so that is a step forward.  In terms of what has gone before us, however, is it fair to say that we have been in a position where we have not reached the targets that we either set ourselves or were set for us as part of overall agreements?</p></speech>

There will be a shortfall in terms of our emissions target to 2020.  We are expected to reduce our emissions by 5% to 6% relative to the target set.  In terms of renewable energy, as reported by the Comptroller and Auditor General, we had a 16% target for renewable energy.  We will hit 13% on that.  If that is broken down as a 40% target for renewable electricity, we have made very strong progress on renewable electricity and may get close to the 40%.</p> <p>  On transport, it was a 10% target.  We are predicting we will hit 9% out of the 10%.  The area that is most problematic is the renewable heat component of the target.  Our disbursed settlement pattern and the associated challenges with that is probably the reason we are finding it more difficult on the renewable heat target.  There are ambitious targets in the climate action plan to retrofit 500,000 houses by 2030 and to install 400,000 heat pumps, which is a technology that is suitable for disbursed settlement patterns and in shifting them towards renewable heat.</p></speech>

We all want to make sure that we reach our targets and we are all focused on making sure that climate action means action and that we reach the targets we set.  We have to be honest, however, and say that up to now we have not and in many areas we are lagging behind.  Mr. Carroll talked about retrofit.  The Taoiseach is at an international conference today and he spoke about a &euro;50 billion retrofit.  That is how much it will cost to retrofit every home in the country.  Is it possible to retrofit every home in the country?</p></speech>

The figure the Taoiseach was quoting was an investment figure out to 2050 based on today's cost.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.901" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#OO00500"><p>That is my point.  It is easy to throw out those figures and say that we will do something by 2050.  Let us come back to planet earth.  In reality, will we be in a position in 2050 where we will have spent &euro;50 billion on retrofitting homes?  That is what drives people mad because they want to engage and want to be able to make the changes.  People whose homes are heated by oil or gas are listening to this discussion and they are the ones who are subject to carbon tax increases, which I will get to shortly.  When we say that by 2050 we will have spent &euro;50 billion on deep retrofit or retrofitting people's homes, is that a credible objective for the State to set itself in terms of whether it can be met?  If it can be met, where will the money come from to pay for it?  Will it be on the households?  Will the State, or homeowners, have to borrow?  I cannot see &euro;50 billion being spent by the State on retrofitting homes by 2050.  I might be wrong, and Mr. Carroll might be able to correct me on that.</p></speech>

The &euro;50 billion is based on today's costs.  It is the total investment required, not distinguishing between what the State, and the private sector, might contribute.  That is the first important distinction to make.  The second is that in the climate action plan there is a new model of retrofitting to be brought forward where we are seeking to aggregate groups of houses and, through aggregation, achieve economies of scale.  The expectation would be that over time the costs of retrofitting houses will fall.</p></speech>

How many people that we represent have that kind of money to spend on deep retrofit?  If we are making schemes available to deep retrofit homes, let us not do it for the people with the deepest pockets who can afford to deep retrofit and then have all of the benefits that come from energy efficiency.  When carbon taxes increase they benefit, but the vast majority of people who do not have the money do not get any State supports to enable them to retrofit are the ones who lose out.</p> <p>  I will come to carbon tax.  The Comptroller and Auditor General rightly said that the Exchequer collected &euro;431 million in 2018 but &euro;3.35 billion was collected since the carbon tax was introduced.  If he can, will Mr. Carroll tell me on what that &euro;3.35 billion was spent?</p></speech>

I am not in a position, in terms of carbon tax receipts to date, to explain where that money was spent.  What I can say is that in terms of increases in the carbon tax expenditure, and the first was in the budget of this year - it was a &euro;6 increase - the money generated by that increase is very clearly ring-fenced for climate action activity.  The figure was &euro;90 million in total for next year.  That is broken down in terms of protecting the vulnerable, with &euro;21 million towards the fuel allowance; efficiency upgrades, &euro;13 million; &euro;20 million for the midlands to retrofit social housing; &euro;5 million for peatlands rehabilitation; and &euro;6 million for the Just Transition Fund.  There are other allocations for greenways: urban cycling, &euro;9 million; electric vehicles, &euro;8 million; further investment in electric vehicle, EV, charging infrastructure, &euro;3 million; the Green Climate Fund for overseas development aid, &euro;2 million; and green agricultural pilot schemes, &euro;3 million.  The &euro;90 million that is coming from the &euro;6 increase is fully accounted for in terms of climate mitigation expenditure.  Prior to the increase this year, receipts went into general revenue receipts and formed part of the general expenditure base.</p></speech>

He is coming into this committee and giving us what is the Government and the Department line.  Here is the reality.  The money is still going into general Government expenditure.  There is no hypothecating of any money and there is no ring-fencing.  Mr. Carroll can give us many line items that might be in any particular budget and say that is because we increased the carbon tax but the headline figure of &euro;3.35 billion was raised from households, businesses and working families, in terms of carbon taxes, since 2010.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Department of Finance, whose representatives are here, are unable to tell us on what that money was spent.  What we do know is that last year, carbon emissions did not go down.  Is it correct that they increased slightly?</p></speech>

Agriculture, and another area, was up.  We have taken &euro;3.3 billion out of people's pockets.  It has gone into general Government expenditure.  It was not spent on enabling people to make a transition to reduce their carbon footprint.  Mr. Carroll is now telling us that will happen with only the surplus of what the increase will be, not the overall figure.  What is projected to come in on carbon taxes in 2020?  I am not just asking about the increase but the overall figure.</p></speech>

After the previous two meetings, we thought we would have had this information.  We understand that sectoral committees and other committees will be looking at the future plans.</p></speech>

The increase of &euro;6 per tonne will be applied to petrol and auto diesel from midnight on 8 October and to all other fuels on 1 May 2020, so presumably whatever is generated in 2020 is not the full impact of it.  That could explain at least some of the discrepancy.</p></speech>

Why is that entire amount not ring-fenced for climate action measures if it is so urgent?  The Department is telling us there is a climate action plan and that we are going to get better at reaching our targets, yet all it has done is tell us that &euro;70 million is ring-fenced.  I will deal shortly with the issue of the money that is ring-fenced and also the midlands issue.  We had the trade unions before the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment recently and they were quite critical of the Government, Bord na M&oacute;na and ESB response to just transition.  Why is the entire take for next year not ring-fenced?  If climate action is so important, which it is, why is only the increase ring-fenced?</p></speech>

We are talking about just transition.  At an international conference the Taoiseach said that deep retrofitting will cost &euro;50 billion by 2050.  We have major problems with public transport in rural Ireland and in all of the regional cities outside of Dublin, such as Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway, and many rural towns and villages have no public transport, and the Department is telling us it will ring-fence &euro;70 million.  Whoop-de-doo, &euro;70 million of the carbon tax will be ring-fenced for climate action measures.  Does Mr. Carroll see that as a woefully unambitious target for the Department to set itself?</p></speech>

I was trying to explain where the incremental piece of carbon tax was going.  I know the Deputy is very focused on the &euro;431 million that was received but, in terms of a breakdown of expenditure for next year-----</p></speech>

It is nonsense to come in here and say the Department is ring-fencing money when, in reality, it is not.  Yes, investments are being made but the Department is increasing the carbon tax on households, many of which do not have the ability to make the changes they need and want to make.  Rather than enabling them to make the changes, what the Department and the Government has done is increase the carbon tax this year and they say they will increase it for the next number of years.  At the same time, they have a very unambitious plan to provide people with the alternatives that will allow them to make the behavioural changes they need to make.</p></speech>

On budget day, the estimate was that over the period to 2030, that would amount to an additional &euro;5 billion.  That is a very significant increase in expenditure over and above what is in the national development plan in the period out to 2030.</p> <p>  I will come back to carbon tax.  A point I wanted to come back to was in terms of helping those who are poorer in the transition.  We have a warmer homes scheme for people on lower incomes and that funds 100% of the retrofit in homes of people who are poor.  It as a scheme run by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.</p></speech>

This is more of the nonsense.  Those people Mr. Carroll is talking about have their homes heated by oil or gas.  If an increase is put on their oil or gas, although insulation can be put in their homes and that is fine, they are still using oil and gas, and what the Department is doing is increasing the cost for them.  It is not allowing them to transform their home into one that has an electric heat pump, for example, or some alternative and it is going to take an awful long time for us to get to that position.  It is just increasing the carbon tax on them, not just this year, but next year, the year after and the year after that.</p> <p>  I have a question on the just transition, which is important.  We had the trade unions before the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment recently and Patricia King headed a delegation of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  She was scathing in her criticism of the Department, the Government, Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB.  Two plants were closed and no just transition has been put in place.  Ms King feels many of the workers will lose their jobs without any transition being in place.  Bord na M&oacute;na has refused even to engage with the unions and is refusing to engage with the just transition forum that the Government says is going to be put in place.  An announcement was made prematurely to close the two ESB plants in question and three Government Ministers scrambled down to the midlands to talk to the workers.</p> <p>  Mr. Carroll talked earlier about the &euro;70 million that will come from the carbon tax increase in a full year.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might be right that it may not be &euro;70 million next year but we will see what that figure is.  Mr. Carroll talked about the money for the midlands that is being made available for retrofitting.  There is no retrofit plan in place.  They are still looking at the detail of it and trying to work out what that will mean.  The Department does not have a plan for those workers.</p> <p>  We all knew a just transition was necessary.  We all knew for years that those plants were going to have to close and that there had to be plans in place.  Yet, here we are, already prematurely closing some of the plants, when the trade unions who represent the workers say the just transition has been a farce.  A just transition commissioner is being appointed who does not have any remit in regard to workers - none whatsoever.  Is that not correct?  Ms King was quite critical of that as well.  How is it the case, when we have workers potentially losing their jobs, that the most senior trade union leader in the country can say Bord na M&oacute;na is refusing to engage with the unions and is involved in de-unionising the company?</p></speech>

To go back to the Deputy's earlier point on the fuel poor and the impact of the carbon tax on them, it is important to note that more than one third of the funds raised by the increased carbon tax are devoted to ensuring the least well-off are protected.  This is being done through two measures, first, increasing the fuel allowance by &euro;2 per week, which applies from 1 January and means an annual benefit of &euro;56, and-----</p></speech>

I know Mr. Carroll is trying to give the response.  Does he not hear the madness of that response?  The whole logic of increasing the carbon tax, from the Government perspective, is to change people's behaviour.  Now, Mr. Carroll is saying it will just increase the fuel allowance, so they do not use any less fuel or any less carbon.  That is the madness of this.</p></speech>

It is not being done in isolation.  There are also schemes available which will be rolled out over time and are currently being implemented, such as the warmer homes scheme, where 100% of the retrofitting of housing is funded.  We cannot do everybody's house at once so, if we raise carbon tax, it is important to make sure the fuel allowance is the mechanism which-----</p></speech>

I remember several years ago starting to ask about ring-fencing carbon taxes, which I did on numerous occasions.  I was told we did not do hypothecation.  I think that was the terminology used.  There was much emphasis put on that because it was about changing behaviour.  The &euro;90 million was about changing behaviour.  However, I am thinking of the totality of the &euro;431 million in addition to the &euro;90 million that people are paying in carbon taxes.  Would Mr. Carroll not agree?  If it is not ring-fenced for that, is it not just another stream of revenue?</p></speech>

Individuals do not have a choice.  The big choices are about how electricity is to be generated.  Probably the only choice people can make is how they move around - whether to use public transport as opposed to a car.  They can use less energy but they cannot choose the type of energy that comes into their home.  There is a limited choice on that.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right that people have choice around whether they use public transport or travel in a car.  People have choice as to whether they insulate their house.  People have choice as to how they heat their homes as well.</p></speech>

That is the basic principle underlying carbon tax as a pricing mechanism.  The Deputy is talking about the bulk of carbon tax and asking why that is not ring-fenced.  On how money is being spent, to pick one thing, in 2014 we spent &euro;54 million on retrofitting houses.  Again in 2016-----</p></speech>

If we are spending all that money on changing behaviour and mitigation, we must be lousy at it because we are missing our targets.  It seems like a sizable amount of money.  Some of it is spent on purchasing credits, although not that much.  It would help if we could see the balance sheet.  If they are spending money, people will want to know what they are getting for it.  They have a right to see that.  There is a lack of transparency and I think Mr. Carroll accepts that.  A lot of schemes were promised, for example, the pay as you save scheme for utilities.  That was to meet the need of people who were unable to come up with a large chunk of money by allowing them to do the retrofit themselves and then save it in their utility bills later.  That was announced to great fanfare during the previous Government and it was never rolled out.  I recall investment in wave energy, although it was not enough.  Wavebob is one example that comes to mind.  We spent something like &euro;10 million or &euro;12 million on that and then decided not to continue the investment.  A Scottish counterpart agency took the investment we had made a stage further.</p> <p>  There are many positives in terms of our location and the generation of wind energy.  I want to be positive about it.  We could do much that is positive in this area but it seems like we are buying ourselves out of things.  There is a terrible lack of leadership.  It is a case of just trying to stay compliant or trying to avoid have to pay large amounts for non-compliance.  Positive things could come out of that very large amount of money that was collected.  We could not only meet the targets but be leaders in this area.  That is really frustrating.  Maybe Mr. Carroll might address some of those issues such as where the pay as you save scheme went and why we did not continue investment in wave energy, where we have a huge natural advantage.  I know it is developed as wind energy but it is getting there.</p></speech>

One thing that impacted quite severely on our capacity to meet our 2020 target was the economic downturn in terms of having the resources available to make the types of investments needed.  Those resources were not available over the period of the economic downturn.  In terms of retrofitting, the first thing to say is that we are not unique.  These are difficult problems to solve and it is difficult to design policies that will work.  The UK tried a green deal but it did not work there.  There is a task force in the Department at the moment following on from the climate action plan that is trying to design an aggregation model, which I mentioned earlier.  The idea is to group houses together, achieve economies of scale in retrofitting them, and also to find innovative financing mechanisms such as low interest, low cost loans that will enable people to finance the retrofitting and avail of the savings they will make on their energy bills.  For those who are in fuel poverty, we have schemes where we 100% fund the retrofitting of their homes.</p><p>They are not asked to pay any money.</p></speech>

I was involved in that area around the time of Wavebob.  We have a great resource on the west coast but, as yet, there is no settled technology for harnessing wave energy.  I visited a wave test site in the north of Scotland while I was working in the area.  Six or seven radically different looking devices were being tested.  Sometimes one tests a device and brings it to a certain point and it will not work.  Nobody has made a breakthrough in that regard.  It is an area in which we are still working.</p></speech>

There are supports through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and the prototype development fund which is designed to try to bring some of those technologies forward.  The Deputy is correct in terms of the scale of we need to reach.  The west coast generally, particularly in the context of offshore winds and larger wind turbines, is ripe for that but it will take time because conditions there are quite challenging in terms of water depth and so on.  A significant amount of Government funding has been invested in test site infrastructure through successive years.  We have wave-testing pools in Cork and quarter-scale facilities in Galway and we are moving to a full-scale test facility off the coast of County Mayo.</p></speech>

The picture has become overly complicated.  We need to decarbonise and there are many initiatives for so doing.  I have concerns based on our most recent meetings with the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Central Statistics Office regarding the way the system is divided and Ireland's place in it.  When one breaks it down, the emissions trading system is heavily weighted.  Some 72% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are categorised as non-ETS emissions.  A third of that 72% is agriculture based.  Ireland seems to be overly negatively affected by the European method of calculating or quantifying emissions because of our dependency on agricultural and the amount of food we export.  Some 90% of agricultural product is exported.  What are the witnesses' views in that regard?  Is there an uneven playing field?  Big industry has significant power in this area.  The two ESRI representatives who appeared before the committee stated that once one's profit margin is sufficient to buy one's way out, one can pollute as much as one wishes.  I do not need to explain this to the witnesses.  If one's margin is big enough, one can pay the carbon bill.  That goes completely against the aim of reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and keeping as much of it in the ground as possible.  Has Ireland been given a raw deal in this regard?</p></speech>

Companies choose whether to mitigate or buy their way out.  That is what I meant by "potential".  The ETS is a cap and trade system on an EU-wide basis.  Its objective is to achieve decarbonisation within the EU.  One way or another, decarbonisation happens somewhere.  If a company in a particular jurisdiction chooses to buy its way out, that does not mean that the overall target for the ETS in the EU will not be met.</p></speech>

I am referring to everyday people eating, dressing themselves to stay warm and going places.  It is very difficult to bring people with one if there is a possibility that a company, through whatever it is producing, can pollute continually and buy its way out.  Deputy Cullinane mentioned somewhere in Waterford the last time.  There are those who do not have the capacity to change their behaviour because there is no alternative available to them.  It is going to be very difficult to bring people with us.  The whole point is carbon reduction and decarbonisation.  People get that because it is not that complicated.  If the Department is telling people to invest in and retrofit their homes, walk to work or buy an electric car while big industry is pumping out carbon, albeit in a way that it is balancing out somewhere else globally, it will be very hard to sell to average people just trying to go about their daily lives.  There is not so much choice available to average people.</p><p>With regard to the retrofitting, the scene in an urban area is completely different from that in a rural area.  I am originally from a very rural part of Ireland.  There are many people in homes around my family home that would have regarded the getting in of oil-based central heating as being progressive recent years.  They would have moved from turf or wood.  I refer to heavy-duty fossil fuel burning.  I just do not see how we can convince somebody who is perhaps of retirement age and who might be considering her life expectancy and saying she could be around for another week or 30 years.  The position is very different in terms of getting loans to retrofit homes.  With regard to the suitability of many rural dwellings, many have lime-based mortar and stone bases that cannot be wrapped in insulation.  There are considerable barriers if those in rural Ireland are to apply the same rules as would apply in urban Ireland.  Insulation pads cannot just be put on the outside and inside of stone walls.  Heat pumps cost a huge amount of money and require maintenance every year.  I just cannot see how older people would buy into the idea of investing in this.  Practically, the Department is missing a trick here.  I can understand the thinking on modern homes and people building new homes but I believe older people in rural areas with homes that will never be suited to standard retrofitting or standard heat pumps will be very much left behind because there is nothing they can do - other than knock the house and start again - to change their behaviour and reduce their bills.</p><p>With regard to the increase in the fuel allowance to mitigate against the carbon tax, I agree with Deputy Cullinane.  We are back to the point I made at the start.  We have to be reducing carbon emissions.  If we are subventing the use of carbon to balance against tax, it seems like a style of economics equivalent to moving deckchairs around the <i>Titanic</i>.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right in that there are certain groups of people and certain houses that are more challenging than others.  Retrofitting the entire housing stock is a project that is to take place over 31 years.  We have made a start.  We have targeted 500,000 to be retrofitted by 2030.  This will happen in a series of waves over the coming decades.</p> <p>  I did not make a note of the point the Deputy made at the end.</p></speech>

That is not to be looked at in isolation.  That is a policy measure to make sure poor people are not worse off.  There are further supports being brought forward in terms of the warmer homes scheme, which funds the retrofitting of homes in the order of 100%.  We cannot get to everyone at once with this.  We have to make sure it does not disadvantage poorer people in the meantime.  That is the intent.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.979" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#SS01200"><p>When calculating greenhouse gas emissions, methane, a by-product of agriculture, is considered to be 25 times more warming than carbon.  It does not seem to have been taken into account that the effect of carbon is cumulative.  Carbon gathers in the atmosphere whereas methane breaks down within a 12-year cycle period.  Therefore, the effect of methane is not cumulative.  I cannot find anything in the documentation from the Department, the ESRI or the CSO that brings in a variable to take into account the fact that the methane cycle is a cycle within the carbon cycle.  I brought this up with the ESRI and the CSO representatives when they were before us.  My point is that there is over-calculation of the impact of agriculture on the carbon footprint of Ireland because methane, although it is considered to be 25 times more warming than carbon, is constantly on the move and constantly breaking down.</p> <p>  The British Veterinary Association has done some work on this.  New Zealand, which has a similar agricultural profile to ours and the same type of grassland, has recently brought in a variable to account for this.  It would be in the interest of heavily agriculture-based economies to examine this area.  It appears to me that agriculture is being unfairly blamed based on an over-calculation of the contribution of methane to warming overall.  Does anybody know anything about this?</p></speech>

The current national policy position is to have an 80% reduction in carbon emissions from the energy system.  That is the policy position the Government agreed in 2014.  An approach to carbon neutrality in agriculture was agreed.  Within the policy position, we already have differential treatment in respect of agriculture.  I also mentioned that the European Commission recognised the limited mitigation potential of agriculture in 2014 and the importance of food security.  With regard to framing longer-term targets, all those factors will have to be taken into consideration.</p></speech>

The global warming potential of methane from agriculture is regarded as 25 times greater than that of regular carbon.</p><p>To my mind that is just scientifically incorrect because if we got rid of all methane-producing farm animals - we obviously cannot - in 12 years' time we would have much less methane.  However, with carbon, it just continues to build up.  Methane breaks down.  Agriculture is being unfairly targeted and I wonder why.  Is it that there were not strong enough voices at the table when it came to fighting for agriculture over heavily polluting industries?</p><p> Food security and sustainable production is fundamental to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, programme.  It is not just about writing cheques.  It is obviously key to us all eating and surviving.  There seems to be an imbalance in the approach to agriculture versus heavily polluting industry.  I just do not think Ireland is being represented.  If Mr. Carroll does not know about it, clearly there has not been much contact in terms of the New Zealand approach now and the British Veterinary Association's approach.  Are we not looking to other countries with a large agriculture industry?  We are very lucky to have a large agricultural industry because we have many people minding our environment in rural areas.  We are not really doing them justice with our actions.</p></speech>

It is not that we are ignoring it or not trying to delve into it to see, in terms of understanding it, the implications of how we frame things in relation to agriculture going forward.</p></speech>

It is ultimately carbon but initially biomethane.  While some report recommended culling and reducing herd numbers, different approaches can be used to reach the same goal, such as healthier animals producing as much food, vaccinated animals, producing a calf within the optimum period and ensuring they are not sick or dying in the middle of having a calf.  We need to maintain efficiency within agriculture.  We are number one in dairy and number five in beef genomics.  When we consider the major part of agriculture in our overall industry and the importance of agricultural exports for the economy, I am not sure if the current policy direction is fair to agriculture.</p></speech>

The climate action plan focuses on three things in terms of agriculture.  The first the Deputy talked about and that is increasing agricultural efficiency and farm efficiency to reduce emissions.  The second is the role of land use, land-use change and so on and the creation of carbon sinks.  The third piece is agricultural waste to energy.  It is on those three pillars that the climate action plan is based and solely those three pillars.</p></speech>

The debate on the budget for 2020 focused on where the small additional amount of the carbon tax we collect next year over this year will be spent.  Ring-fencing can mean anything or nothing from a legal point of view.  Can Mr. Carroll guarantee today that the amount collected in carbon tax next year will be spent on climate change initiatives?  We can only talk about the increase.</p></speech>

I do not have those accumulated figures with me today.</p></speech>

Either in 2012 a figure was produced showing it for the previous year or at this stage the Department is going to try to assemble the figures in retrospect to show us.  They were either documented at the time or they were not.  I am not talking about the Department now trying to invent something justifying it seven years on where we have collected and have it.  Was it documented?  Can Mr. Carroll give me a document today showing where the carbon tax collected in 2010 was specifically spent?  Does that document exist?</p></speech>

In the first instance the raising of tax and expenditure are matters for the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  What I am saying is that up to this year, carbon tax receipts went into just general tax revenue.</p></speech>

It is not a question of me suggesting that I can retrospectively construct some link between carbon tax to date and how it was spent.  It went into general tax receipts.  I can say at the same time that significant amounts of money were being spent through various Votes on climate action.

I have seen nothing yet to say that the extra &euro;90 million will not go into the same account again.

Effectively, what has been shown there is the amount that was received from ETS auctions each year.  What it is reporting is sufficient spending in other areas that make up the equivalent of that.  It is not working in the way a hypothecated tax is supposed to work, which is that one raises "X" amount and demonstrates how that amount was used.  If moneys go into the Central Fund of the Exchequer, they are funding everything the Central Fund of the Exchequer is funding and spending that is being done separately is just an account of spending that is being done separately.</p></speech>

There is a footnote stating that a European Commission report from 2017 entitled "Analysis of the use of Auction Revenues by the Member States" noted that Ireland is one of the ten member states where revenue raised through the auction of allowances is not earmarked or ring fenced in its budget and that along with the other nine member states, Ireland was also deemed to provide a low level of detail on the application of revenue to projects aimed at reducing emissions.  That is why we are here.  We want to get to the point where we are not in the bottom league within the EU when it comes to accounting for it.  That was stated by the EU two and a half years ago and we are here today not having advanced an awful lot since then.  This is all we want to achieve.</p> <p>  In respect of the &euro;570 million that was collected in 2018, the &euro;440 million collected in carbon tax was read out.  We also received &euro;140 million in receipts from the emissions trading scheme.  We want to bring the public with us.  This is the message I am bringing back.  We want to bring the public on the right road on this.  I am putting the responsibility on the Department as the lead Department in respect of climate change.  Revenue will appear before us next week when we can ask it about the revenue and we can talk to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is the one deemed to be the climate change Department.  All I am saying is that the public gets very cynical when it is told that &euro;570 million was received in 2018 and we cannot document that it went on climate change initiatives.  It would make the job of bringing the public around to the idea of an extra tax a whole lot easier if it could be assured that not just a marginal increase in tax but all of the carbon tax was going on climate change initiatives.  People would buy into it but when they see that it is just a wheeze and that we are collecting carbon tax but will not really show how it is being spent, it damages the national effort to bring people around on this issue.  I worry that it could lead to a backlash against a carbon tax.  We saw it with water charges because people just saw them as a mechanism for collecting money and paying for meters.  They did not necessarily see them as improving the water infrastructure because they were not connected.  One was just to collect money and pay for the installation of meters to a large extent.  The people will have a difficulty with the carbon tax.  We want all this to be clear, transparent and upfront so that if the public is told next year that &euro;500 million is being collected, it knows it will be spent on climate change initiatives.  I have great faith in the Irish people and believe that they will accept that without a quibble but if they are told it is being collected but the Department will only show them where a tiny percentage of it is going, they will not come along fully.  </p> <p>  One of the reasons why we have had these hearings relates to when the CSO appeared before us recently.  We found it slightly unusual that when it appeared before us, the CSO document stated that some publicly funded supports have a negative impact on the environment.  I know there are other objectives relating to fuel poverty.  The CSO stated that a subsidy is classified as potentially environmentally damaging if it is likely to incentivise behaviour that could be damaging to the environment irrespective of the importance of other policy purposes.  Some people might say it is an academic argument but we all know that if we increase carbon tax, raise money from it and hand some of the proceeds back by way of a fuel allowance, we will increase CO2 emissions by burning oil, gas, coal or turf.  The CSO states that this will have a detrimental effect.  I know it costs money but the CSO is saying that it would better if the funds collected were spent on the retrofitting and home heating scheme rather than on giving allowances to people to allow them continue to burn fossil fuels.  The CSO is saying that some of what is happening here is detrimental to the environment.  Is Mr. Carroll familiar with that document?  </p></speech>

I must say that the intention in giving it back is not to encourage people to keep burning fossil fuels.  The intention is to make sure the most vulnerable are not made worse off by the introduction of the carbon tax.</p><p>I do not think it can be looked at in isolation.  If it is brought in to make sure that people are not worse off, that is different from bringing it in to discourage them from continuing to burn fossil fuels.  It has to be understood alongside other schemes, such as the warmer homes scheme, whereby we are trying to retrofit the houses of the fuel-poor and funding that to 100%.  That cannot be done all at once.  It will take time to do.  It will happen over the coming decade and beyond.  In the meantime, the intention is that those least able to bear the burden are not made worse off by the introduction of carbon tax.</p></speech>

We are here to add to the debate.  The public should be able to see transparency and accountability in respect of the &euro;500 million in carbon tax that will be collected next year.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment probably has some documentation done, or perhaps each Department has it done, on the Estimates for the coming year.  I am just saying this myself - I have not run it by the committee - but it would be a tremendous assistance and of benefit to the public, when the Estimates come before their respective committees next year, to be shown where the more than &euro;500 million that will be collected in carbon tax next year will go on climate change initiatives.  It would be a tremendous help to everybody.  It would help the Government in its initiative.  Some 170 young people were sitting in the D&aacute;il Chamber last Friday.  Their generation would receive the benefit.  Just collecting the tax and putting it into the black hole where most of it is going is not helping to bring people around.  We, the Committee of Public Accounts, want to contribute to that debate.  Mr. Carroll understands where we are coming from.</p></speech>

We are trying to move towards greater transparency when it comes to climate and environmental expenditure.

Two and a half years on, we have another &euro;114 million this year plus last year's &euro;114 million and no breakdown.  The EU told us two and a half years ago, "Boys, you are not doing your job", and we are carrying on.  Somebody needs to put a little bit of pressure on the system to be more open and transparent.  I am sure this is a good initiative, but we see this silo approach.  Revenue collects the tax and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does the revenue.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is one Department.  The reason we are talking to officials from that Department and not the former or Revenue is that the latter is the Department with the word "climate" in its title.  That is why we are trying to assist it in strengthening the case it wants to make at Government level.  That is why we are here today - to assist the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I am speaking personally at this stage, and the committee will have to agree with any recommendations we make on this matter, but if we come out with strong recommendations in a positive manner, it will be with a view to increasing accountability and traceability and people's acceptance of the need for this initiative.  They can only accept it if they know what is going on.  I apologise to Deputy Connolly.  I have done a little solo run.</p></speech>

I mentioned the table that was published for the first time in the Revised Estimates of this year and that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is involved in the OECD's green budgeting.  As for our Department, it is much easier to see.  We have renewable energy subheads and energy efficiency subheads, so it is easy to identify climate expenditure in our Vote.  It might not be as easy to identify it but I cannot comment on what is-----</p></speech>

There is a recommendation to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and other Accounting Officers.  We have little time left regarding climate change, and I tire of the debate on changing behaviour by charging people.  I have repeatedly said I have a different model and I have seen it work in practice.  We are all tired, and I am almost finished.  I would have thought there is a need for an urgent meeting on this.  If it is not possible to easily track the expenditure, something needs to be done quickly when there is this report from the Comptroller and Auditor General, which is moderate.</p></speech>

I reiterate that we are moving towards making that more transparent through initiatives such as the table that was published in the Revised Estimate and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform being part of the OECD initiative on green budgeting.  That is a move to greater and greater transparency over time.  Just in the way our Vote is structured, it is easy to see what is being spent on dealing with climate change.</p></speech>

This is not on the same issue, but a year ago, we made a recommendation that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform meet systematically with those Departments in respect of which major Supplementary Estimates are required each year - for example, the Department of Health.  The HSE was the first one.  It has now set up a health monitoring budget committee within the Department that meets regularly.  That was necessary.  We are here with representatives of the Department with responsibility for climate change matters.  Is it the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that will pull this together or is it the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment?  What we see in the public service, and we have seen it in other cases, is that if three or four different people are responsible, nobody is responsible.  Is it the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's job to pull this information together with input from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment?  The latter cannot tell the Accounting Officers in other Departments what they should do.  To whom do we, as the Committee of Public Accounts, make recommendations?  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is the line Department, but this issue is bigger than just that Department.  Have we to go back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this?</p></speech>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has produced a document for us that we had here on the previous occasion, Staff Paper 2018: An Introduction to the Implementation of Green Budgeting in Ireland, dated December of last year.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will probably have the role in pulling this together but we want the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to drive it as well.</p></speech>

If it is just a table at the back of the Revised Estimates Volume, REV, one is looking at the money provided every year.  The figures in that are the money provided for spending, and it is only the spending side.  I suggest that there needs to be greater transparency around what was spent and on what was raised so that it is broader than the REV.  The place where that has to start is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Another point is that the budgeting that is being done now, is budgeting for 2020.  Even for the 2019 financial statements, we have missed the boat.</p></speech>

For example, take the appropriation accounts for the Department of Communication, Climate Action and Environment.  It has two programmes - one is an energy programme and the other is environment and waste management.  There needs to be consideration as to whether that is the correct grouping or if it is the correct programme structure.  That is something that individual Departments will discuss with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The sooner we start on that work, the sooner we can start taking action and provide better information for a debate that will not go away.</p></speech>

We are frustrated at the lack of transparency.  Although we might appear to give the officials a hard time, it is to encourage everyone in the system to move in the direction in which we all need to move.  There is no criticism; we are all just a bit frustrated at the slow pace.  That is why we called the officials to a special meeting, to highlight it and to give it greater emphasis.  Sometimes the Committee on Public Accounts must link it to the tax that has been collected and the expenditure.  That is our opening into this, but it is not just about examining the past but also the benefits for the future.</p> <p>  We have concluded our discussion.  I thank the officials from the Department of Communication, Climate Action and Environment for their attendance and the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff.   The committee secretariat will contact the officials for any follow-up information that is required and was mentioned.  </p> <p>  The next meeting will be with the Revenue Commissioners, during which we will ask about carbon tax.  We will discuss Vote 9 of the Revenue Commissioners - Central Fund-related accounts,  chapter 17 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on tax compliance interventions, and chapter 18 on tax relief on film production.

Indeed, I tabled an amendment last year on the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2018, at which time the Minister stated that there was no need for such an amendment in light of the work to which her Department had committed.</p><p>The Minister stated:</p><blockquote>We are ready, practically, for the finalisation of our report that was committed to under the Pathways to Work programme 2016-2020, which will examine exactly what the Deputy is looking for today.  I have no problem committing to that as the report is very nearly ready to be published. I am very happy, Chairman, that this committee be the first place that we have a conversation about it.  I do not need to recommit in legislation to something that is already practically completed.</blockquote><p>The amendment was not successful last year and many members took the decision, based on the Minister's contribution, that trust could be placed in her that the report would be forthcoming.  Unfortunately, another year has passed and the discrimination against our young jobseekers continues.  Unfortunately, I am tabling this amendment again because the report is not here with us.  She has spoken about making changes in the Bill, which are welcome but they do not go far enough.  Only approximately 300 young people living independently will benefit from the changes put forward by her.<br/><br/>We need a full poverty impact assessment.  Has she seen a draft of this report, the preparation of which seems to be going on forever?  Has she read the report or where is it?  If I could be given a date categorically now, there would be no need for this amendment.  Unfortunately, if we do not have that, I must press the amendment.</p></speech>

I did not realise a reply had been given last year when this report was requested so we need it now.  It was revealed to me in response to a parliamentary question that approximately 300 young people will benefit from the changes.  The idea of being able to live independently on meagre money of approximately &euro;118 a week is pie in the sky stuff.  There are approximately 29,000 unemployed young people so there is a cohort that is not being treated fairly.  Their payments were cut for austerity reasons but we are way beyond that justification now.  It is discriminatory behaviour to keep them in this bracket.  I totally support the amendment.</p></speech>

I have said many times that there are plenty of options for anybody aged under 25 to receive the full payment through training, employment opportunities, community employment, CE, or the youth employment support scheme.  There is a wide variety of opportunities.  I must correct the Deputy's probable misunderstanding, as 1,780 people aged 25 will be affected by the changes we are making this year.  On top of that, 380 people aged under 25 will be positively affected because of the changes.  Those are not the numbers mentioned by the Deputies.</p> <p>  Having said that, I am quite happy to accept the amendment as I find myself in the unfortunate position of only being able to answer his questions in the negative.  I have not seen a draft report or any sign of it.  It is imminent but I will not sit here and tell him that "imminent" has any different meaning from this time last year.  I am happy to accept the amendment on the basis that it might encourage us to give him the report and the information he has requested for the past number of years.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that the report has not been produced.  Where is the problem or the delay?  Last year, she said it was there.  Whether she been misinformed by officials in the Department or not, it is disappointing.  What is being proposed is a welcome small step forward.</p></speech>

In a means testing scenario, a person is allowed to work for 15 hours per week.  This amendment would have increased the amount by approximately the value of the minimum wage, or &euro;10; if a person is allowed to work an extra three and a half hours, the means test would have to be increased accordingly.  In the case of a couple, for example, they might have &euro;665 per week.  This means that if a carer works more than 15 hours and earns a bit more money, it would be of limited use as it would come off the carer's allowance.</p></speech>

It appears that increases in carbon tax will be a feature of budgets from now because of climate change policies of all parties, including those in government.  There is an argument as to whether increasing carbon tax has any impact in reducing carbon emissions but that is beside the point.  The Government has accepted the proposition, which seems widely accepted, that it has an effect.  That is the stated purpose, at least, of increasing carbon tax.</p><p>Increasing the carbon tax will have a disproportionate impact on lower-income families.  If an increase is X, a higher proportion of income will be sacrificed as the income gets smaller.  The Government's strategy to deal with this was to increase fuel allowance by &euro;2 per week.  The fuel allowance lasts for 28 weeks, giving an increase of &euro;56.  The Minister told me recently during Question Time in the D&aacute;il that some studies have been done and it is reckoned that this amount is needed to compensate people.  I would like something more specific than that.  Many categories of social welfare recipients do not receive the fuel allowance at all and, in effect, they are not being compensated for the increase in carbon tax, which is grossly unjust.  If it is the Government's intention and the intention of future Governments to increase the carbon tax year on year, I would like a detailed assessment of how this will affect lower income groups so we can make the necessary adjustments in budgetary policy.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Dea's amendment focuses on low-income families but I have come at this from the angle of people in receipt of the fuel allowance.  We know the impact the carbon tax will have on people as it is not new.  It has been in place for a number of years.</p><p>By and large, they live in poor accommodation that may be badly insulated, that has little or no central heating and windows that are not in a good state of repair.  This affects local authority houses but also the private rental sector.  While we acknowledge there are some good landlords, there also some bad landlords in receipt of substantial amounts of State funding, whether through the rental accommodation scheme, the housing assistance payment or some other form of State assistance.  Carbon tax increased this year and it will continue to increase in the coming years.  This will disproportionately affect people in the situations to which I refer.</p><p> Other Deputies and parties have looked for an assessment to be carried out.  When I raised the matter previously with the Minister, she stated that it was not really her responsibility and she kicked it over to Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton.  There must be an onus on the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to carry out this assessment, however.  I specifically honed in on people in receipt of the fuel allowance.  I take the point Deputy O&rsquo;Dea made.  I am happy to meet him to work on a formula on which we could jointly agree.  Leaving aside the wording, we need this assessment to be carried out.  Otherwise, a &euro;2 carbon tax rise does not take on board the massive rise in fuel costs over the past several years and into the future.</p></speech>

I am on the climate committee and fought hard to get such a study agreed on.  We got it agreed but it never happened.  The committee heard from witnesses from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, which had both carried out such studies.  We did not look hard at the evidence that shows increasing carbon tax actually reduces emissions.  There is much evidence to show that it does not.</p> <p>  Apart from that, because that is a kind of climate action issue, measuring fuel poverty by those in receipt of fuel allowance gets it completely wrong.  There is a cohort of people who do not get fuel allowance but who pay an extraordinary amount of money on electricity, gas or coal in order to stay warm because their houses are in poor condition, they are sick or one of their family members is ill.  If one looks at the way it is measured in other countries, all of these factors are taken into account.  They just do not consider someone being in receipt of fuel allowance or the level of social protection payments that applies.  I have met retired workers from RT&Eacute; and the Oireachtas who have been crippled by the increase in carbon tax, despite the fact they have a job pension.  They are cold but cannot afford to make the changes in their lives which this would require.</p> <p>  We need to look at a different measure.  If the Minister was willing to take this on board, that would be a start.  Another Department failed in this regard but this is also applicable to this Department.  Like MABS and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, a report would show this is a widespread and deep issue.  Fuel poverty is flying under the radar and will increase because of the actions taken by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p></speech>

We cannot bring forward amendments that will result in a cost to the Exchequer.  The only proposal we can push for is reports on the impact of cuts, changes or measures brought forward by the Minister.  This amendment seeks a report on the cost of hearing aids and the adequacy of the financial support in this regard.  In July, the organisation Chime gave a comprehensive statement to the committee on the impact of the cuts imposed as part of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation, FEMPI.  Some stark statistics came out of this.  We know changes have been made in terms of optical and dental benefits under the treatment benefit scheme.  Hearing aids have not, however.  I am trying to find out the entitlements prior to the changes but it was hard to get those exact figures.</p><p>The cuts were made in budget 2009.  There are over 300,000 people with significant hearing loss who need hearing aids.  Only one in five actually have them.  That is a low treatment rate.  If one has a look at those who have access to a medical card, they are twice as likely to have a hearing aid than those who do not.  Not having a hearing aid can have a massive impact on an individual.  There is much evidence to show that it can impact in terms of dementia and other medical issues, as well as social isolation.  This needs to be rectified.  Changes have been made in terms of the dental and optical treatments.  This also needs to change.  Unfortunately, I cannot bring forward an amendment calling on the Minister to reverse this cut.  My hands are tied.  Accordingly, I can only bring forward an amendment calling for reports on treatment benefits.</p></speech>

In 2012, the Government, the grant was reduced from &euro;760 per aid down to the current &euro;500.</p> <p>  I am happy to compile a report on this.  I already know what is in it because I met Chime and I commissioned a report subsequently.  I am quite happy to give the Deputy that report.</p> <p>  We do not pay in its entirety under any of the treatment benefits.  That has been the case for as long as they have been around.  We only pay towards the cost.  Digital technology has changed significantly over the past several years around many items.  The price of many items has come down over the years.  A crude example is that this is probably somewhat similar to the price of TVs.  A couple years ago, a 32 inch flat-screen TV would cost &euro;1,000.  Now, one can buy the same TV in Tesco for &euro;199.  The same has happened with the technology for hearing aids, meaning the price relating to them has dropped significantly.</p><p>Fortunately, around the time that the reductions were made in 2009 and 2011, a package was provided by the market that mirrored the &euro;500 that was on offer every couple of years.  I am happy to examine the matter and produce a report in order to allow the committee to consider it.  Any changes to the awards or the allowances that go with it will have to be made in a budgetary context by whoever is lucky enough to be in my chair next year.</p></speech>

I acknowledge, as would Chime, that costs have fallen but, unfortunately, uptake has not increased.  There remains a big difference between people in respect of receiving a medical card, where there is a clear problem.  Eye and dental patients must pay their contributions.  There was a significant cut from &euro;830 to &euro;500, not to mention the second cut.  I would not imagine that the reduction in costs for the new digital hearing aids was in line with the percentage cut-----</p></speech>

The matter has been the subject of a degree of focus and the Minister will be aware I introduced legislation in respect of it.  In advance of the changes being made, there was no consultation or meaningful debate in this institution, while there was little debate outside it.  The UK is the only other country examining increasing the pension age to 68 but it will not make the change until 2046, 18 years after Ireland.  We will increase our pension age to 67 in 2021 and further in 2028.  All the evidence shows that Ireland has nearly 30% fewer older people than other European countries.  Nevertheless, we are pushing ahead faster and further than all our EU counterparts.</p><p>In 50 years, Ireland will still have the lowest number of older people, with nearly 20% fewer than other EU countries.  We have always been given the rationale that the State pension age has to increase, while some use the terrible phrase of the ticking time bomb and so on.  The evidence clearly shows that is not factual.  We are nowhere near our European counterparts, yet we are pushing ahead faster and further than them.  In 2017, the committee published a report with cross-party consensus that indicated that further increases in the pension age had to be suspended.  The committee agreed to that, although I am not sure whether the Minister was aware.  It is an anomaly that someone who has to retire at 65 years old will sign on for jobseeker's allowance.  That is not acceptable.  If we increase the age in 2021, will we tell people who retire that they will have to sign on for two years before they can receive their State pensions?  It is an unfair anomaly and a report would be useful in this regard.</p></speech>

It is especially harsh on manual workers.  In the case of a bus driver who retires after more than 40 years, as my father did, it is evident that manual workers' lifespan is much shorter than that of white-collar workers or people who do less hands-on or shift work.  Many bus drivers die before they reach 70 years of age.  Now they have been told they will not be able to receive their pensions until they are 68 and that this will cost them &euro;45 per week, according to SIPTU's research.  It is grossly unfair to say to members of the workforce, not least those who have worked in the most demanding jobs, that they will be penalised.  While they may apply to Dublin Bus, for example, to continue for another year if they are healthy enough, they have the right to retire after 40 years' service, and they may find themselves making the choice that they cannot afford to retire because they would be &euro;45 worse off per week.  Moreover, the age level is rising.  The issue has caused riots - near revolutions - in France, Germany and other countries.  We have the highest rate of increases in the retirement age in the entire EU, which is shameful.  Something needs to be done and the report needs to be examined.  Much of the work has been done by SIPTU, including Michael Taft and others, but we need to examine it and its consequences in depth.</p></speech>

I am happy to produce a report for the Deputy and, in fact, most of it has been done in the confines of total contributions, which will come before the Cabinet in the next number of weeks.  I do not have the money, or even a Vote from which to take it, in order to conduct research, including international comparative research, and engage in public consultation.

That is the current position but the Government can change it if it wishes.  The reason advanced for the change is the demography, that is, the ratio of pensioners to the people who pay for the pensions, a difference that will increase dramatically over the next 20 or 30 years.  I was interested in what Deputy Brady said about what is happening in other countries.  I would like to see not just the age limits from other countries but also the comparative statistics, that is, the ratio of pensioners to contributors.  I do not imagine that would cost an awful lot of money.  I take the Minister's point about public consultation and so on but comparative research, not least against European countries, would be a one or two-day job.  If the public consultation provision is omitted, the amendment should be acceptable.</p></speech>

There are different timescales for different age groups.  However, the one that really gets to me is the 25 to 60 year age group because those in it must make 260 contributions before becoming entitled to any benefit.  I have spoken to many people about this matter.  It is a fact that children are starting school at a later age, that transition year is nearly mandatory in all schools and that an ever increasing number of people are attending college.  How many graduating from college will have 260 contributions made at the age of 25 years?  The answer is very few, which is why I have asked for the qualifying criteria to be reviewed.  I am not sure how they were arrived or for how long this problem has persisted.  The number of contributions may have been fit for purpose a number of years ago, but it is not now.  A swathe of people educate themselves and find employment to try to further themselves, but, unfortunately, they are precluded from receiving any benefit by virtue of not having made 260 contributions.  Therefore, a review would be very beneficial.</p></speech>

That is the purpose of the system.  If he wants to change to a universal system, we are talking about having an entirely different cheque book from the one the Department has.  I am quite happy to compile a report, but it will literally explain why the system is based on the making of contributions by recipients.</p></speech>

I oppose the qualifying criteria which require the making of 260 contributions.  That is the piece that needs to be examined.  How many 25-year old college graduates have that number of contributions?  The answer is very few.  Different criteria apply, depending on someone's age from the age of 18 years upwards.</p></speech>

Again, the qualifying conditions for recipients of jobseeker's allowance and supplementary welfare allowance for the fuel allowance are unfair.  For example, in order to qualify for the fuel allowance, a person needs to be in receipt of jobseeker's allowance for more than 390 days or 15 months.  For the sake of argument, if a worker becomes unemployed this winter, he or she will not qualify for the fuel allowance either this winter or next winter.  Potentially, he or she could miss out on payments for two winters, whereas someone who became unemployed earlier in the year or during the summer will only miss out on receiving the fuel allowance this winter but will qualify for it next year.  The way the conditions have been set up is unfair, particularly for persons who are very vulnerable.  We have gone through all of the arguments, including whether the allowance has even been set at the right level from the start.  I am not sure what the rationale is for stipulating a 15-month period.  Perhaps the Minister might explain it.  A review might prove greatly beneficial in the cases I have outlined.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I did not have the amendment ready for today, but it will be ready before Report Stage.  I also need to introduce related amendments to enable me, at the same time as making the order for the national minimum wage, to provide for parallel increases in the PRSI earnings threshold, as set out in section 13(2)(d) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act.

My party and others want to see the introduction of a living wage, but that is a different piece of work.  The 30 cent increase was the minimum proposed.  For the Government not to approve it was a slap in the face for workers.  With the amendment being withdrawn, the Labour Party's facilitation of this pitiful move by the Government is striking.

My repeated statements, his misunderstanding of which is causing him angst, might be why Deputy Penrose is happy to support me, namely, that the Government has accepted in their entirety the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission to increase the national minimum wage from &euro;9.80 to &euro;10.10.

To put it simply, the court found that the automatic disallowance of entitlement to benefits was unconstitutional, since it represented a secondary or extrajudicial punishment.  The issues involved were complex, but they need to be addressed.  Work is under way to draft the necessary changes to the Act.  If they are ready before the closing date for submission of Report Stage amendments, I will introduce them as amendments to the Bill.</p> <p>  I wish to bring another matter to members' attention.  I have been asked by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to introduce a necessary amendment to the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001.  That amendment is being drafted and the Business Committee is discussing whether there must be a debate before it can be moved on Report Stage.
