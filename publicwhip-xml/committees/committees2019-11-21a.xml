    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#B00200"><p>We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the committee and he is joined by Ms Maureen Mulligan, senior auditor.  No apologies have been received for today's meeting.</p> <p>  We need to agree minutes for previous meetings.  We met on Tuesday, 5 November regarding greenhouse gas and financial transactions with witnesses from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  We had our normal weekly meeting on 7 November, for which certain details have been circulated.  We had a private meeting on 12 November to consider our periodic report.  A note on that has been circulated.  We also had a normal weekly meeting on 14 November, last week.  Can we agree and publish those minutes?  Agreed.</p> <p>  As no matters arise, I will move to correspondence, starting with category A, briefing documents and opening statements.  Nos. 2552 and 2562 from the Charities Regulator are briefing documents and opening statements for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish these.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 2564 dated 20 November is the opening statement from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment for the session this afternoon.  We will note and publish this.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Category B is other correspondence.  Some items that we published last week have been held over in case members wish to raise any matters.  The first of these is No. 2530 from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 7 November provides information requested by the committee following our recent meeting with Caranua on 17 October as follows: a report on the consultation with survivors of institutional abuse; information regarding pension liabilities incurred by Caranua under the public services single scheme; and details regarding four properties that were initially offered by religious congregations under the 2002 indemnity agreement and accepted for transfer to the State which subsequently had to be rejected, mainly because of title issues, and cash amounts equivalent to the agreed valuation accepted instead.  We agreed to note and publish this last week.</p> <p>  No. 2532 from Caranua, dated 7 November was also noted and published last week.  It deals with salaries paid to the acting CEO and non-acting CEO during the period of overlap in 2018; a breakdown of the cancelled payments returned to Caranua; details of when the 2018 accounts came before the board; details of expenditure of &euro;80,000 under the human resources heading in 2016; breakdown of expenditure on consultancy work; details regarding 317 outstanding applications; any surplus or interest accrued on contributions received from the Christian Brothers; details regarding statutory redundancy payments and the amount set aside for redundancies; details regarding statistics on phone calls to Caranua; a note on Caranua's total administrative costs since its inception; a breakdown of administrative costs for each year since Caranua's inception; and a note on ongoing mediation involving construction companies and alleged defective work.  We have already agreed to note and publish this.  If any member wants to discuss it, that is fine.  If not, it has been circulated, members have it and are free to discuss it among themselves in any forum they wish, but we have already published it.</p> <p>  No. 2544 is from Mr. Paddy O'Keeffe, tax appeals commissioner, dated 8 November providing the regular update which we require from the Tax Appeals Commission.  The value of the top ten cases amounts to &euro;2.558 billion.  All bar one relate to corporation tax issues.  One relates to the environmental levy, which was subject to a recent Supreme Court decision and parties are now reviewing that judgment.  All the other cases have been listed.  There is a proposed timetable for February 2020.  In one or two they expect progress to be reviewed this month.  The schedule is there.  We note and publish it.  There are no details of names of individuals or companies.  Many of them are in respect of items that could potentially be more than &euro;100 million.  The total is provided.  It is in line with the previous report.  We are getting reports on a regular basis.  We will note and publish that and people can make observations on that.</p> <p>  No. 2545 is from Mr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General, Department of Children and Youth Affairs, dated 8 November providing an update requested by the committee on pending claims being managed by the State Claims Agency on behalf of the Department, including a geographic breakdown.  In particular, I draw attention to the 57 active claims relating to Oberstown detention centre, 49 of which are claims from members of staff.  We will note and publish this.  It contains information we were seeking regarding our discussion with the State Claims Agency.  It is very worrying that 49 staff members have claims against the Department in respect of Oberstown.  We will note it.  That is a serious matter for the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, and Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

I know we got details for Oberstown but not for the other areas, whether it be service users, staff or whatever.  I believe that was part of the request.  Could we request further information on that?  The letter lists the numbers but not the reasons or who made the complaints.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#B00600"><p>We will certainly do that.  That is noted and published.  We will follow that up.</p><p>No. 2546 is on the school transport scheme.  It contains two sentences which I find almost mutually contradictory.  It is from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 8 November responding to our request on whether Bus &Eacute;ireann's auditors are satisfied that profits from the school transport scheme have not been used to cross-subsidise Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; advises that reimbursement to Bus &Eacute;ireann is on a cost-recovery basis for a range of costs identified as being incurred in the operation and administration of the scheme, together with other direct and indirect costs attributable to the work carried out for the Department, referred to as the transport management charge.  A separate account for the school transport scheme is audited each year by independent auditors in Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The Department is satisfied that the appropriate assurances have been received from Bus &Eacute;ireann that all moneys in the school transport scheme are retained within the scheme and expended only on the requirements of the scheme.  We will note and publish this.</p><p>However, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; also contradicts that statement in his letter.  The essential element of what he is saying is that reimbursement is on a cost-recovery basis under an old agreement going back to 1975.  The letter refers to that.  The last paragraph on the first page states:</p><blockquote>The C&amp;amp;AG report referenced a surplus in the Transport Management Charge element of the costs.  This amount was held by way of an uncommitted reserve by Bus Eireann to be used solely for the purposes of the school transport scheme.  The uncommitted reserve was repaid in full to the Department in December 2018.</blockquote> <p>I cannot understand this letter stating there is not a surplus and it is on a cost-recovery basis.  I can understand that there might be a surplus one year and it goes into the next year to meet known costs coming up in that year because it cannot be cut off at the end of the year.  There is a follow through.  However, at the end of all that the letter states, &quot;The uncommitted reserve was repaid in full to the Department.&quot;  Why would it hand money back to the Department if there was not a surplus?  I do not understand that sentence.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#B00800"><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General has been all over this and produced a special report.  I ask him to explain how the Department is claiming there is not a surplus and that it is just cost recovery, yet Bus &Eacute;ireann repaid an uncommitted reserve to the Department.  It is either one or the other.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#B00900"><p>It depends on whether it is defined as a profit or a surplus.  If Bus &Eacute;ireann accepted that it was due back to the Department, which it appears to have done, it could not be recognising it as a profit.</p></speech>

It has excess money and is saying it is a surplus, but because it handed it back, it was never a profit.  Is that what it is saying?</p></speech>

I just do not understand it.</p></speech>

A number of things have happened.  The Department carried out a review.  It did not give us the results of that, but told us what it did as a result of it.</p><p>It did not say what difficulties it discovered with the apportionment methodology.  It also said it was never a profit because it had to be used for school transport.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#C00200"><p>That is the essence of what it is saying.  While it was over-funded, let us say, in one year relative to what it was spending or what it needed to spend, that money was not Bus &Eacute;ireann's to take to profit.  It was money that it was obliged to hold in trust and take less money the following year or to give it back to the Department.  That is what it is acknowledging.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#C00300"><p>So in essence, what is wrong with that?  It should be run on a cost recovery basis, should it not?  It is not a profit-making business so it should be run on a cost and they should be able to show this was the cost, this was the surplus.</p></speech>

Over what period was this surplus, as we will call it, and that ultimately was repaid to the Department built up?  What about the company deciding to return it to the Department?  Was that the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General?  Had his office not done it, was it going to keep this money in its own bank account year on year?  What brought it about that this extra money that was over and above the cost recovery basis that it had been paid, what brought about that being returned to the Department?  That is all I am asking.</p></speech>

There are big issues here in terms of value for money as a subject in terms of the challenges we face separately.  This net issue is about whether the money was a profit or a surplus.  Clearly it was not a profit and clearly it was a cost recovery.  The only question is the one the Chairman is raising.  At what stage should the surplus be repaid or what is the mechanism for it to go back?</p></speech>

We are going to ask the Department to give us the straightforward history on a year-by-year basis since the scheme was introduced of the amounts that were returned to the Department.

If it had never happened before and only got highlighted, that would mean Bus &Eacute;ireann was sitting on that money until whenever somebody highlighted it.  We need to know the full history of any repayments to the Departments of an uncommitted reserve and over what period those uncommitted reserves built up.  That is what we need.

It should not take the actions of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It has independent auditors and the Department is over the scheme.  There was no compulsion on the Comptroller and Auditor General to do the report.  Had he not chosen to do it, that money may well have remained sitting in Bus &Eacute;ireann's bank account.  That is my point.  Surely it should have its own mechanism in place to identify those matters.</p><p>I am going to associate another item of correspondence, No. 2556C from a private individual.  We will note it because it deals specifically with this and highlights a parliamentary question published on 12 November asked by Deputy MacSharry, a member of this committee, in respect of this issue.  The reply is suitably vague.  We will note that item.  We will not publish the name of the person but we will publish the parliamentary question and reply because they are a matter of public record.  We are satisfied that we are going back to the Department on this issue.</p><p>Next is No. 2547B from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE providing information we requested regarding Daisyhouse Housing Association.  There is an ongoing issue.  Issues were highlighted.  They have given us an extensive briefing note in respect of the structure of what Daisyhouse does.  We will note and publish this.  They deal with 15 residents for residents to successfully move into long-term housing.  They work with 14 tenants in long-term accommodation and have provided 32 people with access to health and well-being opportunities.  In respect of funding to Daisyhouse, &euro;237,000 is 51% of their funding and comes from the HSE under a section 39 agreement.  They receive donations of 26% and receive some rent themselves and have some fundraising activities.  Following the issues raised, they had a meeting in August 2018 and the social inclusion teams in the relevant areas in Dublin city and Wicklow met them.  This organisation has now been included on the 2019 agreed audit plan by the HSE.  There is a audit ongoing and we will ask to be kept informed of that audit when it is completed.  We note and publish that.</p><p>Next is No.<b></b>2548B from Mr. John O'Sullivan, chief executive and Commissioner of Valuation, dated 12 November 2019, providing the information we requested in relation to the valuation of public utility undertakings.  Mr. O'Sullivan advises the global valuation process relates to the physical network occupied by certain public utilities for its principal purposes, mainly the supply of gas and telecommunications, issues like that.  They have an overall valuation of &euro;970 million which is designated as public utility undertakings for the purpose of the valuations.  I just want to explain this to the public who will find it interesting.  Global valuations apply where there are major organisations providing public utilities.  They can be private companies providing public utilities across the vast majority of local authorities.  The way the Valuation Office does it is to value the total assets and then apportion this to the relevant local authority areas in which there are assets of that organisation.  This is so people will know what we are talking about.  They have issued very good information here on a county-by-county basis for each of the following companies: 2RN, formerly RT&Eacute; Transmission; BT Communications; Eircom; EirGrid; Eir Mobile; ESB Networks; Gas Networks Ireland; Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann; Irish Water; Three Ireland (Hutchison) Ltd.; Virgin Media Ireland Ltd.; and Vodafone.  The highest valuation is in respect of ESB Networks across the country.  The next highest valuation was Irish Water.  The next highest was Gas Networks Ireland.  Eircom was the fourth highest.  The other ones are down the line.  They give a breakdown of the valuation for each of those companies by local authority.  People will know by looking at this that the 31 local authorities are split showing the valuation.  Gas Networks Ireland has only 27 local authorities because there are some counties that have no natural gas network.  It is not included.  Eight local authorities have not had a recent revaluation and they are listed on the right hand side as a separate amount.</p><p>What I want to stress, because it is not covered in the letter - and perhaps there is an assumption that we know it but the public will not know it - is that while it gives the total global valuation of these organisations as &euro;970 million, which is almost &euro;1 billion, members of the public watching should know that is not &euro;1 billion for local authorities.  The local multiplier is applied in each local authority area in respect of the valuation designated by those organisations.  We all know about counties that have had revaluations.  People got a figure showing what the valuation was and they panicked.  Then they went in and the local authority multiplier might have been 0.25 or 0.23 or whatever the case was.  That is not money for local authorities from rates.  It is the valuation and each local authority has its own local multiplier.  The amount for local authorities is a fraction of this and it can only be obtained by getting the multiplier in each local authority area.  Irish Water is the one that raised this issue in particular.  There is great information for people who want it.  I have run through it so the people watching understand what this correspondence and discussion is about.</p></speech>

Through no fault of their own some of these local authorities have found themselves significantly short-changed.  Local authorities in Dublin, Waterford and a couple of others happened to have the revaluation process when Irish Water was established.  Prior to this, I understand most, if not all, local authorities had a nominal charge on rates because it was just money in and money out for them.  Taking Waterford as an example of a revaluation of the rates done after Irish Water was established, the contribution from Irish Water was &euro;4.7 million.  It was paid in the first year and then, because of the difficulties with Irish Water, it stopped paying the rates and compensation was paid by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Each local authority has received this until now.</p> <p>  The Water Services Act was amended in 2017 to allow Irish Water to pay rates again.  Because of the global valuation, which is not based on the infrastructure in any local authority area but on population, some local authorities have been hit with massive reductions, such as &euro;8 million in Dublin and &euro;3.3 million in Waterford.  Through no fault of their own, they now have to take an axe to cut services or increase rates.</p> <p>  When the revaluation was done in all local authorities, there were some winners and losers.  The pot of money remained the same but that is eaten bread and it has been forgotten.  What is now happening is that ratepayers and those using local services are being affected.  This is quite a serious issue.  Dublin City Council cannot pass its budget and something similar will happen in Waterford.  There are ongoing discussions with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p> <p>  We should go back to the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Planning and Local Government to ask about the history of this and how it came about.  Some authorities, through no fault of their own, just happened to go through the revaluation process at the time.  Waterford City and County Council was given the figure of &euro;4.7 million and did not come up with it.  It was built into their income over seven years and taken away from them with all of the consequences of that.  Dublin City Council's proposed budget included an increase in rents on local authority tenants and an increase on toll charges and rates.  This will have an impact on a lot of people.  It is not the case with every local authority and, in fact, some local authorities gained.  Some were winners and others losers.  For those who are losers it is not their fault but they are taking a hit.  The Comptroller and Auditor General does not audit local government but do we audit Irish Water?</p></speech>

Last week, I raised this issue and the issue of rates income foregone.  Following that, I asked a parliamentary question on the amounts paid by the Department to local authorities over the past five years.  The Department came back to me and helpfully pointed out the Comptroller and Auditor General publishes a report on central government funding, that the most recent report was in 2018 and provided a link.  God bless them.  Two can play at that game.</p></speech>

There are wide variations.  For example, in Waterford, it was almost &euro;4.6 million last year; in Louth, it was &euro;584,000; in Tipperary, it was &euro;427,000; and in my county, it was &euro;308,000.  In Galway city, it was &euro;98,000 while in Galway county, it was &euro;10,500.  There are wide variations.  Council budgets will be done over the coming weeks.  As the Chairman said, it is very useful to have the global valuation with regard to applying the multiplier.  In my county, where the budget will be dealt with on Monday, the figure is not in the budget book yet.</p> <p>  I asked this question last week.  I asked for us to write to the Department which, in previous correspondence, said it was actively monitoring the situation as to the impact on local authorities.  Have we received a response?  I want to know the impact on each local authority's budget book.  The Dublin city manager, Owen Keegan, stated publicly that he had an understanding with the Minister that any shortfall would be met by Exchequer funding.  It is unusual for a member of the County and City Management Association to make such a public statement.  This is not happening and, as I said last week, that issue alone is leaving Dublin City Council with a substantial shortfall of &euro;8 million.  We just do not know yet what the situation will be with regard to the liability of each county and where it stands.  We must remember the central allocation by the Department of Finance to the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government out of the overall pool is &euro;35 million.  There is no wriggle room for the Department to try to intervene and help local authorities in this situation.  They are faced with having to find it from elsewhere.  Do we have a response from the Department on its active monitoring of the situation?  It is well aware of the correspondence.  It is keeping in contact with all of the directors of finance in each county and where we stand with regard to the overall figure for each council's budget.</p></speech>

Five months away from an election, a Minister is saying he will get the council over the hump for this year.  This goes back to the substantive issue of how we are funding local government or not funding it.  We give a council &euro;2 million to get it over the hump for this year and then it will be in the same hole next year, and will have to stretch across all the services.  One then receives an answer stating that the Comptroller and Auditor General publishes a report and to look at that.  It is disgraceful.

I assume that if Dublin and Waterford just happened to be going through the revaluation process at the time Irish Water was established, the Valuation Office looked at the water infrastructure in those local authority areas.  Waterford has wastewater treatment plants that service the region.  Is it the case with the global valuation, if it is based on population, that it is not actually based on the infrastructure in local authorities at all?</p></speech>

We have had various Bills on global valuation and the Valuation Office over the years.  The logic is that the other way of doing it is to have the Valuation Office value every single asset in every individual local authority one by one.  The Government felt that was an excessive use of resources at the time.  It said to do a valuation and that this would be divided by population.  It is not exact but is probably the quickest-----</p></speech>

Some counties, if there is no gas network, do not come into the global valuation for Bord G&aacute;is, for example, or Gas Networks Ireland, but most of the big counties do.  There are some very big pieces of infrastructure in certain local authority areas.  It was a simple way of doing it but is not an accurate assessment of the assets.  That global valuation system is one that we here in the Oireachtas have dealt with and amended since time immemorial.  It is up to the Oireachtas if we want to do it on an asset-by-asset basis.  These are commercial bodies.  We all know that lots of other public bodies have schools, courthouses and hospitals, which are not rateable at all because they are non-commercial.  We will follow up on that with the Department, Irish Water and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  No. 2549B is from Mr. Jim Meade, chief executive of Irish Rail, dated 13 November 2019 providing further information regarding the use of the public services card for rail travel.  Figures about the value of debt are included.  We will note and publish this.  He refers to my earlier comments.  He understands that what was said at this meeting by myself and others was reasonable on the basis of the information that we had.  Irish Rail has now provided further information, which helps to clarify the issue.  We will come back to the matter of the public services card and free travel in our next periodic report.</p> <p>  No. 2550B is from Mr. Colm Hayes from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and is about the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme.  We needed to clarify some matters for the periodic report, which we are launching next Tuesday.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p>  No. 2551B is from Mr. Nick Ashmore, chief executive of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, about the number of employees or number of jobs assisted.  He takes our point but says that the corporation will explore the viability of seeking additional data at the time of application about the number of jobs to be assisted.  However, he says that its preference in such matters is to gather the minimum information needed from small and medium enterprises which are borrowing to meet policy, state aid and founder requirements to keep the application simple and straightforward.  If that is the approach it takes, that is fine.  It should not be publishing the other information regarding employment if it is not related to what it is doing.  My only gripe is that it was claiming some connection between a small loan to a particular organisation and total employment.  If it cannot do it and the amounts are small, where it involves small organisations which meet all the other requirements, that is fine but it should not be putting the employment figures in its annual report unless it can stand over them.</p> <p>  No. 2553B is from Professor Willie Donnelly of Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, providing details requested by the committee regarding the build-up of budget deficits in recent years.  There is much documentation and Deputy Cullinane might want to comment.</p></speech>

A number of institutes of technology are running deficits.  When we looked at it, I think Waterford had the highest deficit proportionally.  We are trying to understand the reason for that and what corrective action is being taken.  It seems that there a number of reasons, including consolidation of companies after a statutory inspection that took place in the institute.  There was regularising of certain income streams.  It noted the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General into how certain income streams were accounted for.  It also talks about cutbacks in funding for higher education.  I assume it is talking about the austerity years, when there were cutbacks.  It has an accumulated deficit of &euro;6.8 million.  The last line is worrying, where it states that despite making savings in both pay and non-pay, the institute could not match the income cuts with comparable expenditure savings.  It is essentially telling us that it cannot bridge the gap, which is a considerable deficit.  It looks like it is not entirely the institute's fault, if at all, if it was a result of significant cuts at the time.</p> <p>  If that has not been dealt with by the Department, that is a difficulty for the institute.  I know that a cost containment plan was put in place that resulted in significant reductions in services on at least one campus in an attempt to deal with it.  The problem here is that the institute cannot deal with pay, which is a big part of any institute's spending.  When it starts trying to cut non-pay expenditure, it becomes very difficult.  It is a very similar situation to a hospital.</p><p>It might be useful to look at WIT as a test case in terms of the other institutes.  Perhaps we could bring representatives of WIT in and look at what happened and the history of this.  WIT has set out very clearly for us the history going back to 2011 and how it ended up in this situation.  It is, it seems, trying to recover and to deal with the deficit.  There was a drop-off in student numbers.  WIT says there has been an increase again, which is helping.  However, I find the last line very worrying because this is an institute that, it is hoped, will transition into a technological university with Carlow yet it is carrying this big deficit and does not seem to be able to manage it, it seems, through no fault of its own because it just does not have the income to do it.  It cannot cut in areas in which it cannot cut, such as pay, obviously.  I request that we have a look at this as part of our work programme.  We did a lot of work on third level institutes and now we have moved on to other issues.  However, this is one of those legacy issues.  I refer to how WIT is funded; consolidation of other companies, which in this case happened; how that has played a part in the deficit; and, more importantly, the cuts in funding to higher education and how they are still biting for some institutes of technology.  Would that be a reasonable request, that we perhaps look at Waterford as-----</p></speech>

It says in respect of the financial year ending 31 August 2019, "The consolidated financial statements are currently undergoing a final draft stage and will be available for the C&amp;AG by the prescribed due date of 30th November 2019."  That is within three months of the year end.  I remember that a few years ago we almost suspended a meeting because the most recent accounts we had were two and a half years old.  Again, the input of the Committee of Public Accounts has certainly brought a bit of realisation to the boards of these organisations that there must be proper corporate governance, which includes producing financial statements in a timely manner.  WIT now seems to be doing so.  However, as Deputy Cullinane said, the last sentence reads, "The Institute, despite making savings in both pay and non-pay, could not match the income cuts with comparable expenditure saving."  I take it that that is the historic position, not the position into the future.  WIT is giving the summary of its past-----</p></speech>

There are still legacy issues resulting from the cutbacks back in the austerity years, which is a bit unfair if the effort is being made to deal with the non-pay elements of this, and it seems there has been an effort in conjunction with the Department.  I think the Comptroller and Auditor General is saying there was some growth in student numbers and that there has been some reduction in the deficit in recent years, so it is going in the right direction at least.</p></speech>

We will certainly come back to it at that stage.  We will note and publish that information in the meantime.  It is good to get it.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence - we are nearly there - is No. 2554B, from the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, dated 14 November, responding to our request for information regarding asylum seekers.  The information was requested by our secretariat as part of our periodic report work.  There is also the next item, No. 2560B, from Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, dated 5 November, providing information requested by the committee on direct provision centres.  This is also to feed into our periodic report, which we will publish next week.  For the benefit of people watching the meeting, I wish to highlight a couple of matters.</p> <p>  In No. 2554B, which contains some useful figures and statistics, the Department of Justice and Equality states the following.  At the end of October there were 8,560 persons with active international protection claims in Ireland, with 4,198 applications being made between January and the end of October of this year.  There were 6,760 persons in direct provision centres at the end of October.  The number of asylum seekers in hotel accommodation was 1,433 at the end of October.  The number of individuals currently residing in direct provision centres who have been granted leave to stay in the State is 778.  The average length of stay in direct provision centres, the Department says, is 22 months.  There is a chart in the correspondence, which we will publish.  The Department goes on to state the average time it takes for an application for international protection to be completed.  This was new to me, but the Department refers to the cases that were completed in October, in the last month, and seems to be saying it is shortening the procedure.  What happens is that when people arrive and present themselves at the office, they are granted accommodation on the day and then, as soon as possible, they complete the questionnaire with all the information, making their application for international protection.  It states here that for prioritised applications there will be an interview scheduled within four to five months.  For non-prioritised applications it will take nine to ten months.  Then, after the interview, it takes about two months, depending on the complexity of the case, for a decision to be recommended.  The Department is saying that the processing time during October 2019 was 15 months and for prioritised cases it was 9.6 months.  What are the criteria to be considered in determining whether an application is prioritised versus non-prioritised?  That is new to me.  I had not encountered it before.  Members can see what the Department is saying.  The figures are there and they are useful.</p> <p>  This is complemented by the next item of correspondence, No. 2560B, from the Secretary General of the Department, Aidan O'Driscoll, again providing information that we will need for our periodic report.  He refers in this short letter to the numbers in direct provision, and I have given those figures.  He states, "Because of a shortage of places in centres, there are now, as of 29th October 2019, 1,531 people are in emergency accommodation in hotels and guesthouses."  He accepts that this is highly unsatisfactory and says that some time ago the Department put an advertisement in the national media looking for such centres.  The Department further states that it held a competition on a regional basis for people to provide emergency accommodation centres - that is, accommodation through hotels and guest houses - and that, following the regional competitions, the Department is now in the mobilisation phase in the south-east, the midlands and the mid-west regions.  Accommodation for the south-west and western regions is still on the way.  For the mid-east region, which I presume includes Dublin, the closing date for submissions was 16 September and the valuation will commence shortly.  I am providing all this information just by way of an update.  The issue is very clear: because the accommodation centres are full, the Department has been trying to get emergency accommodation in various centres around the county.  These are meant to be temporary.  The Department says it could take three months, but that could be one or two years at the end of the day, depending on the numbers coming.  The Department notes it has no control over the numbers arriving in the country.  It must deal with people on the day they arrive and present at the office.</p><p>That is interesting information, some which will be in a periodic report.</p><p> Did the Deputy wish to comment on that?</p></speech>

First, I welcome the information, which is helpful, particularly to local communities.</p> <p>  On value for money, I welcome also this.  The mean length of stay is 21.75 months.  Doing a quick calculation, according to the diagram on page three of this email, more than 30% are waiting longer than two years.  It depends on how one reads figures.  According to the emergency figure, in the space of two days, there is a difference of 98 people.  These are human lives.  I welcome the email, but I do not welcome that 1,433 asylum seekers are in hotel and guest accommodation.  People seeking asylum are being put up in hotels and guest houses.  From a public accounts assessment, is that value for money, besides any human considerations, which we discuss in a different forum?</p> <p>  According to the letter then, we are told that there are 1,531 people in such accommodation.  The difference is 98 people in the two days.  Have 98 people left this accommodation provision in two days?  </p></speech>

The numbers are not overwhelming.  More than 700 people with status are in direct provision.  If the system was working efficiently, they would be out in the community and there would be 700 spaces, which would immediately halve the number in emergency accommodation.</p> <p>  On every level, this is not value for money.  This was foreseeable.  It should have been reviewed on a regular basis.  We knew the numbers, which are not overwhelming.  I want that message to go out from me.  I ask people to read the detail in those letters.</p> <p>On the restricted remit that we have in respect of value for money, this is not value for money.</p></speech>

Most of the centres are former hotels.  Some of the hotels and guest houses are solely dedicated to emergency accommodation.  There are no other people in this accommodation, although a certain number of rooms are set aside in some hotels.  Any of the centres I have encountered are dedicated solely for emergency purposes.  We need to know what is the difference in the quality of service for the people who arrive here versus the other accommodation provided.</p> <p>  The other issue I wish to mention, which I believe RT&Eacute; highlighted, is that we had a detailed discussion regarding the costs of direct provision, and it emerged long after our meeting that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had allocated part of its overseas development aid, ODA, budget towards provision for people who arrive here seeking asylum for their first 12 months here.   We were never told that and I am disappointed at the way this Department works.  The public were entitled to believe that the committee had a full, frank and complete discussion on the cost of the direct provision centres with the Department of Justice and Equality and that that was the full picture.  It transpired shortly after meeting, according to a report published by RT&Eacute;, that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade expended considerable millions of euros in recent years from the ODA budget to meet our international targets for people who come to Ireland from these countries.  The first full 12 months of their accommodation is included in the ODA budget.  They are helping people from foreign countries, even though the service is being provided here.  For the 12 months after they have been granted status the Department can also include that in the ODA budget.  We are writing immediately to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for a complete breakdown on that.  On behalf of the committee, it is disappointing that this silo mentality is operating within the Government.  We could be here talking to the Department of Justice and Equality believing that we were dealing with full picture, and it fully knew that some of the funding for the direct provision centres was coming from another Department.</p></speech>

It is clear that the process is not working and that claims are not being processed anywhere near that time.  According to the figures, 766 people have been in direct provision or emergency accommodation for three to four years, and more than 500 for four to five years.  Many of them came here looking for work and could be working, earning, and paying their taxes but, instead, they are stuck in direct provision for that duration.  Towards the end of the correspondence, as referred to by the Chairman, it states that prioritised applications take four to five months.

That will complete our discussion on this matter.</p> <p>  No. 2555 is from an individual, dated 11 November, requesting that the committee make inquiries regarding personal information collected for the public services card.  We will write to the Department to ask for details on this.  The correspondence states that there is information on debt levels, SAFE levels, quarantine, welfare profile, and relationship collection.  This person has obviously made some inquiries.  We will ask the Department for a full response to the email we have received.  We will note that but we will not publish it as it is from a private individual.  </p> <p>  Finally, we will deal with financial statements and accounts received since our most recent meeting: Housing and Sustainable and Communities Agency, clear audit opinion but non-compliant procurement - a standard letter will issue to the agency on the non-compliant procurement; Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, clear audit opinion; Broadcasting Fund, clear audit opinion; Waterways Ireland, a North-South body, clear audit opinion; export guarantee account - inactive, clear audit opinion; National Library of Ireland, clear audit opinion; and motor tax account, which is a new account, clear audit opinion.  Will the Comptroller and Auditor General explain what a new account means?</p></speech>

The subvention required from the Horse and Greyhound Fund will have to increase if that accumulation of liability is to be staved off again.  The CEO's promise to provide the report was an indication that Bord na gCon was going to change tack and become commercially viable.  The point made is relevant in that the board was not washing its face with regard to revenue streams from attendees or commercial revenue.  The bar and restaurant were the only things coming in on the right side of the ledger.  That is an important point to consider before looking at the subvention, which is substantial, for next year or the year after.</p></speech>

We are joined by Ms Helen Martin, chief executive officer; Mr. Niall Scanlon, finance manager; and Mr. Eamon O'Halloran, head of registration and projects.  We are also joined by Ms Ciara Bates, principal officer, and Mr. Kevin Power, assistant principal officer in the Department of Rural and Community Development.  It is interesting that this is the first time the authority has appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is also Ms Martin's first appearance before the committee, having been appointed to her current role last summer.  We wish her well.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and the people in the Gallery that all mobile phones must be turned off or put into airplane mode, as merely putting them into silent mode does not prevent interference with the recording system.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded that under Standing Order 186, the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p><p>While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour, they can, and should, expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

It is responsible for the regulation and protection of charitable trusts and organisations.  It has been granted a wide range of powers and duties, including the power to conduct investigations into the affairs of charities.  Under the provisions of the Act, the authority holds funds in trust on behalf of charities that wish to participate in a common investment fund controlled by the authority.  Separately, it holds the funds of charities in a charity funds account.  My audit of the authority covers two sets of financial statements: the financial statements for the normal operations of the authority and the financial statements for the charity funds account.  The common investment fund is separately accounted for and is audited by a commercial firm of auditors.  The financial statements of the common investment fund are not presented to the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  The 2018 financial statements of the authority recorded total income of &euro;3.96 million, all of which is Oireachtas grant funding.  Its expenditure in that year was &euro;3.7 million, which included staff costs of &euro;2.1 million and other administration costs of &euro;1.5 million.  The authority reported an operating surplus for the year of &euro;47,000, after appropriation of &euro;236,000 for capital purposes.  A clear audit opinion was given on the 2018 financial statements.  Certain charity funds have been lodged for safekeeping with the authority or its predecessor, the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests, and are being held pending clarification of their proper use.  These funds are held by the authority in a separate charity funds account.  The authority uses the same account, as required, to receive and transmit funds between charities and the common investment fund.  The balance on the charity funds account at the close of 2018 was &euro;1.38 million.  Most of the balance related to funds of charities being held for safekeeping.  Receipts into the fund account during 2018 amounted to just over &euro;2 million, mainly comprising dividends from the investment fund and proceeds of investment units realised at the direction of participating charities.  The charity funds account payments in 2018 mainly represented distribution of the receipts to the charities concerned.  A clear audit opinion was given on the 2018 financial statements of this account.</p></speech>

I am joined by Mr. Eamon O&rsquo;Halloran, who is the authority's head of registration and projects; and Mr. Niall Scanlon, who was recently appointed as the authority's professional accountant and finance manager.  The committee will be aware that the CRA, or Charities Regulator as it is known, was established as an independent authority on a statutory basis in October 2014 in accordance with the Charities Act 2009.  The board of the authority has 12 members and the authority has 37.5 full-time equivalent members of staff.<br/><br/>The Charities Regulator is funded by the Exchequer through a subhead of Vote 42 of the Department of Rural and Community Development.  In 2018, our budget was &euro;4.4 million and our total spend was just over &euro;4 million.  Pay accounted for approximately &euro;2.1 million of our overall spend and non-pay expenditure amounted to approximately &euro;1.9 million.  Monthly financial reports are used by senior management, by the finance, audit, risk and governance committee and by the board to monitor performance against key strategic priorities, objectives and yearly business plan targets.  We have a number of statutory functions, such as maintaining a register of charities, ensuring charity trustees comply with the 2009 Act, carrying out inquiries and investigations into the affairs of charities and issuing guidance and other codes to assist charity trustees.  We deal with applications by charities under the Charities Acts, 1961 and 1973, for services and assistance such as authorising <i>cy-pr&egrave;s</i>schemes and sales of charity lands.  When it was established, the Charities Regulator took over responsibility for administering a common investment fund scheme for charities, established under the Charities Act 1961.  The current value of this fund is approximately &euro;39.7 million.<br/><br/>Our first statement of strategy supported the establishment of the Charities Regulator and guided us through our formative years from 2016 to 2018.  Over this period, significant time was dedicated to establishing organisational structures, processes and procedures to ensure compliance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  During the period of our first statement of strategy, we developed an online public register of charities and established a contact centre for charity trustees and other members of the public to call or email us with any queries they may have.  Other key milestones during that period included the publication of a suite of practical and informative guidance materials to assist charity trustees, including guidelines on fundraising from the public, the development of a concerns unit and an online concerns process, the completion of a number of statutory investigations under the 2009 Act, the implementation of a new digital platform to support our regulatory and organisational activities, the launch of an enhanced website and a quarterly e-magazine to keep those involved in the sector updated on key developments, the formulation of a draft scheme for a charities (amendment) Bill along with associated draft accounting and reporting regulations and the launch of the charities governance code.<br/><br/>In 2019, we published our second statement of strategy, for 2019 to 2021, which aims to move us closer to realising our vision of a vibrant trusted charity sector that is valued for the public benefit it provides.  Strengthening public trust and confidence in charities is one of four strategic priorities under our second statement of strategy.</p><p>A key objective in this regard is to enhance further the public register of charities, which is a searchable online facility.</p><p> Charities are independent organisations run by charity trustees.  They play a vital role in our society and provide public benefit in diverse ways to communities in Ireland and across the world.  It is, therefore, essential that charities are transparent and accountable to volunteers, beneficiaries, employees, funders, donors and the wider public.  The register is intended as a point of reference for members of the public to learn more about individual charities.  There are currently 10,370 registered charities in Ireland and 65,904 charity trustees listed on the register.  According to research published by the Charities Regulator in 2018, the majority of charities on the register are small volunteer-led charities with income of less than &euro;50,000.  However, there is no doubt that registered charities make a significant contribution to our economy and society more generally, with income of &euro;14.5 billion, approximately 189,000 people employed in the sector and more than 300,000 volunteers.</p><p> Other general functions of the Charities Regulator include the promotion of compliance by charity trustees with their legal duties and ensuring the accountability of charities to donors, beneficiaries and the public.  In this regard, we work closely with charities, charity representative groups and other experts and stakeholders to ensure that the guidance materials that we publish are of practical assistance to those volunteering and working in the sector.  Examples include the guidelines on fundraising from the public, guidance for charity trustees, internal financial control guidelines for charities and, more recently, a governance code toolkit comprising templates and other guidance materials to underpin the charities governance code.  Promoting compliance with the charities governance code and working with charities to support them in its implementation will remain a key focus for the Charities Regulator for the period of our current strategy.</p><p> Our statutory remit also includes monitoring compliance by charitable organisations with charity law and carrying out investigations.  We actively monitor compliance with key regulatory requirements, such as the requirement for charities to submit annual reports.  Compliance rates in regard to this obligation have increased significantly over the past three years, with the overall compliance rate for annual reports due in regard to 2017 reaching 98%.</p><p> We also carry out inquiries as part of our concerns process.  In 2018, we received in excess of 686 concerns, which was an increase of 29% on the previous year.  Of the concerns received in respect of registered charities, over 50% related to internal financial controls and transparency and other governance issues.  We closed 722 concerns during 2018.</p><p> Other compliance activities in 2018 included 48 statutory directions to provide information or produce books, documents and other records for the purposes of our inquiries.  In addition, we published two inspectors&rsquo; reports into the affairs of two registered charities, GLEN and Solas&ndash;Galway Picture Palace, and we imposed intermediate sanctions on one registered charity.</p><p> Developing our compliance and enforcement function further is a key objective in terms of meeting our strategic priorities of providing proportionate risk-based regulation and protection, and promoting compliance within the sector.  Supported by our new IT platform, along with a number of important legislative amendments, which the Minister for Rural and Community Development is progressing through the charities (amendment) Bill, we hope to enhance our proactive monitoring capabilities further, using data to identify and anticipate risks to facilitate targeted and proportionate regulatory interventions and engagement with charities.  The charities (amendment) Bill is key in this regard as it will create a level playing field for all charities, including those that are companies, and will facilitate increased levels of transparency and greater accountability in regard to the finances of charities.</p><p> Since our establishment in 2014, the Charities Regulator has made significant progress in meeting its statutory mandate.  Through the hard work and commitment of the authority, its staff and those working in the charities sector, we have a strong foundation on which to build and deliver on our second statement of strategy.  We remain committed to working with all our stakeholders to fulfil our mission to regulate the charity sector in the public interest so as to ensure compliance with the law and support best practice in the governance, management and administration of charities.  I am happy to respond to any questions members of the committee might have.</p></speech>

Today, we have two sessions and we will have one lead speaker for each session, one this morning and one this afternoon, if that is agreeable.  The lead speaker this morning is Deputy Kelly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.195" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#L00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for coming in and for their opening statement.  I wish them the best of luck in their important work.  Given the number of charities, and there are those that come under two lists, that is, those that are registered and those that are not, and given the number of full-time staff in the Charities Regulator is 37.5 whole-time equivalents, does it have enough capacity to do this work?  It is a relatively new organisation and has had to develop and get structures in place.  While I believe this is a positive thing, and I do not say that regularly, it seems a small number of staff for the work it does, given there are 10,370 registered charities.</p> <p>  The Charities Regulator has had a turnover of senior staff lately.  That usually sets off alarm bells here.  Ms Martin might explain, so we can clear that up, why the three senior people left.</p> <p>  How often does the Charities Regulator liaise with the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda fraud squad, the Data Protection Commissioner and the Companies Registration Office?  Will Ms Martin give us a flavour of that in regard to meetings and interactions, what they are about and how often they take place, sharing data, investigations and so on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.196" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Martin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#L00400"><p>With regard to the number of staff, we do not have enough staff and the complement should be about 53.  However, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, we have achieved an enormous amount, although that has been on the back of the real commitment of staff and focusing our resources on where we think we can have the greatest impact.  That would be in terms of supporting charities but also, at the same time, since 2016, building up our concerns unit.  In future, when we have more staff, we will look to move into the area of more proactive monitoring, and I will come back to that later as there are certain things we require in that regard.</p> <p>  We have managed to get staff over the past year, having lost some staff.  We have a new in-house finance manager, which we did not have before as we previously used a consultant.  I wanted to bring that role in-house so that person would be reporting to me, as CEO.  We have also got our head of communications and stakeholder engagement, which is another key position we have filled since June of this year.  In addition, we have a number of positions that are obviously key and which we absolutely need to fill, such as the corporate affairs manager, and we also need more legal resources.  On the legal resources, it is a very challenging marketplace out there but we are using the different avenues available to us and working with the Department on that in regard to seeking expressions of interest for secondment of people from within the civil and public service and drawing down from past panels that are available to us.  That is very much the focus at the moment.  Another key position was filled in recent weeks when Thomas Mulholland joined us as our head of compliance and enforcement.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, the CEO moved on to become CEO of the Mental Health Commission.  Our head of compliance and enforcement moved on.  At the time, his role was graded as assistant principal and we sought to have that regraded, but unfortunately he had moved on to a promotion opportunity within the HSE.  Our head of communications and stakeholder engagement had been with us on a two-year contract and, as a result, had wanted to move on, and he moved back into the charities sector.  They were the main losses that we had.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.200" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Martin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#L00800"><p>This was in regard to our interactions with other agencies.  The main agency we interact with is Revenue, with which members of our registration team would interact.  The Deputy might be aware from our briefing material that 6,500 of the charities on our register are there because they were deemed registered at the date the register was established.</p><p>The deeming was related to the fact that on that date, they held a charitable tax exemption so, effectively, they came on to the register.  We have over 3,500 others which are what we call section 39 bodies.  They are the charities that registered with us.  As a result of the fact that we have a huge number of section 40 bodies, the ones that are deemed registered, we would deal with Revenue a lot.  Where a section 40 charity that has been deemed registered loses its charitable tax exemption through the operation of the Act, it automatically comes off the register.  We have no input into that decision.  Once a charity loses its tax exemption, it comes off the register and must try to re-register.  That is why we interact regularly with Revenue.  </p><p> In addition, we would be in contact with the Companies Registration Office regarding our IT platform and the fact that we would draw down certain materials from its website regarding the accounts of those charities that are companies.  Our compliance and enforcement team would be in contact with staff from the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement where particular issues arise, for example, if we were dealing with a company that was not keeping proper books of account.  Unfortunately, under our Act at the moment, we would not be able to proceed against such a company for breach of the Charities Act because it is a company and is carved out.  That is something we are looking to address under the charities (amendment) Bill because we believe all charities should be equally regulated by the Charities Regulator.  It means that in those situations, we have to contact the ODCE because, obviously, it is an offence not to keep proper books of account under the Companies Act.  We are reliant on the ODCE to take action in that regard.  Similarly, we would have almost daily contact with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

What kind of powers does the Charities Regulator use to ensure that the money being left in wills to various different charities does what it says on the tin, namely, goes to the right area and relevant charity and is spent in the way the person, persons or organisations intended it to be spent?  Have there ever been instances where anyone in the legal profession has had to be investigated for ignoring or not following instructions 100% regarding the leaving of money to these organisations?  What procedures has the Charities Regulator used to follow up in such scenarios?  Does it ever carry out random checks in respect of these sort of donations to make sure the money is being spent appropriately to ensure public confidence?  I see that the section on donations in its guidelines for charitable organisations states that where donations are made for a specific purpose, the donor's request is honoured.  Can Ms Martin give us confidence that this happens?</p></speech>

As part of that, there is a requirement, which is the subject of a Law Society direction, that when a charitable donation is made, a receipt must filed with us.  The solicitor and executor must confirm with the Charities Regulator that the money or the bequest has gone to the relevant person or charity it was meant to go to.  We work with the Probate Office on that.  We would receive what are known as PAS 3 forms, which are the forms that are filled out by solicitors and executors regarding charitable bequests and donations.  We have a team that would go through those.  It follows up with solicitors and executors to see if they have receipts or something they can submit regarding the particular bequest or donation.</p></speech>

We are here to help the Charities Regulator in this scenario.  From a resource point of view, the committee does periodic reports and if members believe the Charities Regulator needs more resources, we will say that plainly.

Another major issue concerns the regulations for accounting and reporting.  They are dependent on us having this change made with regard to companies.  We cannot introduce regulations to require a level of transparency with regard to finances that would only apply to unincorporated charities and would not, therefore, apply to 60% of the charities on our register.  We have to wait until this amendment comes into force before we can introduce the regulations that, for example, would introduce something like the charities statement of recommended practice or SORP.  This is a statement of recommended practice for charities that would require charities with a certain level of income to give far greater detail in their financial statements that is currently the case.</p></speech>

I agree with Ms Martin 100%.</p> <p>  I looked at the percentages showing where donations went under headings such as education, religion, benefit to the community, poverty and economic hardship.

We have been around the houses in this committee on numerous occasions with issues relating to the third level sector.  We did a specific report on it, in fact, and there is a whole quagmire of issues relating to how third level funding operates in respect of third party organisations, etc.  We hear a lot about philanthropists funding various third level organisations.  We know that Ireland Funds and various other organisations are providing funding to third level.  We have had debates where representatives of colleges and universities have come in and said they are putting a sign over a building in Cork, for example, stating that the funding came from private funds they generated themselves, whether through donations or other income.  That is complete and utter garbage because the taxpayer has to provide funding in the first place before those bodies are able to access other sources of income.</p> <p>  If the witnesses do not have the information I am seeking, we will need to come back to it another day.  I will not stop pursuing the matter because I have a deep nervousness about how these funds are being given to third level colleges, what the Charities Regulator is and is not aware of in this regard, and for what purposes the colleges are using the funds.  Are they charitable donations or are they being given for research?  Are they being given to the various alumni associations that have been set up to assist in the funding of third level institutions?  We have a figure for 2017 but we cannot break it down.  Where are we at in regard to 2018?</p></speech>

Universities are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and we now know of other sources of income.  These foundations are outside the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General but do come under the Charities Regulator.  The funding goes through these foundations and comes out the other end, so we should be able to create a whole and transparent picture of what is going through all the third level colleges.  When Ms Martin can provide us with that information, we will have a clearer view of where all that funding is going, how it is being spent and how it is being matched with taxpayers' money.  I hope Ms Martin can provide us with as much information as possible, including totals and percentages across all third level colleges, in tabular form, and a commentary on each foundation or other organisation that is in place.  All of that would be useful.</p> <p>  Has the Charities Regulator considered running a public awareness campaign in regard to its work?  As a public representative, people often tell me that they do not donate to charities other than those which are local to them because they are confident of their bona fides.  I am concerned that a lot of charities are being painted in the wrong way.  There have been issues with the sector in the past, which I will not detail today.  There are one or two organisations that stand out at a national level because they are so large and well known, such as the Irish Cancer Society.  Some charities, however, are being damaged by association with what went on in the past, and potential funds are not coming to them because of this.  Could the Charities Regulator devise some type of campaign to engage and inform people?  It will be challenging because of the range of charities in operation, but it would be helpful.  We have discovered in the past that where people were collecting on street corners for certain charitable organisations, a large percentage of the funds raised were given to the collectors and only a small percentage to the charities themselves.</p></speech>

Specifically, priority No. 4 in our current statement of strategy is all about the need to ensure there is public awareness of what the Charities Regulator does and how the sector is regulated.  There is a focus on increasing standards of governance across the sector and working with charities to highlight how they can make the most of being a registered charity.  We are currently in the middle of a Meet the Regulator roadshow.</p><p>One of the key messages we are trying to get across to charities and registered charities is that not every not-for-profit is a registered charity and that charities should be utilising their registered charity number to let people know they are regulated.  We are working very closely with the charities.  I believe there is a piece of work there and we will be focusing on that.</p></speech>

I am aware that Ms Martin is bedding down the organisation.  I have gone through the opening statement and the corporate plan and have done some research on some of the work done by the Charities Regulator.  In her opening statement, Ms Martin referred to a number of "statements of strategy".  Initially, for the period of 2016 to 2018 the regulator was bedding down organisational structures, looking at processes and procedures in order to ensure compliance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  The next part of the strategy for 2019 to 2021 will be, in Ms Martin's terms, to move "closer to realising our vision of a vibrant trusted charity sector [and] ... strengthening public trust and confidence in charities".  On that second piece of the strategy from 2019 to 2021, will Ms Martin clarify what the Charities Regulator will be looking at specifically?</p></speech>

The work is about ensuring the register has as much information as possible relating to charities in order that members of the public can check out the individual charity in which they might be interested and can see what the charity is about.  Hopefully, the public can also take some confidence that the sector is regulated.</p> <p>  We are also working with the charities on the charities' governance code.  This is a huge part of our strategic priorities over the next two years in particular when we will work with the charities on that.  This is about getting the charities to engage with the tool that is available to them, which is the charities' governance code, and to increase standards of best practice in governance.  We would hope to see that reflected in levels of trust and confidence.</p> <p>  We will be monitoring and doing our own research to establish a baseline early next year for what are the levels of trust and confidence.  The members may be aware that in 2012 it was at the highest rate, which was 74%, but it had fallen quite considerably over the last years.  In 2017 the level of trust and confidence was at 46%.  I want to ensure that we establish a baseline and then look at that in subsequent years.  In that way we can see if we can work out the impact of the work we are doing and see how it has assisted the charity sector.</p> <p>  On the other side, which is the compliance and enforcement piece, charities themselves will agree that they want to see the Charities Regulator holding charities to account when things are not being done correctly.  This is a key focus over the coming years also, and especially on the resources side.  New resources we get in over the next year certainly will be going into the compliance and enforcement area.  I have said before that one of the big things is that we would have access to the accounts of all charities and that they would be presented in a very particular way that is specific to charities.  This would give certain disclosures to charities with regard to what is suitable for them.</p></speech>

My questions will focus more on reporting and who does the reporting and how is it acted upon.  Consider an example of charity A, where the auditor finds there have been lapses in financial controls or finds some other problem or challenge.  Obviously, that would then be included in the audited report.  Does the Charities Regulator get a copy of those audited reports?</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General does an audit of a Department or an organisation that comes under his remit.  He does the audit, reports and there is an audited opinion.  If an issue arises, it is there for everybody to see.  In this situation, if one has a charity that has to carry out an audit - which they have to do - there may be a report or there has to be a report as a consequence of that, and it may well flag a problem.  If the Charities Regulator, however, does not see that audit report how does it know there is a problem?</p></speech>

Console was a real controversy.  All of us accept that the vast majority of charities do an excellent job where there are no difficulties and they provide an excellent service.  There are some, however, whether they were outliers or not, that had very serious challenges.  Console's problems were only highlighted when the HSE's internal audit looked more deeply at what was happening.  Flags had been raised, missed and not acted upon over a long period.  When they were acted upon it was the internal audit that established what was happening.  If the regulator does not have access to internal audit reports of organisations that could be flagging up some problems, then I am worried that the regulator is not across what might be happening in some charities in the way it should be.</p></speech>

If they are flagged up, then there is even more reason for the regulator to have them.  They would be in plain sight and the regulator could see them; it would not need any work done by the regulator.</p> <p>  I want to get on to the concerns process.  Ms Martin has said there is an online concerns process and a concerns unit.  It strikes me that this is based more on individuals, such as whistleblowers or service users who would perhaps highlight concerns, but this is different to actual processes where people go in to do audits and examine the financial controls that might be in place in organisations.  Earlier, I asked about an internal or external auditor who sees a problem.  Is he or she obliged to report this to the regulator or not, or is the organisation obliged to report this to the regulator?  If a problem has been flagged by the auditor to the organisation, is it then obliged to inform the regulator of the problem? Does this happen or are they obliged to do that?</p></speech>

If one considers the history of the Console issue, it went on for so long and people were trying to figure out how did it happen for so long.  It was because people were asleep at the wheel and it was not being examined in the way it should have been: credit card expenditure was off the chart; duplicate accounts were different for the same time period; and directors were also employees.  There were huge issues that were all missed but which were eventually found to be the case.  I am struggling to understand, as this happened.  There are other examples we could go into and while I do not want to spend time talking about the bad examples - as there are so many good examples of charities - we do know there was very bad practice.  This has an impact on the people who gave the money to those charities.  If the regulator is not across this, if there is no obligation on the auditor to inform the regulator that there is a difficulty, if there is no obligation on the organisation or charity itself to inform the regulator and if the regulator is not seeing the audited accounts, then I am concerned that we do not have the oversight we should have around financial governance and governance generally in charities.  When are we going to get to a point when this will be the case?</p></speech>

This is the difference between being reactive in our compliance work and being proactive in monitoring.  To have proactive monitoring, there are several elements and we have geared ourselves up for it with the new IT systems, in order we can have a system to interrogate the information we get.</p><p>First, we need amendments to the Charities Act to enable us to introduce regulations on accounting and reporting.  Once those are in place, there would be a proportionate requirement for certain standards of reporting and auditing for certain sized charities.

We also have internally generated sources, that is, situations where another regulator might contact us with a concern about a charity and we might start looking into it at that point but that would be in a minority of cases.  The cases tend to come in from the public.</p></speech>

Surely there is an obligation.  Take the HSE for example.  Some of these are section 39 organisations which have service level agreements to provide certain services.  Separately from that, if a charity was not such an organisation, it would be a charity that would be audited independently and an external audit would have to be done.  There is, however, an element of an audit for the moneys paid by the State to these organisations.  Given we have had problems with some of the section 39 organisations - I will not go through them all but I believe there was a difficulty in Harold's Cross and elsewhere - I would be surprised if at no point has the HSE or any other body approached the regulator to say it is coming across these problems and here is how those organisations were able to evade responsibility and accountability.  Going back to what Ms Martin said earlier, 2019 to 2021 is supposed to be about strengthening public trust and confidence in charities and looking at ways in which the charity sector can provide the trust that people need.  Part of that would be that the regulator learns lessons.  Whatever about any mistakes that are made, if we are not learning lessons there is a problem.  How is it the case that through all these scandals, and I gave two examples, that Ms Martin cannot tell me today she is clear that none of the organisations, whether the HSE or otherwise, has at any point alerted the regulator to any of the problems?  It is no good for Ms Martin to read about any of this in the newspaper or hearing it on the news.  What good is that to her organisation?</p></speech>

I am glad that the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned Trinity.  It decided to consolidate its accounts in the past few years; it is a new step and is an example to other universities.</p> <p>  Ms Martin has an extremely important job.  The figures she gave in her opening statement are extraordinary, with over 10,000 charities, almost 66,000 trustees and &euro;14.5 billion, not to mention almost 190,000 volunteers.  It is an extremely important area on every level, both on an economic level and on a psychological level for the work being carried out, and there is also what volunteers get out of it. </p> <p>  I will follow on from the last Deputy's concerns.  In her opening statement, Ms Martin noted "In 2018, we received ... 686 concerns, which was an increase of 29% on the previous year."  If we have learned anything in recent years, it is how difficult it is for someone to complain.  It is not in the interest of someone living here to complain, they suffer as a consequence.  That is why the processes and procedures need to be robust.  The breakdown of the figures as to where the concerns are coming from is key to help the regulator, as an organisation, to deal in a more proactive way.</p><p>We should be relying on whistleblowers and individuals to come forward as a tiny piece of the jigsaw.  The regulator is the vital piece in this and the Act is from 2009.  It is no reflection on the witnesses but it was years before the regulator became operational.  We are still waiting on amending legislation, and that is our fault.  Within this, what risk assessment has the organisation carried out to identify the areas that are suffering or exposed because the regulator does not have a full staff complement?</p></speech>

I would not put other resources into the concerns team as it exists; I would put them in the proactive monitoring piece.  We will have people in the area working with the systems to see what other information we might have while waiting for the accounting and reporting regulations to come in.</p></speech>

There was a serious problem with - I will put this as mildly as I can - the trustees&rsquo; awareness of their duties and responsibilities.  The regulator made a general finding that trustees should be ore aware of their duties and it has a role in that.  Another of the recommendations states "the Charities Regulatory Authority should consider furnishing a copy of this report as it deems relevant."

That is why we are focused on the next stage of developing the compliance and enforcement team, as well as introducing proactive monitoring.  We need certain tools to do that.  We need the information to be made available to us.  That is why we require the amendments to the Act and the accounting-reporting regulations.  To be able to do that proactive monitoring piece would be a massive move for us.  Hopefully, we would see flags and particular points in accounts where we would know there is something not right.  It would raise a flag and then we could hone in on it ourselves without anyone having to raise a concern with us.  We would be able to identify those charities ourselves.</p></speech>

There was a charity shop, Good and New, which was not keeping proper books of account.  We have the ability to impose an intermediate sanction where the contravention is publicised.  In some cases, we can remove the charity from the register for a period.  An intermediate sanction is used in a situation where there has been a breach and an offence committed under the Act in place of a prosecution.  We would see that as being more proportionate, particularly when it comes to charities.  We tend not to see charities doing things on purpose.  It tends to be an oversight or a case of simply not being informed.  We take a proportionate approach to those matters.</p></speech>

In 2017, there were discussions about the regulator providing information on who is running a charity and how donations are spent.  It provides information on the who but not on the donations.  It could provide that information if it chose to do so but it has not done so yet.  This is a matter of public concern or public interest.  People could see how charities spend their donations.  It would also help to ease the suspicion that has arisen because of the Console scandal.  If people could see where their donations were being spent they would not have those suspicions about charities.  I am surprised the regulator has not done it.</p></speech>

It is one of the reasons that in 2017 we proposed amendments to a courts and civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill and we managed to get our amendments included in the Bill.  We need further amendments to introduce standardised forms of financial reporting for all charities.  If we had those standards, we would have the detail the Deputy is speaking about.  Unfortunately, the courts and civil law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill in which our provisions were included did not go anywhere.  It has since been carved out into a separate charities (amendment) Bill which we hope will progress shortly.</p></speech>

The purpose carries the presumption of public benefit.  That is a statutory matter but there is nothing there for the advancement of human rights.  The church has better rights than Amnesty international.  I presume that would be a legislative matter.  It could possibly allow a lot of scope for bogus religions or religions that turn profits while not paying tax.  It is something that stood out for me.  Does Ms Martin have an opinion on this?

That is absolutely the case.  With regard to the advancement of religion, we receive applications from organisations that are religions but even though there is a presumption of public benefit, they go through a rigorous application process in the same way as all other types of charities.  I cannot comment on charities that are religious organisations that existed prior to our establishment.  They are also on our register but they came onto it along with thousands of other charities because they held a charitable tax exemption.  They were entitled to be deemed registered at that time.</p></speech>

It does not pay tax on the fees paid by parents.  I can only presume this is because it offers a handful of scholarships a year.

Once an organisation fulfils the charity test, ends up with a charitable tax exemption or was deemed registered back in 2014, it is on the register as a charity.  I am not aware of the particular example and whether the school was deemed registered.  I think it was deemed registered so it came onto the register automatically.  The advancement of education is a charitable purpose under the Act.</p></speech>

This is why we speak about the more than 50% that are registered charities.  We are reliant on concerns being raised.  Either we spot it or somebody comes to us having spotted it.  We will immediately try to contact the individuals concerned.</p><p>Obviously, it is an offence if it is holding itself out as a charity when it is not a registered charity.  When we follow it up, sometimes it transpires that the organisation is simply unaware that it was supposed to be registered.  Such cases are passed on to the registration team to enable the organisations in question to engage in the full registration process.</p><p> We work with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on much more difficult areas like the house-to-house collection of clothing bags by bogus charities.  When we use the contact details on the plastic bags that are provided to households, we often find that the number rings out and we cannot get through to anybody.  We intend to undertake a public awareness campaign in this area.  We previously issued a public notice to let the public know specifically about this problem.  Ultimately, the public plays a role in this area.  When people think they are donating to a charity, we want them to check the register first to make sure it is a registered charity.  We have engaged in some publicity in this regard.  Next week, we will issue some public notices to alert people to the phenomenon of bogus clothing collections.  One of the reasons bogus organisations get involved in this area is that there is money to be made.  If people were not donating bags of clothes to these organisations and were instead ensuring they donated to charities only, some of this bogus activity would be curtailed.</p></speech>

It is really important that people feel confident in this incredibly important sector.  The work of the witnesses is incredibly important from that point of view.  When I went through the list of charities, I noticed that some of them have 19th century names.  People know the names of many of the big charities, but there are also local charities like schools that crop up on the list.  The number of charities is incredibly large for the size of the country.  Perhaps this is a reflection of the fact that the charitable sector in this country is providing services that would normally be public services in some other countries.  I refer to charities like Rehab, Enable Ireland and the Irish Heart Foundation.  Some of their work is promotional.  It is understandable that they would have charitable status.  In many other countries, the services being provided by a charity like Enable Ireland would be a matter of public provision.  I think there is a gap being filled.  Some confidence was lost when attention was focused on the amounts of money being paid to the CEOs of charitable organisations.  I assume that does not come under the remit of the Charities Regulator.  At a time when the public is being very generous but is seeing very large salaries being paid to CEOs, it is very difficult to retain public confidence in this sector.  Is any guidance available in this regard?  Some of these companies are very big and need to have good personnel.  Is there any guidance on engagement with some of the bigger charities?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.503" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Martin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#T00800"><p>I can answer that more generally because it comes under the charities governance code and the whole area of private benefit.  When salaries are paid to the people involved in running charities, that is considered to be a private benefit.  The Act provides that the private benefit must be reasonable in all the circumstances, must be ancillary and must be necessary to the furthering of the public benefit that the charity entails.  We tell charities they must ensure the amounts of money they pay to members of staff should be benchmarked and should be reasonable.  They have to be reasonable and necessary.  It is obvious that a charity which provides healthcare services in the home will need nurses.  We consider that to be a private benefit which is absolutely required and is permissible under the Charities Act.  The charity would have to make sure it is benchmarked against what a nurse would be paid elsewhere.  That is where we would come across that.  People would be asking about that, and that would be our general advice in this area.</p> <p>  I would like to refer to research that has been done on salaries more generally.  We might consider a salary of more than &euro;70,000 to be a high salary for these purposes.  Research indicates that less than 1% of the workforce in the not-for-profit sector, which obviously is wider than the charitable sector, is paid more than &euro;70,000.  The relevant percentage is much higher in other areas.  I believe it is 13% in the rest of the economy.  There is certainly a perception out there.  We often see it when the results of research come back.  People want charities to be well run, but at the same time they do not think people in charities should be paid the same as they might be paid elsewhere.  Our view is that a nurse who is working in a charity should be paid the same as a nurse who is working in a hospital, if they are doing the same job.</p></speech>

We have been told that it has 37 staff on its books at the moment, but I can count 43 people on its organisational chart.  There are some vacancies as well.  The higher up the ladder one goes, the greater the proportion of vacancies.  There are vacancies for positions like head of legal affairs, regulatory lawyer and head of corporate affairs.  There are no vacancies down at the clerical officer end.  That is the point I am making.  Where would the additional staff up to the full complement of 53 fit in on the organisational chart?</p></speech>

There are certain areas we need to develop when we are talking about proactive monitoring.  They would certainly be going in there.  Ultimately, we are looking to resource the whole area of operations, IT and research as well.</p></speech>

It has been set out as a hierarchy in the organisational chart.  I am not saying that the organisation is hierarchical.  Ms Martin has spoken about teams.  I am trying to visualise how the 37 people who have been mentioned fit into these teams.  There is an overall administration as well.  The administrative staff are probably not part of one of the teams in question.  I am trying to visualise how the organisation is run.  The top two areas that are named before the chart moves on to the next tier are head of compliance and enforcement, and head of legal affairs.  Are all of the areas named there?  Will there be an additional stream that will go along with the authority's senior staff, even if they are not employed?</p></speech>

There is probably some confusion here.  At the moment, I am re-examining the organisational structure.  I can send the committee the original structure if it would like to see it.  The original structure was based on the preferred operating model.  Having gained experience over recent years, and having considered where we want to go with our strategy, my view is that we need more senior decision-makers in the organisation.  The review has not yet been completed.  That is why I do not have the updated organisational chart.</p></speech>

There are quite a number of small charities where there is an overhead to have an audit, and yet they are very small organisations and there are multiple charities in the same sector.  That can be seen in the list of charities and their functions.  Is consolidation discouraged, or if a body comes along and meets the criteria, is it automatically granted charitable status?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.522" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Martin" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#U00700"><p>Yes, once it meets the charity test.  We do not seek to control the numbers that are registering.  If people apply and meet the charity test, then they will be registered as a charity.  We take the view that charities, as was mentioned earlier, are stepping into gaps.  Particular individuals who are setting them up can perceive a gap and want to step into that.  While on the face of it, it may look like charities are very similar, sometimes when one looks behind them, for example, in the area of animal welfare, it will be found that there are very different philosophies behind those particular charities.</p></speech>

Obviously people are asked, when making a will, to think of charities and such things.  There may well be people, in some cases, who do not have family members who will follow things up, and these are the ones who will be aware.  What would it take to be proactive rather than reactive in that particular sector, because it is likely to be a growing sector?</p></speech>

We do and we will follow this up with executors.  There is a proactive element in that.  If we have received a form from the Probate Office and we have not received a receipt from a solicitor, for example, from a charity stating that they have received the money, we will follow that up, so we absolutely do follow that up.</p> <p>  One of the issues we had and that I mentioned earlier is around the whole area of paper and the fact that it was very hard to deal with the masses of paper that we were receiving.  We worked with the Probate Office and have put that whole system online now.  That will enable us to do that proactive monitoring piece more easily as we will be capturing those data at source from the solicitors or executors who are putting the forms in.  That means we can analyse that, and it will also be useful for the Probate Office down the road, when it modernises its systems.</p></speech>

It is publicly funded in terms of the building of schools and the payment of teachers.  There is an inadequate amount of money provided to run schools, hence the reason fundraising is required.  It is would come as a surprise to people and they would not think that their national school, for example, was a charity.  Does the Charities Regulator's office look at comparisons with other countries in terms of what ends up being a charity in this country as opposed to, say, our European counterparts?  Is there a remit from that point of view that the Charities Regulator's office will fulfil?</p></speech>

It was set up in the 1980s or 1990s by the then Commissioners of Charitable Bequests and Donations for Ireland.  It was set up as a means, particularly for smaller charities, to be able to invest funds and earn a return on those.  It was closed, however, by the time we took it over, and before the Charities Regulator came into being.  There are no new members in that fund now.  We did a review on what we should do with the fund, such as whether we should wind it up, and different options were considered.  The preliminary view was that we would maintain it for the moment.  We are doing a number of exercises around it.  It is quite an old fund and there is a lot of administrative work to be done around it such as data cleansing exercises, anti-money laundering, and making sure we have the right details for people, etc.  Once all of that work is done, we will continue with the review and see what the next steps are.</p></speech>

The board is responsible for the strategic direction of the Charities Regulatory Authority, CRA, and in terms of that it is how they engage with the charity sector, how they regulate it, and governance.

I must say as a member of the committee, I think that it is shocking governance, without prejudice to the wonderful expertise of the individual we are talking about.  As a matter of basic rules, to give people the peace of mind to which they are entitled, the regulated should never, while continuing to be regulated, have a seat on the board of the regulator.  I ask the Department to give the committee a formal response as to why this has happened.  It would also be useful to know how many people applied for this position and what assessment criteria was used to make the appointment.   In terms of ticking boxes of expertise and qualifications, I have no doubt but there is a fundamental flaw in what has occurred here.</p> <p>  It it ironic that Members in the Roscommon area including Deputy Eugene Murphy and Senator Leyden have raised the issue of the Cuisle centre which is a holiday resort for people with disabilities and particularly wheelchair users.  That facility is set to close.  Say in the case where, for example, the IWA is a fantastic association, and Cuisle is a particularly fantastic part of the national infrastructure for people who are wheelchair users and so on, does the regulator have any competence on issues like that where it can liaise with the charity to ask that it keep such a facility open?  Can it ask what are the problems and why such a facility is being closed?   </p></speech>

Deputy Catherine Murphy might have mentioned it.  The witnesses referred to less than 1% of people in the charitable sector being paid more than &euro;70,000.  That compares to the private sector, where 13% are paid more than &euro;70,000.  The witnesses used a nurse as an example.  I do not think that anybody would expect that a nurse who is working for a cancer charity would be on less money than a nurse in a hospital.  The concern is the pay of the people at the top.  I do not think it really answers our questions to say that less than 1% are on more than &euro;70,000.

The Charities Regulator was contacted some months ago about it.  I cannot understand the delay in stopping it.  It is still active and live.  It is still collecting money.  How long would Ms Martin expect an investigation such as this to take?  It is a little complicated if a fund has been in existence since the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s but surely it is the job of the Charities Regulator to sort out a group that is not registered but marketing itself online as a charity today.</p></speech>

There is no question that there is a charity that purports to offer professional care to people under a charitable heading when it is not a charity.  This is extremely serious.</p> <p>  What role does the Charities Regulator have in highlighting risks to the public?  What comes to mind is the financial regulator advertisement from many years ago.  What does the Charities Regulator do to highlight to the public that they could be giving money to dodgy things?  What is the role of the Charities Regulator in advertising public awareness?</p></speech>

Earlier, I mentioned that we have a campaign due out next week on clothing collection, with regard to making sure people check the register to ensure the entity is a registered charity.  This is something we regularly do.  We try to come at it from different angles depending on the number of concerns, which are very high with regard to clothing collections.  It is something on which we focused because we could see a particular risk there.  Certainly, public awareness around these issues and people checking the register is one of our key focuses.</p></speech>

We are trying to get the public to be more proactive themselves about managing who they give money to.  It is about telling people there is a facility available for them if they want to check and that they should be aware there are organisations that are registered and other organisations that are not registered.</p></speech>

It is a statutory role.  I believe that even a family member or spouse on the board would be inappropriate.

With regard to process, where a body applies to us on top of its constitution, we look for a document that sets out its principles, tenets and faith to understand what it does in terms of worship, for example, where it holds worship.  We look for a lot more information from an organisation that sets itself out for the advancement of religion than we do in some other areas where the charitable purpose might be quite clear.  This is something we are aware of and we focus on the registration side where risks might occur.</p></speech>

Many of them come from new communities, who might be of a Baptist religion, for example.  Other areas where we see growth are animal welfare charities and environmental charities and this reflects what is happening in society.  That is where we see growth.  There are people in new church organisations that may not be involved in the traditional Catholic or Church of Ireland churches.  This will occur.  The register will always reflect what is happening in society.  Whatever is happening in society will be reflected in the types of new applications we see.</p></speech>

How does the Charities Regulator assess what is on the right or wrong side?  Whose skill set is that?  It is a bit like the religion issue.  It is subjective.  If a company purports to be the greenest of them all, who assesses this?  What is the level of expertise? High level people would be needed to be able to work out whether a charity would help to save the environment or whether it is just making a few euro.</p></speech>

It pays its taxes and is not a charity, just a private hospital.  The company I mentioned, which provides bogus counselling, is pulling people away from this legitimately-run hospital and may be tax-exempt.  Does the regulator have any role in that as there may be an uneven playing field, without mentioning the quality of service?  I refer to people trying to get ahead of the game by getting charitable status and tax exemptions, thereby disadvantaging a legitimate company operating without charitable status.

To follow up on what Deputy O'Connell said, we have heard about the investment policy the NTMA set with respect to tobacco and, a year or two earlier, the armaments industry.  It has a clear policy.  I believe the Courts Service has a lot of funds invested on behalf of wards of court and it also has a policy not to invest in those areas.

Almost all the charity tests we do are legal tests so a large volume of legal advice is required in that area.  We have a requirement for three legal advisers, but we only have one at present so we are reliant on using some of our funds to get external legal advice.</p></speech>

Consultancy costs include the cost of external advice to management and exclude outsourced business as usual functions.  Can you differentiate between paying somebody on a consultancy basis and an outsourced function?  What is the difference?</p></speech>

That is where we identified that we needed in-house financial support in terms of having an accountant.  It was decided at that time to do it by way of outsourcing, that is, to get somebody in as a consultant to do it for us.</p></speech>

I was worried that it might be a large number.  The CRA has consultancy costs of &euro;388,000.  The digital platform, which was mentioned earlier, is &euro;218,000.  Page 22 refers to consultancy costs of &euro;333,000.  The digital platform is a significant element of that cost.  According to page 8, the authority capitalised &euro;212,000 of it and only charged &euro;126,000 of it to its revenue account.  How does authority decide what is capitalised and what is charged to the revenue account?</p></speech>

The capitalised element is any of the expenditure directly related to the platform and the project management fees associated with the platform.  Of the &euro;218,000 for the digital platform, we capitalised &euro;212,000 of that.  Some &euro;6,000 of that related to training, which was put directly to the income statement.</p></speech>

We have already had a meeting with the Central Statistics Office and the Economic and Social Research Institute on this topic.  They have carried out some related research which was discussed by the committee and we are very grateful to both organisations for that research and for making themselves available to the committee.</p> <p>  We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, as a permanent witness to the committee and he is joined this afternoon by Mr. Ciaran Crowe, senior auditor.  From the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment we are joined by Mr. Brian Carroll, assistant secretary, Mr. Frank Maughan, principal officer, Mr. Eamonn Confrey, principal officer, and Ms Catherine McGinty, assistant principal.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.  That means having them on airplane mode, as merely putting them on silent mode can interfere with the recording system.</p> <p>  I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  While we expect witnesses to answer questions asked by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and consideration at all times, in accordance with the witness protocol.  I invite Mr. McCarthy to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Operating under the Department's aegis, the Environmental Protection Agency monitors and reports on the level of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>  Through its EU membership and participation in various international agreements, Ireland is committed to a number of climate action targets.  While some of these have been adopted voluntarily, others are binding and there will be significant financial consequences if they are not met.  Following on from these commitments, Ireland is pursuing climate targets through a combination of carbon pricing and taxation, payment of grants and subsidies, regulation and public awareness campaigns.  These activities give rise to financial transactions but because they are spread across a wide range of State organisations, the net impact on the Exchequer finances is not readily visible.  My objective in compiling this report was to present an overview of the key current financial transactions that are related to greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>  In the context of EU climate policies, a distinction is made between greenhouse gas emissions emanating from sectors of activity subject to the EU emissions trading system, ETS, and those of all other, non-ETS, sectors.  In Ireland, economic activity subject to the ETS accounted for about 28% of emissions in 2017, which is low by comparison with the EU average.  This includes power generation, manufacturing and industrial processes.  The level of emissions allowed for each operator declines each year, and if the cap is breached, carbon credits must be purchased through an EU-wide auction system.  Revenues from the auction of credits is divided between European Union member states, which must use at least 50% of the proceeds to finance specific climate and energy programmes.  Ireland's Exchequer has benefited from such sales to the amount of &euro;367 million between 2013 and 2018.</p> <p>  Since 2013, separate targets apply to non-ETS emissions, which accounted for 72% of Ireland's output of greenhouse gases in 2017.  This includes the agriculture, transport and residential sectors.  On the basis of projections that Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions for the period 2008 to 2012 would exceed the level committed to under the Kyoto Protocol, resulting in an obligation to surrender what are referred to as carbon credits, the State spent a total of &euro;121 million on acquiring carbon credits.  Ultimately, Ireland met its emissions target for that period, but mainly due to the contraction in economic activity as a result of the banking and financial crisis.  Just over one third of the credits acquired had to be surrendered at the end of the target period.  The balance of the credits remains to assist in meeting further obligations as they arise.</p> <p>  In contrast to the first Kyoto period, the Environmental Protection Agency projects that Ireland will not meet the non-ETS emissions reduction target for the 2013 to 2020 period.  The available unused carbon credits are not expected to be sufficient to meet the resulting obligations.  The Department has estimated that the cost of purchasing additional required credits in 2020 will fall within a range of &euro;2 million to &euro;14 million, depending on the quantity of credits required and the prevailing market price.</p> <p>  In terms of renewable energy, Ireland has a mandatory target for at least 16% of gross final energy consumption to come from renewable sources by 2020.  While progress has been made in that regard, it is expected the target will not be met.  Based on the likely shortfall projected by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, the Department estimates that the future cost associated with failure to achieve the target could be in the order of &euro;110 million.  Against a targeted improvement of 20% in energy efficiency by 2020, the latest projections indicate that the actual increase will be around 16%.  However, as the energy efficiency target is non-binding, there is no direct financial penalty for failing to achieve it.</p> <p>  Carbon tax is one of a number of environmental taxes based on the consumption of fossil fuels.  While other fuel-related taxes were introduced for revenue raising purposes, carbon tax is intended to have a disincentive effect on the consumption of such fuels by raising prices.  Exchequer receipts of carbon taxes in 2018 amounted to around &euro;431 million.</p> <p>  A range of State bodies are incurring substantial climate-related expenditure.  At the same time, the State is receiving significant income in the form of environmental tax receipts and revenue from the auction of emission allowances.  However, there is currently no comprehensive national account to capture this income and expenditure.  Even in individual accounts where climate-related transactions are recorded, there is little transparency.  The report concludes that it would be timely for relevant Accounting Officers to consider including additional information and disclosures on climate change initiatives in the statutory accounts they produce.</p></speech>

The chapter examines transactions associated with Ireland's participation in the EU emissions trading system and purchases of credits by the State for compliance with Ireland's commitments under the Kyoto Protocol between 2008 and 2012, and the EU effort sharing decision, which spans the period 2013 to 2020.  The report also briefly examines the revenues accruing to date from carbon tax.  The report notes that a total of &euro;121 million has been spent to date on the purchases of credits for Kyoto Protocol and effort sharing decision compliance, with a further amount of between &euro;2 million and &euro;13 million expected to be required to meet the costs of purchasing further credits for compliance with the effort sharing decision.  The report also examines the costs of compliance with Ireland's renewable energy targets for 2020.</p> <p>  The report does not examine other transactions or expenditure associated with the implementation of climate change policies, whether in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment or elsewhere.</p><p>The report recommends that accurate and comprehensive information on relevant costs, including costs of abatement measures and carbon credit purchases, and incomes, including auction revenues and tax yields, would assist in informing future decisions on climate change initiatives and notes that, in budget 2019, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform indicated his intention to introduce a green budgeting framework with the aim of embedding climate change in the budgetary process.  Implementation of this framework offers the opportunity to develop a comprehensive national account capturing income and expenditure relating to climate change initiatives.<br/><br/>The Department also notes and welcomes the recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General regarding the provision of additional information on climate change related policies and measures in the statutory accounts of Departments.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment supports this recommendation which it considers will help to improve both the transparency as well as the robustness of evaluation of climate change policies across all Departments.<br/><br/>The Government published its climate action plan on 17 June.  The plan sets out, for the first time and on the basis on the best available evidence, the measures that are required to meet our 2030 targets, with the burden shared across all sectors.  The plan will also put us on the right trajectory towards net zero emissions target by 2050. <br/><br/>In respect of the of the Comptroller and Auditor General report's assessment of the distance to target for 2030 compliance, presented in figure 9.11, it is important to note that the report uses EPA projections that do not yet take into account the impact of the climate action plan.  The EPA is currently updating these figures as part of finalising the national energy and climate plan, for submission by the Minister to the European Commission by the end of 2019.<br/><br/>The climate action plan contains a strong focus on governance and accountability, including a commitment to publish progress reports quarterly.  The first such progress report, launched at the end of October, shows that 85%, or 149, of the actions due for delivery in quarters 2 and 3 of this year have been delivered, with the remaining in progress and due for delivery by the end of the year.<br/><br/><b></b>At the end of September, there was approximately 4,100 MW of renewable generation capacity connected to the national grid.  Of this, wind generation accounted for over 3,800 MW.  The most significant progress towards our 2020 renewable energy targets has been made in renewable electricity and we expect to be at or very close to the 40% sub-sectoral target for renewable electricity by 2020.  In the transport sector, we expect to achieve over 9% of the 10% target primarily due to the biofuels obligation scheme with electric vehicles also making a contribution.  The target in renewable heat is more difficult due in part to our dispersed population and our reliance on fossil fuels for a large share of our domestic heating.  The support scheme for renewable heat and supports for the roll-out of heat pumps under the national development plan are important measures to help us close the gap to target.<br/><br/>The fact remains that we are projected to have a shortfall to the renewable targets of approximately 3 percentage points based on analysis by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.  Ireland will not be alone in falling short of our 2020 targets and there are compliance mechanisms available to us, known as statistical transfers, to enable us to purchase compliance.  The cost of purchasing statistical transfers should any potential shortfall in Ireland's target arise has yet to be established and will depend on a number of factors, particularly the availability of supply and market costs.  The focus of the Department is on maximising renewable energy in our energy mix by 2020 and on implementation of the comprehensive actions set out in the climate action plan that will enable our transition to a low-carbon economy.</p></speech>

We will figure it out in 2020.  It appears that we will not meet the 20% energy efficiency in respect of the 2020 target and that the actual figure will be in the region of 16%.  Those are the figures in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, the global figures under the Paris Agreement and the targets we have to meet by 2030.  We had representatives of other Department and other organisations before the committee and it appears we will not meet those targets either.  We are not in a good place in the context of reaching targets we either set for ourselves or to which we have signed up.  Will Mr. Carroll agree that would be a fair comment to make?</p></speech>

I mentioned the projections in the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s chapter for 2030 are based on EPA analysis, which had not incorporated the measures included in the climate action plan published earlier this year.  When we were putting the climate action plan together it was based on analysis to bring forward the most cost-effective measures to ensure that we meet our 2030 target.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.894" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#NN01900"><p>There is a new climate action plan in place but before it came into being, the reality, as per the facts presented by the Comptroller and Auditor General, is that the State is failing to meet all the targets set out in his report.  Unless drastic changes occur as a consequence of implementing the climate action plan, and we do not know what that will mean, the assumption from representatives of organisations which came before us is that it is unlikely we will reach the targets we have set ourselves for 2030.  A problem I have with this, and I said this to the representatives of the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Central Statistics Office when they appeared before the committee, is that when we push a target out  for that length of time and have such a target for 2030, a representative appearing before the committee today in 2019 or in 2020 or in 2021 can say what will be done down the road might get us to 2030 target.  However, Mr. Carroll will possibly have left his position by that time and somebody else will most likely be telling the person in my seat, if I am not here, that we have not reached our targets.  The problem is that while we have long-term targets, we do not have short to medium term ones to allow us to properly assess what is and is not being achieved.</p></speech>

The first carbon budgets are to be in place from 2021 to 2025, 2026 to 2030 and 2031 to 2035.  There will be a role for the Climate Change Advisory Council on advising Government on an economy-wide basis what those five-year carbon budgets should be.  It will then be the responsibility of the Minister to recommend to Government and the Oireachtas the acceptance of those budgets and the division of them on a sectoral basis.  They will provide annual ceilings that sectors will have to remain under in order to meet the climate obligations.</p></speech>

This committee carries out look-back exercises in respect of previous year, two years, three years or five years.  Today, we can  benchmark Mr. Carroll's Department and the State against targets they set themselves five years, ten years or two years ago.  Leaving aside what might happen in the future, I accept that there is a new climate action plan and that there will be more scrutiny and more targets set for each line Department.</p><p>I sit on the committee which will be responsible for scrutinising the Department so that is a step forward.  In terms of what has gone before us, however, is it fair to say that we have been in a position where we have not reached the targets that we either set ourselves or were set for us as part of overall agreements?</p></speech>

There will be a shortfall in terms of our emissions target to 2020.  We are expected to reduce our emissions by 5% to 6% relative to the target set.  In terms of renewable energy, as reported by the Comptroller and Auditor General, we had a 16% target for renewable energy.  We will hit 13% on that.  If that is broken down as a 40% target for renewable electricity, we have made very strong progress on renewable electricity and may get close to the 40%.</p> <p>  On transport, it was a 10% target.  We are predicting we will hit 9% out of the 10%.  The area that is most problematic is the renewable heat component of the target.  Our disbursed settlement pattern and the associated challenges with that is probably the reason we are finding it more difficult on the renewable heat target.  There are ambitious targets in the climate action plan to retrofit 500,000 houses by 2030 and to install 400,000 heat pumps, which is a technology that is suitable for disbursed settlement patterns and in shifting them towards renewable heat.</p></speech>

We all want to make sure that we reach our targets and we are all focused on making sure that climate action means action and that we reach the targets we set.  We have to be honest, however, and say that up to now we have not and in many areas we are lagging behind.  Mr. Carroll talked about retrofit.  The Taoiseach is at an international conference today and he spoke about a &euro;50 billion retrofit.  That is how much it will cost to retrofit every home in the country.  Is it possible to retrofit every home in the country?</p></speech>

The figure the Taoiseach was quoting was an investment figure out to 2050 based on today's cost.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.901" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#OO00500"><p>That is my point.  It is easy to throw out those figures and say that we will do something by 2050.  Let us come back to planet earth.  In reality, will we be in a position in 2050 where we will have spent &euro;50 billion on retrofitting homes?  That is what drives people mad because they want to engage and want to be able to make the changes.  People whose homes are heated by oil or gas are listening to this discussion and they are the ones who are subject to carbon tax increases, which I will get to shortly.  When we say that by 2050 we will have spent &euro;50 billion on deep retrofit or retrofitting people's homes, is that a credible objective for the State to set itself in terms of whether it can be met?  If it can be met, where will the money come from to pay for it?  Will it be on the households?  Will the State, or homeowners, have to borrow?  I cannot see &euro;50 billion being spent by the State on retrofitting homes by 2050.  I might be wrong, and Mr. Carroll might be able to correct me on that.</p></speech>

The &euro;50 billion is based on today's costs.  It is the total investment required, not distinguishing between what the State, and the private sector, might contribute.  That is the first important distinction to make.  The second is that in the climate action plan there is a new model of retrofitting to be brought forward where we are seeking to aggregate groups of houses and, through aggregation, achieve economies of scale.  The expectation would be that over time the costs of retrofitting houses will fall.</p></speech>

How many people that we represent have that kind of money to spend on deep retrofit?  If we are making schemes available to deep retrofit homes, let us not do it for the people with the deepest pockets who can afford to deep retrofit and then have all of the benefits that come from energy efficiency.  When carbon taxes increase they benefit, but the vast majority of people who do not have the money do not get any State supports to enable them to retrofit are the ones who lose out.</p> <p>  I will come to carbon tax.  The Comptroller and Auditor General rightly said that the Exchequer collected &euro;431 million in 2018 but &euro;3.35 billion was collected since the carbon tax was introduced.  If he can, will Mr. Carroll tell me on what that &euro;3.35 billion was spent?</p></speech>

I am not in a position, in terms of carbon tax receipts to date, to explain where that money was spent.  What I can say is that in terms of increases in the carbon tax expenditure, and the first was in the budget of this year - it was a &euro;6 increase - the money generated by that increase is very clearly ring-fenced for climate action activity.  The figure was &euro;90 million in total for next year.  That is broken down in terms of protecting the vulnerable, with &euro;21 million towards the fuel allowance; efficiency upgrades, &euro;13 million; &euro;20 million for the midlands to retrofit social housing; &euro;5 million for peatlands rehabilitation; and &euro;6 million for the Just Transition Fund.  There are other allocations for greenways: urban cycling, &euro;9 million; electric vehicles, &euro;8 million; further investment in electric vehicle, EV, charging infrastructure, &euro;3 million; the Green Climate Fund for overseas development aid, &euro;2 million; and green agricultural pilot schemes, &euro;3 million.  The &euro;90 million that is coming from the &euro;6 increase is fully accounted for in terms of climate mitigation expenditure.  Prior to the increase this year, receipts went into general revenue receipts and formed part of the general expenditure base.</p></speech>

He is coming into this committee and giving us what is the Government and the Department line.  Here is the reality.  The money is still going into general Government expenditure.  There is no hypothecating of any money and there is no ring-fencing.  Mr. Carroll can give us many line items that might be in any particular budget and say that is because we increased the carbon tax but the headline figure of &euro;3.35 billion was raised from households, businesses and working families, in terms of carbon taxes, since 2010.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Department of Finance, whose representatives are here, are unable to tell us on what that money was spent.  What we do know is that last year, carbon emissions did not go down.  Is it correct that they increased slightly?</p></speech>

Agriculture, and another area, was up.  We have taken &euro;3.3 billion out of people's pockets.  It has gone into general Government expenditure.  It was not spent on enabling people to make a transition to reduce their carbon footprint.  Mr. Carroll is now telling us that will happen with only the surplus of what the increase will be, not the overall figure.  What is projected to come in on carbon taxes in 2020?  I am not just asking about the increase but the overall figure.</p></speech>

After the previous two meetings, we thought we would have had this information.  We understand that sectoral committees and other committees will be looking at the future plans.</p></speech>

The increase of &euro;6 per tonne will be applied to petrol and auto diesel from midnight on 8 October and to all other fuels on 1 May 2020, so presumably whatever is generated in 2020 is not the full impact of it.  That could explain at least some of the discrepancy.</p></speech>

Why is that entire amount not ring-fenced for climate action measures if it is so urgent?  The Department is telling us there is a climate action plan and that we are going to get better at reaching our targets, yet all it has done is tell us that &euro;70 million is ring-fenced.  I will deal shortly with the issue of the money that is ring-fenced and also the midlands issue.  We had the trade unions before the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment recently and they were quite critical of the Government, Bord na M&oacute;na and ESB response to just transition.  Why is the entire take for next year not ring-fenced?  If climate action is so important, which it is, why is only the increase ring-fenced?</p></speech>

We are talking about just transition.  At an international conference the Taoiseach said that deep retrofitting will cost &euro;50 billion by 2050.  We have major problems with public transport in rural Ireland and in all of the regional cities outside of Dublin, such as Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway, and many rural towns and villages have no public transport, and the Department is telling us it will ring-fence &euro;70 million.  Whoop-de-doo, &euro;70 million of the carbon tax will be ring-fenced for climate action measures.  Does Mr. Carroll see that as a woefully unambitious target for the Department to set itself?</p></speech>

I was trying to explain where the incremental piece of carbon tax was going.  I know the Deputy is very focused on the &euro;431 million that was received but, in terms of a breakdown of expenditure for next year-----</p></speech>

It is nonsense to come in here and say the Department is ring-fencing money when, in reality, it is not.  Yes, investments are being made but the Department is increasing the carbon tax on households, many of which do not have the ability to make the changes they need and want to make.  Rather than enabling them to make the changes, what the Department and the Government has done is increase the carbon tax this year and they say they will increase it for the next number of years.  At the same time, they have a very unambitious plan to provide people with the alternatives that will allow them to make the behavioural changes they need to make.</p></speech>

On budget day, the estimate was that over the period to 2030, that would amount to an additional &euro;5 billion.  That is a very significant increase in expenditure over and above what is in the national development plan in the period out to 2030.</p> <p>  I will come back to carbon tax.  A point I wanted to come back to was in terms of helping those who are poorer in the transition.  We have a warmer homes scheme for people on lower incomes and that funds 100% of the retrofit in homes of people who are poor.  It as a scheme run by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland.</p></speech>

This is more of the nonsense.  Those people Mr. Carroll is talking about have their homes heated by oil or gas.  If an increase is put on their oil or gas, although insulation can be put in their homes and that is fine, they are still using oil and gas, and what the Department is doing is increasing the cost for them.  It is not allowing them to transform their home into one that has an electric heat pump, for example, or some alternative and it is going to take an awful long time for us to get to that position.  It is just increasing the carbon tax on them, not just this year, but next year, the year after and the year after that.</p> <p>  I have a question on the just transition, which is important.  We had the trade unions before the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment recently and Patricia King headed a delegation of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  She was scathing in her criticism of the Department, the Government, Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB.  Two plants were closed and no just transition has been put in place.  Ms King feels many of the workers will lose their jobs without any transition being in place.  Bord na M&oacute;na has refused even to engage with the unions and is refusing to engage with the just transition forum that the Government says is going to be put in place.  An announcement was made prematurely to close the two ESB plants in question and three Government Ministers scrambled down to the midlands to talk to the workers.</p> <p>  Mr. Carroll talked earlier about the &euro;70 million that will come from the carbon tax increase in a full year.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might be right that it may not be &euro;70 million next year but we will see what that figure is.  Mr. Carroll talked about the money for the midlands that is being made available for retrofitting.  There is no retrofit plan in place.  They are still looking at the detail of it and trying to work out what that will mean.  The Department does not have a plan for those workers.</p> <p>  We all knew a just transition was necessary.  We all knew for years that those plants were going to have to close and that there had to be plans in place.  Yet, here we are, already prematurely closing some of the plants, when the trade unions who represent the workers say the just transition has been a farce.  A just transition commissioner is being appointed who does not have any remit in regard to workers - none whatsoever.  Is that not correct?  Ms King was quite critical of that as well.  How is it the case, when we have workers potentially losing their jobs, that the most senior trade union leader in the country can say Bord na M&oacute;na is refusing to engage with the unions and is involved in de-unionising the company?</p></speech>

To go back to the Deputy's earlier point on the fuel poor and the impact of the carbon tax on them, it is important to note that more than one third of the funds raised by the increased carbon tax are devoted to ensuring the least well-off are protected.  This is being done through two measures, first, increasing the fuel allowance by &euro;2 per week, which applies from 1 January and means an annual benefit of &euro;56, and-----</p></speech>

I know Mr. Carroll is trying to give the response.  Does he not hear the madness of that response?  The whole logic of increasing the carbon tax, from the Government perspective, is to change people's behaviour.  Now, Mr. Carroll is saying it will just increase the fuel allowance, so they do not use any less fuel or any less carbon.  That is the madness of this.</p></speech>

It is not being done in isolation.  There are also schemes available which will be rolled out over time and are currently being implemented, such as the warmer homes scheme, where 100% of the retrofitting of housing is funded.  We cannot do everybody's house at once so, if we raise carbon tax, it is important to make sure the fuel allowance is the mechanism which-----</p></speech>

I remember several years ago starting to ask about ring-fencing carbon taxes, which I did on numerous occasions.  I was told we did not do hypothecation.  I think that was the terminology used.  There was much emphasis put on that because it was about changing behaviour.  The &euro;90 million was about changing behaviour.  However, I am thinking of the totality of the &euro;431 million in addition to the &euro;90 million that people are paying in carbon taxes.  Would Mr. Carroll not agree?  If it is not ring-fenced for that, is it not just another stream of revenue?</p></speech>

Individuals do not have a choice.  The big choices are about how electricity is to be generated.  Probably the only choice people can make is how they move around - whether to use public transport as opposed to a car.  They can use less energy but they cannot choose the type of energy that comes into their home.  There is a limited choice on that.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right that people have choice around whether they use public transport or travel in a car.  People have choice as to whether they insulate their house.  People have choice as to how they heat their homes as well.</p></speech>

That is the basic principle underlying carbon tax as a pricing mechanism.  The Deputy is talking about the bulk of carbon tax and asking why that is not ring-fenced.  On how money is being spent, to pick one thing, in 2014 we spent &euro;54 million on retrofitting houses.  Again in 2016-----</p></speech>

If we are spending all that money on changing behaviour and mitigation, we must be lousy at it because we are missing our targets.  It seems like a sizable amount of money.  Some of it is spent on purchasing credits, although not that much.  It would help if we could see the balance sheet.  If they are spending money, people will want to know what they are getting for it.  They have a right to see that.  There is a lack of transparency and I think Mr. Carroll accepts that.  A lot of schemes were promised, for example, the pay as you save scheme for utilities.  That was to meet the need of people who were unable to come up with a large chunk of money by allowing them to do the retrofit themselves and then save it in their utility bills later.  That was announced to great fanfare during the previous Government and it was never rolled out.  I recall investment in wave energy, although it was not enough.  Wavebob is one example that comes to mind.  We spent something like &euro;10 million or &euro;12 million on that and then decided not to continue the investment.  A Scottish counterpart agency took the investment we had made a stage further.</p> <p>  There are many positives in terms of our location and the generation of wind energy.  I want to be positive about it.  We could do much that is positive in this area but it seems like we are buying ourselves out of things.  There is a terrible lack of leadership.  It is a case of just trying to stay compliant or trying to avoid have to pay large amounts for non-compliance.  Positive things could come out of that very large amount of money that was collected.  We could not only meet the targets but be leaders in this area.  That is really frustrating.  Maybe Mr. Carroll might address some of those issues such as where the pay as you save scheme went and why we did not continue investment in wave energy, where we have a huge natural advantage.  I know it is developed as wind energy but it is getting there.</p></speech>

One thing that impacted quite severely on our capacity to meet our 2020 target was the economic downturn in terms of having the resources available to make the types of investments needed.  Those resources were not available over the period of the economic downturn.  In terms of retrofitting, the first thing to say is that we are not unique.  These are difficult problems to solve and it is difficult to design policies that will work.  The UK tried a green deal but it did not work there.  There is a task force in the Department at the moment following on from the climate action plan that is trying to design an aggregation model, which I mentioned earlier.  The idea is to group houses together, achieve economies of scale in retrofitting them, and also to find innovative financing mechanisms such as low interest, low cost loans that will enable people to finance the retrofitting and avail of the savings they will make on their energy bills.  For those who are in fuel poverty, we have schemes where we 100% fund the retrofitting of their homes.</p><p>They are not asked to pay any money.</p></speech>

I was involved in that area around the time of Wavebob.  We have a great resource on the west coast but, as yet, there is no settled technology for harnessing wave energy.  I visited a wave test site in the north of Scotland while I was working in the area.  Six or seven radically different looking devices were being tested.  Sometimes one tests a device and brings it to a certain point and it will not work.  Nobody has made a breakthrough in that regard.  It is an area in which we are still working.</p></speech>

There are supports through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and the prototype development fund which is designed to try to bring some of those technologies forward.  The Deputy is correct in terms of the scale of we need to reach.  The west coast generally, particularly in the context of offshore winds and larger wind turbines, is ripe for that but it will take time because conditions there are quite challenging in terms of water depth and so on.  A significant amount of Government funding has been invested in test site infrastructure through successive years.  We have wave-testing pools in Cork and quarter-scale facilities in Galway and we are moving to a full-scale test facility off the coast of County Mayo.</p></speech>

The picture has become overly complicated.  We need to decarbonise and there are many initiatives for so doing.  I have concerns based on our most recent meetings with the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Central Statistics Office regarding the way the system is divided and Ireland's place in it.  When one breaks it down, the emissions trading system is heavily weighted.  Some 72% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are categorised as non-ETS emissions.  A third of that 72% is agriculture based.  Ireland seems to be overly negatively affected by the European method of calculating or quantifying emissions because of our dependency on agricultural and the amount of food we export.  Some 90% of agricultural product is exported.  What are the witnesses' views in that regard?  Is there an uneven playing field?  Big industry has significant power in this area.  The two ESRI representatives who appeared before the committee stated that once one's profit margin is sufficient to buy one's way out, one can pollute as much as one wishes.  I do not need to explain this to the witnesses.  If one's margin is big enough, one can pay the carbon bill.  That goes completely against the aim of reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere and keeping as much of it in the ground as possible.  Has Ireland been given a raw deal in this regard?</p></speech>

Companies choose whether to mitigate or buy their way out.  That is what I meant by "potential".  The ETS is a cap and trade system on an EU-wide basis.  Its objective is to achieve decarbonisation within the EU.  One way or another, decarbonisation happens somewhere.  If a company in a particular jurisdiction chooses to buy its way out, that does not mean that the overall target for the ETS in the EU will not be met.</p></speech>

I am referring to everyday people eating, dressing themselves to stay warm and going places.  It is very difficult to bring people with one if there is a possibility that a company, through whatever it is producing, can pollute continually and buy its way out.  Deputy Cullinane mentioned somewhere in Waterford the last time.  There are those who do not have the capacity to change their behaviour because there is no alternative available to them.  It is going to be very difficult to bring people with us.  The whole point is carbon reduction and decarbonisation.  People get that because it is not that complicated.  If the Department is telling people to invest in and retrofit their homes, walk to work or buy an electric car while big industry is pumping out carbon, albeit in a way that it is balancing out somewhere else globally, it will be very hard to sell to average people just trying to go about their daily lives.  There is not so much choice available to average people.</p><p>With regard to the retrofitting, the scene in an urban area is completely different from that in a rural area.  I am originally from a very rural part of Ireland.  There are many people in homes around my family home that would have regarded the getting in of oil-based central heating as being progressive recent years.  They would have moved from turf or wood.  I refer to heavy-duty fossil fuel burning.  I just do not see how we can convince somebody who is perhaps of retirement age and who might be considering her life expectancy and saying she could be around for another week or 30 years.  The position is very different in terms of getting loans to retrofit homes.  With regard to the suitability of many rural dwellings, many have lime-based mortar and stone bases that cannot be wrapped in insulation.  There are considerable barriers if those in rural Ireland are to apply the same rules as would apply in urban Ireland.  Insulation pads cannot just be put on the outside and inside of stone walls.  Heat pumps cost a huge amount of money and require maintenance every year.  I just cannot see how older people would buy into the idea of investing in this.  Practically, the Department is missing a trick here.  I can understand the thinking on modern homes and people building new homes but I believe older people in rural areas with homes that will never be suited to standard retrofitting or standard heat pumps will be very much left behind because there is nothing they can do - other than knock the house and start again - to change their behaviour and reduce their bills.</p><p>With regard to the increase in the fuel allowance to mitigate against the carbon tax, I agree with Deputy Cullinane.  We are back to the point I made at the start.  We have to be reducing carbon emissions.  If we are subventing the use of carbon to balance against tax, it seems like a style of economics equivalent to moving deckchairs around the <i>Titanic</i>.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right in that there are certain groups of people and certain houses that are more challenging than others.  Retrofitting the entire housing stock is a project that is to take place over 31 years.  We have made a start.  We have targeted 500,000 to be retrofitted by 2030.  This will happen in a series of waves over the coming decades.</p> <p>  I did not make a note of the point the Deputy made at the end.</p></speech>

That is not to be looked at in isolation.  That is a policy measure to make sure poor people are not worse off.  There are further supports being brought forward in terms of the warmer homes scheme, which funds the retrofitting of homes in the order of 100%.  We cannot get to everyone at once with this.  We have to make sure it does not disadvantage poorer people in the meantime.  That is the intent.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.979" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2019112100002#SS01200"><p>When calculating greenhouse gas emissions, methane, a by-product of agriculture, is considered to be 25 times more warming than carbon.  It does not seem to have been taken into account that the effect of carbon is cumulative.  Carbon gathers in the atmosphere whereas methane breaks down within a 12-year cycle period.  Therefore, the effect of methane is not cumulative.  I cannot find anything in the documentation from the Department, the ESRI or the CSO that brings in a variable to take into account the fact that the methane cycle is a cycle within the carbon cycle.  I brought this up with the ESRI and the CSO representatives when they were before us.  My point is that there is over-calculation of the impact of agriculture on the carbon footprint of Ireland because methane, although it is considered to be 25 times more warming than carbon, is constantly on the move and constantly breaking down.</p> <p>  The British Veterinary Association has done some work on this.  New Zealand, which has a similar agricultural profile to ours and the same type of grassland, has recently brought in a variable to account for this.  It would be in the interest of heavily agriculture-based economies to examine this area.  It appears to me that agriculture is being unfairly blamed based on an over-calculation of the contribution of methane to warming overall.  Does anybody know anything about this?</p></speech>

The current national policy position is to have an 80% reduction in carbon emissions from the energy system.  That is the policy position the Government agreed in 2014.  An approach to carbon neutrality in agriculture was agreed.  Within the policy position, we already have differential treatment in respect of agriculture.  I also mentioned that the European Commission recognised the limited mitigation potential of agriculture in 2014 and the importance of food security.  With regard to framing longer-term targets, all those factors will have to be taken into consideration.</p></speech>

The global warming potential of methane from agriculture is regarded as 25 times greater than that of regular carbon.</p><p>To my mind that is just scientifically incorrect because if we got rid of all methane-producing farm animals - we obviously cannot - in 12 years' time we would have much less methane.  However, with carbon, it just continues to build up.  Methane breaks down.  Agriculture is being unfairly targeted and I wonder why.  Is it that there were not strong enough voices at the table when it came to fighting for agriculture over heavily polluting industries?</p><p> Food security and sustainable production is fundamental to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, programme.  It is not just about writing cheques.  It is obviously key to us all eating and surviving.  There seems to be an imbalance in the approach to agriculture versus heavily polluting industry.  I just do not think Ireland is being represented.  If Mr. Carroll does not know about it, clearly there has not been much contact in terms of the New Zealand approach now and the British Veterinary Association's approach.  Are we not looking to other countries with a large agriculture industry?  We are very lucky to have a large agricultural industry because we have many people minding our environment in rural areas.  We are not really doing them justice with our actions.</p></speech>

It is not that we are ignoring it or not trying to delve into it to see, in terms of understanding it, the implications of how we frame things in relation to agriculture going forward.</p></speech>

It is ultimately carbon but initially biomethane.  While some report recommended culling and reducing herd numbers, different approaches can be used to reach the same goal, such as healthier animals producing as much food, vaccinated animals, producing a calf within the optimum period and ensuring they are not sick or dying in the middle of having a calf.  We need to maintain efficiency within agriculture.  We are number one in dairy and number five in beef genomics.  When we consider the major part of agriculture in our overall industry and the importance of agricultural exports for the economy, I am not sure if the current policy direction is fair to agriculture.</p></speech>

The climate action plan focuses on three things in terms of agriculture.  The first the Deputy talked about and that is increasing agricultural efficiency and farm efficiency to reduce emissions.  The second is the role of land use, land-use change and so on and the creation of carbon sinks.  The third piece is agricultural waste to energy.  It is on those three pillars that the climate action plan is based and solely those three pillars.</p></speech>

The debate on the budget for 2020 focused on where the small additional amount of the carbon tax we collect next year over this year will be spent.  Ring-fencing can mean anything or nothing from a legal point of view.  Can Mr. Carroll guarantee today that the amount collected in carbon tax next year will be spent on climate change initiatives?  We can only talk about the increase.</p></speech>

I do not have those accumulated figures with me today.</p></speech>

Either in 2012 a figure was produced showing it for the previous year or at this stage the Department is going to try to assemble the figures in retrospect to show us.  They were either documented at the time or they were not.  I am not talking about the Department now trying to invent something justifying it seven years on where we have collected and have it.  Was it documented?  Can Mr. Carroll give me a document today showing where the carbon tax collected in 2010 was specifically spent?  Does that document exist?</p></speech>

In the first instance the raising of tax and expenditure are matters for the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  What I am saying is that up to this year, carbon tax receipts went into just general tax revenue.</p></speech>

It is not a question of me suggesting that I can retrospectively construct some link between carbon tax to date and how it was spent.  It went into general tax receipts.  I can say at the same time that significant amounts of money were being spent through various Votes on climate action.

I have seen nothing yet to say that the extra &euro;90 million will not go into the same account again.

Effectively, what has been shown there is the amount that was received from ETS auctions each year.  What it is reporting is sufficient spending in other areas that make up the equivalent of that.  It is not working in the way a hypothecated tax is supposed to work, which is that one raises "X" amount and demonstrates how that amount was used.  If moneys go into the Central Fund of the Exchequer, they are funding everything the Central Fund of the Exchequer is funding and spending that is being done separately is just an account of spending that is being done separately.</p></speech>

There is a footnote stating that a European Commission report from 2017 entitled "Analysis of the use of Auction Revenues by the Member States" noted that Ireland is one of the ten member states where revenue raised through the auction of allowances is not earmarked or ring fenced in its budget and that along with the other nine member states, Ireland was also deemed to provide a low level of detail on the application of revenue to projects aimed at reducing emissions.  That is why we are here.  We want to get to the point where we are not in the bottom league within the EU when it comes to accounting for it.  That was stated by the EU two and a half years ago and we are here today not having advanced an awful lot since then.  This is all we want to achieve.</p> <p>  In respect of the &euro;570 million that was collected in 2018, the &euro;440 million collected in carbon tax was read out.  We also received &euro;140 million in receipts from the emissions trading scheme.  We want to bring the public with us.  This is the message I am bringing back.  We want to bring the public on the right road on this.  I am putting the responsibility on the Department as the lead Department in respect of climate change.  Revenue will appear before us next week when we can ask it about the revenue and we can talk to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is the one deemed to be the climate change Department.  All I am saying is that the public gets very cynical when it is told that &euro;570 million was received in 2018 and we cannot document that it went on climate change initiatives.  It would make the job of bringing the public around to the idea of an extra tax a whole lot easier if it could be assured that not just a marginal increase in tax but all of the carbon tax was going on climate change initiatives.  People would buy into it but when they see that it is just a wheeze and that we are collecting carbon tax but will not really show how it is being spent, it damages the national effort to bring people around on this issue.  I worry that it could lead to a backlash against a carbon tax.  We saw it with water charges because people just saw them as a mechanism for collecting money and paying for meters.  They did not necessarily see them as improving the water infrastructure because they were not connected.  One was just to collect money and pay for the installation of meters to a large extent.  The people will have a difficulty with the carbon tax.  We want all this to be clear, transparent and upfront so that if the public is told next year that &euro;500 million is being collected, it knows it will be spent on climate change initiatives.  I have great faith in the Irish people and believe that they will accept that without a quibble but if they are told it is being collected but the Department will only show them where a tiny percentage of it is going, they will not come along fully.  </p> <p>  One of the reasons why we have had these hearings relates to when the CSO appeared before us recently.  We found it slightly unusual that when it appeared before us, the CSO document stated that some publicly funded supports have a negative impact on the environment.  I know there are other objectives relating to fuel poverty.  The CSO stated that a subsidy is classified as potentially environmentally damaging if it is likely to incentivise behaviour that could be damaging to the environment irrespective of the importance of other policy purposes.  Some people might say it is an academic argument but we all know that if we increase carbon tax, raise money from it and hand some of the proceeds back by way of a fuel allowance, we will increase CO2 emissions by burning oil, gas, coal or turf.  The CSO states that this will have a detrimental effect.  I know it costs money but the CSO is saying that it would better if the funds collected were spent on the retrofitting and home heating scheme rather than on giving allowances to people to allow them continue to burn fossil fuels.  The CSO is saying that some of what is happening here is detrimental to the environment.  Is Mr. Carroll familiar with that document?  </p></speech>

I must say that the intention in giving it back is not to encourage people to keep burning fossil fuels.  The intention is to make sure the most vulnerable are not made worse off by the introduction of the carbon tax.</p><p>I do not think it can be looked at in isolation.  If it is brought in to make sure that people are not worse off, that is different from bringing it in to discourage them from continuing to burn fossil fuels.  It has to be understood alongside other schemes, such as the warmer homes scheme, whereby we are trying to retrofit the houses of the fuel-poor and funding that to 100%.  That cannot be done all at once.  It will take time to do.  It will happen over the coming decade and beyond.  In the meantime, the intention is that those least able to bear the burden are not made worse off by the introduction of carbon tax.</p></speech>

We are here to add to the debate.  The public should be able to see transparency and accountability in respect of the &euro;500 million in carbon tax that will be collected next year.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment probably has some documentation done, or perhaps each Department has it done, on the Estimates for the coming year.  I am just saying this myself - I have not run it by the committee - but it would be a tremendous assistance and of benefit to the public, when the Estimates come before their respective committees next year, to be shown where the more than &euro;500 million that will be collected in carbon tax next year will go on climate change initiatives.  It would be a tremendous help to everybody.  It would help the Government in its initiative.  Some 170 young people were sitting in the D&aacute;il Chamber last Friday.  Their generation would receive the benefit.  Just collecting the tax and putting it into the black hole where most of it is going is not helping to bring people around.  We, the Committee of Public Accounts, want to contribute to that debate.  Mr. Carroll understands where we are coming from.</p></speech>

We are trying to move towards greater transparency when it comes to climate and environmental expenditure.

Two and a half years on, we have another &euro;114 million this year plus last year's &euro;114 million and no breakdown.  The EU told us two and a half years ago, "Boys, you are not doing your job", and we are carrying on.  Somebody needs to put a little bit of pressure on the system to be more open and transparent.  I am sure this is a good initiative, but we see this silo approach.  Revenue collects the tax and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform does the revenue.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is one Department.  The reason we are talking to officials from that Department and not the former or Revenue is that the latter is the Department with the word "climate" in its title.  That is why we are trying to assist it in strengthening the case it wants to make at Government level.  That is why we are here today - to assist the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I am speaking personally at this stage, and the committee will have to agree with any recommendations we make on this matter, but if we come out with strong recommendations in a positive manner, it will be with a view to increasing accountability and traceability and people's acceptance of the need for this initiative.  They can only accept it if they know what is going on.  I apologise to Deputy Connolly.  I have done a little solo run.</p></speech>

I mentioned the table that was published for the first time in the Revised Estimates of this year and that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is involved in the OECD's green budgeting.  As for our Department, it is much easier to see.  We have renewable energy subheads and energy efficiency subheads, so it is easy to identify climate expenditure in our Vote.  It might not be as easy to identify it but I cannot comment on what is-----</p></speech>

There is a recommendation to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and other Accounting Officers.  We have little time left regarding climate change, and I tire of the debate on changing behaviour by charging people.  I have repeatedly said I have a different model and I have seen it work in practice.  We are all tired, and I am almost finished.  I would have thought there is a need for an urgent meeting on this.  If it is not possible to easily track the expenditure, something needs to be done quickly when there is this report from the Comptroller and Auditor General, which is moderate.</p></speech>

I reiterate that we are moving towards making that more transparent through initiatives such as the table that was published in the Revised Estimate and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform being part of the OECD initiative on green budgeting.  That is a move to greater and greater transparency over time.  Just in the way our Vote is structured, it is easy to see what is being spent on dealing with climate change.</p></speech>

This is not on the same issue, but a year ago, we made a recommendation that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform meet systematically with those Departments in respect of which major Supplementary Estimates are required each year - for example, the Department of Health.  The HSE was the first one.  It has now set up a health monitoring budget committee within the Department that meets regularly.  That was necessary.  We are here with representatives of the Department with responsibility for climate change matters.  Is it the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that will pull this together or is it the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment?  What we see in the public service, and we have seen it in other cases, is that if three or four different people are responsible, nobody is responsible.  Is it the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's job to pull this information together with input from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment?  The latter cannot tell the Accounting Officers in other Departments what they should do.  To whom do we, as the Committee of Public Accounts, make recommendations?  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is the line Department, but this issue is bigger than just that Department.  Have we to go back to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this?</p></speech>

The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has produced a document for us that we had here on the previous occasion, Staff Paper 2018: An Introduction to the Implementation of Green Budgeting in Ireland, dated December of last year.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will probably have the role in pulling this together but we want the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to drive it as well.</p></speech>

If it is just a table at the back of the Revised Estimates Volume, REV, one is looking at the money provided every year.  The figures in that are the money provided for spending, and it is only the spending side.  I suggest that there needs to be greater transparency around what was spent and on what was raised so that it is broader than the REV.  The place where that has to start is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Another point is that the budgeting that is being done now, is budgeting for 2020.  Even for the 2019 financial statements, we have missed the boat.</p></speech>

For example, take the appropriation accounts for the Department of Communication, Climate Action and Environment.  It has two programmes - one is an energy programme and the other is environment and waste management.  There needs to be consideration as to whether that is the correct grouping or if it is the correct programme structure.  That is something that individual Departments will discuss with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The sooner we start on that work, the sooner we can start taking action and provide better information for a debate that will not go away.</p></speech>

We are frustrated at the lack of transparency.  Although we might appear to give the officials a hard time, it is to encourage everyone in the system to move in the direction in which we all need to move.  There is no criticism; we are all just a bit frustrated at the slow pace.  That is why we called the officials to a special meeting, to highlight it and to give it greater emphasis.  Sometimes the Committee on Public Accounts must link it to the tax that has been collected and the expenditure.  That is our opening into this, but it is not just about examining the past but also the benefits for the future.</p> <p>  We have concluded our discussion.  I thank the officials from the Department of Communication, Climate Action and Environment for their attendance and the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff.   The committee secretariat will contact the officials for any follow-up information that is required and was mentioned.  </p> <p>  The next meeting will be with the Revenue Commissioners, during which we will ask about carbon tax.  We will discuss Vote 9 of the Revenue Commissioners - Central Fund-related accounts,  chapter 17 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on tax compliance interventions, and chapter 18 on tax relief on film production.

Under the terms of the D&aacute;il motion of 12 November last, this committee must consider the matter and, having done so, report back to the D&aacute;il not later than 26 November next.

The motion that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann has been asked to approve reads:</p> <blockquote> 	That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the terms of the Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Armenia, of the other part, signed in Brussels on 24th November, 2017, a copy of which was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 11th November, 2019. </blockquote> <p>This modern, comprehensive and ambitious agreement, which was signed in the margins of the Eastern Partnership summit in Brussels in 2017, provides a framework for Armenia and the EU to work together for the benefit of the citizens of Armenia to strengthen democracy and human rights and to create more jobs and business opportunities, fairer rules, more safety and security, a cleaner environment, better educational opportunities and more opportunities for research.  The scope of the new agreement, which has been concluded within the context of the Eastern Partnership initiative, is comprehensive.  It covers issues of EU competence and interest and reflects the existing wide range of co-operation in economic, trade and political areas and on sectoral policies.  It develops these areas further, thereby providing a long-term basis for the further strengthening of EU-Armenia relations.  In addition to facilitating stronger economic relations, the agreement aims to enhance political dialogue and to promote peace and stability.  By intensifying this dialogue and improving co-operation across a broad range of areas, the agreement lays the foundations for more effective engagement with Armenia.  At its core is a commitment to strengthen the promotion, protection and implementation of fundamental freedoms, human rights, the respect for democratic principles, the rule of law and good governance.</p><p>Armenia is undergoing a period of rapid and positive political change.  In what was termed the Velvet Revolution, the spring 2018 protests against the then Prime Minister, Serzh Sargsyan, eventually forced his resignation and led to the elevation of Nikol Pashinyan to the office of Prime Minister.</p><p>Along with our EU partners, Ireland watched the events of spring 2018 in Armenia with great interest.  The revolution resulted in a remarkably peaceful transition of political power in the country.  Ireland, together with the EU, continues to encourage and support Armenia&rsquo;s reform efforts, with a number of positive steps having already been taken, including Armenia's new five-year government programme, containing a series of political, economic, judicial and governance reforms, which focuses on enhancing rule of law, fighting corruption and improving protection of human rights.</p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral trade with Armenia is not hugely significant.  However, this comprehensive and enhanced partnership agreement will allow for more access into the region and will help to develop greater opportunities for trade and investment, including in the areas of education, research and innovation.</p><p> While Armenia is not seeking EU membership, relations have gone from strength to strength in recent years due to the EU&rsquo;s Eastern Partnership mechanism. The most visible illustration of this is the 2017 comprehensive and enhanced partnership agreement.  The EU is the largest provider of financial support to and a key reform partner in Armenia.  The EU stands ready to continue engaging in Armenia and to provide support through political dialogue and financial and technical assistance in order to support the Armenian Government's ambitious reforms for the benefit of the citizens of Armenia and EU-Armenia co-operation.  This support is critical to ensuring a sustained approach to ongoing reform efforts in Armenia aimed at enhancing democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights, with the ultimate aim of increasing security, prosperity and socio-economic resilience.</p><p> The EU contributes &euro;40 million annually to Armenia in grants at present, with the focus on supporting the reform agenda of the new Government, private sector development, education and the development of focal regions, including the promotion of e-governance.  In addition, more than &euro;1 billion in the form of blended loans and grants has been invested in the energy, agriculture and transport sectors since 2014.</p><p> I wish to acknowledge the ongoing concerns over the so-called frozen conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.  The Armenian Prime Minister recently affirmed Armenia&rsquo;s commitment to the peaceful settlement of the conflict, which Ireland and the rest of the EU have welcomed.  I understand that there has been some progress in talks between Armenia and Azerbaijan, with the EU welcoming the current decrease in tension on the ground and the constructive and calm attitude shown by both leaderships.  Ireland&rsquo;s position, like that of the EU as a whole, has been supportive of the Minsk process of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, with the aim of moving towards the peaceful resolution of the conflict on the basis of mutual compromises.</p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to present this motion.  The agreement will not only broaden and deepen the EU&rsquo;s relationship with Armenia and provide for closer economic and political ties, but will also provide the framework for further constructive dialogue on human rights, fundamental freedoms, rule of law and governance.  I must emphasise that, by ratifying this agreement, we will be in a position to add our voice to the EU and 27 other member states in encouraging Armenia on its path to reform, rather than sitting on the sidelines as others engage.  I hope that the committee will support the motion and that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann may approve the terms of this agreement in order that Ireland might proceed to ratification before the end of 2019.  I am happy to take committee members' questions.</p></speech>

Armenia is undergoing a period of rapid political change.  Following the Velvet Revolution of spring 2018, Nikol Pashinyan inherited a country facing serious corruption and human rights problems.  Ireland watched the spring 2018 events with great interest.  The revolution presented a remarkably peaceful transition of political power and was followed by a five-year government programme, which contained a series of political, economic and judicial reforms while also focusing on governance, enhancing the rule of law, fighting corruption and improving the protection of human rights.  The purpose of the agreement is to provide a framework for further strengthening the bilateral relationship between the EU and Armenia in order that this work can continue.  The EU's commitment is based on a commitment to promoting respect for democratic principles and enhancing fundamental human rights.  The agreement also covers co-operation across a number of sectoral areas, including people-to-people relations and strengthening civil society and co-operation in education, culture, research and innovation.</p> <p>  Armenia is probably in a place that Ireland was many years ago, in that it is beginning a journey of transition.  The more that we engage at all levels with Armenia, the greater the influence that we can have to encourage reform.  By ratifying the agreement, we can influence Armenia from within the fold of the EU, which is exactly from where we should be doing it.  Should we choose not to ratify the agreement, we can only observe from the sidelines while others continue to engage effectively and press for the kinds of reform that need to happen.  Ireland engages with human rights in Armenia through the EU, the Council of Europe and the OSCE by ensuring that focused attention remains on human rights issues.  As such, it is critical that Ireland ratify this agreement and play a central role in ensuring that reforms take place.</p></speech>

I am joined by Ms &Aacute;ine Carroll, director of communications and policy. </p> <p>  We are aware that the committee&rsquo;s primary focus in this matter to date has been on insurance and we will offer our views on same.  Given that the CCPC&rsquo;s role is economy wide, we will also provide details of our work on pricing strategies in a broader context.  I hope that this will be of use to the committee as it considers these matters.</p> <p>  By way of very brief introduction, the CCPC works to improve consumer welfare across the economy.  We do this through enforcing competition and consumer protection laws, our advocacy efforts and our consumer information activities.  Currently, we are active in a number of markets, including ticketing, public transport procurement, the motor sector, nursing homes and in the retail sector for pricing and product safety.</p> <p>  Over the last number of decades we have seen the benefits that competition and market liberalisation have brought in many sectors.  For us, telecommunications are a good example of this as consumers went from a situation where there was a single provider and it took weeks or months to get a new telephone line to now having choice, competition and innovation in the market.  Where consumers are vulnerable, there is a low level of competition or the potential for harm is high, these sectors require a higher level of supervision and intervention.  Sectoral regulators, therefore, have access to industry information thus enabling them to build up knowledge and expertise so that they can see market trends or issues as they develop.  They can also, if required, take preventative steps or alter the rules so that they reflect new market dynamics.</p> <p>  In addition to sector specific regulation and regulators, the CCPC enforces competition and general consumer protection laws, provides information to consumers and advocates on their behalf.  The roles of sectoral regulators and the CCPC are complementary in that regulators can deal with problems that are specific to their industry, while we can identify and analyse broader cross-cutting trends.</p><p>Financial services are particularly complex markets for consumers to navigate because of the risk, value and importance of the products involved.  In recent years, the CCPC has been extremely active in the sector.  As the committee will be aware, we currently have an ongoing investigation into price signalling in the motor insurance sector.  We have assisted the European Commission in its motor insurance investigation.  Most recently we commenced a study into the public liability insurance market which is an important piece of work for us.</p><p> We also work to improve consumer welfare through our advocacy efforts and our financial education programmes.  We undertook a detailed examination of the mortgages market, making recommendations on improving competition and identified issues with consumers&rsquo; ability to navigate cashback offers.  Having witnessed a significant increase in the popularity of PCP car finance, we completed a market study including commissioning research to understand consumers&rsquo; experiences with PCP finance and as a result we made recommendations that they should fall within the same regulatory scheme as car loans and other financial products.  In recent weeks a consultation has been opened on a Bill which we hope will soon address this regulatory gap.</p><p> Our financial education work is of significant priority to us and in addition to extensive public awareness campaigns we provide mortgages, savings, current accounts, credit cards and personal loan money tools on our website to help consumers compare rates and make informed decisions.  Last year we published the first financial well-being study ever conducted in Ireland.  The research examined the behaviours and circumstances that influence financial decision-making and the extent to which people are able to meet their current financial needs and their financial resilience to do so.  Through our financial education programme we have also delivered independent personal finance information to thousands of employees in workplaces across the country.  We also work with the Central Bank and Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman to ensure the information we provide to consumers is up to date or to share insights or trends that we are seeing in our engagement with consumers.</p><p> I mentioned that competition has brought about choice and innovation for consumers.  It is also a fact that businesses, where they have one, will use their information advantage to try and maximise the prices they charge.  Therefore, in order for the full benefits of competition to be realised, consumers need to be active participants in markets by researching their options and availing of better deals through switching.  Over the last decade, as part of our public awareness work, we have used research to identify the sectors where consumers are most and least active and identified what contracts could provide significant savings if consumers moved.  We have advocated on behalf of consumers for improvements to be made in switching processes in a number of markets.  We have run numerous consumer information campaigns targeting where consumers may benefit from switching providers.  Significantly, in financial services we developed and recently redeveloped cost comparison tools to help consumers compare products more easily.  Last year, these tools provided details of 518 financial products and received over 180,000 visits.</p><p> More recently, however, it is increasingly felt that this may not be enough.  Through our market monitoring and through participation in European groups, we are aware of pricing strategy concerns.  Relevant reports include the work done by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK which have examined loyalty penalties across financial services and other sectors.  We have also looked at the use of dual-pricing bans and other initiatives in the United States.</p><p> In addition, two weeks ago the European Council adopted the omnibus directive to modernise consumer law.  Among other things it provides for enhanced transparency in online transactions, in particular regarding the use of online reviews, personalised pricing based on algorithms or higher ranking of products due to paid placements.  On personalised pricing, the directive amends Article 6 of the consumer rights directive to insert a specific requirement to inform consumers when the price is "personalised, on the basis of automated decision-making".</p><p> A number of reasons have been put forward as to what has changed and why advising consumers to switch may no longer be a sufficient response in all markets.  With digitalisation there is a greater opportunity for businesses to know more about us and exploit that information; with the use of the loyalty penalty mechanism, businesses increasingly know that many consumers do not have the time or the ability to switch, so consumers experience successive price increases, sometimes called "price walking" and unfortunately loyalty is no longer rewarded, which is disappointing but is a reality for consumers.  Also, products are getting more complex which makes switching more difficult and this amplifies all of the above reasons.</p><p> What is the CPCC doing?  From our experience in examining dozens of markets per year we know that the solutions are rarely the same across different sectors.  The most effective solutions come from an accurate understanding of the problems and their impact on consumers, as illustrated in our work on PCP, mortgages, waste collection and nursing home contracts.  Having that clarity not only ensures effective solutions but, crucially, an in-depth understanding of the issues ensures that there are no unintended consequences, such as one consumer group benefitting from an intervention at the detriment of another.</p><p> Although work has been undertaken internationally to look at the issues and there have been measures introduced to address them, it is important to stress that the solutions for Ireland need to be developed with the realities of our markets in mind.</p><p> As our remit is economy-wide there is an onus on us to look at practices which may be of concern across all markets, to identify where the detriment is and the potential solutions.  Therefore, building on our previous switching research, the CCPC is undertaking considerable consumer research into pricing strategies in key consumer markets, including utilities and financial products.  We will look at the incidence of switching and price-checking, the impact of loyalty penalties on particular groups of consumers, for example, older consumers or those with low financial well-being.  We will examine the role and impact of contracts rolling over.  We also think it is important to understand consumers&rsquo; perception of fairness: are some happy to pay more so that everybody pays the same price?</p><p> Without pre-empting that work I expect that it will result in the following actions in 2020.  It will provide a basis for our advocacy work which will include, where appropriate, making recommendations to Government, sectoral regulators and advocacy groups to address any identified consumer harm.  This will focus, in particular, on groups of consumers who may find it hard or impossible to switch providers.  Specifically in relation to insurance, we will engage with the Central Bank as our research and their market study progresses and will also engage with the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.  We will use the research to engage with national and European counterparts to share information and keep up to date with developments.  It will also provide us with the basis for a public awareness campaign which will inform and provide information to consumers as to how they can switch service providers.</p><p> In conclusion, I am acutely aware that the committee is concerned with and has undertaken considerable work in examining dual-pricing to date.  The CCPC recognises the importance of this work and is committed to playing its part as quickly as we can in providing an evidence base for firm actions to help consumers.  We would welcome any questions that the committee may have.</p></speech>

I thank the committee members for the opportunity to speak here.</p> <p>  By way of background I was asked by the board of Insurance Ireland to take on the role of interim CEO of the organisation pending the appointment of a replacement for Kevin Thompson.  I have spent over 30 years in the insurance sector primarily with Irish Life and more recently with Great West Life in Canada.  In both cases I was focused on the life and retirement part of the business.  I now have a consultancy business which I will be returning to full-time once a new CEO has been appointed to Insurance Ireland.</p> <p>  I am pleased to be joined today by Michael Horan, non-life insurance manager with Insurance Ireland.</p> <p>  Insurance Ireland represents the Irish general insurance, health insurance, life assurance, international, reinsurance and captive management sectors.  We represent 140 companies providing insurance domestically in Ireland and internationally from Ireland.</p> <p>  About 28,000 people are employed directly or indirectly in the sector, with one in four financial service jobs being in insurance.  Our members pay out &euro;13 billion in claims and benefits annually and contribute over &euro;1.6 billion in tax to the Irish Exchequer every year.</p> <p>  The Irish market for motor insurance is currently served by 35 companies.  However, the core market is primarily served by eight firms most of which are leading international players, with the balance serving niche markets like high-powered cars or specialist commercial vehicles.  There are approximately 2 million Irish consumers with motor insurance and about &euro;1 billion is incurred annually in motor claims.  The market is highly competitive and the market share of the various players ebbs and flows in line with commercial activity.</p><p> Like any company or trade association, Insurance Ireland must fully comply with the law, including competition law.  It was this requirement that informed our recent correspondence with the committee explaining the limitations relating to our ability to make a meaningful contribution on the topic of dual pricing due to the constraints of competition law.  Our track record with the committee is one of always being available and open to discussing key policy issues, including the important issue of reform of the sector and issues pertaining to the cost of claims.  When it comes to pricing policy, however, the rules are clear.  Insurance Ireland as a trade association does not hold, discuss or facilitate any material in respect of the pricing of products.  We have no access to data around product pricing or pricing strategies either on an industry basis or for individual firms.  The pricing policies of companies is proprietary and highly confidential.  For these reasons, it is difficult for us to help the committee in understanding the application of various pricing strategies operating in the Irish market.  Competition law means that we cannot discuss how a company strikes a price for a particular risk.  This is not something that we know nor something that we should know.  I trust that committee members will understand the sensitivity with which we view this topic.  We fully respect the committee's role, and having actively participated in previous meetings, we will do everything possible to participate constructively at today's meeting, notwithstanding the constraints.  However, I should stress that we will be particularly constrained on the specifics of pricing policies at an industry level and in respect of specific company practices.</p><p> While Insurance Ireland has not been directly involved in the Central Bank review of the insurance market, we are aware that member companies have been engaging with the bank in recent months on the topic of differential pricing.  We note the decision by the Central Bank to carry cut a formal review to: seek to establish the impact of differential pricing on consumers while at the same time establishing the drivers of consumer behaviour, including how customers engage with the insurance industry; and assess the extent to which these pricing practices lead to outcomes that are consistent with the consumer protection code.  We welcome this review.  In particular, we welcome the fact that it is evidence-based and will involve a comprehensive data-gathering and analysis phase.  While Insurance Ireland does not see itself as being directly involved in the review process, we are confident that member companies will co-operate fully with it and engage proactively on any recommendation made.</p><p> I look forward to a good engagement and welcome committee members' questions.</p></speech>

I might start at a broader level with Mr. O'Leary.  He referred to an investigation that was being undertaken by the CCPC into potential price signalling by the insurance industry in the motor insurance market.  That investigation is over three years old.  Will Mr. O'Leary update the committee on where it stands and what progress is being made?</p></speech>

Without going into great detail, the reason for that is the volume of information that we had to look through to ensure that we covered every angle.  We anticipate that it will come to the decision phase in the CCPC in the next couple of months, but certainly early in the new year.  At that point, there will be a clear path as to when it will be finalised.  The next stage for us is a decision phase.</p></speech>

The committee will recall that this issue arose a number of years ago.  From our point of view as the enforcer of competition law, there were too many firms in the market signalling future pricing intentions.  We wanted to ascertain whether that information was being acted upon across the industry.  That meant that we needed to examine a wide number of companies, with well over 1 million documents having been collected as part of that.  We are in the region of 40 or 50 witness hearings.  All of this is being done to get a picture of what information is flowing around the sector and who is acting upon what piece of it.  That is the goal of the investigation.</p></speech>

Is that the central allegation being investigated?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.1087" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal O'Leary" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2019112100002#D00800"><p>I will speak in general terms.  In price signalling, a company is telling its competitors what it plans on doing and they then react.  That is different to a cartel, which is a secret agreement and would lead to a criminal investigation by us.  Currently, this is a civil investigation.  It is about putting information in the public domain that a company's competitors then act upon in terms of their pricing strategies or engagement with their customers.</p></speech>

One is to agree commitments with the firms that they will not do this again.  The other is to go to court and seek a declaration that the conduct was unlawful.</p> <p>  If the committee does not mind, I will take this opportunity to say that we want more powers in this space.  There is a new European competition network directive - the ECN+ directive - that will be transposed in the next year or so.  In a civil case situation like this, I hope that it will allow us to make a determination ourselves without having to go to a court and then to impose a fine on the companies.  That would be much more efficient and allow us to get more cases through the system and have a larger impact across the economy.</p></speech>

We even heard Mr. Fergal O'Leary say that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's review will be across several sectors.  Essentially, it is driven by companies that want to grow their market position.  It stimulates competition.  As a practice, very often a company might even have a teaser rate as a loss leader to attract new business.  There are some dimensions to it that are positive.  It stimulates competition in the market, rewards customers who shop around and, hopefully, in time, it would attract new entrants into the industry.  That is positive.  The question is the extent to which that practice penalises the loyal customer.  There must be a balance.  For example, a recent CCPC survey shows that motor insurance has one of the highest rates of switching of any market in Ireland.  It was up at 27% to 28% annually.  I personally believe that is a good thing.  It signals a vibrant market and that is a good thing but we must be cognisant of consumers who are loyal to companies and whether they are they being treated fairly.  For me, it is a question of balance and getting that balance right.</p></speech>

Is it not the case companies use technology to arrive at a conclusion that a customer is very loyal, will not switch or shop around and, therefore, their premium is loaded and they pay much more?</p></speech>

It has always been a core principle in insurance that the more data one has about a risk, the more accurately one can price that risk.  That works in several different ways.  To take the example of the health insurance sector, if one wears a Fitbit or goes to the gym, one will get a discount.  If one puts a black box with all the telematics in one's car, a motor insurance company will give one a discount because the customer is providing more information that allows the company to more accurately price the risk.  That issue of data works both ways.  For some people, the data will lead to a lower premium.  I am not sure of the context within which it is used in individual pricing strategies.</p></speech>

To take the example of mortgages, which typically is the biggest transaction anyone enters into in their life, there is still price differentiation in the market.</p><p>Cashback is available to new customers but not to existing customers, and certain banks still offer preferential rates to new customers as opposed to existing customers.  We know it is widespread across utility companies.  We also know it is happening in the insurance industry.  How does the CCPC, as the competition watchdog, the body that has the responsibility of protecting consumers, deal with that?

For us, as I mentioned in our statement, the difference is whether the price differentials are bigger than they were before.  Is it the case that firms are using information to test consumer groups to see if they can pull more margin out of those consumer groups?  What we want to do with this piece of research, which is broadly similar to what our counterpart in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority did, is to see how much the loyalty penalty is in the 16 markets that we are going to look at.  What we will do then is try to target the customers who are losing out at the moment, see what groups are there, and then we will look at solutions.  Traditionally, the solutions we have looked at have been public awareness and trying to get consumers to switch.  We are very well aware that not all consumers have access to online information, so a lot of our work, including sponsoring a television programme, is to try to get to people who do not have access to the Internet.  However, there is a genuine question, which is the reason we are doing this research at the moment, namely, to see if that is enough.  Without pre-empting the work that we will do over the next three or four months, I think we have come to a stage where it is unlikely to be enough to make sure that competition can remain in markets, that new entrants can come in and look for customers, but people should not be penalised for being on long legacy products or the differentials should not be as large as I think we are seeing in some sectors.</p></speech>

I will start with the CCPC.  I appreciate the meeting we had on the complaint I submitted to the CCPC on dual pricing within the insurance market.  As noted in that complaint, I know that it is not unique to the insurance market.  I am pleased the CCPC has already undertaken some work on that and, if I understood correctly, it intends to look further at the insurance market in 2020, including dual pricing.</p></speech>

We have briefed a market research firm.  We have had engagement with the Central Bank about its study.  We want to make sure that we do not overlap with what it does.  We are going to engage with the other sectoral regulators whose markets we are going to look at, just to make sure that we are not doing any overlap or collecting data they might already have.  We will take it from there.</p></speech>

What we are seeing in the information we collect when we look at the markets is that loyalty is getting less and less among consumers, which is good.  We think that is a reaction to their loyalty not being rewarded.  That is the basis for it.  There is a tipping point somewhere, which Deputy Doherty has identified in terms of the individual case studies and the file he gave to us.  There is a point where public awareness is not sufficient.  We want to do public awareness and we will continue to do it, but there are probably other measures we need to look at as well.  We know the Central Bank is doing the same in its sector.</p></speech>

We have a co-operation agreement with the Central Bank that, first, makes sure that we do not overlap and duplicate what it is doing.  We have regular engagement with it on a range of issues.  We keep in close contact with the Central Bank.  I admit that its study on insurance will be much more in-depth than ours.  That is by virtue of the access to information it has.  While we have similar powers, it has the consumer protection code and other regulations that allow it to get data in its sector much more quickly and in much more detail than we can.  There will be close engagement in the next couple of months.  We will provide any assistance that we can but, ultimately, the Central Bank probably has the resources to progress the study mostly by itself.</p></speech>

We release all of our market research given that we are a State-funded body.  We also get a levy from the financial industry.  We publish the research that we do.  I expect that the initial piece of research will be done in the next three months, and then quickly thereafter we will engage with sectoral regulators to figure out the appropriate response.</p> <p>  The one difficulty that I might mention is that there are some unregulated sectors, such as waste, on our list, and it is going to be harder there because, as shown in a report that we published last year, the State at present does not really have the levers to influence behaviour.  The waste sector is composed of unregulated entities from a consumer protection point of view.  We will have to work with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  It will be easier to come up with solutions in regulated markets.</p></speech>

I may come back later with further questions.  I welcome the representatives of Insurance Ireland to the committee.  The body indicated that it had nothing to offer our deliberations but I am pleased it accepted our subsequent request.  Insurance Ireland has been busy in recent days.  It hosted a conference on fraud and the compensation culture in Ireland.  What is the increase in the number of motor insurance claims between 2014 and 2017?</p></speech>

That was a genuine mix-up.  Deputy Doherty is correct.  It was 255,000 to 200,000.  That is very welcome.  The problem is that the cost associated with those claims continues to rise.  In the same period, our cost of incurred claims has risen by 17%.  The way the costs are split, 25% relates to damage to vehicles.  They are relatively small amounts of money.  Those costs have fallen in line with the number of cases falling, because it is a fairly routine thing.  Unfortunately, the cost of personal injuries continues to rise.  That is driven by-----</p></speech>

The figures for 2015, 2016 and 2017 found that the average award for all claims up to &euro;100,000 increased by over &euro;900 each year.  The average Circuit Court award increased from about &euro;16,000 in 2015 to &euro;19,000 in 2018.  We are seeing an increasing cost of claims over those years.  When all of the claims are taken together, this is seen in the Department of Finance cost of insurance second motor data report.  It is also seen in the Personal Injuries Commission report which was published last year.  We gave all our settled claims for 2015, 2016 and 2017, and an increasing cost of claims could be seen.  It could be seen that the soft tissue award claims were 4.5 times higher than they were in the UK.</p> <p>  Those two reports, the Department of Finance report and the Personal Injuries Commission report, look at all the claims together and show an increasing cost of claims.  There is a correlation between the increasing cost of claims and the increasing cost of premiums.  It is necessary to take all of the claims together, rather than zero in on different parts of the claims market.</p></speech>

Looking at the cost of motor claims from 2014 to 2017, the cost of motor claims in 2014 was about &euro;1.1 billion.  The cost of motor claims in 2017 was about &euro;1.27 billion, a 15% increase.  In the overall scheme of things, the total cost of motor claims in increasing.  In addition, while the number of claims has reduced, the Department of Finance report showed that this was largely because damage claims had come down.  The second motor data report from the Department of Finance showed that damage claims had come down in number.  Damage claims are much less expensive to settle than injury claims.  When I say damage claims, I mean the bumps, rear-end shunts and so on, own-damage claims, third party damage claims and windscreen claims.  It takes many windscreen claims to make up the value of one injury claim.  The Department of Finance report showed that the injury claims under &euro;250,000 were increasing year-on-year by about 7% in cost.  That is what is driving the problem for us.  That is the defining issue.  The cost-----</p></speech>

The published Insurance Ireland data will show that they have actually increased from &euro;448 in 2014 to over &euro;660 in 2017, a 50% increase.  The figure did not actually decrease in any one of those years despite the fact that we have seen a 22% reduction in claims and a 15% reduction in the amount of awards being paid.

It is clearly indicative of the actual awards.  The basis of the Insurance Ireland premise is that the awards are coming down.  I wish to add to what Deputy Doherty has said.  It is not only that the figure come down 22% overall.  For court awards, aside from the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, Mr. Hassett has said that in many cases claimants are being advised legally to go to court.  However, the court awards in that period reduced.  We have got feedback from the Court of Appeal in particular that the awards have gone down.  Why is that not reflected in a reduction in insurance costs?</p></speech>

It has gone up by 15%, driven by the removal of the cap.  The Personal Injuries Commission found that the average award for soft tissue injury is still rising by &euro;900 every year and now stands at &euro;20,826.  That is the average award and it is four and a half times the UK average and still rising.</p></speech>

We must make reserve for settled claims and unsettled claims.  What we are seeing is that the courts set norms.  As these norms show an increase in the awards, two things are happening.  More people are opting to go through the court process because they believe the outcome will be better.  Second, given the predictability in the system in terms of where those awards are going, insurers are settling cases.  The figures shared in respect of the court awards are accurate but they do not present the whole picture.  Many of the claims that we have incurred have not yet been settled.</p></speech>

That is coupled with a 22% reduction in the number of claims.  I will go back to Deputy Doherty presently.  Based on empirical work, we have to question the basis of the assertions being made.  The figures were presented to Insurance Ireland.  It is a clear indication that premiums should be coming down significantly.</p></speech>

I have asked Mr. Hassett to back up that claim as well.  Is it not the case that the Insurance Ireland fact file gives the average price per insured vehicle and then gives the average price in 2017?  Is it not the case that using those data we see an increase in premiums rather than a reduction?  Again, we have the insurance industry suggesting that premiums peaked in 2016 and reduced in 2017.  However, using Insurance Ireland statistics published in the Insurance Ireland annual report, it does not take a genius to figure out that we actually have an increase rather than a decrease.</p></speech>

I believe that when the chief executive officers of some of our members were before the committee over the summer they quoted price reductions in the market of approximately 15% over recent years.  Frankly, that was news to me because I am not allowed to even talk to them about those data given the competition constraints, which the committee will understand.  Clearly, we have access to the claims data.</p> <p>  I believe the average size of awards is a critical number because that is what dictates claimant behaviour.  It also dictates insurer behaviour in settling claims.  Why would an insurer add additional cost to go all the way down to the end of the line in a court process when the outcome is predictable?</p></speech>

It has disputed it with the Department of Finance in the context of the motor insurance group.  It has suggested that the CSO collection of data is wrong.  We all know that it uses only one subset of insurance.  In any event, Insurance Ireland provides data to its European colleagues for the reporting they do across the motor insurance industry.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Deputy Doherty has quoted it plenty of times.  What I am saying is that the CSO motor insurance index has reduced over the past three years, since mid-2016.  It is 27% lower now than it was in mid-2016.  That correlates with the fact that motor claims costs are stabilising and falling and that is flowing through into pricing as the CSO index shows.  The point I am making is that the reason motor claims costs have stabilised is that damage claims primarily have fallen.  These include policyholder damage claims, third party damage claims and windscreen claims.</p> <p>  We have not actually addressed the defining issue, namely, the high level of personal injury awards in Ireland, especially for soft tissue injuries.  Some 80% of motor claims are for whiplash.  We need to address the defining issue.  The high level of awards is a cost and a problem.  It has bedevilled the Irish claims environment for decades.  We need to address that fundamentally.  Earlier this week, we welcomed the announcement by the Chief Justice of the interim personal injuries guidelines committee as part of the Judicial Council, which will recalibrate those awards.</p> <p>  We welcomed the other point made by the Chief Justice that in future when those judicial guidelines are produced judges who depart from the guidelines would need to explain why they have done so.  That would bring more consistency as well.  This is something the insurance industry sought for many years.  We need consistency in award levels because historically there has been a lack of consistency and this makes insurance companies uncomfortable in terms of their reserving.</p><p>We want more consistency and we want to see a recalibration of awards to reduce the differential that exists between high whiplash awards in Ireland and those in the UK.  More than &euro;20,000 can be got for a whiplash award in Ireland and much less in the United Kingdom.</p></speech>

They are saying the claims ratio is now 65%, which means that for every euro taken in, 65 cent is paid out in claims.  It is a good indicator in respect of claims.  The other part will be made up of either the industry's profits, which have increased significantly, or the operational cost.  How is it that the claims ratio in Ireland is significantly lower than what the European average is reported to be?  In some cases, as with the companies before us, it is 10% lower.  In other words, it is 65% rather than 75%, yet Insurance Ireland continues to peddle the suggestion that there is a massive compensation culture here.</p></speech>

If there is a known figure for a certain injury, why would a company try to prolong a process and add to its cost when the outcome is highly probable?  From our point of view, the cost of personal injury awards is driving the cost of incurred claims up.  That cost of incurred claims is up by 18% in the same period even though the number of claims is down.  I understand that, logically, might not appear to make sense but it should be remembered that, from a monetary point of view, personal injuries account for 75% of all claims costs.  That is the number that is really out of kilter.  If we could have structural reform and reduce the average claims cost, the cost of claims could come down quite dramatically.</p></speech>

Historically, legal fees added over 40% to the cost of compensation.  We still regard legal fees as a problem.  We regard the main problem to be the level of awards and consistency in the level of awards.  We also regard legal fees as a major problem.  Legal fees need to be addressed also.  The national claims information database, regarding which there will be some outputs and a report published in the coming months, will show the high levels of legal fees as a percentage of compensation.</p></speech>

If one is providing reserves based on a combination of actual awards plus expected awards, that is a finite and absolute figure and that figure is then built into a provision within the accounts of the individual insurance companies which dictates the overall level of the premiums they will charge.  If the overall number of claims is down by 55,000 and the overall number of awards, particularly in the courts, is down by 40%, it stands to reason that the average could go up.  If there are fewer people claiming, the average could go up.  I do not wear that argument.  It should be the amount of awards overall for the company that dictates the level of premiums and the way it prices among all its customers.  I do not buy the argument on the average.</p></speech>

First, 75% of awards relate to personal injury claims.  While the number of cases is relevant, the amount of money is dictated by what is happening in the personal injury section.  Second, even though the case count is coming down, that is in the year in which a claim is made whereas, typically, personal injury cases take three, four and five years to go through the system so there is a sort of multi-annual process.  What we are also seeing is a reduction in the number of cases in the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and more cases going through the Circuit Court process.  Therefore, the total numbers are masking some of the trends that are happening underneath the bonnet.</p></speech>

One could make the case that an insurance company is being very prudent in that it errs on the side of caution and it ups the amount it provides.  The trend is that the number of claims overall has gone down by 20% and court awards have gone down dramatically - by 40% in the period - yet we are not seeing reductions.  We had the insurance companies before us recently and I went through their figures.  They are looking for an average net return on premiums of 5% or 6% but many of the companies are earning substantially more than that.  The insurance companies will blame the legal costs and the claims, the legal profession will blame the insurance companies and it is the consumer who is losing out.  While we will probably not agree, I believe that making the argument purely on the average does not stand up to scrutiny.  When does Mr. Hassett expect to see substantial reductions in motor insurance premiums?</p></speech>

He is correct that the reserve made in regard to unsettled claims is a judgment, but it is a judgment that firms take extremely seriously.  There is a prudential regulation regime to make sure that companies get that right because, from an insurance company's point of view, to get that process wrong would lead to severe financial risk, not just to the company, but to policyholders.  Unfortunately, once a decade Ireland has endured an insurance failure - the last was Setanta - and we have all been privy to the hardship, not just to policyholders, but to the victims of accidents of those policyholders.</p> <p>  The Senator used the word "prudent".  Insurance companies have to be prudent, although I accept that is within limits and they will be conservative based on reality.</p></speech>

To put it this way, if I can turn a criminal offence into a civil offence, I am a much happier person, so I might mask a cartel as being price signalling.  How can the CCPC differentiate between the two?  If it is regarded as price signalling, as far as I am concerned, the CCPC can spend as much time as it wishes investigating but, at the end of the day, the companies can whistle "Dixie" to it because it has no impact.  They will get a tap on the wrist and be told they are bold boys, or whatever, but there are no other implications for them.  Many of the public believe there is a cartel in place.  How can the CCPC distinguish between the two?  It appears to me the action on price signalling has no impact.</p></speech>

It can take insurance companies to court but, ultimately, there are no sanctions in court so it is a Pyrrhic victory.  When the CCPC looks at this price signalling issue, does it also look at the issue of criminal intent?  I assume that by definition, "criminal intent" must be a cartel.</p></speech>

Our current director of what we call civil competition and mergers previously worked in our cartels division.  People who might be listening may find the way this works for us internally difficult to understand but we come to each part of this, look at the evidence and ask ourselves whether we can continue with this, whether we need to close it and what other options we have.  At all times, we have a process if any information becomes available to us that moves outside the civil space and into the criminal space and there is no issue with using that information.</p></speech>

We are engaging very closely with our parent Department - the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation - as to what that legislation might look like.  Obviously, we input into its policy decision.  It is discussing scope with the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  It involves how much of competition law will be involved.  Will it be just European offences or will it cover Irish offences as well?  Can there be any kind of retrospective assessment?  I do not want to mislead the committee.  Based on my experience, it is unlikely that when legislation comes in, it can be made retrospective.</p></speech>

I think the narrative being spun by the insurance industry about how the primary issue is an increase in claims is falling apart.  It is not working well for the industry.  The facts do not illustrate it.  The dual pricing issue is part of that.  Perhaps we can start there before going back to the figures.  I am not asking Mr. Hassett to comment on concrete cases or on Insurance Ireland members doing this or that but if it is the case that dual pricing is happening, is the fact that non-actuarial factors are being taken into account when setting the price for customers a problem?</p></speech>

I think there are issues that may or may not arise in how it is applied.  It is a question of getting the balance right between having a competitive market and always making sure there is value out there for people who want to switch and at the same time, treating existing loyal customers fairly.</p></speech>

Mr. Hassett does not think this is necessarily a problem.</p></speech>

On the one hand, we are being criticised for the fact that people feel there are uncompetitive practices in the market.  This is a practice that rewards switching and competition so-----</p></speech>

They may not have the time to do it.  Mr. Hassett does not think that is necessarily a problem.</p></speech>

People have raised issues and concerns around that.  For the benefit of the market, getting proper data on that will be very helpful.  As I said, it is about how it is applied, which is why we are supportive of the Central Bank review.  We also very much welcome the CCPC review because it is important that people have confidence that whatever pricing strategies are being applied are applied fairly.</p></speech>

Sometimes they want to grow their market share while at other times, they might feel they have enough of a certain risk.  Companies' pricing strategies ebb and flow depending on what they see.

The second motor data report, which was published under the cost of insurance working group, shows that the vast majority of claims inflation comes from smaller third-party injury claims, the cost of which increased at an average rate of 7.3% per year, up 42% in total from 2011 to 2016.  In that time the damages costs fell by 17% but the bigger figure - it is 75:25 - is the one that is rising.</p></speech>

They have a figure for total motor and liability premiums - the total taken in by the insurance industry - of &euro;1.35 billion in 2012 rising to &euro;1.57 billion in 2013, &euro;1.68 billion in 2014, &euro;1.88 billion in 2015, &euro;2.27 billion in 2016, &euro;2.48 billion in 2017.  They then have figures for net motor and liability claims, which is, as I understand it, all claims including PIAB, court and other.  Those figures are: just over &euro;1 billion in 2012, then up to &euro;1.29 billion, down to &euro;1.25 billion, &euro;1.16 billion, &euro;1.35 billion and &euro;1.31 billion.  I am sure Insurance Ireland has looked at this article, analysed it, etc.  Are those figures accurate?  They indicate a substantial divergence between premiums, which have risen substantially over the course of the past six or seven years, and claims which have varied but remained strictly similar?</p></speech>

There was a correlation between that and premium increases.  Between mid-2016 and now, the CSO index for motor shows that it is 27% lower now than it was in mid-2016.  That is because the cost of motor claims has stabilised, and fallen in some cases relating to damage claims.  It is not me saying that.  It is the Department of Finance second motor data report.  The report includes the tables for anyone to see.  Equally, the Personal Injuries Commission report also took in all the data for 2015 to 2017, inclusive, and showed claims costs for soft tissue injuries increasing year on year by &euro;900 per year.  We had that significant differential identified by the Personal Injuries Commission between the UK and Ireland.  There is a correlation between increasing claims costs and increasing premiums.  The defining issue is to address the high level of personal injury awards, particularly for soft tissue whiplash injuries.</p></speech>

When we are talking about the number of claims that have come down, based on what Insurance Ireland is telling us, as the awards have come down in the courts by 20% that means that the provisions Insurance Ireland is making must be the payouts by the insurance companies prior to going to court, which is where the big increases are.</p></speech>

Personal injury cases are the cases that drive the numbers here.  They make up 75% of the total number.  The lion's share of this increase is accounted for by the Circuit Court where the caseload increased by 55% to well over 4,000 cases.  That is the trend.</p> <p>  By the way, it is reassuring to see that the overall number of claims is falling.  It reflects tremendous work, for instance, on road safety.  That is to be welcomed.  That was one of the first structural things we needed to do.</p> <p>  The second structural thing we need to do is address the issue around personal injury claims.

I would like to return to my questions to Mr. Hassett.  There are four legs to this chair: the number of awards being paid out, the legal costs, the fraudulent claims and the profits of insurance companies.  Earlier, Mr. Hassett provided us with the following figures for 2014-2017: the Courts Service, &euro;141 million down to &euro;85 million and PIAB &euro;281 million up to &euro;315 million.  The number of claims decreased by 2 million over the period yet the total awards increased from &euro;1.1 billion to &euro;1.3 billion.  A large number of claims must have been settled outside of the courts.  Perhaps Mr. Hassett would elaborate on the reason for this.</p></speech>

The lion's share of these cases go through the Circuit Court, which is directly linked to the increase in awards.</p></speech>

If they did, the cost of the legal fees and so on would be huge.  If every single case were to end up in court, both sides would have to pay legal fees, for solicitors and barristers, so it does not make sense for every case to end up in the High Court or the Circuit Court.</p></speech>

If one believed that in a case of whiplash, for example, the award would be &euro;20,800, why would one go to the expense of hiring a barrister for oneself and the claimant?  The average amount of the court award dictates the levels at which one settles.</p></speech>

Those costs would also be dumped on the people paying the premiums.  We are trying to use our judgment.

The whole point of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board was to try to reduce legal costs.  This goes back to the point we made earlier that there is no point in bringing a case in which one is down on liability to the High Court or the Circuit Court and ending up with two sets of legal fees, that is, a solicitor and a barrister on both sides.  In most motor claims the liability is clearcut: one can tell who is at fault for the accident and one works from that and tries to settle on the best possible terms.  Unfortunately, we have a dysfunctional system in Ireland in the sense that the level of awards for personal injuries is very high.  We need to address that.  That is the defining issue and we need to try to recalibrate those awards.  The judicial council, we are delighted to hear, will do that.</p></speech>

Mr. Horan should not try to second-guess my question.  We know that net incurred claims dropped from 2014 to 2017.  I am using that period because it was a period in which motor insurance premiums increased by in excess of 50%.  Mr. Horan will argue, as he has done, that he has to include the cost of reinsurance.

We are talking about the total.  As Mr. Horan said, reinsurance is an issue.  Mr. Horan is making the point that the net figure, which is what was incurred by the insurance industry in terms of payouts and claims, fell during that period but that we need to look at reinsurance.  When Mr. Horan takes the issue of reinsurance into account, did people still pay more?  Did they not pay an additional &euro;220 million?  Mr. Horan argued earlier that premium increase was correlated with claims, but when we look at net premium written during that period, which takes into account reinsurance, we see that consumers were charged an extra &euro;220 million.</p></speech>

My apologies; it is complex.  The premium gathered is gathered in a single 12-month period.  It is for a risk in that 12-month period and the insured takes on that risk.  However, a claim can be incurred in several years after that period.  There is not a direct link in each 12-month period between the premium and the claim.  The claims, in particular, are multi-annual.</p></speech>

Take the practice of an insurance company operating in Ireland, a member of Insurance Ireland, quoting an existing consumer &euro;4,000 for a renewal.  However, when I enter my details into the company&rsquo;s website, as a first-time customer, I get a quote for &euro;1,200 less.  What is Mr. Hassett&rsquo;s view on that?</p></speech>

Dual pricing is the layer above the risk where one looks at behaviour statistics.  For example, the EIOPA study, in which 222 insurance companies participated, makes it clear.  A different type of data is used.  There are the data we provide to the insurance companies.  Third-party data are purchased legally by the companies from other sources.  They are from people ticking boxes allowing their data to be sold.  Irish Rail, for example, has one of those tick boxes.  The third part is where insurance companies use artificial intelligence to draw down data from Facebook posts, video posts and so forth.  Is Mr. Hassett aware that either of those second pieces of data are being used by the insurance industry?</p></speech>

I would note, however, that one of the conclusions of the EIOPA report, which covered 200 companies across Europe, was that there is no evidence as yet that an increasing granularity of risk assessment is causing exclusion issues for high-risk customers, although firms expect the impact of big data analytics to increase in the years to come.  Big data analytics is a factor in all industries.  It is a growth sector in every industry where one is looking for insights into one&rsquo;s customers.</p></speech>

What I find difficult to understand is where they are increasing premiums for customers who are loyal because they believe they can get away with it.  How does Insurance Ireland regard that as competition?  I can understand the points about getting market share.  It would be expected that their financial modelling would ensure they were not being reckless with unsustainable rates.  How can Insurance Ireland, however, justify a financial model that effectively increases a premium because the customer will be held because of loyalty?</p></speech>

The study described price optimisation, which is dual practice, as when the consumer's premium depends not only on the risk but also on price sensitivity and the likelihood of shopping around, and stated that it could be challenging from a fairness and ethical perspective, and that this is particularly important regarding the potentially adverse impact on vulnerable customers of old age, low income and low level of study and education.</p></speech>

That is not confined to just the insurance industry.  My reading of the EIOPA report was that it stated this is an area that will require further evaluation and learning as the techniques become more refined.  I also point to the conclusion that stated there was no evidence as yet that increasing granularity is causing exclusion.  I see it as a risk that needs to be monitored but we do not yet have enough evidence to make a final conclusion.</p></speech>

Genetics in particular is an area that needs very careful consideration.  I am not aware of any company specifically using genetics.  This is an issue that is much bigger than insurance.  How artificial intelligence and machine learning are deployed in consumer or commercial markets is an area that will become an emerging discussion point.  They can add value but clearly there are areas where people can be hurt if companies stray over the line.  We have to get the balance right.</p></speech>

We know it is banned in at least 17 states in the US.  A major study was done in Britain, which has many of the same operators as we do in this market.  Some of them have acknowledged to the committee they also operate dual pricing in this market.  The study in Britain found it affected 6 million consumers and that they were overcharged by &euro;1.4 billion as a result of dual pricing in insurance.  This is one end of it.  There is another end with regard to dual pricing or price optimisation, which is the payment of claims.  As a result of this behavioural big data being gathered by the insurance companies people have a different awards made to them by the insurance industry not on the basis of the validity of the claim but on the basis of behavioural attitudes, such as low levels of education, disabilities or older age.  Is Mr. Hassett aware of anybody in the Irish sector using big data to optimise claims payouts?</p></speech>

We need to treat people who make a claim fairly and honourably.  I am in favour of any method that allows us to do that.  I can see a scenario where gathering information could help make a more accurate assessment but I can also see scenarios where it may potentially lead to some negative practices.  This is balance we have to find.  I am not aware of any company that right now is acting in any way that I believe would be unfair.</p></speech>

An insurance company would pay out less in a more impoverished area because it would believe that person would be less likely to challenge the claim payout.</p></speech>

Is it the case that we could have a tracker mortgage scandal mark 2, whereby a number of complaints being adjudicated by the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman with regard to dual pricing could open up a serious problem for the insurance industry because it would have to ban it if the ombudsman came down on the side of the consumer?</p></speech>

They are very different products.  A tracker mortgage is a 20-year commitment while a motor policy can be renewed after 12 months.  We have very high levels of switching and 50% of our market involves brokers, whereby people are actively advised on the other options in the market.  The market fundamentals are very different.</p></speech>

The point and correlation I am making is that a small number of people took a case to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman with regard to tracker mortgages and the small number of people who saw their claims through opened up a serious problem, and rightly so, for the banks, which had to end the practice and restore more than &euro;600 million into customers' accounts.  If the financial services ombudsman adjudicates as he has suggested, and it will have to be proved that insurance companies are not basing simply on risk and are punishing customers as a result of loyalty, would the insurance industry not have a major problem?  This is part of the insurance industry.  Insurance Ireland will do a conference with Milliman next week.</p></speech>

Milliman has made the risk very clear.  It stated the risk could manifest in the form of bad press prompting more customers to shop around and potentially it could spiral into a bigger problem for a firm.  It has made it clear that it is about punishing loyalty.  Has Mr. Hassett seen the research done by the Financial Conduct Authority, FCA?</p></speech>

I will recount some of it.  If someone renews with an insurance company on four or more occasions, the loyalty premium that person will be hit with is 20%.  If people stay with the same company for ten years or more, the average loyalty premium is 40%.  Does Mr. Hassett accept this?</p></speech>

Insurance Ireland moved on this a year and a half ago when a process was set up.  The witnesses might recount this to the committee.  Many people are very frustrated.  For instance, I was contacted by one individual who was insured by AXA Insurance in another European country.  When the person moved back to Ireland their no-claims bonus was not recognised.  The person is with the same company, although with a different headquarters.  Is the honouring of no-claims bonuses regardless of where a customer is insured being addressed by Insurance Ireland?  Different companies operate different policies but this is something that needs to clarified.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.1647" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rosemary Keogh" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019112100002#B00300"><p>On behalf of the IWA, I thank the committee for the invitation to present and the opportunity to answer questions regarding the background to the decision to close the Cuisle facility in Roscommon and the consequent transition to a new hotel-based model of holiday respite services for people with physical disabilities.  I am joined by the IWA's national director for services, Tony Cunningham.</p> <p>  The IWA has a vision of an Ireland where people with disabilities enjoy equal rights, choices and opportunities in how they live their lives and where the country itself is a model worldwide for a truly inclusive society.  The IWA is a leading representative organisation and service provider for people with physical disabilities, with 20,000 members, over 2,500 employees, 57 local community centres and 2,000 volunteers.  For almost 60 years, the IWA has pioneered the development and delivery of innovative, quality assured services to people with physical disabilities and has continually advocated for greater access to society on behalf of our membership.  The IWA is a major provider of services to the HSE under the mandate of the service arrangements process.  In 2018, the association received &euro;41.7 million from the HSE towards delivering over 2 million hours of services nationally, including assisted-living services, resource and outreach centres, respite care and supported living.  The funding received from the HSE for these services does not fully cover the associated costs of delivering those services and in 2018, the IWA contributed &euro;1.87 million from its own unrestricted operating income in order to maintain those services. </p> <p>  In June, this committee was briefed by a number of disability service provider umbrella groups on the growing funding crisis in the disability sector.  In this context, during the period 2008 to 2018, the IWA has seen its financial reserves diminish by &euro;5.7 million as it used its own funds to ensure continuity of service provision across all our services.  The association's cash balances at the end of 2018 represented just four weeks' operating costs.  The IWA is a registered charity and a company limited by guarantee governed by a voluntary board.  The majority of board members are elected from our membership at the annual general meeting and at least a third of all members must be, and are, persons with physical disability.</p> <p>  For 22 years, Cuisle has been a core part of the IWA as well as the community in Donamon, providing employment and social opportunities for people in the locality, as well as providing accessible holiday and respite for people with physical disabilities, particularly at a time when Cuisle first opened and when there were few or no alternatives for people with physical disabilities.  The board and management of the IWA understand and share the sadness of those who visit and work in Cuisle at the news that the facility will not reopen in 2020.  The difficult decision to close the Cuisle building has not come easily and was made by the board of the IWA on 18 October last following over two years of trying to find an alternative solution.</p> <p>  The building, which is not owned by the IWA and the lease on which expires in 2026, is in need of significant repair works, including full electrical installation and fire safety upgrades.  These will cost in the region of &euro;1.15 million at a minimum.  We are aware that there is asbestos in the building and there is a high risk that if this is disturbed during construction the cost of necessary remedial works could escalate significantly.  The IWA does not have the funds to pay for these essential upgrades, which are vital to keeping the leased building open for respite.  During the period 2017 to 2019, there were a number of IWA board visits to Cuisle and a full meeting of the board took place in Cuisle during 2017.  Also during this period, Cuisle was discussed at 14 of 21 the association's board meetings.  In March 2018, the IWA commenced implementation of a new social enterprise business model for Cuisle and invested from its own funds to generate new income for Cuisle as demonstration of its commitment to continuing to provide services there, subject to the funds to pay for the essential upgrade works becoming available.  For over two years, the IWA has engaged extensively with public representatives and funders but unfortunately there is no funding available to complete the essential capital works and no viable alternative has been proposed to the association by any third party.</p> <p>  The board has a legal obligation to everyone who stays in Cuisle and had no choice but to make the decision to close the building at the end of November.  Cuisle usually closes from December to February annually due to limited bookings during this period.  The IWA acknowledges the loss of employment associated with the closure of Cuisle and the impact on the local community.  We are grateful to the staff for their commitment and dedication to the Cuisle-based service and the local community for their support over many years.</p> <p>  Over the past number of weeks, the IWA has been in discussion with Cuisle staff and their representatives.  All staff have received an "expressions of interests" letter and form, the purpose of which is to capture their preferences with regard to redundancy or redeployment.  At time of writing, 19 November, 25 of 42 staff had returned this form, with 24 choosing redundancy and one opting for redeployment.  the IWA has written to all impacted staff with an estimate of their redundancy entitlement in accordance with the terms of the redundancy package agreed on their behalf with SIPTU.  The IWA will write again to Cuisle staff with a final calculation of their redundancy entitlements when any corrections or amendments have been made following the circulation of the redundancy estimates letters.  A small number of staff will remain in employment at Cuisle for two to four weeks after 29 November to assist with the closure.  Future use of the Cuisle facility will be a matter for the owners of the building.  The IWA assumes that any future use will be contingent on completion of the required capital works.</p><p> In response to the difficult decision to close the Cuisle facility, and to ensure continued provision of holiday respite breaks, the IWA will commence its new holiday service in the west to provide a wide range of choices to people with disabilities seeking to take a supported respite holiday in the region by partnering with fully accessible hotels.  This new and innovative service will commence in March 2020 in collaboration with the HSE.  Cuisle ordinarily closes between December and February, which means that there will be a limited impact on guests during that period.  Our new holiday service will provide people with a modern, inclusive hotel break in a range of locations with easy access to local towns and a wider choice of amenities.  It will also enable people with disabilities to take an enjoyable holiday with friends or family in the same hotel as chosen by them from a selection of options.</p><p> The IWA has been operating comparable hotel breaks in Kilkenny since 2018 and has received positive feedback from our guests.  This service was shortlisted for an Irish healthcare centre award in 2019.  Some of the feedback that we have received includes "staff excellent", "food excellent", "feel equal going on holidays with everyone else", "I no longer feel like people with disabilities are in a box", "it is all excellent" and "you gave us a great holiday, not just respite".</p><p> The IWA has developed a range of holiday respite options for all of our guests regardless of their level of support requirement - low, medium or high.  The IWA will provide support to guests on a tailored individual basis.  We will ensure that guests have everything they need, including fully accessible en suite bedrooms, specialised beds, aids and appliances, hoists, support with medication management and clinical tasks, and the IWA's 24-7, staffed and skilled personal assistance service.  The IWA's fully accessible transport can be arranged during holiday breaks and will be available to provide transport to activities and events in the community.</p><p> An information sheet included in the documents provided to the committee has been distributed and explained to our members through more than 252 engagement meetings at our resource and outreach centres across the country.  The IWA and HSE representatives were invited by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to meet on Tuesday, 12 November to provide the necessary reassurances in respect of what is a fundamentally progressive and innovative way of meeting the needs of people with disabilities who wish to avail of holiday respite breaks and to bridge the gap that will arise from the closure of Cuisle.  The IWA has stressed to the Minister of State that the clear choice and preference of people with disabilities is increasingly more about having access to fully inclusive settings where existing commercial hotel provider settings implement universal design initiatives to accommodate people of all levels of ability.</p><p> It goes without saying that the new model of service will be different.  It will be a big change for those who have loved going to Cuisle.  We are optimistic, based on the feedback from those who have availed of our Kilkenny services, that as time goes on and people get a chance to experience this form of holiday respite break, they will see the benefits of enjoying it.  The IWA has a 60-year track record of ensuring that our services meet the wants and needs of our members.  We will continue to adapt and innovate to ensure that this remains true in future.</p><p> I thank the committee members for listening.  Mr. Cunningham and I welcome whatever questions they may have.</p></speech>

As someone who has fundraised for the IWA many times and who, through my more than 20 years of radio work before becoming an Oireachtas Member, did significant work for the IWA and gave it support and publicity, I am deeply disappointed and distraught over its moves.  I will first ask about the end of Ms Keogh's presentation, for which I thank her.  She stated:</p> <blockquote> 	The IWA has a 60-year track record of ensuring that our services meet the wants and needs of our members.  We will continue to adapt and innovate to ensure that this remains true in future. </blockquote> <p>If so, why did the IWA not consult its 2,000-plus members?  My understanding is that it is the advocate for service users.  Why did it not consult its staff, given that this has been under discussion for two years?</p></speech>

That is an important clarification.</p></speech>

Our board is composed almost entirely of IWA members.  Our agenda, including our advocacy agenda, is always driven by our members.  I have expressed the disappointment of the board and management of the IWA in coming to this decision.  It has not been an easy one and has taken two years.  Ultimately, the organisation has a legal obligation to everyone who uses the building and we cannot guarantee the safety of the building into the future.  We have made extensive representations to resource the funding, but the funding was not available.</p> <p>  The service is not ceasing.  Rather, it is changing and moving to a new model.  I understand that this is disappointing and upsetting for those who are regular visitors to Cuisle and who have made many happy memories there, but there are serious issues with the building.  I would challenge anyone who made any other decision in this situation.  I would not want to be sitting before the committee in a year's time explaining the outcome of a fire or an electrical accident.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.1659" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1342" speakername="Eugene Murphy" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019112100002#C01200"><p>That is a fair point, but why has the IWA brought the issue of the building's dangers into the arena now?  I am a public representative and have been in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann since 2016.  I have checked my records.  There was no representation, letter or phone call.  I brought the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to Roscommon in 2017.  It was one of the first ministerial visits that I brought to the county.  We brought him to Donamon, where I met Ms Jean Coleman and members of staff.  There was never any mention of a need to replace any part of the building.  The Minister of State stood outside with me and the manager and said that it was a fantastic facility and that he would always be available to assist.  The IWA received &euro;39.4 million in its last budget.  If Ms Keogh has the figure, how much did the IWA receive in voluntary contributions, in other words, fundraisers, throughout the country?  Many of those fundraisers were in County Roscommon.</p></speech>

Every year, the IWA generates approximately &euro;7 million of its own funding through a variety of activities - fundraising, our retail shops, grant sources and our social enterprises.  I cannot think off the top of my head of the value of our fundraising.  I have the financial statements with me, however, so I can pull the figure out for the Deputy.  It is not a large amount of money and is in the region of approximately &euro;1 million spread across all of our activities.  In 2018, the IWA put &euro;1.9 million of our own funding into supporting the continuation of services that were funded by the HSE.  There is a serious deficit issue in the funding from the HSE.  The HSE's funding is managed under the service arrangement process.  As such, each service has a specific amount and service level allocated to it.  It is not within our gift to change that without consulting the HSE.  In any case, all of our services are underfunded.  If we were to take money from another service, that service would be in jeopardy.</p></speech>

We took on the building in 1997 and developed it extensively over the past 22 years.  Most of that was funded by grants and local fundraising.  The staff in the past year raised funds towards the matching funding for the LEADER grant, which were some of the figures to which the Deputy referred.  We qualified for 75% of a &euro;216,000 LEADER grant.  We had to then raise &euro;50,000 for that.  Some &euro;25,000 was secured through the Athlone municipal district.  The remainder was fundraised locally.  That fund is still there, as it was not spent.  The LEADER grant was also not spent because we would have been undoing the work of the grant with the electrical works.  The grant was for the upgrade and removal of the institutional look of Cuisle to try to make it more like a hotel and, therefore, more appealing to the public and more comfortable for our members.  This would involve a theme running through the centre, such as a hotel, and enhancing the look of the corridors, bedrooms, en suite bathrooms and reception area, including carpets and wallpaper and so on.  The problem was if one were to then do the electrical and fire-safety works, one would need to chase the wiring through the wallpaper and the carpets.  We asked about this on a number of occasions and the Roscommon LEADER Partnership has worked very well with us.  That fund still sits there on hold.  It would have been negligent of us to spend that money and undo a lot of the work later on.  The funds that were raised were then put towards that.  I am not be familiar with the entire series of smaller fundraisers.  Individual staff members also run fundraising events and some people make donations and so on.</p></speech>

Am I correct that the association has some 2,300 workers in total?</p></speech>

There are some 20,000 members.  There is no question about the way the association has treated the staff in Donamon, after all they have done and do, and with their service going way beyond the call of duty.  It is fair to ask the witnesses why, if they had these problems for two years, the association did not meet the staff and local politicians?  Why did the association treat the staff so shabbily in the end by not informing them until the last minute of this decision?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.1668" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Cunningham" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019112100002#D00700"><p>It is not accurate to say staff were not aware of the decision.  I attended three general staff meetings and my purpose for being there was to update the staff team on the issues and on the efforts that were being made to secure the funding.  It is not my job to inform staff that a place might be closing or that we might not get funding.  It damages the business and it damages morale.  We tried to be as upbeat as we could in our efforts all through that period.  I recall three staff meetings where we looked at that.  Staff were aware of the bigger issue.  I went as far as saying that if we did not get the money, I did not know what would happen, and that it was not good but we were working away on the issues.  That is the information we gave and I have said this at other meetings.</p> <p>  It has been asked why this is happening at this point in time.  I was at the meeting and it was devastating.  There is no right time, be it 1 January or 1 December.  It was one of the toughest things I was ever involved in.  With regard to the time of the year, it has come after we were sure there was no funding coming.  At this time of year, Cuisle usually closes for most of December, January and into February.  A month's notice was agreed to pay people for the additional notice period as required.  There is no right time and it has been devastating for the staff.  It was the end of the road.  As Ms Keogh said, the board has the legal responsibility for everybody's safety in the building.  We cannot guarantee that now.  This is why the issue was discussed at so many board meetings in the past two years, including our efforts to secure the funding.</p> <p>  I also refer to her point about the financial position in the organisation.  Our fundraising efforts around the country were to maintain essential services, and this was covered at a meeting here some weeks ago.  The association does not have the money to do these works.  We do not own the building.  It is leased, and the lease will be out in a few years.  Accessibility has improved in the community.  I am at a loss about what to say to say to the staff.  I have met many of them on a one-to-one or group basis and there are no words for it.</p> <p>  As Ms Keogh said, the service is looking at transitioning into the community.  The first place we looked at was Roscommon with regard to hotels and how that might create opportunities for the staff locally as a redeployment option.  This was not possible in Roscommon because the necessary accessibility, the numbers of rooms and the interest in partnering with us was not there.  We are also looking at places such as Ballinasloe, which is a commutable distance, where we looked at redeployment options for people.  Originally, we were considering two hotels - one in Galway city and one in Ballinasloe - but to create more sustainable jobs for redeployment, we went for a longer, full-year effect in Ballinasloe to start with.  These are the redeployment opportunities we have put out there for people, our colleagues, and the uptake on that is very low.  One can always do things differently, and everyone could say that.  There is no right way of doing it.  I am at a loss in one way.</p></speech>

I have gone through the witnesses' supplementary information on LEADER grants, assistance from the Athlone municipal district and the moneys on hold.  I am quite confused about that.</p> <p>  I met the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, on 12 November 2019.  I would like clarification on the funding.  I was informed by him that the IWA board had approved &euro;65,000 to commence immediate fire safety issues.  This meeting happened in July 2017.  The organisation, however, required the balance of &euro;423,862 by the end of September 2017.  I understand that the HSE advised the IWA that its funding application would be escalated to the HSE head of operations for disability services.  I was advised by the Minister of State at the meeting on 12 November that the IWA confirmed that the work would be planned on a phased basis so the centre would not close.  He also advised that he had been informed by the HSE head of operations - I refer to email correspondence I have - that funding was provided at that time.  Will the witnesses indicate if this funding was provided?  If it was provided, was it drawn down?

The &euro;423,000 figure was estimated in 2017-18 before we brought in the engineers and the quantity surveyors.  When we had the professional advice, the total cost of the work was estimated at &euro;1.15 million.  At no point did the HSE approve funding for the IWA for capital works in Cuisle.  That is all I can say on it.  I do not know of any conversation between the Minister of State and the HSE.  In all our engagement with the HSE on this issue over the past two years, it has been clear that it cannot provide any funding for the capital works in Cuisle.</p></speech>

Jean Coleman, the manager of Cuisle, and I went to LEADER to ask if we could change the application to go towards the electrical works.  I have clarified this since with LEADER because it came up recently in Cuisle.  I knew the facts but I just went back to them.  We were informed that, under the EU rules, LEADER funding could not be used for statutory requirements in terms of building compliance so we could not change it over.  It would be different if as part of the upgrade we were doing up a few lights in a room, from a small, aesthetical point of view.  It came up at the meeting recently in Cuisle and I rang LEADER on the way home to confirm that was the situation still and they confirmed it.</p></speech>

Our application went in for what I will call the wallpaper, for enhancing the look of the building in Cuisle, to lift all of that.  We called it a major renovation project.  That was literally for putting in accessible doors at the front and for doing up the corridors, some bedrooms and en suites - that type of softer stuff.  That is what the LEADER grant was for and it was part of the strategy that we have talked about.  We had engaged a sales and marketing officer to work with Cuisle.  We had travelled the UK to see the project Revitalise Respite Holidays had done.  We had developed our website built on the branding.  We were preparing for that external market to create a more inclusive environment and to generate the income to support the delivery of services because we are a section 39 organisation.  We went back to LEADER to ask for clarity.  We said that if there were no electrics, there would be no need for wallpaper.  It is not just about wallpaper, I am just throwing that in, but there would be no need for the softer things.  We were told categorically that the funding could not be used.  The Senator can check that with Roscommon LEADER Partnership.  It is a different fund altogether.</p></speech>

I have spoken about the works that Mr. Cunningham has said are required.  I am going to move on in terms of the model of care.  The opening statement indicates that it is about providing a wide range of choice to people with disabilities.  I find that very disingenuous in the context of the many people who have contacted me and, I am sure, others here in regard to the service that is provided in Cuisle.  I do not think that is very reflective of providing clear choice in what is being presented today.  I would like our guests to speak specifically about the wide range of choices they are providing.  I have worked as an occupational therapist so I am very aware of the needs of people with disabilities.  The opening statement says the service "will provide support to guests on a tailored individual basis" and "will ensure guests have fully accessible en suite bedrooms".  I would like to know where the hotels are.  Are they set up to facilitate people?  Are staff in place?  I would like a little bit more information about the Kilkenny model.  How many people has it facilitated since it was set up?  How many beds are in place there?  We have really little to no evidence in terms of closure of one service and providing a better replacement service.  That is why we are extremely concerned.  Staff are concerned, service users are concerned, families are concerned, public representatives are concerned.  I would like specific answers.  There was a reference to Ballinasloe.  Is Ballinasloe set up?  Is there provision of en suite bedrooms, specialised beds, hoists, support with medication management, and clinical tasks?  Are all of those set up?  We know that people have varying needs.  Surely the IWA, as was also outlined in the opening statement, wants to provide low, medium and high-level support?</p></speech>

I will do my best to answer them all in the time allowed.  The first thing I will say when it comes to choice of service is that closing Cuisle is not a choice that the IWA wanted to make.  If the building was safe and secure for use into the future this decision would not have been made.  It was made because it is not safe to continue to operate a service there and unfortunately we do not have the funding to rectify that and no State agency has been able to offer us that funding.</p> <p>  In terms of the service, we talk about how we will provide for people.  We are providing this service fully in Kilkenny currently.  We have people who visit the service in Kilkenny.  I visited it earlier this year and stayed with a group of IWA guests who were there at the time whose needs varied from the very low to the very high.  IWA staff are in the hotel with the visitors 24-7.  IWA-trained personal assistants who are doing this type of work day in, day out and have been for many years are providing the service in the hotels to our guests.  All of the equipment that is needed is provided by the IWA.  We bring in fully adjustable hoists that will go from bed to bathroom and fully en suite rooms.  We are providing clinical care and medication management.  We are currently providing all of the services currently provided in Cuisle, albeit on a much smaller scale, in our service in Kilkenny.  We will be able to replicate, develop and grow those services and continue to add more services to our members in the three new hotels we will be operating from March 2020.</p></speech>

Many questions have already been asked.  Really what I am a little bit perplexed about is this change of model from a purpose-built centre with people who have skills that they have honed over many years and who have developed a service which by all account from the service users and their families is first class and which they want to maintain, and moving to a model which apart from the experimental model in Kilkenny is pretty much untested.  That concerns me greatly.  I see the sheet here which says that the hotel respite breaks are available in various places.  I just contacted a couple of hotels this morning.  I rang them and asked what the story would be if somebody in a wheelchair with particular needs and who requires a hoist were to book accommodation.  I will not name the four hotels I contacted but all of them basically said, &quot;No, not a hope.&quot;  That was just <i>ad hoc</i>but it is the experience of an awful lot of the families of those who have chronic conditions and significant needs and who need to have a care atmosphere around them.  Cuisle has provided that when nowhere else could provide it.</p></speech>

I understand that the people who own the building are prepared to assist in any way they can in regard to guarantees or whatever else in the future to help with being able to secure finance or assistance from whomever.  In many of these cases, the State plays its part and the voluntary sector plays its part, as does everybody else.  It is about getting the right mix, co-ordinating it properly and trying to find a model that will work and deliver.  Ms Keogh is telling us that, despite the association's best efforts - and we will take that at face value although there are others who would say otherwise - it has not been able to do that up to now.  Given the profile this issue has attained in the past few weeks, does she believe that, between now and Christmas, we could be in a position to work out a solution?  Would the board be open to that?</p></speech>

I will take each in turn before getting to the last one.  He spoke about the telephone calls he had made to the hotels.  If one rings any hotel in Ireland and asks if they have hoists, they will say they do not have them.  I refer to what is unique about the IWA's model of service.  I challenge the assumption that it is an experimental model.  It has been in place for more than 18 months and it is constantly fully booked.  We cannot keep up with the demand for the service.  I believe we have gone past experimental at this point.</p> <p>  As regards the hotels we are working with in Kilkenny and those we will be working with in the new model for people who have previously visited Cuisle, we concluded the procurement process with those hotels yesterday.  We will be able to provide the same number of bed nights that were HSE funded in Cuisle in 2019 and into 2020.  That is 1,700 bed nights, and probably more than that as things grow.</p> <p>  With regard to equipment, hoists, beds and so forth, the IWA provides all the equipment in the hotel environment.  If people wish to book a break through the IWA, they call our regional respite manager, say where and when they want to go and how many people wish to go.  We go into great detail with them about their requirements, be it medication, clinical tasks, personal assistant service, equipment and so forth, and we provide it on site.  The people who work for the IWA providing that service are part of our personal assistance services.  The association provides 1.2 million personal assistance hours on behalf of the HSE every year.  It is by far the largest provider of personal assistance services in Ireland.  We know how to do this and we do it well.</p> <p>  In the context of the decision for the board and whether we could bring something back to the board if funding became available, if there is a realistic proposal on the table we will bring it back.  We have not seen anything in that regard at this point.  The only caveat I would add is that, at present, the estimate we have for the cost of works is &euro;1.15 million.  We are greatly concerned that if we start pulling down walls, ripping out fuse boards and so forth, the asbestos in the building will be disturbed.  If that happens, we are facing an inestimable cost and the question of who will pay for it.</p></speech>

The other issue is that the people we deal with here, the users of the service whom the association very generously works with, are people who do not have many choices in their lives.  One of the points they are making to public representatives is that it is their choice to have a special place, which Cuisle provided.  That is what they want.  There is a responsibility on us as public representatives and also on the association to do everything we can to deliver that choice.  We must try to move this forward in that context.  All Members of the Oireachtas would play their part in trying to move it forward.  However, I am still slightly perplexed about the board.  One of the matters that has come through in all of this, and it appears to be the case for everyone we talked to, is that people were unaware that it was at this level of crisis until very recently.  If this crisis was developing, we would have thought that the board, conscious of the possibility of having to close this centre, would be shouting from the rooftops much sooner to try to resolve the situation.</p></speech>

We have laid out who we contacted very clearly in our supplementary information.  We were in contact with two Ministers very early and both of them ultimately directed us towards HSE capital.  The HSE is our funder and we dealt with the HSE through the normal protocol.  We did not know until recently that there would be no funding available.  We were in a process with the HSE and the Government over the last two years on this matter.  We did not deliberately not contact anybody.

The association contacted Ministers or senior people in the Government.  That was its choice.  Did it make them aware of how serious this crisis was becoming?

The protocol was to go through the HSE.  That was a given and we went through it at that early stage, so we would not have had a follow-up with everybody.  That is the avenue we took.  We engaged immediately.  I met Department of Health officials and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  They ultimately directed us to the HSE.  The Deputies I met spoke about their support for the project and said they would communicate their support to the Minister of State as well.  We have been working with the HSE since then.</p> <p>  The landscape has changed.  Take the example of the national children's hospital and the funding required for that.  Ms Keogh outlined the financial position in which we found ourselves.  Pay restoration for the sector was a major issue and had a big impact on the association.  That lobbying was taking place and was a pressure on the system, the HSE and the Department.  There was the underfunding of services and the increasing costs due to regulation, including insurance alone.  The external environment changed along the way but we had been following the recognised route for funding through the HSE for an organisation such as ours.</p></speech>

Ms Keogh is right and I have said publicly on numerous occasions that the board and the association would not have decided at this point to move from Cuisle except for the situation that we find ourselves in.  The design team is made up of electrical engineers, who were brought in first, fire safety consultants, the quantity surveyor and the architect.  People asked where the &euro;1.15 million in known costs comes from.  There is a question of whether that calculation and those drawings exist.  I presented all of that to the landlords.  There is an issue regarding procurement and EU directives.  It is not rocket science that we cannot throw out a lot of information.  People say that the money will come and the works will be done, whether by the Irish Wheelchair Association or the landlord.  We have invested substantially in bringing this to where it is.  I met the landlord last week with my colleague and we shared all the work done to date.  The landlord was very satisfied with the financial investment that the association had made to bring it to that point.  We showed the landlord all the drawings and specifications for the electrical and fire safety works.  The unknowns are the big concern, bearing in mind that it is a leased building.  We had an asbestos report done and there is both known and unknown asbestos.  Unknown means that the heating system is probably all insulated with asbestos, because the building is from the 1960s.  I do not know how many members have been to Cuisle.  Deputies Harty and Naughten know it.  It is a huge, three storey building.  There is a long corridor to another building.  It is more than 3,000 sq. m in size.  If the heating system fails, that would cost hundreds of thousands more.</p> <p>  When we looked at our investment and planning, we were looking at a long-term facility.  Sales and marketing work was done.  The website was developed.  Our vision was that this would grow bigger and better over time.  The energy rating in the building is pretty poor, but people focus on the beautiful views from the windows.  There are huge windows in every bedroom and the heat flies out through them.  It is a mass concrete building, and that has to be considered.  If one is doing work on one's own home, one will look at the bigger picture to see if it is worth doing up the house or if it is better to knock it down and build a new one.  While we talk about &euro;1.15 million to address known issues, that is all we will do.  To go back to the question of what we would do if we got the money in the morning, we would have to consider that it is an estimate of &euro;1.15 million.  I am told that it could be 5% more because that estimate was a year ago.  It is only when it goes to tender that one knows what the actual price will be.  It has to be considered whether it is worth doing it.  The lease goes until 2026.  The Divine Word is open to extending that further and we asked it about the matter previously.  If that money is invested and the heating fails, what will happen?  The process has been verified with the HSE and the Department of Health, and the IWA does not have money for this.</p></speech>

I have a special gr&aacute; for Cuisle.  I was involved when it was a musty old seminary that had not been used for two decades.  It brought back other memories for me but those are not the business of this meeting.  I will tell Mr. Cunningham that the building has mass concrete walls internally, for the en suites, which was a surprising find at the time.  I first heard about this when people with disabilities on social media engaged with me.  They were very sad, upset and worried about it.  Added to that were people from a number of organisations for Huntington's disease, spina bifida, ataxia and such like.  The Chairman is a medical doctor and has particular understanding of the complexities of some of those issues and the stigma related to them for people as they advance, and all of the different elements of some of those and other conditions.</p> <p>  While I knew this already, it has been said to me again over the past couple of weeks that Cuisle was a home from home.  It was a safe place where the staff were people's family.  As somebody with polio, it is important for me to have time out with others with polio, to give out about doctors, medics and consultants and who is the best one to go to, save in the Chairman's presence.  People can exchange how they work things out and what works for them.  It is more than gossip.  There could be many more places using the hotel model, but something would be missing if there was no Cuisle.  The association said that if it had the money to keep Cuisle going and this issue had not arisen, its intention was to keep the show on the road.  We need to come back to that, whether today or after today.</p> <p>  There is much local, community and political interest in what Cuisle is and the value that it has had.  I regularly travel to various countries in Europe.  Not only is there no Cuisle anywhere else in Ireland but I have not heard of one anywhere else in Europe.  It is a gem.  Following up on what Deputy Kenny has said, people are raw, sour and hurting about what has happened over the past month or so.  From an employer's point of view, nobody likes making people redundant.  I made five people redundant in my own organisation in the past five or six months.  Deputy Kenny talked about the level of crisis.  It is not just that Cuisle is an issue.  The Irish Wheelchair Association runs personal assistance services that it cannot keep up with.  There is a crisis across the whole platform of funding for people with disabilities.  Everyone in the Oireachtas knows that from the representations they get, and we try to plug holes in places.</p> <p>  A number of statements have been made by our witnesses.  Can we find a way to have them signed off?  They referred to what they have received from the LEADER programme and such.  Can we find a way to agree what playing pitch we are on and to confirm what the IWA said about the sums of money, such as the &euro;400,000?  There is great interest in solving this issue here and people with disabilities keenly want it to be solved.  Any chief executive such as myself cannot speak for an organisation's board when the board has not yet made a decision but has to play the ball he or she is given.  The reason for the decision related to funding.  If the issue of funding can be decommissioned, there is a possibility that we could get back in action.  I do not want to overplay that but this needs other players.</p><p>It is clear the people in government and in the HSE have not yet put their hands in their pockets for the money, or even returned to say the figure is inflated and that it will cost only &euro;500,000.  Is that fair to say?  Has anybody contradicted the figure of &euro;1.15 million?</p></speech>

We stand over the statements we have made on the LEADER funding and the assertion made to Senator Hopkins in respect of the HSE offering the IWA &euro;400,000 at one stage.  It did not make such an offer and that is all I can tell the committee in that regard.</p> <p>  On the assurances needed, the IWA is not the body to give those assurances.  We can tell the committee about our interactions but that is all we can do.  We cannot speak for any other organisation and it for other organisations to speak for themselves.  As I stated in my opening statement, everybody is sad about the decision.  Nobody wanted it to come to this.  Cuisle has been part of the fabric of the IWA for 22 years and the Senator was involved in establishing it in the 1990s.  It has been a difficult time for our board members.  I remind the committee that a number of our board members regularly holiday at Cuisle and were among the people who made the decision.  It has not been an easy decision for anybody to make.</p> <p>  The Senator talked about Cuisle being a safe place.  I hope we have demonstrated during the meeting that, unfortunately, Cuisle will no longer be a safe place in respect of the structure of the building and related issues.  I reiterate that even if the funding was to become available, &euro;1.15 million is not the solution to the problem.  The figure is &euro;1.15 million based on our current estimates, which are now one year old.  We would also need assurances that if the sum is larger, asbestos is uncovered, there are issues with the water treatment works or whatever else there might be, there will have to be enforceable commitments that the funding will also be available into the future.  Otherwise, in a year's time, having drawn down the &euro;1.15 million, we could rip the building asunder and discover we will need another &euro;1 million.</p></speech>

I do not know anyone currently working at Cuisle but I knew people who were there at the start.  Cuisle's success has been partly, albeit significantly, helped by the attitude, orientation and approach of the people working there.  Over the years, the people of Roscommon have come to know about Cuisle and it is an important issue.  I will not make a case that might be made by a trade union but rather a business case.  If we cannot keep Cuisle, it will not just be the building that will have to be replaced but the more difficult part will have to be replaced, namely, the calibrated and qualified staff.  I do not refer even to staff with professional qualifications but instead to people who know what the organisation is about.  That unquantified asset will be lost.  I would like us to leave the meeting having cleared out the ground, in order that we will know exactly what we have agreed on and understand, to see how we can all get stuck in and keep the show on the road.</p></speech>

Towards the end of the IWA's presentation, however, I heard the alternative, on which we have not heard much detail, being presented as progressive and innovative, as if to suggest that what is going on at Cuisle is not progressive.  It worries me that that is the language of people trying to build a case for a decision they have made.  It also worries me that when our guests spoke about having been upbeat in their efforts, or when they said to staff that if they did not get the money, they do not know what they would do, that is a "don't frighten the horses" type of approach that I do not regard as a professional approach to saving a service.  If the IWA is serious about getting money from the State or other sources, the political machinery will involve going public with the risks, dangers and needs at an early stage, and it certainly will not involve tip-toeing around and saying to staff, "Gosh, I do not know what will happen" and so on, while perhaps the board gets ready for a decision it will have to take, as sure as there is a cross in an ass.</p> <p>  Was the effort high on spin and low on consultation?  When, for example, did the Divine Word Missionaries become aware that the IWA was seriously considering the possibility of closing the service?  I refer to one important stakeholder.</p></speech>

I am talking about going to the media and saying Cuisle is in danger of closing in a couple of years if we do not raise X amount of money.  The Divine Word Missionaries are in for &euro;125,000 and that leaves a shortfall.  It appears from everything the witness has said so far that there have been board meetings preparing for the announcement but the approach with regard to the staff is not to frighten the horses.  Knowing which politicians the centre has engaged with would be helpful.</p> <p>  Generally speaking, when voluntary organisations are at risk of closing - and we have had this only this year - they go public very quickly.  I speak of political machinery in the form of getting the public onside for something the organisation wants to achieve.  I am wondering if the witnesses really wanted to save the Cuisle centre and if they did, why we were all not hearing strongly that the service, including the 48 jobs, was at risk.

In 2018, the board of the Irish Wheelchair Association agreed to invest in developing the sales and marketing and branding of Cuisle.  We put in &euro;65,000 of the IWA's money to do the initial remedial works as a demonstration of our commitment to continuing the service but that was always going to be contingent on us having the money.  We deal with the HSE and we are contracted to provide services for it.  We went to public representatives who referred us back to the HSE and we have gone through the channels we are required to work under as part of the service arrangements process.  It was always our intention to keep Cuisle open and there was no long-term plan to close it.  I restate that everybody in the IWA, including the staff, board, management and, most important, the guests and service users of the centre are devastated about where we have come to.</p></speech>

We link directly with the hotels and we have an agreement with them that we will book up to a certain number of rooms per year, although we are not bound by that.  We do not have to do it and if the demand was not there, we would not have to pay for all those hotel rooms.  We would pay for them as they are used.</p></speech>

We started with the Kilkenny model.</p></speech>

Once it was set up we saw it was a great success.  We were looking to expand that around the country.  For example, the HSE area in the south had expressed an interest and we put a proposal together for it.  The funding has not come forward at this point but it is looking to source the funding to operate a similar model in the south using a hotel facility.  We always had members and people from Ireland and abroad contacting us and looking for details of accessible hotels.  We were looking to see if we could roll this out around the country so people could have more options.</p> <p>  It is not about the hotels.  In 1997 there was a lack of accessibility in general and even at shops there may have been steps at the doors.  Shopping centres and hotels are now more accessible and they are around the country.</p></speech>

I did not ask about steps at hotels, shops or anywhere else.  On the decision to take an alternative route, from what I and others have garnered, it appears that was made a year ago at least.</p></speech>

Did the organisation then go back to the landlords?  I presume the lease has conditions for reviews every two, five or ten years, for example.  Did the organisation involve itself in any discussion with the landlords with a view to working out a lease that would be more favourably disposed to carrying on with the facility that the organisation had on foot of a reduction in the rent?</p></speech>

Approximately three or four months ago, when we were at a point that we were really concerned about funding not being available for Cuisle, we started exploring what other hotels were accessible in the west of Ireland.  If we came to a point where we had to make the decision to close the Cuisle centre because of the lack of funding, we would be prepared to offer our guests and service users an alternative model of service as soon as possible.  It is not true that the decision was made a year ago and I have already stated that in 2018, the board made a decision to invest in the Cuisle centre and complete the works subject to funding becoming available.  The Kilkenny process started 18 months ago and it is not related to Cuisle.  We were fortunate in that we had already developed the model and it has given us something to build on and provide an alternative service for people who go to Cuisle.</p> <p>  We entered negotiations with the landlords and in 2018 they offered to extend the lease.  Had we been able to avail of the funding, we would have accepted the offer to extend the lease and do the works.</p></speech>

We had to go through the tender process to get the costings, etc., for that particular project.  Anyone who has dealt with tendering will know that it is quite extensive.  I wish to make another clarification.  This is an elephant in the room of which people might not be aware.  It is to do with the Donamon campus, particularly Donamon Castle.  I am not sure who has been to Donamon and who has not, but I note that the site includes the Divine Word Missionaries castle at the gate.  That is the private residence of the priests who live there.  When we were having these discussions there were only four people living in the castle.  I stress that we have a very positive relationship with them.  That order also has a print works on site.  Divine Word Missionaries' environment in Ireland has very much changed.  This is the order's view.  Part of our discussions with the order concerned the whole campus.  At one point its members encouraged us to take on the castle as a fundraising asset.  The inside of the castle is absolutely beautiful.  It has stucco ceilings, if that is what they are called.  We have surveyed every inch of it, from the roof down to the basements.</p></speech>

At this point, we had talked about the property as a liability.  We moved on from that and looked at the castle from top to bottom.  We brought down our property projects manager and the previous CEO.  If memory serves me correctly, the Divine Word Missionaries had spent something of the order of &euro;60,000 at that stage trying to find leaks where water was coming through the roof, either through the pointing in the stones or the parapets.  Fr. Pat Hogan told me that he had been woken up one night by an unmerciful bang.  He came out to find the ceiling of the hall had collapsed.  There is asbestos in the building.  However, it is a private residence.  Once it becomes a public building it will be subject to a different set of regulations.</p></speech>

It is partly to do with people having greater access to other venues around the country than they would have had in 1997.  Another reason is a lack of disposable income among people with disabilities.  The Cuisle facility is not fully funded.  We get a contribution from the HSE towards the cost of running Cuisle.  The rest of our costs have to be met from guest contributions or from our catering business, our bar or other independent guests who might visit.  We had the BDO business plan drawn up to see how to attract more external income to subsidise the service, which was in deficit. All of those factors operate together.  Some of the decrease is because people are accessing holidays abroad or in other hotels in Ireland.  That is a reality which we accept.  Part of the reason concerns budgets.  We do not have the funding to support people.  Another part of it concerns our limited staffing at Cuisle.  There are only so many staff members available to support people with various requirements.</p></speech>

From what I gather the IWA is running two models of care.  One is Cuisle and the other makes use of hotels around the country.  What proportion of guests, clients or service users go to Cuisle as opposed to going to hotels?  Has the proportion of service users using hotels as opposed to Cuisle increased?</p></speech>

However, this is related to Deputy Durkan's question on why we have gone from 9,000 bed-nights to 4,000 in the last ten years.  The Kilkenny hotel model was set up for a very specific purpose 18 months ago.  We have 57 resource and outreach centres located throughout the country.  The IWA members and service users who attend those centres all go on holidays supported by IWA every year, some of them several times a year.  In the past ten years, we have found that more and more of those people choose to go abroad on a holiday, or choose to stay in a hotel for a holiday.  We have definitely seen an increased demand for the hotel model.  That said, we fully accept that for some people Cuisle is a very special place and it is their preference.</p></speech>

Do our guests believe that this was right, particularly as they have admitted in evidence that the IWA had been considering alternatives for the past three to four months?  They also stated that, if funding had been found, they would have brought a proposal to the board.  Will Mr. Cunningham confirm to the committee that he told staff that, even if funding had been available, Cuisle would have been unlikely to reopen because of the issues he has raised here?  Will he confirm that I met him on 20 July 2017 and committed to communicating with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath?  When Mr. Cunningham met him on 24 July, did the Minister of State confirm to him that I had made contact and was supportive of the project in Donamon?  Given that our guests have made great play of the fact that the IWA met two then Cabinet attendees - the Minister of State and me - do they not believe that, when the HSE eventually reverted to the IWA to say that it would not be forthcoming with funding, it would have been worth their while to contact us again?  Will Ms Keogh confirm that, within 24 hours of the staff being informed, I made contact with her requesting an urgent meeting to explore the options available to us and the local community to keep the facility open?  Will she confirm that I subsequently contacted her on two further occasions in respect of that matter?  I have yet to receive a response to those requests.  In light of that, will our guests reconsider the evidence they have given to the committee regarding their willingness to postpone the decision if funding is made available?  The Minister of State has confirmed to me that he has also made this request twice.  That commitment has not been forthcoming.</p> <p>  Will our guests explain the speed with which the IWA has moved to complete a procurement process for 1,700 bed nights?  It went through the process within 20 days of informing the staff.  It seems that the board of the IWA has already made its decision.</p></speech>

I will do my best to address all of them.  If we leave anything out, please revert to me.</p> <p>  The staff at Cuisle have done a fantastic job and have been fabulous ambassadors for the IWA for the past 22 years.  It has been extremely difficult for the IWA to reach a position where we are making people redundant.  It is not something that we do lightly or without great thought.  Regarding the level of notice given to the staff, we have operated within the legislation.  Since the centre would have been due to close at the end of the first week in December anyway - it normally closes between then and some time in February - we did not believe that it would be fair to tell people on 1 November that they would be losing their jobs next February and then leave them sitting in limbo until then.  To reference some of Senator Dolan's points, it is never easy to make anyone redundant.  I have been on the receiving end of redundancy twice - it is devastating.  We accept that.  If there is an easier or better way to do it, we will reflect on it for the future.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Cunningham to provide clarification on the Deputy's meetings with him.  The Deputy contacted me within 24 hours of the notice of Cuisle's closure.  I asked Mr. Cunningham, as national director of services for Cuisle and a number of other IWA services, to contact the Deputy on my behalf and give him the background to and reasons for the closure, which I understand he did.  The Deputy sent two further emails to me requesting that certain actions be taken, including keeping the centre open for a further 12 months while solutions could be found.  As CEO, that is not within my remit or my gift to do, but I will relate those comments to the board.</p> <p>  Regarding our willingness to postpone the decision, it is not my decision to make.  As CEO of the IWA, my colleagues in management and I work at the behest of the board.  It is my job to execute the decisions of the board, and that is what I am doing.  If anyone brings a proposal back to me, I will bring it to the board.  I have not received any such proposal at this point.</p></speech>

I apologise if we have not been able to get back to everyone.</p> <p>  We have discussed the procurement process.  We began it a number of months ago as a contingency to ensure that, if we got to the point of having to close Cuisle, which we only reached on 18 October, we would be able to provide a service to our members from spring of next year and they would not be left without a holiday in 2020.  That is why the process was started a couple of months ago.  We had a backup plan.  The last thing we wanted to be doing was announcing that we had to close Cuisle when there was no alternative service in place.</p></speech>

To clarify, the service will cease and certain staff will finish on 29 November, but there will be a wind-down period for the rest of us.  It is not a matter of just walking away from the building or the service, even from a records point of view, given that the service will continue in the new year.  There is work to be done on that front.</p> <p>  We have indicated to the landlords that we need to talk to them about the lease and consider what they propose to do with the building afterwards.  We are leaving the building because of the works required.  Once we leave the lease, the question of what to do with the building will be the responsibility of the landlords or whoever takes it on.  Given the background, I do not know what will happen, but the assets will be considered in that context.</p></speech>

The visit to Revitalise Respite Holidays in the UK is historical.  When we were developing Cuisle and the marketing for it - the website and so on - the plan at the time was to grow Cuisle into a bigger and better place.  A previous speaker noted that the Cuisle model is unique in Ireland.  We discovered that an organisation called Revitalise Respite Holidays in the United Kingdom provides a venue like a hotel for holidays for people with disabilities.  The Cuisle manager and our commercial director flew to the UK to meet the management at Revitalise and see the facilities and returned on the same day.  The brochures were very glossy and the manager and commercial director visited to see what they could learn in one day, with a view to seeing what they could add to the development of Cuisle.  The trip had nothing to do with the redeployment of staff.</p></speech>

I would like to detach it from the redeployment issue if I may because they are completely separate timelines and issues.  In 2018, when the board of the Irish Wheelchair Association made the decision that we would invest in the further development of Cuisle, invest in sales and marketing for Cuisle and stay in the facility, further to being able to find the funding for the capital works, as part of our own investment in developing Cuisle, we spent &euro;200 travelling to the UK to learn from another provider that is an expert in this field.  We employed a sales and marketing resource who spent time with the staff in Cuisle, trained them in sales and marketing, approached other organisations and sought further bookings.  As members will see, there was a small increase in our bookings in 2018 and 2019 as a result of that.  There was also a small increase in Cuisle's income, independent of State funding, as a consequence.</p> <p>  In November 2019, when we were in the unfortunate position of having to announce redundancies, we wrote to all staff in Cuisle and asked them to return an expression of interest as to whether their preference was to be made redundant or take up an offer of redeployment.  To date, only one member of staff has taken up the offer of redeployment.  That person will be redeployed either in the new holiday model or within our personal assistance service.  That has been negotiated with the individual in question.</p></speech>

I do not want to class everybody as the same but there is a familiarity with buildings.  For example, we bring my sister-in-law to the same place every year on holidays because it is familiar to her, she knows the people and she would go berserk if we brought her somewhere else.  That is fundamental when we are planning our year.  It is important that there is familiarity and that people have their equipment and know where it is going to fit.  Knowing the bathroom is going to accommodate their chair, the bath fits and they have whatever else they need, and that their family members or whoever else goes with them are familiar with where fire exits are and all of that, is almost unquantifiable in terms of benefit to people.</p></speech>

I failed to contact the CEO.  She refused to take calls from me, which is strange.  It has not happened in my many years in public life that someone in such a position would not communicate with elected representatives, but Ms Keogh is here today.</p> <p>  I welcome Councillors Orla Leyden and Anthony Waldron and all the staff, members and friends of Cuisle.  They have made great efforts and a lot of work has gone into the area around Donamon and Castlecoote, and the whole county.  It is a national issue, not just local.  I thank the Divine Word Missionaries for their commitment to this project since 1997, to Seamus Thompson, who was chief executive at the time, and the dedicated staff who have committed themselves for so long and so well, and who are being treated in the most abhorrent manner by Ms Keogh, her staff and the board of the Irish Wheelchair Association.  I have never in my political life come cross anything like the way they have been treated.  I want to put that on record.  It is a very significant point.</p> <p>  Ms Keogh came here today with her mind made up.  She did not come here for dialogue.  She had her opening statement prepared and she submitted what she had decided to do before she came here today.  She was not interested in listening to the proposals and suggestions of the members of this committee, Oireachtas Members, councillors, supporters and friends of Cuisle.</p> <p>  I have many questions and I will use every minute I have.  I put the first question to Ms Keogh.  In light of the very strong case made by my colleagues, will she put to her board that, in justice, the IWA should postpone this decision for six to nine months to see what we can do?  We were not informed there was a problem.  I was not contacted.  As the longest serving Oireachtas Member in the county and the area, and as a neighbour of Cuisle, given our lands adjoin, I was not contacted.  However, I was involved when Charlie McCreevy and Brian Cowen provided up to &euro;1 million, although I do not know the exact amount.  I was involved with my colleagues and councillors in regard to the provision of specially designed fishing stands, the development of the roof and the development of the buildings.  I know that building back to front because I live beside it.  To avoid me having to put more questions that may have been answered, I am asking Ms Keogh to now give a commitment that she will go back to her board and say that, arising from the dialogue today at this important committee, she will postpone the decision to close for six or 12 months to give us time.  Will she please put this to the board arising from the discussions today? </p></speech>

I think the fair context of this is that under the law we are required to have periodic inspection and testing of the electrical installations in the building.  That was requested by the fire officer at the time of the bar licence renewal.  That report was completed.  We carried out the remedial works that we could carry out at that point.  I know it is difficult to bridge the gap in between.</p> <p>  We are lucky in the sense that during the past 22 years there have been no incidents.  We have a good record in fire safety management.  All of that has been reviewed and is excellent.  However, we cannot guarantee it.  The electrical system has gone way beyond its lifespan.  We all have a lifespan, as do houses and electrical systems.  We cannot unknow what we know.  The report recommends that all this work should be done.  In that context it is a legal responsibility of the board.  The board has made the decision to cease operating the service on 29 November.  It is not the case that we can say the building is dangerous.  The risks are present.  That is the reality.  Life is full of risks.  The reality is there would be a problem if something happened - I am with everyone on this.  However, I am sure many of us sitting around the table and many involved in the campaign would not be seen for dust if there was an accident or incident relating to fire safety or electrics in Cuisle on foot of the report issued.  I do not carry the responsibility.  The board carries the legal responsibility for that.  The board has made its decision on that basis.  We have said from the outset that any proposal coming back would have to be a concrete proposal about completing the works and not involve waiting a further six months or a year.</p></speech>

Under no circumstances, after 40 years in public life, have I ever been accused of intimidating anyone on the telephone or in person.  I was three times a Minister.  I never lost a staff member in those three Ministries.  No complaint was ever made and I never sacked anyone in my Ministries.  I find it quite abhorrent.  My daughter is here today and I am sure she is shocked by the statement.  I was anxious to speak to Ms Keogh.  Ms Keogh refused to speak to me.  There were about three calls.  In the circumstances I would have no problem.  I know Ms Keogh is on the control of the charity's board, which is rather unusual, to say the least.  Ms Keogh is controlling the charity.  She is on the board.  If I make an allegation against her board now, she will arbitrate on that as a member of that charity.</p></speech>

I want to talk about the promotion leaflet for hotel breaks.  The leaflet has quotes that read like comments on Trivago or Booking.com.  There are references to the staff and food being excellent and to patrons feeling equal going on holidays with everyone else.  They no longer feel that people with disabilities are put in a box.  They say the service is excellent and gives them a great holiday and not only respite.  Those quotes were also in the IWA presentation, as Ms Keogh will be aware.  The reason I have read them out is because I believe there is a major imbalance in the representation of what people with disabilities may or may not choose and what may or may not be open to them.</p><p>Like everyone else, and I assume it is the same for the IWA representatives, we have been heavily lobbied by those who use the centre regularly for their holidays.  Some of the quotes would break hearts.  I want to read some of them into the record because it is only fair to have people praise Cuisle in the same way as the brochure praises the hotels.  One comes from the sister of a 37 year old woman.  She said her sister is vulnerable and cannot talk or walk, but she calls Cuisle her boozing holiday because she can drive herself to the bar, where the staff know her and know what she likes.  One man goes to visit her every year she is there and has even written a song about her.  How special is that?  Another comment comes from a woman directly.  Cuisle offers her and her friends from her centre a holiday together where they look forward to seeing each other very much.  It is the only opportunity they have for a holiday together.  They have a great time meeting other wheelchair users.  The next comment is from the father of a young teenage girl.  He is actually a friend of mine.  He says his daughter will not stay in anyone's house except his mother's because the girl knows her granny will look after her in the same way that the staff in Cuisle look after her.  The idea of throwing her into a new surrounding because of some notion of integration is nonsense.  She needs to feel safe and secure and that only happens when she has continuity.  If we force people into more isolation when they do not want to go somewhere else, they will feel more anxiety.  That will deter their families from sending them on holidays.  When people suffer from mental and physical disabilities, it is all about safety, security and knowing what to expect.</p><p>I have read their testimony because I believe it is important to put balance on this.  It strikes me as strange that when the IWA is asked for the numbers on what users say, the number of people who want to use Cuisle and the numbers who do not, the association does not have exact numbers.  It has a general pattern of what may be happening with service users.</p><p>In <i>thejournal.ie</i>and the association statement today, the IWA &quot;stressed to Minister McGrath that the clear choice and preference of people with a disability is increasingly more about having access to positive and non-segregated settings and where existing commercial hotel provider settings implement universal design initiatives to accommodate people of all levels of abilities&quot;.  That is a big statement to make without a questionnaire or survey that we can all look at and determine, for example, that 99 users prefer to be in Cuisle while 299 would prefer to go to commercial hotels.  That is a big statement to make.  If the IWA made that clear to the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, and that is what the IWA believes to be the pattern based on what we know about the actual results, then the IWA representations to the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, expressed a preference for the hotel model over the Cuisle model.  It may well be the case that had the IWA done it the other way around, the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, might have decided to find the &euro;1.5 million.  I am not a big fan of any Minister but, as it happens, the Minister of State may well have done that.</p><p>I agree with the IWA in one respect and I see where the association has a problem.  This is a bigger political issue.</p><p>This is the same week in which the Government announced it will put &euro;3 billion of taxpayers' money into broadband.  There has just been a big announcement on the overspend on the children's hospital, which although we cannot prove it, most of us believe impacts on all services, including mental health and disability.</p><p> In her submission, Ms Keogh stated, "In June, this committee was briefed by a number of disability service provider umbrella groups on the growing funding crisis in the disability sector."  That is an important statement.  She went on to state, "In this context, during the period 2008 to 2018, the IWA has seen its financial reserves diminish by &euro;5.7 million".  In 2008, there was a banking collapse, the then Government bailed out the banks to the tune of &euro;64 billion, and many services suffered.  We now live in the fastest, healthiest-growing economy in the EU.  In the context that this is happening to the most vulnerable sectors of society, the IWA stated its funding is depleted and that there is a crisis in the funding of the disability sector.  It is an absolute disgrace that Cuisle will close.  Anybody who was at the protests last week would fully back the users to retain the service.  We have to find a way to retain it.  Given that the Government makes a bags of everything else, overspends on everything and deprives people of proper funding, we will have to find a firefighting service way out of the matter.  We cannot let down the father of the girl, the sister of the woman, all the people attending the meeting and their families.</p><p> Whatever proposals the Senator made may be the way out but the IWA should tell the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, that the emphasis put on the hotel model was outweighed by the protest and the sentiment coming strongly from the people use Cuisle day to day and year to year, and that we cannot afford to close it.  People have to have the choice and preference, and the IWA should state that, unfortunately, it gave the Minister of State the wrong impression there is only one way to go, namely, into commercialised hotels.  What IWA stated to the Minister of State was flawed, or if it was not, we need to hear what the wheelchair users and the people who use the service say to the IWA about the service.  Our guests might comment on that.</p></speech>

We value the centre.  All our dialogue for two years was about securing the funding.  I met the Minister of State last week, after it had become clear through the HSE that the funding would not be available.  He invited us in to talk to him about how the new holiday model will work.  It was a different period and a different conversation.  For two years, our initial conversations were focused entirely on securing the funding.</p></speech>

In the past month, there was a different type of dialogue, namely, that the hotel model will work, that it will be integrated and that it will help people to develop.  There is no evidence that people should be taken from a setting they are used to, where they can meet their friends and where the staff know them, what they drink and what they are saying when nobody else can understand them, or that what the IWA put to the Minister of State holds water.  The committee needs to seek a meeting with him to help to have the decision reversed.  We have political weight on our side.  The Government cannot, in one week, give &euro;3 billion to the national broadband plan and say there is not &euro;1.15 million to fund the centre.  It is an outrageous indictment by any measure of a decent society.</p></speech>

I am one of the people who lobbied the committee in June in respect of the crisis in disability funding.  It is something that the IWA does day in, day out.  We did not want to leave Cuisle.  We have invested a great deal of the IWA's money in recent years to ensure we can stay there, but without the works being done, we will not be able to do so.  It is a very sad day for everybody who goes to Cuisle, the staff at Cuisle and all the IWA's management and board.  In the absence of having the works done, we cannot continue to use the building.</p></speech>

Ms Keogh stated she only services the board but she is the CEO.  Her remuneration reflects her responsibilities, which are not just to the board but to the users, and she has not fought hard enough for them.  I do not mean she has sat on her hands for the past two years but the IWA's statements in recent weeks have let down the users.  We need to reverse quickly and tell the Minister of State that the service cannot close.  The Government will have to find the money.  Money is there.  Some &euro;17 million was spent on protecting Donald Trump when he visited.  Money is available and we have to ensure we fight for it.</p></speech>

We have done a great deal of work on the matter over the past two years.  If that was not enough, I am sorry, but we felt we did everything we could in that period.  On the Deputy's comment about what was reported in the media in recent weeks, the IWA has had a small number of media inquiries in respect of the Cuisle decision.  The volume of misinformation put into public dialogue by the media raises questions about the media and how it conducts itself because it has not dealt with or contacted the IWA directly.</p></speech>

We gave them sight of all of it and went through it with them, including the drawings and the quantity surveyor's cost estimate, because there were questions as to whether they even existed or whether we had plans to close the place.  My understanding on leaving the meeting was that the provincial was very satisfied and recognised the volume of work and expenditure that went into bringing it to that point.  We also spoke about the lease, to which the Deputy referred, and I said that after the IWA's time, those plans would be of no use to us <i>per se</i>and that we would be happy to talk to them about the use of the work that has been done date so that it would not go to waste.  The reason we did not give them a copy of it, as we would have communicated previously, is that people are still talking about money coming forward under the EU procurement directives, in respect of which we must be careful.  In fact, our quantity surveyor was not happy we were even saying the estimate for what was involved was &euro;1.15 million as of last year.  We would compromise everybody if we openly provided the plans.  They have been drawn up and have been witnessed by the landlord, who will confirm that to the Deputy.  We are more than happy to talk to the landlord about this as the plans will be of no use to us if we are not in the Cuisle facility.</p></speech>

It is not just a matter of the work but they have a belief in what they are doing.  If this committee asked Ms Keogh two questions or voted to postpone the laying off of staff for a six-month period - that would not make or break anyone, and I understand the IWA must comply with fire regulations, which no one disputes, and if the facility has a fire certificate it is in a fairly good place - would she bring a proposal to the IWA board that the facility would not close for a six-month period during which the public representatives, the State or the Minister for Health&rsquo;s office and the IWA would work together on this?  Nobody is saying they have a magic wand.  The IWA has said this facility is a good model.  If a solution can be found, is there any sense in dropping the hammer, so to speak, on the facility at the end of the month?  I ask that six months be provided to facilitate this and let us see if a successful outcome can be achieved.

First, I thank the witnesses very much for coming in to give their evidence and explain the position regarding Cuisle.  They will have picked up the passion of the committee for this facility and of its members closely associated with the area where it is located.  The issue is now in the political arena.  There is consensus among the members who have attended this committee that they want this facility to continue to operate in whatever way that can possibly be done.</p> <p>  It would seem to be a unique service not only in Ireland but in other jurisdictions.  It would be a shame to lose it without us, as politicians, giving the witnesses every assistance to try to keep it open.  I understand they have gone down the channels they have gone down and have not been successful.  However, having aired the issues this afternoon, I propose,as Deputy Fitzmaurice suggested, this committee would write to the Minister asking for a review of how Cuisle is being funded, how funds are being made available to it, and ask if the witnesses could defer their decision to close the facility for a number of months to allow the political process that has started here today to feed through to see if funding can be found, or if there is a philanthropist who has not been identified yet, or whatever way funding could be provided.  I ask if they could defer the proposed closure for a period of time to allow the political process to put its weight behind what everyone here wants to happen.</p></speech>

I have already put this in writing to chief executive officer but she has not responded to it.  The Minister has confirmed to me on two occasions that he has put that request to the CEO.  The responsibility is that the committee would ask that this would be formally presented to the board.  That is the wish of the members here, of the community and of the people with disabilities who use the facility.</p></speech>

A family relation has died and he is attending the funeral.  I acknowledge letters received from Erica Boucher and her mother about what Cuisle has meant to them and the heartbreak they are suffering over its proposed closure.  They are full of compliments for the staff.  The Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, made a statement on Monday, 18 November indicating that the main reason behind the decision to move away from Cuisle is that there has been a significant drop-off in numbers seeking to avail of respite in the facility in recent times and the preference of people has been for hotels, as has been facilitated in Kilkenny.</p><p>There have been substantial price increases in Cuisle.  In 2015, a person with high-dependency needs paid &euro;175 per night for full board and care.  In 2019, this increased to &euro;220 in mid-season, representing a 26% increase.  It rose to &euro;230 in peak season, representing an increase of 31%.  Even during the low season, when there is a lot of unused capacity, the price rose from &euro;175 to &euro;200, a 14% increase.</p><p> There has been a major reduction in funding to provide respite breaks.  For example, the Dublin and mid-Leinster budget decreased from &euro;150,000 to &euro;60,000 in recent years.  There has been a reduction in staffing resources in Cuisle, limiting the number of people who can access the service.  Currently, there is one nurse with a 19.5-hour contact and another who can work two weeks out of four and who has a 12-hour contract.  Numerous people have allegedly been told by the IWA that they could not visit the centre this year as a result of the staffing issues.</p><p> The number on the carers' roster in Cuisle has reduced from 30 in 2017 to 18 at present.  Duty manager positions have reduced from three 39-hour positions in 2016 to one 39-hour position and one 20-hour position in 2019.</p><p> I have one question.  Mr. Cunningham may correct me if I am wrong.  He addressed Roscommon County Council last Monday at a meeting hosted by the chairman, Councillor Paschal Fitzmaurice, and he answered many questions.</p></speech>

I will finish shortly.  At the meeting, I do not believe Mr. Cunningham ever mentioned the asbestos report.  If I am wrong, he should correct me.  This is why I feel the whole argument about asbestos and the building not being safe is a new one.  It did not exist before now and it is now being brought into the equation.  I thank the delegates for being here but I ask them to adhere to what 11 Oireachtas Members, including the Chairman, have said.  There should be a suspension of what is proposed if there is any respect for the people affected.  There was a former Deputy at the meeting relating to this matter.  I ask the delegates to go back to their board and put this on hold for 12 months.  There are substantial numbers of people who will raise considerable money in the area to keep the service going.  I can prove that on paper within days.</p></speech>

On 24 July 2017, Mr. Cunningham met the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, at which time I understand the budget of &euro;423,000 was discussed.  Contrary to the correspondence I have, Mr. Cunningham says that was not provided.  Did he not believe, given his statement that funding was not forthcoming, that it would be worthwhile and important to engage again with the Minister of State before the board of the association would make a decision?</p> <p>  With regard to the meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, on 12 November, I understand the Minister of State requested to meet representatives of the IWA and that it was not the other way around.  Can Mr. Cunningham elaborate on the discussions on the budget for upgrade works, including in respect of asbestos, electrical equipment and fire safety?  Was the budget discussed at the meeting or, as we are led to believe, was the discussion focused on implementing a new model?</p> <p>  It is important that the contributions made here be listened to.  We have a sense that we are not being listened to.  This has been a huge shock for service users, staff and the community.  We are saying clearly that it is important that we provide choice but that there are individuals and families who require enhanced support and who want to avail themselves of the facilities currently available at Cuisle.  The delegation should please listen to what we have said and take it back to the board, which should review all that has been discussed here today.  We are very concerned and angry over the decision, which has been made without any consultation, contrary to what was presented in the opening statement.  I ask the delegates to be honest with us.</p></speech>

We now have the transcript.  I stated earlier that there was clearly a sense that people were upset and sour.  The taste takes a while to get out of one&rsquo;s mouth but many people here have started asking very specific questions about how we should try to dig ourselves out of a hole.  I have heard the IWA state that if the funding issue did not exist, it would be carrying on with Cuisle.  Therefore, we are in a place where we now have to turn a corner and get into a mode that is more technical and detailed in respect of finding a way.  I totally agree with Deputy Denis Naughten and the Chairman on communicating directly with the board of the IWA on the basis of what has been said here and the various questions and requests made, and on communicating directly with the Minister.  I wish to make a statement and I do not wish to be difficult in making it: there is a hurdle of some kind in that what is known cannot be unknown.  Mr. Cunningham said this.  Whether it is a game-stopper in terms of hanging on to the service for a period, I do not know, but it is a live issue.  We have a responsibility in terms of providing safe services but I will be very happy to do anything I can and work with people.</p></speech>

I do not expect the delegates to have the figures today on the first question but they might come back to me on it.  How many IWA members requiring high-level support were provided with respite nights in 2019?  How many nights were provided?  What is the projection for next year in terms of the high-level support cases?</p> <p>  From the evidence provided today, it seems no Member of the Oireachtas was contacted between 1 July and 1 November this year, yet the IWA was putting alternatives in place in case funding did not come through.</p> <p>  Mr. Cunningham was asked to choose between the hotel option and the Cuisle model.  I have colleagues who were at the meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and who have discussed the matter with him since.  I understand that the association has made it quite clear that it has made a choice.  Its preference is to have the hotel model henceforth rather than the Cuisle model, which it defines as an institution-type residential setting.</p></speech>

Obviously, if one reduces the number of staff, one will not be able to provide the respite.</p><p> The other very important question was about the asbestos report.  Mr. Cunningham gave a very comprehensive address to Roscommon County Council and he answered a lot of questions but, from memory, the issue of an asbestos report never came up at that meeting.</p></speech>

To be quite honest, I cannot remember.  I spent two and a half hours answering questions.  I would have to play back the video to hear what I said, but asbestos is a reality for us.</p> <p>  Unlike a lot of other respite services, such as, for example, those in Mayo that are fully funded, we are not a section 39 organisation so we get a contribution from the HSE towards our operating costs.  Hence, we try to generate business from catering, for example, in order to generate the income.  We also do fundraising locally and nationally to subsidise the service.  I will link in to what Ms Keogh said to the committee recently about funding for the service.  Funding is an issue.  Many of our reserves have gone on sustaining services after sustaining funding cuts over the years.</p> <p>  In terms of our strategy, at this point we have to look at our services on an individual basis to see if they are sustainable.  One takes opportunities to make savings when they come along.  If the money is not coming in, it cannot go out.  I do not know the staffing levels off the top of my head but I know Cuisle has been restricted in its staffing levels, largely due to budgetary constraints.</p></speech>

At one time there was a flat rate for everybody that came to Cuisle, but those who were more independent or had lower support needs were not happy with that.  We had a lot of complaints.  They felt they were being penalised with the flat rate so we had to analyse the costs and introduce a range of costs.  A person who was very independent would have a particular rate for bed and breakfast.  Then there were different price ranges for people who required low, medium or high support or medication or clinical tasks.  There were price increases because the money was not there.  It was a case of increasing the costs for people, which are often funded by groups through fundraising, although I accept individuals have to fund it as well, and they have limited disposable income.  We had to increase the costs or to cut back further on bed nights.</p></speech>

Once it became very clear that the avenue for us was through the HSE's capital programmes for funding, we worked on that.  I provided some dates for the committee.  Reference was made to a meeting we had with the Department of Health and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath.  Then we moved on to negotiations with the HSE.  We have had ongoing consultations with the HSE estates and follow-up meetings to discuss progress.  We had been working with them all along in the hope that we would get funding for the centre.</p></speech>

That is a matter for discussion and question between the HSE and the Minister of State.  It is not for me to speak on behalf of the HSE.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.2062" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1401" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2019112100002#T00200"><p>I will ask specific questions on money in order that we can finally get our heads around this issue.</p> <p>  The witnesses will understand that we are passionately concerned about people with disabilities, many of whom have been in touch with us.  This issue is also about the quality of rural and community life, the choices that are being made and what is at stake.  To be clear, we are asking the witnesses for a stay of execution and that request will be formalised in due course.  We ask for that because there is an underlying sense of injustice about how the decision to close was reached.  I acknowledge everything the witnesses have said about their interactions with the Government.  The fact is we are in a different situation now; they are aware of the considerable public disquiet and they now have a public awareness asset.</p><p>At this point, the witnesses do not know what we are now capable of doing as a concerned community, particularly in Cuisle's hinterland area.  A very important point is that we are facing into a general election.  That brings a particular dynamic of its own to the lobbying for and extraction of commitments.  The witnesses have been at pains to stress how much they value Cuisle, and we take what they are saying at face value, but it does not lie with that to insist on a sudden death and shuttering of Cuisle.  I hear their concerns about safety and while such concerns must always be taken seriously, as things stand the witnesses have not been condemned.  They are under no legal obligation to immediately cease activities.  They are insured.  From everything I hear, they are in a position to show good faith by not taking a sudden decision.  They have knowledge of new issues but they had a certain amount of knowledge about the gradual and developing inadequacies of the facility that always were going to need updating.  It seems to me that there is a real test of the witnesses' goodwill here, not to take a sudden decision but, when members as a committee communicate formally with them, to do what they said they would do, which is to take a request back to their board.  We would, however, like them to give us some indication today as to what their advice would be because in almost every situation, what the CEO, Ms Rosemary Keogh, says will determine what the board decides.  Let us not pussyfoot about that.  We are asking the witnesses for a stay of execution for good reason because we have not had an opportunity to explore the potential to save Cuisle.</p><p> I turn now to the issue of how Cuisle might be saved, and let us hope that in turning to the future we are not wasting our breath and that there is real goodwill on the witnesses' side towards looking at what might come from this committee about that.  The witnesses talked about the significant capital costs of bringing Cuisle to a position where the association would be comfortable to continue to operate.  The only figure we have heard is &euro;1.15 million, but perhaps allowing for a further 5%.  The witnesses then spoke about other unknown knowns and known unknowns.  It is legitimate for them to say that they do not know the full cost if they went to address certain issues around heating or even around asbestos but they say that the projected costs they have given include full electrical installation and fire safety upgrades.  As I understand it, it is not confined to that.  I have two money questions for the association  We have to acknowledge at this point the very generous contribution from the Divine Word Missionaries over the years.  The sum of &euro;125,000, albeit in punts, for 25 years is less than the salaries of quite a few people in the sector might be on at the highest levels.  It is a very modest amount of money.  We are talking about &euro;5,000 a year.  They are proposing to give all of that back, retrospectively, therefore, the witnesses would be at no rent since the beginning of the operation.  Is that not correct?  That is the first sum the witnesses have to play with.</p><p> Another sum is whatever promised funding is there to be accessed, which the witnesses cannot access under their current decision.  Were they to reverse or postpone that decision, however, they then would be able to access certain moneys.  They might have outstanding commitments in terms of paying heating or other bills up until the end of the lease anyway.  In terms of their estimate, it is legitimate that they would have a conservative estimate and a more costly estimate because they do not know the full situation but it is always possible in these situations to identify a ballpark figure and there is an upper level and a lower level.  When we subtract from that figure the moneys the witnesses know are available to them, what is the actual shortfall?  I will put the question in theoretical terms.  If the secret millionaire was to present himself or herself in the morning and say, "I want Cuisle to continue operating for the next ten years, I want value for money and I do not want to give you more than I have to give you, having regard to the money you are currently able to leverage from other sources, including the Divine Word Missionaries and so on", what is the figure?</p><p> In terms of my second question, the witnesses have not mentioned it but is there a current cost of running Cuisle?  Leaving aside capital, there is the current cost.  Is part of the witnesses' decision-making process that they have been making a loss on Cuisle as they see it and that it is a drain on their current expenses?  Is that the undiscussed factor in their decision-making at this meeting?  If that is the case, can they give us an idea of what closing Cuisle would release for them moneywise on an annual basis, having regard to the fact that they are committing to fundraising hotel-based holidays and so on?</p><p> To summarise the three issues, first, is there genuine goodwill about taking a serious proposal seeking a stay of execution, so to speak, back to the board?  Second, what is the capital shortfall that a secret millionaire would have to come up with?  Third, what is the ongoing current drain - that is a negative word I would not want to use - coming from the operation of Cuisle and has that been a factor in the decision made?</p></speech>

I can give a guarantee that, once a month, I have very long Friday night meetings and I do not always get out with what I wanted going in.  I want to put that on the record.  We have a dynamic and diverse board which takes its responsibilities extremely seriously and it would be wrong for it to be on record that that was not the case.</p> <p>  In terms of the capital piece, I am not trying to be obtuse when I say this but it is a difficult question to answer.  When we start with the &euro;1.15 million, if that is what it was, we can then do the Senator's calculation.  It is very difficult to do the calculation when we do not know what the full cost would be at this point.  However, if somebody came up with the money and it was enough to do the works and ensure that, for the next five or ten years or whatever period, any other unknown - asbestos or whatever it might be - that comes up would be secured, we would look seriously at that.  I want to reassure the Senator that if a proposal comes back through the committee, and we have already stated it here, we will bring it back to the board.  I do not know how many times I have said this afternoon, and I will say it again, that this is probably one of the most difficult decisions that has been made in the history of the IWA.  The association was founded by eight people who were wheelchair users in 1960.  That figure of eight has grown to more than 20,000 people across the country.  If we include staff and volunteers in that, we are up to approximately 25,000.  This organisation has been at the heart of developing services for people with disability and representing people with disability.  We are not in the business of closing services that people value if we have an alternative to doing that.  I will ask Mr. Cunningham to talk about the annual operating piece, if that is okay.</p></speech>

I know Ms Keogh cannot be precise but it is legitimate for us to expect a ballpark figure today.  The question is what amount would save Cuisle.  I am not asking that question for the good of my health.  Ms Keogh can tot up for me today the amount of money she could leverage from the sources I mentioned, including the payback from the Divine Word Missionaries, and subtract that from what she believes it would cost to have this building in good order in order that she is not worried about fire officer inspections or whatever for the next ten years.</p></speech>

As I explained earlier, the LEADER funding was for completely different works and it was very specific.  It was made very clear to us when we went back to the Roscommon LEADER Partnership that that could not be used, so we are still talking about &euro;1 million at that time, as a starting point.</p></speech>

They were budgeted deficits, meaning that the board funded those every year from either reserves or fund-raising within the organisation.  The BDO business plan, if the Senator looks at our overall strategy, is pricing our services across the board.  That goes back to Ms Keogh's meetings with the committee and the service level arrangement process in that every service stands in its own right.  That is what we have to work towards, particularly when the reserves are gone.  We have been working on that across the organisation in respect of all services.</p> <p>  In terms of Cuisle, that was part of the reason for inviting BDO to come in because it has gone from being a service provider to being a social enterprise.  BDO was giving us advice, and it was to make Cuisle a profit-making unit so that it could be revitalised-----</p></speech>

I do not know the exact number but we have over 30 individual service arrangements across all nine community healthcare organisations, CHOs, within the HSE.  We have two service arrangements that relate specifically to Cuisle, one is in CHO 2 covering Roscommon and the other is in CHO 9.  The majority of the funding comes through the CHO 2 Roscommon office.  For as long as I have been in the IWA, and for many years before that, including in 2008 when the various cuts were made in the time of austerity, the IWA has negotiated and lobbied the HSE in regard to the service arrangements.  In two of the past three years, we have gone into a formal dispute process with the HSE with regard to the service arrangements and the funding that is provided.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

As we have a quorum we will begin our meeting in public session.  I ask everyone to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode.  There will be no private session today.  We will deal with any matters arising at our next meeting.  I welcome the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, and officials from her Department to the meeting.  In a moment I will invite the Minister to make an opening statement and then members will have an opportunity to pose questions.</p><p>I draw everyone's attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I now invite the Minister to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.2128" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019112100002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to attend this morning to discuss the public services card, PSC.  I am looking forward to the questions of committee members on what is a very important topic.  Before discussing the public services card, it might be useful to give a brief overview of the history of the card, the background to the recent report by the Data Protection Commission on the card and the developments since the report was published on 17 September last.</p> <p>  The public services card has its genesis in the 1990s and its purpose has always been clear, namely, to provide a means of verifying a person's identity when accessing public services.  In December 1993, the then Government approved in principle the development of an integrated social services system, ISSS, which would provide a more integrated approach to the administration, delivery, management and control of statutory income support services.  An interdepartmental committee was established to progress that initiative.  That committee made a number of recommendations that were subsequently implemented, the main objectives of which were to improve customer services, provide value for money, and modernise the public service and the way it carries out its work on behalf of the citizens of our State.  The committee recommended that legislation be introduced to allow the then revenue and social insurance number, RSI number, to be adopted as a single public service identifier.  It also recommended that the use of the social services card be expanded across the public service to support customer identification, speed up access to social services and support new electronic payments.  It also suggested that the card should include a photograph of the customer to facilitate identification when he or she availed of public services.</p> <p>  These recommendations were published in a 1996 interdepartmental report and formed the basis for measures taken by one of my predecessors in this Department, the former Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in February 1998.  He introduced legislation in the D&aacute;il to provide for the standardisation of the RSI number as the personal public service number, PPSN; the replacement of the social services card by the public services card, which would have the person's name, PPSN and the card number visible on the front; and the use of new technology on cards to develop new methods of paying social welfare benefits.  The Government made it clear at the time that both the public services card and the PPSN were to be used widely across the public service to assist people in their dealings with public sector organisations.</p><p>Subsequent Governments progressed this policy and introduced a small number of further legislative amendments, providing, for example, that the Minister would not issue a PSC unless he or she was satisfied as to the identity of the person to whom the card was being issued, and that the person's photograph and signature would be included on the card.</p><p> Following the development and implementation of the standard framework for authentication of identity, the standard authentication framework environment, SAFE, public service cards were first introduced in 2011.  The PSC is now widely used by a number of bodies as a means of identification.  These bodies include my Department, the Revenue Commissioners, the Passport Office, Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, the National Driver Licence Service and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  In practice, this means that once a person has authenticated his or her identity via the SAFE process and has been issued a PSC, that person does not have to submit the same information to authenticate his or her identity each and every time he or she makes an application to any of the bodies that use that card.  There are more than 3.2 million active users of the PSC, representing more than 80% of the adult population in the State.  In this context, it should also be noted that, each week, payments valued at approximately &euro;150 million are made via our post offices by more than 600,000 people, whose identity is verified on each occasion by using their PSCs.  Every week, approximately 600,000 free travel journeys are made using the PSC.  Every year, approximately 70,000 people over the age of 18 apply for a passport for the first time using their PSC to avoid having to resubmit identity data.  Almost 420,000 PSC holders have verified their identity to a standard that enables them to access a wide variety of online services with the bodies mentioned via MyGovID.  The development of the PSC has been welcomed by the public.  Research commissioned by my Department indicates high levels of satisfaction with the overall process among holders.</p><p> On 27 October 2017, the Data Protection Commission initiated an investigation into the Department's compliance with its responsibilities as a data controller in respect of PSC-related matters, including the legal basis for the processing of personal data and compliance with EU law.  The Department fully co-operated with the investigation, including through the provision of detailed responses to a draft report provided to the Department at the midpoint of the investigation process.  The final report relating to the legal basis and transparency issues contained eight findings and was received by my Department on 15 August 2019, together with a letter from the commission requiring the Department to take certain measures.  The Data Protection Commission stated that it did not have the legal powers to publish the report but it issued a press release setting out the key findings and the measures that it required my Department to take.  It requested that my Department publish the report of its own volition.</p><p> The commission found that my Department has the legal powers to require users of its services to authenticate their identity to SAFE standards, to issue a PSC to these users and to require them to produce it as a means of authenticating their identity when accessing Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection services.  It found that the right to issue a PSC did not extend to circumstances where the user was acquiring it solely for the purpose of transactions with other bodies in circumstances where these bodies did not offer their users an alternative means of authenticating their identity.  It found that the Department did not have the right to indefinitely and on a blanket basis retain documents and other information collected for the purposes of authenticating identity.  Finally, it found that the information provided to users in respect of the PSC did not satisfy transparency requirements.</p><p> My Department, together with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, considered the report carefully and we sought the advice of the Attorney General's office.  Following this consideration, it was concluded that the processing of personal data related to the PSC complies with legal requirements, the document retention is lawful and the information provided satisfies our transparency requirements.  The commission has advised my Department that an enforcement notice is being prepared which will be issued to the Department in respect of its investigation.  My Department will carefully consider this notice when it is received and we will take the appropriate actions in light of the advice from the Attorney General's office, which may include referral to our courts.  I look forward to hearing the committee's views and answering any questions.</p></speech>

Since this report is quite detailed, I will allow members to ask a question and the Minister to respond individually rather than grouping them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.2131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019112100002#B00300"><p>The Minister mentioned legal advice from the Attorney General's office.  I understood, when I raised this during parliamentary questions, that this had been farmed out to a third-party lawyer.  Did this advice come directly from the Attorney General's office or an outside lawyer?  I suppose it would be too much to ask who the lawyer was.  We have not seen the legal advice.  It may not be possible to do so because there may be some precedent for not publishing it.  Can we at least have a synopsis of the legal advice?  I have read the report carefully.  It has been a while but I can read it again.  It represents two years of research and I thought the legal reasoning was impeccable.  How does the legal advice justify indefinite retention of data?  Does it tell us that there is currently sufficient transparency and that the public is adequately informed about the use to which the data can be put?  I am intrigued to find out if it provides justification in that regard.</p> <p>  The Data Protection Commission made a number of recommendations.  Have any of those recommendations been adhered to yet?  Is the Minister conscious that a number of other public bodies that were using the card have resiled from insisting that it be produced to grant people services?  Her colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, went so far as to say that his officials had been vindicated in having initial doubts about the legal validity of the card.  We saw only yesterday that under the childcare scheme announced recently by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, use of the card will come into play.  Since the online system will not be ready until next year, people will have to wait because they will have to produce the card to access the scheme.  Regardless of the recommendations of the Data Protection Commission and the all-party committee that the Minister spoke about, and regardless of what was or was not said in the D&aacute;il, the Data Protection Commission has found that, legally, the legislation introduced in 1998 does not give the powers that are being claimed.  The commission clearly found that the legislation does not allow public bodies other than the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to insist on compulsory production of the card and that is the fact.</p> <p>  The Minister was vague about the enforcement notice.  She has not yet received the enforcement notice, which is somewhat surprising.  Can she be a little clearer in this regard?  If the Attorney General or the Attorney General's lawyer has told her that everything is perfectly in order and she receives an enforcement notice, it follows naturally that she will contest the notice.</p> <p>  The committee's recommendations about the use of the card outside the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection seem to say that it can be used for purposes other than social welfare provided an alternative system is in place which people can opt to use if they wish.  We on this side of the House recognise that the public services card has been very useful.  I know many people in my constituency who prefer to access social welfare and some other services by just producing the public services card.  It is very convenient.  Our difficulty is that it is compulsory.  We get that it is compulsory for social welfare but it has been made compulsory for a range of other services for which the Data Protection Commissioner says there is no legal basis.</p> <p>  I remind the Minister of the 2016 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which stated that no business case had been made for the card.  The report points out that in certain cases, the card seems to make it more difficult rather than easier to access services.</p><p>There is no obvious justification that the card must be produced in appeals for refusals of school transport.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2019-11-21a.2133" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPJ2019112100002#C00200"><p>If I miss any of the 27 questions put to me, I appreciate that they were asked one at a time, I hope Deputy O'Dea will remind me.  The advice we took came from our in-house legal team and the Office of the Attorney General, in which there are many legal minds.  The Office of the Attorney General also took third-party advice.  As a former Minister, Deputy O'Dea will be well aware of the seasoned practice that the Office of the Attorney General is the Cabinet's adviser.  Its advice has never been published so there is precedence for it being between the Attorney General and his or her client which in this case is the Government.  I genuinely believe that all of my statements, including those I have made today, reiterate the strong legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General that the interpretation of the legislation by the Data Protection Commissioner is incorrect.  Our understanding and belief is that the legislation enacted in 1998 by the Deputy's Government, the Government of 2005 and subsequently Fine Gael-led Governments in 2011 and 2013 empowers us to do exactly what we have been doing since the PSC was published in 2011.  The synopsis of the advice is on the public record.  The use of the data is something that we have clearly set out and established in the 2005 legislation.  We believe that we are following the legislation to a T.</p> <p>  There was some misinformation about statements made and public commentary thereafter.  A PSC is not needed to make a SUSI grant appeal, which is the one on which people keep relying to show how we were wrong.  No one needs a PSC to make a SUSI grant appeal, that was never the case and there are no plans by the relevant Department or Government agency to make that the case.  The Data Protection Commissioner did find that there was absolutely a legal base for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to require people to authenticate themselves during the stage 2 process so that we could be absolutely sure that they are who they say they are and that they are only registered to access public State services once, and once only, in their own name.  Every other Minister has the right or entitlement in their own Department to determine how best they provide public services.  The Deputy needs to recall why his Government had the foresight to do this in 1998 and why subsequent Governments continued with it.  The idea was just to try to make access to public services easier, more efficient and quicker for the people we are here to serve.  People have spoken with their feet insofar as the Deputy has admitted that, where they wish to do things online, it is much faster to use the PSC as proof of identity.  The best example which most people can visualise is how one can get a passport by completing an application form online on Monday and receiving one's passport on Wednesday or Thursday.  That would have been unheard of some years ago.  However, it is not true to say that one cannot get a passport any other way because one can.  It is not true that one cannot get a driver licence any other way than having a PSC because one can, but it is by means of the old, inefficient way.  People can choose with their feet to decide if they wish to go to the post office, bring the photographs to the Garda station, get them signed, go in and sit in Mount Street for four hours or to just do it online.  That is their choice.</p> <p>  It is incumbent on any Government to provide services in the most efficient way possible but also to give people choices depending on their circumstances.  The childcare scheme is a case in point.  There is misinformation circulating that we have only changed the childcare scheme since the Data Protection Commissioner's ruling came out in August.  Since the inception of the childcare scheme 18 months ago, there were always plans for a paper application and an online application route, which is just what transpired since the scheme went live recently.</p> <p>  The Deputy suggested that I am vague on the enforcement notice.  I am not sure if he means how I will respond when the enforcement notice comes.  I am deliberately vague in this regard because the press releases which were issued by the Data Protection Commissioner on 15 August were incredibly strong, direct and robust.  I now find myself some three and a half months later, having initially been instructed to do things within seven days, within 21 days and within six weeks, of having no sight of the enforcement notice that was imminent on 15 August.  If I am being deliberately cagey it is because I genuinely have no idea what will be in the enforcement notice if it ever arrives.  I have no idea if it will be exactly the same as the findings given that some of the opinions have changed in the last couple of months arising from the findings.  I am not sure if it will be the instructions that came in the letter to us on 15 August which were different to the instructions that came in the findings.  I am not being obstructive, I just do not know what will be in the enforcement notice.  However, I guarantee that it will get as much careful thought and consideration in our response, if and when it comes.</p> <p>  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General did suggest that there was a problem that we should have potentially a one-document business case.  That was raised at a meeting of the Committee on Public Accounts either last week or the week before.  The Department has acknowledged that there was no single business case document for the development of the SAFE identity process and the whole PSC project but that should not be taken as evidence that there was not a huge amount of planning over many years by successive Governments over the years and Departments.  Most of the elements of the business case were in place in various documents that were laid before the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have a document that I can give the Deputy today that lists 22 different documents which detailed exactly how, when, where, why and the purpose of what we were trying to do.  In hindsight, perhaps it would have been better had we started on day one with one document with 20 chapters but that is not the way it happened.  That was acknowledged by the Secretary General last week, that if we were to start from the beginning we might have one document.  However, just because there was not one document that does not mean that there were not 21 documents detailing all the facets.</p> <p>  Finally, I have had the privilege of holding this post for several years and have received legal advice on many matters.  The legal advice I have from the Office of the Attorney Genera is as strong as it could be.  We have a difference of interpretation of Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection legislation.  Our interpretation of our legislation which was passed by successive Governments is correct.  The advice is that the Data Protection Commissioner interpretation of our legislation is incorrect.  We have a simple case of two people interpreting legislation in a different way.  The Data Protection Commissioner is doing her job and we are doing ours.  We will take our next move after the Data Protection Commissioner has made its next move.</p></speech>

I will return to that.  This has been a shambles from day 1.  The Department's handling of the Data Protection Commissioner's entire investigation, and even the format in which some of the material was sent to the investigation.  I will not dwell on that as there are more important questions for which I require answers.  This was the first investigation but another is ongoing onto biometrics and the card.  What stage is that investigation at?  Has the Minister engaged with the Data Protection Commissioner on that?  Has it furnished the Department with a series of questions and areas on which it seeks clarity or further information?  Has the Minister seen a report or draft stemming from that?</p></speech>

The Minister spoke of the incredibly strong advice received from the Office of the Attorney General that the card is legal under all circumstances which she outlined.  This is the same Attorney General who briefed the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and his officials and whose advice led to the withdrawal of the mandatory requirement to use the PSC for the test for the driver licence.</p><p>The Minister mentioned taking two different interpretations of legal advice but does the Attorney General have two different interpretations of the legal status of the PSC?  He seems to give two versions of what is legal.  The Minister stated that she has received incredibly strong legal advice from the Attorney General and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has indicated that he and his officials have been vindicated in the position they have taken to withdraw the requirement relating to PSCs following advice from the Attorney General.</p><p> Does the Minister truly believe that challenging the Data Protection Commissioner will have absolutely no repercussions in how multinationals based here will deal with the Government?  There are genuine concerns around that.  Does the Minister firmly believe there will be no such repercussions?  The Minister is challenging the very strong ruling of the Data Protection Commission relating to the retention and sharing of data linked to the mandatory nature of the PSC.  How far is the Minister prepared to go with this and how much of the taxpayers' money is she willing to waste in challenging the ruling?</p><p> The Minister indicates that the legal advice she received was in-house and we know the Attorney General had third-party legal advice.  What formal questions were asked of the Attorney General by the Minister when her Department was considering the Data Protection Commissioner's report?  The Minister mentioned in-house legal people but what qualifications do they possess?  There are probably six Irish barristers who qualify as being legally expert in the field.  It is quite interesting that all of them have said-----</p></speech>

The first investigation had three modules, of which two have been reported upon; the resulting report came from the Data Protection Commission on 15 August.  The third module in the first investigation is still outstanding.  I am not aware that the second investigation, which concerns biometrics, has commenced because we have received no questions, queries or a draft report from the Data Protection Commission.  We await any requests that would come from there on that.</p> <p>  As stated earlier, the advice given by the Attorney General to my Department is as robust as it potentially could have been.  It is very strong ins that the legal basis that we have to support what was exactly initiated and desired as far back as 1998 is as we are doing now.  The advice is so strong as to say that if we deviated from what we are doing and from the practices in my Department and other Departments, we would be in breach of legislation passed in 1998 and 2005.  There are not two different views.  With respect to the statements made by the other Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I suggest that the Deputy ask him what exactly he sought legal advice on and what advice was received.  He certainly did not ask for legal advice on whether he had the legal authority to mandate the National Driver Licence Service to look-----</p></speech>

The Minister definitely did not receive any legal advice on the legal status or basis for requiring people when using <i>mygov.ie</i>to have a PSC.</p><p>I truly believe that challenging the Data Protection Commissioner is okay.  I am not sure if the Deputy was here when the House passed the legislation relating to the establishment of the Data Protection Commission and its responsibilities.  When we passed that legislation, as is standard practice with any judicial or semi-judicial authority, we made a provision that if somebody received a ruling that he or she did not agree with, there would be a legal right to challenge that ruling and defend himself or herself.  That is all we are doing.  Legislation was enacted or amended in 1998, 2005, 2011, 2013 and 2015 and we believe this vindicates and defends the Government's provision of our services in an efficient and fast manner.</p><p>The only reason the PSC was established was to allow our citizens - the people we are here to serve - get access to services and interact with the State in the most efficient manner possible.  If the Deputy is suggesting we should not defend successive Governments' attempts to make it easier for the citizens of the State to do business with the State, I am not sure what is the basis of his argument.</p></speech>

We believe we have both the legal right and authority to do exactly what we have been doing since the first PSC was issued in 2011.</p> <p>  It is probably standard practice for most Departments to have in-house legal advisers.  We have two and both are barristers who have been seconded from the Attorney General's office.  They reside in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection but they are staff of the Attorney General's office.</p> <p>  We did not ask formal questions.  We gave the final report to the Attorney General and this is exactly the same as when we consulted extensively when we got the draft report in November 2018.  In the preparation of the response to the draft report, both the Attorney General's office and officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform would have been heavily involved.  I did not ask about qualifications in the Office of the Attorney General.  It is an established authority that has been around since the foundation of the State.  It is there to advise Governments on how they should run their business.</p></speech>

We have been looking forward to this for a while.  The Data Protection Commission's report vindicates much of my thoughts about the PSC from the very beginning.  Many people feel that this is a national identity card introduced by the back door and that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, having established it for its own services, has expanded it across the board into other services.</p><p>From the eight findings in the report of the Data Protection Commission, three relate to the legal basis and the remaining five relate to transparency.  The report indicates that the processing of certain personal data by the Department in connection with the issuing of PSCs for the purpose of validating the identity of a person claiming, receiving or presenting for payment of a benefit has a legal basis under applicable data protection law.  It goes on to state that the processing of personal data by the Department in connection with the issuing of PSCs for the purposes of transaction between individuals and other specified public bodies other than the Department itself does not have a legal basis under applicable data protection laws, and that, specifically, such processing contravenes section 2A of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.  Has the Minister responded to the Data Protection Commission on that matter?</p><p>The report also indicates that the Department's blanket and indefinite retention of underlying documents and information provided by persons applying for a PSC contravenes section 2(1)(<i>c</i>)(iv) of the Data Protection Act 1988 and 2003 because such data is retained for periods longer than is necessary than the purpose for which it was collected.</p><p>Has the Department responded to the Data Protection Commission on that issue to clarify the Department's legal point of view?<br/><br/>In terms of transparency, the scheme does not comply with section 2D of the Data Protection Act 1988, as amended by the Data Protection (Amendment) Act 2003, in that the information provided by the Department to the public about the processing of their personal data in connection with the issuing of PSCs is not adequate.  Has the Department responded to the Data Protection Commission?<br/><br/>The Data Protection Commission went to state that, critically, the Department will be required to complete the implementation of two specific measures within a period of 21 days.  Have those two specific measures been implemented, yes or no?  The first of the two measures was set out as follows: </p><blockquote>	It will be required to stop all processing of personal data carried out in connection with the issuing of PSCs, where a PSC is being issued solely for the purpose of a transaction between a member of the public and a specified public body ... .  The corollary of this finding is that bodies other than DEASP cannot insist that a person who does not already hold a PSC must obtain one as a pre-condition of accessing public services provided by that body. </blockquote><p>Has the Department responded to and implemented that measure?  The second required measure was:</p><blockquote>	The Department will be required to contact those public bodies who require the production of a PSC as a pre-condition of entering into transactions with individual members of the public, to notify them that, going forward, the Department will not be in a position to issue PSCs to any member of the public who wishes to enter a transaction with ... any such public body. </blockquote><p>How is the Department implementing those two points?<br/><br/>There is another question I want to ask the Minister before I finish up.  The Minister stated in her introduction that each year, approximately 70,000 people over the age of 18 apply for a passport for the first time using a PSC to avoid having to resubmit identity data.  The Minister is saying one can go the old route of getting one's two photographs, etc.  Has that been the case in all circumstances?  Maybe the Minister can also clarify the following point for me.  I have read that one needs to have a public services card to apply for the national childcare scheme.  Is it correct to state there is an alternative paper application process but that does not start until January and there is no back payment?  If I am correct, it means that the Department's system discriminates against those who do not have the public services card.  Those are the main points I wanted to ask on the issue.</p></speech>

At no stage was there ever any indication or action arising from the thought process that there would be any legislation passed or anything to give anybody the impression that this was a national identity card by the side door, the back door or the front door.  That fear, while real for a small number of people, is unfounded.</p><p>For the record, there is an assumption that members of my party have a great wish to have a national identity card.  I would abhor anybody walking down the road or anywhere being stopped and asked to produce papers.  It has massively negative connotations for me and I would not be able to support anybody who wants to introduce it.  Regardless of whether we have a national debate about it, which is what people keep calling for, I would not agree, sign up and subscribe to a policy that would introduce a national identity card.  For the record, I do not agree with it.</p><p>There were eight findings.  The difficulty I have in answering the questions without sounding like a smart-arse is that none of the eight findings has any force in law.  There is no enforcement notice and since 15 August, none has been issued as of yet.  I have nothing to challenge other than to say to the Deputy that I do not agree with any of the eight findings, not even the first one.  While that might sound bad, I do not have the ability to do anything other than wait.</p><p>It was never the case that the instructions that were given to us to be complied with in seven days, within 21 days and, in the final instructions, within 60 days, were ever to be complied with because we do not agree with them.  My legal advice is that the interpretation of the legislation by the Data Protection Commissioner's, DPC's, office is incorrect.  In fact, the advice we have been given is that if we did any of the things we were instructed to do, we would be acting outside of the legislation and effectively breaking the law.  While it might seem disrespectful, I find that we are in limbo.  Had the enforcement notice arrived on 15 August, we would have taken our time to look at it, get all of the advice and look at all of our practices over the past 20 years.  We do not have anything to legally challenge and until I have something to legally challenge, the eight findings that were issued in the report - the instructions that were issued in the DPC's letter - do not have any legal force and we will not be enacting any of the instructions.  If and when an enforcement notice is issued, we will consider carefully the instructions in that enforcement notice.  If there are things in it with which we agree, we will comply.  If there are things in it with which we disagree, our only recourse to challenge that is through the courts.</p><p>The Deputy asked about the photograph and the passport, as to whether one had the ability to get the passport by means other than having a PSC.  One always had the ability to go the old route.  That has never changed.  That is to facilitate people of all walks of life who do not necessarily like technology.  There are lots of people who still do not even send text messages.  We need to be able to provide public services in the manner that people expect to be able to use.  The most efficient manner for most people these days is online, which is why we have 3.2 million active users of the PSC and hundreds of thousands of people on a weekly basis who use it to get public services in a more efficient manner.  However, all other routes to be able to accommodate other people should be facilitated by each and every Department.  At the end of the day we are here to serve, not to control.</p><p>The Department is only the data controller of all of the data that are stored.  I do not have the directive powers to tell other Ministers how to draft and run schemes that come out of their offices but the governing responsibility allows them to ask people.  If people want to do business with the State online, they must be able to prove their identity and the most efficient way to be able to do so is through the SAFE 2 registration process, as 3.2 million people have found.</p><p>Lastly, the national childcare scheme was always in its foundations to have two ways to apply for it.  One was to be paper and one was to be online.  In order for one to make an application online through <i>mygov.ie</i>, one needs a PSC.  Some 80% of those who will qualify for the childcare scheme subsidies have already got a PSC and the paper form is going live on 1 January.  The Deputy is correct in stating that there is a month of a difference between the online version and the paper version.</p></speech>

The Data Protection Commission believes the Department is in breach of section 2A of the Data Protection Act and so forth.  There are three legal issues where the Data Protection Commission suggests the Department is in breach.  The Minister's legal advice is that the Department is not and she has sought that advice.  Has the Minister, at any stage, with her officials, considered amending that legislation to bring better clarity to it to address the issues of concern to the Data Protection Commissioner?</p></speech>

There was some flurry of activity around 15 August and I think people expected us to either comply within two days or to respond within a number of days.</p> <p>  The issues here are complex and the legislation has been amended many times.  The Chairman will be aware that with consolidated legislation one must look back etc.  We considered everything to the nth degree right up to whether there is any possibility that we can strengthen the legislation.  At the end of the day, we do not want to fight with a Government agency.  If there was a way that we could have complied with the spirit of what the DPC was trying to do, we genuinely would have done it.  We looked at the legislation and the advice from our drafters was there was no way to be clearer in what we are trying to do than what was already stated specifically in the legislation.  In answer to the Chairman's direct question, we looked to see whether we could but the advice from the drafters was that it cannot be any clearer than it is.</p><p> Deputy Joan Collins asked me whether we responded to the DPC with regard to the seven days or 21 days.  My Secretary General and I have written numerous letters to the DPC in recent months seeking clarity on the difference between the instructions in the letter and the instructions in the findings.  We also requested meetings to find out exactly what the thinking was behind some of the instructions to see if we could find a way of avoiding going to court and to find some way of continuing the process of providing efficient services for all our people.  We recognised the concerns the office of the DPC had raised and wanted to see if there was any way to assuage those concerns.  We received no responses to our letters and the meetings were refused.  I am not trying to be humble, and I know people probably will not believe this, but I respect the office of the Data Protection Commission and I have a particular respect for the lady who holds the single role of our regulatory authority.  Neither I nor my Department want to be in conflict with her.  We tried as hard as we could to find an amicable resolution but in the absence of having anything to legally enforce, I have no choice but to say that we will robustly defend our legal standing and the legislation of successive Governments.  We will do exactly what we had intended and set out to do, which is to provide public services in an efficient manner.</p></speech>

In her presentation, she gave much detail about the 1990s but we skipped very quickly from 2017 to 2019, during which time many things were happening.  I have looked back at my own engagement with the Minister on this issue at that time, when many others also engaged with her.  In December 2017, I urged a period of slowing down and caution.  I asked that the Department would try to stop digging in respect of the public services card and creating trouble for us as a nation so as to avoid leaving us as hostages to fortune.  As an investigation had begun at that point, it would have seemed a good time to slow down but instead the Department doubled down on the roll-out.  In February 2018, when questions were being asked, Mr. Duggan from the Department said he did not believe the fact that an investigation had begun necessarily meant the DPC had concerns.  In December 2018, the Minister stated:</p> <blockquote> 	I cannot allow the Senator put on the record of this House that the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has grave concerns with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It does not. </blockquote> <p>The Minister had received the draft report at that time, which noted concerns about the retention of information, about which I will talk some more.  The Minister can surely understand why giving a sense of the mood of the Attorney General's advice or what she feels might have been said is not satisfactory to us.  We have been given assurances as to the general mood or tenor of an engagement that have not been backed up and which have effectively been contradicted by later revelations of the grave concerns raised, to which the Minister had access and we did not.  In 2018 a new contract was signed for a new roll-out while this investigation was under way.  These are serious concerns because many decisions were taken not to exercise even a modicum of caution for any period, not only as regards the contracts that had already been signed, but the new contracts as well.</p><p>I will group a few of the findings and go back to some others.  Finding No. 3 stated &quot;the blanket, indefinite retention of personal data consisting of documents and information (other than the applicant&rsquo;s photograph and signature) which are originally collected for the purposes of identity authentication in the context of SAFE 2 registration is in contravention of DEASP&rsquo;s obligations&quot;.  Some 3.2 million people have gone through the SAFE 2 process and satisfied the Minister as to their identity.  Not everyone has gone through the process but that is a separate issue.  According to Mr. Duggan, the PSC is the token which shows that someone has gone through that process and successfully verified his or her identity to a substantial level of assurance.  The Department satisfied itself as to their identity.  Why is it retaining their documentation?</p></speech>

The Ombudsman's office overruled decisions that had been made on appeal by our deciding officers because we did not have the relevant supporting documentation for those decisions.  We were instructed that if we did not keep the supporting documentation, we would not be able to stand over the decisions made thereafter.  Our office retains people's proof of the identity at the time of their application.  When somebody else makes an application or submits a second PSC card application, we refer through the system for all that person's supporting documentation.  In order to be able to identify and authenticate somebody who tries to apply a second time, we need to be able to reference the documents they used in the first instance.  That is the reason we retain documents, and the problem-----</p></speech>

The introduction to the report makes it dead clear that this is not simply about privacy, or about who can or cannot identify someone.  It is about control.  A person's data is his or her data.  My travel is my travel.  The fact that I am going from place to place is my information.  The fact that I go to Wexford every week is my information.  It is one thing to know that someone has used the card.  It is another thing to be able to track where someone has used it.

The purpose of the Data Protection Commissioner's investigation was to ascertain whether it is obligatory under the legislation for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to insist on the production of a PSC by those applying for social welfare.  The purpose of the investigation we are talking about was to examine the attempt to extend that mandatory system to other Departments.  Those responsible for issuing driving licences and passports, etc., were taking the view that they could also insist on the mandatory production of a PSC by those who wanted to avail of their services.  The Data Protection Commissioner has said that this is not correct.  When responding to Deputy Joan Collins and others, the Minister stated that people can now apply for passports and driving licences under the old system.  People can do so now, but in the-----</p></speech>

I take what the Minister is saying about 3.2 million people being happy about the convenience of all of this.  However, she is wrong when she says that the purpose of the Government's approach was to allow people to access services more efficiently.  The purpose of the Government's approach was to force people to use the PSC to access services to which they would otherwise have been entitled.  That is the position.  That is precisely the matter on which the Data Protection Commissioner disagrees with the Minister.  She said in response to a question asked by Deputy Brady that people who disagree with a legal ruling have the right to appeal.  Of course they have.  We all know that.  As the Minister well knows, it is a gross oversimplification of the position to say that.  The Data Protection Commissioner was set up as a statutory body to regulate data and to advise the Government on legislation concerning data, etc.  When a statutory body of this nature, having been set up and paid for with millions of euro of taxpayers' money, comes up with a finding that the Minister is unhappy with, it is most unusual for her to rush immediately to her legal adviser.  I am not sure whether the advice came from within the Department or from the Attorney General.  I am not sure whether the Attorney General agreed with the in-house advice.  I do not know where the third-party lawyer came into the picture.</p><p>Deputy Brady makes a valid point when he speaks about reputational damage.  The Data Protection Commissioner is the European regulator for outfits like Google and Facebook.  The Minister was highly condemnatory of the commissioner, a point I will return to in a moment.  The impression that this confrontation could create among multinational companies is that if one of them disagrees with a finding of the Data Protection Commissioner, it can go to the Irish Government and the Government will see it right.  In 2014, less than &euro;2 million was spent on the Data Protection Commissioner's office.  The figure now stands at &euro;15 million, which gives a good impression that we are serious about data protection.  However, this controversy is undoing that.</p><p> The Minister, in her response to me on a finding of the Data Protection Commissioner, was very condescending.  She spoke of compliance with enforcement notices being required within a certain number of days and stated she had not yet received an enforcement notice.  She said she would respond to the enforcement notice if it ever arrives.  There is no doubt that it will arrive.  My understanding was that the Minister was given 60 days to comply with some of the Data Protection Commissioner's requests.  As such, it is not unreasonable that she has not yet received enforcement notices.</p><p> What is the position?  Will the Government legislate in this area?  Will it fight the Data Protection Commissioner through the courts?  Will it accept, based on the fact that while the public services card is very useful and many people find it convenient and are happy to use it, those who do not want to use it for services other than social welfare should not be forced to do so?</p></speech>

The legislation that currently covers the DPC was voted on by the Fianna F&aacute;il Party, which did not object to anybody in the State having recourse to taking objection to a semi-judicial body making a statement of finding against them.  The State has done this on numerous occasions with an Bord Plean&aacute;la and many other Government and State agencies without reputational damage being done.  Nobody says An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been undermined by the State because somebody took a case against it.</p></speech>

The quasi-judicial rules and legislation that underpin the Data Protection Commissioner's office are exactly the same.  I am not sure what the purpose of the Deputy's questions was.  The Government legislation that has underpinned practice in this area for the past 20 years dates back to 1998 when it was introduced by the then Minister, Dermot Ahern.  It was amended in 2005 by the Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government and again in 2011 and 2013 by the Department under a Fine Gael and Labour Party Government.  This is not a case where the Deputy is good and I am bad.  To return to the foundations of this process, the purpose of the card was to ensure that people who wanted to do business with the State in an efficient manner could do so.  There is no bogeyman waiting to catch anybody out.  As the Deputy said a number of times, people like this card.  They like being able to deal with agencies of the State in an efficient manner and are doing so in their millions.  People who do not want to identify themselves through our SAFE 2 registration process do not have to.  There are other ways to access State services.</p></speech>

Use of the public services card was a mandatory requirement for first-time passport applicants and applicants whose passport had expired more than five years previously.  There was no alternative means of obtaining a passport other than having a public services card.  That is a fact.

I raised the case of six Irish barristers, all of whom are leaders in the field as regards the general data protection regulation, who stated categorically that this is in breach of the GDPR.  The Minister laughed at that which I do not understand.  It is interesting to look at the freedom of information, FOI, requests that have been made and the information that has been provided.  The Department seems to have a great regard for what these experts had to say, so much so that it virtually trolled Simon McGarr.  Any contributions Mr. McGarr made online went back to officials in the Department to get a view and an analysis.</p><p>On the one hand, the Minister seems to be dismissing these experts-----</p></speech>

It is not.  It is mandatory for anybody applying for citizenship to have a PPS number.  The only way to get a PPS number in the State is by going through my Department.  We are all aware that the Data Protection Commission has said that I do have the legal basis to make people go through the SAFE 2 process.  Words matter, and nuances really matter.  The statement made by Deputy Brady is incorrect.  The card was never mandatory for applicants to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in the context of undergoing the SAFE 2 process.  It is only because they need PPS numbers, and for no other reason.</p> <p>  The Deputy is suggesting that I misled this committee.

For a person to apply online. he or she would absolutely need to have a PSC.  How else would he or she identify himself or herself during the online process?  During those periods, a person always had the ability to go to the local Garda station with his or her passport application, get it signed, get the photograph signed and arrive up to the office in Mount Street.

The Minister has just stated that people need PPS numbers, obtained through the Minister's Department, in order to access the scheme.  A PPS number can only be issued by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, but it is very clear in the Data Protection Commissioner's findings and recommendations that people should not have to get PSCS solely for a purpose, including in the context of naturalisation, if that is the only reason they are asked to apply for PSCs.</p></speech>

I would question that the 3.2 million people who have the cards are all delighted and happy about it.  While they already have the cards, it does not justify the retention of their data after the fact.  If the Minister complied with the commissioner's third finding tomorrow, a person could still use his or her PSC, with the signature and the photograph, and could access all of the services available.  Everybody would be satisfied, SAFE 2 would continue to get the services, and the Minister simply would not have the additional file on the person.  In the Minister's survey - it involved 1,000 people and is, therefore, very small in the context of the 3.2 million cards issued - people were most dissatisfied with the retention of their records after the fact.  This had the highest level of dissatisfaction.</p> <p>  On the fifth finding, which relates to privacy and the privacy statement, we are aware that the data protection officer in the Department changed the privacy statement to reflect biometrics being recognised as part of it.  At the Oireachtas Committee of Public Accounts, the Data Protection Commissioner was clear that she is of the view that the Department collects biometric information.  The Department's data protection officer, whose charge is the link between citizens and their data protection rights within the Department, was removed and replaced.

There are 3.2 million active users of the card.  There are only 1.2 million recipients of services from within my Department.  The other 2 million people who have the cards got them for the crack.  They just got them because they wanted to have them in their back pocket.  I put it to the members that the vast majority of people think this is a good idea.  As I said earlier, most people the Deputy speaks to actually enjoy having the card and they use it for a variety of purposes and nobody is made to get a card.  People are invited to go through the SAFE 2 authentication process, and more than 4 million times people have come into our offices and freely provided the information required to go through that identification process, and have done so.  Are there people who are ideologically opposed to the card?  Absolutely there are, but that is fine and is totally allowed.  This is why we have alternative routes to access all public services, albeit they would not be able to do it online-----</p></speech>

Indeed, I tabled an amendment last year on the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2018, at which time the Minister stated that there was no need for such an amendment in light of the work to which her Department had committed.</p><p>The Minister stated:</p><blockquote>	We are ready, practically, for the finalisation of our report that was committed to under the Pathways to Work programme 2016-2020, which will examine exactly what the Deputy is looking for today.  I have no problem committing to that as the report is very nearly ready to be published. I am very happy, Chairman, that this committee be the first place that we have a conversation about it.  I do not need to recommit in legislation to something that is already practically completed. </blockquote><p>The amendment was not successful last year and many members took the decision, based on the Minister's contribution, that trust could be placed in her that the report would be forthcoming.  Unfortunately, another year has passed and the discrimination against our young jobseekers continues.  Unfortunately, I am tabling this amendment again because the report is not here with us.  She has spoken about making changes in the Bill, which are welcome but they do not go far enough.  Only approximately 300 young people living independently will benefit from the changes put forward by her.<br/><br/>We need a full poverty impact assessment.  Has she seen a draft of this report, the preparation of which seems to be going on forever?  Has she read the report or where is it?  If I could be given a date categorically now, there would be no need for this amendment.  Unfortunately, if we do not have that, I must press the amendment.</p></speech>

I did not realise a reply had been given last year when this report was requested so we need it now.  It was revealed to me in response to a parliamentary question that approximately 300 young people will benefit from the changes.  The idea of being able to live independently on meagre money of approximately &euro;118 a week is pie in the sky stuff.  There are approximately 29,000 unemployed young people so there is a cohort that is not being treated fairly.  Their payments were cut for austerity reasons but we are way beyond that justification now.  It is discriminatory behaviour to keep them in this bracket.  I totally support the amendment.</p></speech>

I have said many times that there are plenty of options for anybody aged under 25 to receive the full payment through training, employment opportunities, community employment, CE, or the youth employment support scheme.  There is a wide variety of opportunities.  I must correct the Deputy's probable misunderstanding, as 1,780 people aged 25 will be affected by the changes we are making this year.  On top of that, 380 people aged under 25 will be positively affected because of the changes.  Those are not the numbers mentioned by the Deputies.</p> <p>  Having said that, I am quite happy to accept the amendment as I find myself in the unfortunate position of only being able to answer his questions in the negative.  I have not seen a draft report or any sign of it.  It is imminent but I will not sit here and tell him that "imminent" has any different meaning from this time last year.  I am happy to accept the amendment on the basis that it might encourage us to give him the report and the information he has requested for the past number of years.</p></speech>

In a means testing scenario, a person is allowed to work for 15 hours per week.  This amendment would have increased the amount by approximately the value of the minimum wage, or &euro;10; if a person is allowed to work an extra three and a half hours, the means test would have to be increased accordingly.  In the case of a couple, for example, they might have &euro;665 per week.  This means that if a carer works more than 15 hours and earns a bit more money, it would be of limited use as it would come off the carer's allowance.</p></speech>

It appears that increases in carbon tax will be a feature of budgets from now because of climate change policies of all parties, including those in government.  There is an argument as to whether increasing carbon tax has any impact in reducing carbon emissions but that is beside the point.  The Government has accepted the proposition, which seems widely accepted, that it has an effect.  That is the stated purpose, at least, of increasing carbon tax.</p><p>Increasing the carbon tax will have a disproportionate impact on lower-income families.  If an increase is X, a higher proportion of income will be sacrificed as the income gets smaller.  The Government's strategy to deal with this was to increase fuel allowance by &euro;2 per week.  The fuel allowance lasts for 28 weeks, giving an increase of &euro;56.  The Minister told me recently during Question Time in the D&aacute;il that some studies have been done and it is reckoned that this amount is needed to compensate people.  I would like something more specific than that.  Many categories of social welfare recipients do not receive the fuel allowance at all and, in effect, they are not being compensated for the increase in carbon tax, which is grossly unjust.  If it is the Government's intention and the intention of future Governments to increase the carbon tax year on year, I would like a detailed assessment of how this will affect lower income groups so we can make the necessary adjustments in budgetary policy.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Dea's amendment focuses on low-income families but I have come at this from the angle of people in receipt of the fuel allowance.  We know the impact the carbon tax will have on people as it is not new.  It has been in place for a number of years.</p><p>By and large, they live in poor accommodation that may be badly insulated, that has little or no central heating and windows that are not in a good state of repair.  This affects local authority houses but also the private rental sector.  While we acknowledge there are some good landlords, there also some bad landlords in receipt of substantial amounts of State funding, whether through the rental accommodation scheme, the housing assistance payment or some other form of State assistance.  Carbon tax increased this year and it will continue to increase in the coming years.  This will disproportionately affect people in the situations to which I refer.</p><p> Other Deputies and parties have looked for an assessment to be carried out.  When I raised the matter previously with the Minister, she stated that it was not really her responsibility and she kicked it over to Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton.  There must be an onus on the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection to carry out this assessment, however.  I specifically honed in on people in receipt of the fuel allowance.  I take the point Deputy O&rsquo;Dea made.  I am happy to meet him to work on a formula on which we could jointly agree.  Leaving aside the wording, we need this assessment to be carried out.  Otherwise, a &euro;2 carbon tax rise does not take on board the massive rise in fuel costs over the past several years and into the future.</p></speech>

I am on the climate committee and fought hard to get such a study agreed on.  We got it agreed but it never happened.  The committee heard from witnesses from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, which had both carried out such studies.  We did not look hard at the evidence that shows increasing carbon tax actually reduces emissions.  There is much evidence to show that it does not.</p> <p>  Apart from that, because that is a kind of climate action issue, measuring fuel poverty by those in receipt of fuel allowance gets it completely wrong.  There is a cohort of people who do not get fuel allowance but who pay an extraordinary amount of money on electricity, gas or coal in order to stay warm because their houses are in poor condition, they are sick or one of their family members is ill.  If one looks at the way it is measured in other countries, all of these factors are taken into account.  They just do not consider someone being in receipt of fuel allowance or the level of social protection payments that applies.  I have met retired workers from RT&Eacute; and the Oireachtas who have been crippled by the increase in carbon tax, despite the fact they have a job pension.  They are cold but cannot afford to make the changes in their lives which this would require.</p> <p>  We need to look at a different measure.  If the Minister was willing to take this on board, that would be a start.  Another Department failed in this regard but this is also applicable to this Department.  Like MABS and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, a report would show this is a widespread and deep issue.  Fuel poverty is flying under the radar and will increase because of the actions taken by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p></speech>

We cannot bring forward amendments that will result in a cost to the Exchequer.  The only proposal we can push for is reports on the impact of cuts, changes or measures brought forward by the Minister.  This amendment seeks a report on the cost of hearing aids and the adequacy of the financial support in this regard.  In July, the organisation Chime gave a comprehensive statement to the committee on the impact of the cuts imposed as part of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation, FEMPI.  Some stark statistics came out of this.  We know changes have been made in terms of optical and dental benefits under the treatment benefit scheme.  Hearing aids have not, however.  I am trying to find out the entitlements prior to the changes but it was hard to get those exact figures.</p><p>The cuts were made in budget 2009.  There are over 300,000 people with significant hearing loss who need hearing aids.  Only one in five actually have them.  That is a low treatment rate.  If one has a look at those who have access to a medical card, they are twice as likely to have a hearing aid than those who do not.  Not having a hearing aid can have a massive impact on an individual.  There is much evidence to show that it can impact in terms of dementia and other medical issues, as well as social isolation.  This needs to be rectified.  Changes have been made in terms of the dental and optical treatments.  This also needs to change.  Unfortunately, I cannot bring forward an amendment calling on the Minister to reverse this cut.  My hands are tied.  Accordingly, I can only bring forward an amendment calling for reports on treatment benefits.</p></speech>

In 2012, the Government, the grant was reduced from &euro;760 per aid down to the current &euro;500.</p> <p>  I am happy to compile a report on this.  I already know what is in it because I met Chime and I commissioned a report subsequently.  I am quite happy to give the Deputy that report.</p> <p>  We do not pay in its entirety under any of the treatment benefits.  That has been the case for as long as they have been around.  We only pay towards the cost.  Digital technology has changed significantly over the past several years around many items.  The price of many items has come down over the years.  A crude example is that this is probably somewhat similar to the price of TVs.  A couple years ago, a 32 inch flat-screen TV would cost &euro;1,000.  Now, one can buy the same TV in Tesco for &euro;199.  The same has happened with the technology for hearing aids, meaning the price relating to them has dropped significantly.</p><p>Fortunately, around the time that the reductions were made in 2009 and 2011, a package was provided by the market that mirrored the &euro;500 that was on offer every couple of years.  I am happy to examine the matter and produce a report in order to allow the committee to consider it.  Any changes to the awards or the allowances that go with it will have to be made in a budgetary context by whoever is lucky enough to be in my chair next year.</p></speech>

There was a significant cut from &euro;830 to &euro;500, not to mention the second cut.

The matter has been the subject of a degree of focus and the Minister will be aware I introduced legislation in respect of it.  In advance of the changes being made, there was no consultation or meaningful debate in this institution, while there was little debate outside it.  The UK is the only other country examining increasing the pension age to 68 but it will not make the change until 2046, 18 years after Ireland.  We will increase our pension age to 67 in 2021 and further in 2028.  All the evidence shows that Ireland has nearly 30% fewer older people than other European countries.  Nevertheless, we are pushing ahead faster and further than all our EU counterparts.</p><p>In 50 years, Ireland will still have the lowest number of older people, with nearly 20% fewer than other EU countries.  We have always been given the rationale that the State pension age has to increase, while some use the terrible phrase of the ticking time bomb and so on.  The evidence clearly shows that is not factual.  We are nowhere near our European counterparts, yet we are pushing ahead faster and further than them.  In 2017, the committee published a report with cross-party consensus that indicated that further increases in the pension age had to be suspended.  The committee agreed to that, although I am not sure whether the Minister was aware.  It is an anomaly that someone who has to retire at 65 years old will sign on for jobseeker's allowance.  That is not acceptable.  If we increase the age in 2021, will we tell people who retire that they will have to sign on for two years before they can receive their State pensions?  It is an unfair anomaly and a report would be useful in this regard.</p></speech>

It is especially harsh on manual workers.  In the case of a bus driver who retires after more than 40 years, as my father did, it is evident that manual workers' lifespan is much shorter than that of white-collar workers or people who do less hands-on or shift work.  Many bus drivers die before they reach 70 years of age.  Now they have been told they will not be able to receive their pensions until they are 68 and that this will cost them &euro;45 per week, according to SIPTU's research.  It is grossly unfair to say to members of the workforce, not least those who have worked in the most demanding jobs, that they will be penalised.  While they may apply to Dublin Bus, for example, to continue for another year if they are healthy enough, they have the right to retire after 40 years' service, and they may find themselves making the choice that they cannot afford to retire because they would be &euro;45 worse off per week.  Moreover, the age level is rising.  The issue has caused riots - near revolutions - in France, Germany and other countries.  We have the highest rate of increases in the retirement age in the entire EU, which is shameful.  Something needs to be done and the report needs to be examined.  Much of the work has been done by SIPTU, including Michael Taft and others, but we need to examine it and its consequences in depth.</p></speech>

I am happy to produce a report for the Deputy and, in fact, most of it has been done in the confines of total contributions, which will come before the Cabinet in the next number of weeks.  I do not have the money, or even a Vote from which to take it, in order to conduct research, including international comparative research, and engage in public consultation.

That is the current position but the Government can change it if it wishes.  The reason advanced for the change is the demography, that is, the ratio of pensioners to the people who pay for the pensions, a difference that will increase dramatically over the next 20 or 30 years.  I was interested in what Deputy Brady said about what is happening in other countries.  I would like to see not just the age limits from other countries but also the comparative statistics, that is, the ratio of pensioners to contributors.  I do not imagine that would cost an awful lot of money.  I take the Minister's point about public consultation and so on but comparative research, not least against European countries, would be a one or two-day job.  If the public consultation provision is omitted, the amendment should be acceptable.</p></speech>

There are different timescales for different age groups.  However, the one that really gets to me is the 25 to 60 year age group because those in it must make 260 contributions before becoming entitled to any benefit.  I have spoken to many people about this matter.  It is a fact that children are starting school at a later age, that transition year is nearly mandatory in all schools and that an ever increasing number of people are attending college.  How many graduating from college will have 260 contributions made at the age of 25 years?  The answer is very few, which is why I have asked for the qualifying criteria to be reviewed.  I am not sure how they were arrived or for how long this problem has persisted.  The number of contributions may have been fit for purpose a number of years ago, but it is not now.  A swathe of people educate themselves and find employment to try to further themselves, but, unfortunately, they are precluded from receiving any benefit by virtue of not having made 260 contributions.  Therefore, a review would be very beneficial.</p></speech>

That is the purpose of the system.  If he wants to change to a universal system, we are talking about having an entirely different cheque book from the one the Department has.  I am quite happy to compile a report, but it will literally explain why the system is based on the making of contributions by recipients.</p></speech>

I oppose the qualifying criteria which require the making of 260 contributions.  That is the piece that needs to be examined.

Again, the qualifying conditions for recipients of jobseeker's allowance and supplementary welfare allowance for the fuel allowance are unfair.  For example, in order to qualify for the fuel allowance, a person needs to be in receipt of jobseeker's allowance for more than 390 days or 15 months.  For the sake of argument, if a worker becomes unemployed this winter, he or she will not qualify for the fuel allowance either this winter or next winter.  Potentially, he or she could miss out on payments for two winters, whereas someone who became unemployed earlier in the year or during the summer will only miss out on receiving the fuel allowance this winter but will qualify for it next year.  The way the conditions have been set up is unfair, particularly for persons who are very vulnerable.  We have gone through all of the arguments, including whether the allowance has even been set at the right level from the start.  I am not sure what the rationale is for stipulating a 15-month period.  Perhaps the Minister might explain it.  A review might prove greatly beneficial in the cases I have outlined.</p></speech>

He argued that, unless the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 was amended appropriately - he drafted the necessary amendment - it could become a permanent feature of the law.  He wanted to confine it to the purposes of this Bill.  I indicated that I would support the amendment.</p></speech>

Last week when I spoke to Deputy Penrose, I said that whatever impression had been given, it was certainly not my intention.  I will table an amendment to make sure there will be a sunset clause, exactly as mentioned in the amendment.  I, therefore, ask Deputy O'Dea to withdraw the amendment.  Unfortunately, I did not have the amendment ready for today, but it will be ready before Report Stage.  I also need to introduce related amendments to enable me, at the same time as making the order for the national minimum wage, to provide for parallel increases in the PRSI earnings threshold, as set out in section 13(2)(d) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act.  The reason is we cannot increase one threshold without increasing the others.</p></speech>

It was never my intention for it to be ongoing because I did not see the need for that to happen.  Please God, we will never have another year like this one because of Brexit.

The most vulnerable - the 136,000 who depend on the national minimum wage - work in industries that are booming, including the hospitality and services industries, yet they are being deprived of the benefits of this measure, while others were brought forward to enhance the profits of the very wealthy.  It is outrageous that an increase in the national minimum wage has been held back because of Brexit and for God knows how long more.  I am sure this is not of the Minister's doing.  It is probably due to the overall budgetary position, but it still outrageous.</p></speech>

For the excuse of Brexit to be used not to give the 136,000 workers on the national minimum wage a 30 cent increase is unbelievable.  It is a slap in the face for all those workers who get up early to go to work not to receive their just reward.  My party and others want to see the introduction of a living wage, but that is a different piece of work.  The 30 cent increase was the minimum proposed.  For the Government not to approve it was a slap in the face for workers.  With the amendment being withdrawn, the Labour Party's facilitation of this pitiful move by the Government is striking.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in is opposing the section.  I will have no hand, act or part in facilitating the Government.</p></speech>

Under Deputy Brady's proposal, section 20 would effectively be deleted.  That would mean that no one would be able to receive an increase in the national minimum wage at any date in the next 12 months.  I am not sure whether he realises what he is attempting to do.  My repeated statements, his misunderstanding of which is causing him angst, might be why Deputy Penrose is happy to support me, namely, that the Government has accepted in their entirety the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission to increase the national minimum wage from &euro;9.80 to &euro;10.10.

To put it simply, the court found that the automatic disallowance of entitlement to benefits was unconstitutional, since it represented a secondary or extrajudicial punishment.  The issues involved were complex, but they need to be addressed.  Work is under way to draft the necessary changes to the Act.  If they are ready before the closing date for submission of Report Stage amendments, I will introduce them as amendments to the Bill.</p> <p>  I wish to bring another matter to members' attention.  I have been asked by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to introduce a necessary amendment to the Agriculture Appeals Act 2001.  That amendment is being drafted and the Business Committee is discussing whether there must be a debate before it can be moved on Report Stage.  While the last amendment is outside my control, I want to flag to members that if the Business Committee decides to approve the amendment's availability for inclusion on Report Stage, I would like to make it one of our amendments for discussion next week.</p></speech>
