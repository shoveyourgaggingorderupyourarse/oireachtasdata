He is joined today by Ms Georgina O'Mahoney, deputy director of audit.  We have received apologies from Deputy Pat Deering.</p> <p>  We have received at least 80 items of correspondence, which is considerable, so I hope the committee can agree on them.  I sent out a draft timetable indicating that we would deal with the work programme and certain items of correspondence and that at 10 a.m. we would move on to NAMA.  I propose that, when we finish with NAMA, maybe before the vote, we conclude the meeting and hold over the correspondence until next week.  There is a large volume of correspondence.  We might get some dealt with before 10 a.m.  What we get done will be well and good.  We will hold over the remainder.  I printed off what we got.  I am sure there are up to 2,000 pages of correspondence received.</p><p>I record that I printed off what we got and up to 2,000 pages of correspondence was received.  One document from the National Transport Authority, NTA, on the review of public private partnerships ran to 600 pages.  I do not expect everyone to have read it all for today.  Are members happy in general?  If there is specific correspondence, we will deal with it before 10 a.m.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092000002#B00200"><p>I agree in principle.  Three or four items are time sensitive and we probably need to deal with those.  They are in the correspondence and have been aired in public.  Can we deal with those issues specifically?  I refer to issues surrounding the Vote for the President and CervicalCheck, the Scally report and Ms Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, which is a category in itself.  I agree with holding over on the considerable volume of information in the education sphere which must be put together, analysed and brought up at another date.  If we could prioritise the three or four items for discussion in the first hour, I would be in favour of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092000002#B00300"><p>I intended to propose that, aside from the minutes, we move straight to the work programme, which includes those urgent items.  There are three items that could be dealt with next week.  One is the issue of Vote 1 - President's Establishment, which is very time sensitive with an election around the corner.  The second item is the issue of CervicalCheck, on which there is correspondence with which we need to deal this morning.  The third item is an invitation from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, to the PAC and several other Oireachtas committees and Departments to talk about government accounting.  We will come to that.  They propose a meeting next Wednesday morning.  A representative delegation from the committee will meet the OECD.  Those three items have to be dealt with immediately.  I just want to clear the minutes first.  Are the minutes of 12 July 2018 agreed with no matters arising?  Agreed.</p> <p>  We turn back now to the work programme.  There are three time sensitive issues on the work programme.  I have a note on the file that we can note and publish on the request to discuss Vote 1, which is expenditure on the President's Establishment reported in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report every year.  I have received a lot of requests as Chairman for that to be considered.  I propose we consider it, as people have said it is not available under freedom of information but is within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  If the committee were seen to not want to discuss the matter, it might raise even more significant questions than any questions we might get answered if we had a discussion.  In view of the fact that nominations close next Wednesday, next Tuesday is the last possible day on which we can go there.  I would not be comfortable having a meeting on the issue after the close of nominations at all.  I do not think anyone would want to be here two weeks before an election campaign discussing the matter.  If we are to do it, we have to get it out of the way promptly.</p> <p>  Strictly, it will be the Accounting Officer only in relation to expenditure.  I would not allow any question to be directed involving the President.  The President is not answerable to the House, which is a long-standing principle that we will honour entirely.  If anyone asks a question about what the President did or did not do, I will rule it out of order.  The Accounting Officer will be here to answer and Mr. Seamus McCarthy has published his report from the previous year.  The most recent report will not be out until next week.  As such, we will have to go with the most up-to-date information we have.  The secretariat was in touch with Mr. Martin Fraser, the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, who is the Accounting Officer.  We would invite him.  There is a letter from him on file in which he raises some points and which we can note, publish and put up on screen.  It is No. 1557.  We can deal with the those points now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092000002#B00400"><p>What is the logic or reasoning behind examining this in the first place?  I have no difficulty with scrutinising any set of accounts and if a proposal is made, I will support it.  We have the letter from the Accounting Officer.  However, the accounts are audited by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and I might put a number of questions to him before we proceed.  If his office audits the accounts, I am sure it will have seen whether any pattern of issues arises.  I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General whether there has been any issue in respect of the accounts.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked two questions.  The first was to me and why we would examine this.  It is Vote 1.  There are 40 Votes before us every year and we discuss the majority of them, albeit we do not get to all of them every year.  As Chairman, I have received several requests to discuss the matter and I said that if we do it, it will have to be done promptly as I would not like to do it during the campaign.  It is the first chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report every year which we are free to examine.  I would not like to have a substantive discussion on the issue-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092000002#B00600"><p>With respect, the proposal came from the Chairman.  We have a great deal to do but let us not rush things either.  We have a responsibility to ask questions before we proceed to bring people in, especially if an Accounting Officer has raised concerns himself and written to us.  I am, therefore, asking the Comptroller and Auditor General about the work his office has done.  Second, my understanding is that Mr. Fraser is not an accountable officer, but is rather an Accounting Officer for the purposes of those accounts, which is a different thing.  I ask Mr. McCarthy to outline what that distinction is.  I have no difficult with us doing it.  We should do it quickly if it is the first chapter.  However, I do not want us to waste our time if Mr. Fraser is going to come in and say he cannot answer any of the questions we ask.  We have a responsibility to the Committee of Public Accounts to get answers to these questions before we proceed.  My questions were to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

There is no difference.  There is a difference in that the Accounting Officer for the Vote - and any Vote holder is an Accounting Officer - does not have executive responsibility for the decisions on how spending is done.</p></speech>

My audit addresses any questions we have to the President's Establishment and the secretary to the President.  The answers are given in the normal way but the Accounting Officer for the President's Establishment is the Secretary General to the Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092000002#B01400"><p>Is the issue then that the Accounting Officer, or accountable officer, is saying he cannot answer questions because it would be unconstitutional?  That seems to be what he is saying.  Mr. McCarthy says he audits the accounts in exactly the same way, signs off on them and gives an opinion.  I imagine if there were an issue, there would be exchanges between management in &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in and the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

The problem here is that we are being told we do not have an opportunity to scrutinise these accounts in the same way due to legal or constitutional issues.  Is that not what Mr. Fraser is suggesting?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092000002#B01700"><p>It is suggested.

We may need to get some clarity on that.  Do we have legal advice as to what we can or cannot do and what we can or cannot ask?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092000002#B01900"><p>The answer to that question is that we have not obtained legal advice because I understand that we will not direct any questions to him in respect of the President and will question him only in relation to the financial matters for which he is Accounting Officer.  He will not be able to explain.  It is just to provide the information.  He will not have made the specific arrangements.  As Accounting Officer, however, he has a duty to report to the Committee of Public Accounts arising from appropriated-----</p></speech>

That would probably be the question at which he would balk.  I do not think he would have a difficulty answering how the money was spent.</p></speech>

I accept that we will not be able to tease out why this decision was made as opposed to that decision, but he will have to say that this happened, this is what it cost, and this was the expenditure.  It is a question of having the information available.  That is all it is.</p></speech>

I am sure we are equally proud of all our Presidents.  I do have a problem with Mr. Fraser's letter.  He quotes the Constitution in it and, frankly, he is wrong.  He suggested that this is unconstitutional.  At no time are we seeking to question the powers or functions of any President or the execution of same, nor would we.  The Chairman quite rightly pointed out that any such questions would be offside.  I agree that is appropriate.  However, the tone of the letter did bother me.  It then goes on to say that, if we do this, it would in some way undermine the impartiality of the Civil Service.  I resent that suggestion because I do not see how that would remotely be the case.  In fact, my interpretation is the converse of that.  Here we have a senior civil servant seeking to direct the operations of the committee.  I have a real problem with that.  We should go ahead.  We should do it.  We should keep the questioning very much to the question of where the money goes and what happens to it.  It is a matter of public interest.  When people see the value for money they are getting - indeed the 10% surrender and coming in under budget is an example to all Departments - it might even encourage more people to engage in the democratic opportunity that is before us in October.  I thank Mr. Fraser for the advice but it is flawed and incorrect.  Under no circumstances are we seeking to undermine his impartiality or that of other civil servants in the political process.  I cannot say the same for this letter in terms of how it looks to me.  It seems he is seeking to influence our particular view.  In fairness to everybody on the committee, at no time in my few years on this committee have I felt that anybody took his or her political jersey through that door.</p></speech>

My big concern is that the campaign is now under way.  The nomination process under Article 12 is concluding.  It is very clear that candidates are out there robustly campaigning.  We can see that even at the front gates outside the D&aacute;il yesterday; at the Ploughing Championships, if anyone was there; and at events before that.  I have a huge concern that this could, in effect, compromise that democratic process.  I am all for transparency, but we are now so close to a presidential election that if we discuss the Vote here it will really impact on that election.  It is very hard to have demarcation lines in terms of the expenditure in Vote 1 that have nothing to do with President Higgins.  We have seen how difficult it can get in respect of these inquiries in other countries.  I am very concerned that it can get very highly charged in this room.  It can be difficult to stay within the lines.  This committee has a hierarchy of needs which includes CervicalCheck and our education sector.  We have huge important issues to discuss and now we want to look at a Vote which, first, has an audit committee established for it and which has internal audit procedures-----</p></speech>

Something either has an internal audit function or it does not.  It either has an audit committee or it does not.  He states clearly "I have also put in place an Audit Committee and an internal audit function" and the establishment is under budget.  If we are trying to pick important issues on which to adjudicate over this term I cannot see why we would immediately pick a Vote when, first, it meets its budget targets and has audit procedures in place and, second, we have such important other issues to discuss outside it.  In my opinion it would come across in a very bad light if we were to start trying to adjudicate on this in a highly charged atmosphere here.  There are also constitutional issues of which we have to steer clear.  Maybe we could do that, I am not saying we could not, but it is very difficult to keep things objective in doing so.</p></speech>

That is the first thing.  We have gotten legal advice for less.  We obviously have to get that.   In terms of the the work of this committee, the Chair has said that he has been asked to raise this.  For the public watching, he might tell us who asked him to.</p></speech>

A number of members of the public have also asked me to raise this.  That is why.  I could not say no to the media.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092000002#C02400"><p>When it comes to the priorities of the committee, given that we know that there is an internal audit function and an audit committee in place and that the actual Vote is underspent, one has to wonder why this is being brought forward now.  What is the rush to do it now?  Anyone who is watching these proceedings and who does not think there is some form of political capital to be gained, maybe outside this room, from this going ahead now is not being realistic.</p> <p>  Of course it will be impossible for the Chairman to unsay things that will be said in here that are linked to a candidate who is currently in office.  The Chairman needs to think about that.  He will not be able to unsay those things.  The media will not be able to unreport those things.  As a consequence, this rubbish about doing it before the closing date is irrelevant and insincere.  I am not referring to the Chairman, but people are saying this.  This campaign is up and running.  It is everywhere.  It is the most dominant story across the media and has been for weeks and months.  I am not finished.  The fact is that this is an ongoing campaign.  If we are going to jump into this now, it will really say an awful lot about this committee, about its priorities and about the fact that, from a political point of view, while we might leave our jerseys outside the door - I believe that and I share Deputy MacSharry's faith in it - the Chairman will not be able to unsay things said inside here, to unlink them from one candidate or to stop them being reported in the media.  That will be damaging to this committee and will have an impact on the presidential election.  We damn well better think about this very clearly and we better get legal advice because I do not want to be associated with a committee that goes down that road without its eyes open.  Things will happen in that meeting and we will not be able to undo them.  I have one last point with regard to this.  I do not think there is any way we can move without getting legal advice before next Tuesday.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.56" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092000002#C02500"><p>I thank the Chairman.</p><p>I was open to listening to everyone's opinion on the suggestion put forward.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, the person on whom we rely for advice, has advised us what we would be examining is how money is spent, not why it is spent.  This sets the parameters for any work that will be done in this room.  </p><p> This debate has spiralled in other spheres, despite the concise advice given by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I do not agree with Deputies Burke or Kelly that such an examination would compromise the democratic process.  I share Deputy MacSharry's point regarding the three and a half page rebuttal from the Secretary General to the Government, Mr. Fraser.  I wonder did he run that by the Attorney General, bearing in mind his challenge to this committee as to whether it has sought legal advice.  In his summary remarks he states: "I believe your proposal appears to be unconstitutional" but he does not reference whether he ran this three and a half page rebuttal by the Attorney General's Office to see if his own assertions were correct.  He references the Constitution.  The Constitution references the President as the person not being answerable to either Houses of the Oireachtas.  Mr. Fraser draws on Article 13.8.1&deg; in respect of the duties of the President.  It does not refer to the moneys of the office.  Mr. Fraser also talks about his own role as Accounting Officer and says that his capacity is in obtaining assurance that the office operates properly.  If his job is to obtain assurances that the office is operating properly, he obviously is required to set a standard of guidelines in respect of the spend of moneys, which are then subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and should be open to discussion and examination.  </p><p> As I said, I was open to the discussion this morning, as was Deputy Cullinane, but not in regard to the incumbent, President Higgins, in regard to the performance of his duties or how he conducts himself or his office.  The examination would be about how the money is spent and not why it is spent.  The letter sent to this committee by the Secretary General to the Government, Mr. Fraser, is amazing.  He has asked if the committee sought advice and if he can see it.  I do not see too much standing from him in that regard.  He has cited that it is his belief that the proposal for the meeting is unconstitutional.  We are at a stand-off.  I refute the point that an examination would in any way compromise the democratic process.  I do not believe it would.  That is a dangerous assertion.  If anything, it is about ensuring we have a democratic process, which is what anyone involved in a campaign would want.</p></speech>

I was trying to get my head around NAMA, the correspondence and many other items.  I was aware that the Chairman had received requests.   I have listened carefully to the discussion and I am now moved to say we should have a discussion on this matter because I have not been convinced by the arguments against doing so.  The level of argument worries me.  I say that reluctantly.  As pointed out by Deputy Cassells, the letter from Mr. Fraser mentions that he relies on reassurances.  I have tried never to be political in this committee.  I would expect the Chairman to reprimand us if we are political because in doing so, we would lose all credibility in terms of our job.  We have done a good job, as have previous Committees of Public Accounts.  We struggle with the amount of work we have to get through.</p> <p>  On this matter, there are practical questions to be asked, not about any President but how money is spent.  Perhaps it should have been done before now and perhaps the committee was negligent in not having examined Chapter 1 more carefully.  If it came before us previously and we did not give it enough attention, what is the difficulty in giving it attention now?  I do not agree that that work would have to be concluded by Tuesday next.  The issues are bigger than the election, the incumbent or candidate.  There are issues we should be looking at in terms of value for money.  That is the purpose of this committee.  If we limit ourselves to that, I am happy to do it.</p></speech>

He could have approached the matter differently.  That said, if we are going to do this, we have to frame it in the right context.  The context for me is that it is Chapter 1 in the account which we would want to scrutinise anyway.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has given us the parameters in terms of the "how" and on the controls that are in place.  It would be within the scope of the accounting person to answer for the committee not why the money was spent but how it was spent.  I think we should focus on that.  I support doing it.  I agree with the concerns around the upcoming Presidential election.  I said publicly when asked about this that I have a concern in that regard.  I do not think the Committee of Public Accounts should put itself in a position whereby it could be seen that we are doing this for political reasons, that there are people outside of this committee who are lobbying us to do it because they want it as a backdrop to the election.  That is not the reason we should do this, in my view.  We need to be careful, set parameters and do it right.  We should not allow that meeting to become a sideshow.  It would be remiss of us to do so.</p></speech>

Deputy Connolly's remarks captured it all for me.  I might have been relatively indifferent about the timing and so on but this letter has annoyed me.  It makes me feel like we should send the work programme over to Merrion Street and see what they are happy for us to do, who we should meet and what questions we should ask and so on.</p> <p>  There was an internal audit function for the Garda training college in Templemore.  We all know where that led.  That is not to say that the internal audit of the President's Establishment is not exceptionally good.  I am sure it is.  Another issue is the actions of the Chief State Solicitor's Office in offering as a defence the committee's interventions in a case as a reason for somebody to withdraw from suing the State in the David Hall case about which we were never consulted.  Under Standing Order 186, the Committee of Public Accounts is a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  With respect to the Secretary General, the Chief State Solicitor's Office and anybody else we set the agenda in this committee in line with our remit. </p> <p>  I am so annoyed about this letter and I want the committee to do the examination.  I am hugely proud of the performance of all of our Presidents, including the incumbent.  I am only interested in where the money is spent.</p></speech>

The ones for 2017 will not be published until Friday week, well into the campaign.  We are not waiting beyond that.  The last set of figures we are going on are the 2016 audited accounts.</p> <p>  Mr. Martin Fraser comments in a specific paragraph where he confirms the audit committee has not met and the chairman was not there.  He goes on to say that once the President's Establishment audit committee is up and running, it is expected an internal audit of the office will be then scheduled.</p> <p>  That is the last written issue on the public record from the Secretary General, the Accounting Officer, of the Department of the Taoiseach.  The only reason we are now aware that an audit committee is in place - it must have happened since then - is because this committee indicated it was going to consider this matter.  Mr. Martin Fraser has volunteered that information that he has an audit committee in place.  That is what he says in his letter.  His function is in relation to the audit committee.</p></speech>

When the Accounting Officer is here, the committee can ask him that question.</p> <p>  I am of the view that we will not have any questions in respect of the President at all.  This is important and I want to put this in the public arena because it might not be fully appreciated, even though it is a matter on the public record.  There is a discussion every year at the Estimates committee on Vote 1.  I was the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on public expenditure in the previous D&aacute;il.  I attended the committee five years in a row with the Taoiseach and officials.  There is a detailed explanation presented by the Civil Service to the Oireachtas as part of that process.  I have attended that at least five times in recent times.  Deputy Burke knows full well because he attended that meeting on 29 March this year.</p> <p>  At that meeting this year, the Civil Service provided detailed information on expenditure on the office of the President's Establishment.  It gave specific details on administration and pay, detailed notes on underspend, detailed notes on travel and subsistence, what trips were taken, not taken, planned and have happened so far this year, detailed notes on training and development and on the centenary bounty for people who reach 100 years of age.  All of that was provided year in, year out by the Civil Service for the Oireachtas to discuss in detail.  I know from attending the committee, as does Deputy Burke, that the members are free to discuss it in detail or to glance over it.  At the meeting, the Taoiseach even made reference to the Vote for the President's Establishment because he was also dealing with the Vote for the Office of the Taoiseach at the same meeting.  It was a matter for the committee members that year and every other year how much they wanted to delve into them.  Some years they had a detailed discussion about the President's office while other years they did not.</p> <p>  At that meeting on 29 March this year, at which the Taoiseach gave details on this matter, he was accompanied by Mr. Martin Fraser.  If it was constitutional for that meeting to happen and for the Taoiseach and Mr. Martin Fraser to discuss expenditure on Vote 1, it is constitutional now.  To raise the issue that he thinks it is unconstitutional to discuss expenditure in respect of Vote 1 at an Oireachtas committee, it is obvious what he is suggesting about his attendance.  He has raised this issue but his actions have spoken louder than his words by his actual physical attendance at the Taoiseach's side.  He talks about the political impartiality of the Civil Service.  The Civil Service gave detailed briefings to that Oireachtas committee year in, year out.  It is on the record of the House.  I do not understand why it could now be a constitutional issue.  We have to move on.  There is no difference between one Oireachtas committee discussing Vote 1 and another discussing it.</p></speech>

As I said when this issue first came out and when the Chairman made a statement over the summer, I was contacted by &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  I gave my opinion that it was discussed.  I am not disputing that the committee on public expenditure and reform discusses it.  My major issue is the timing of this.  The campaign is well under way.  No matter what we do or say, we cannot disguise that fact.  Discussing this issue in a highly charged atmosphere will have implications for the campaign.  Other candidates will take what is said here as having implications.</p> <p>  The Secretary General to the Government raised the fact that he does have to consult the Attorney General.  This is in his letter.  To say he never mentioned legal advice, is not correct; he did.  We should not misquote.  The core point here is that we have to be responsible in what we do.  We have to look at the needs of this committee.  Is this a critical and important issue for us to discuss now or are there more important issues?</p></speech>

I would like a ruling on that.  I think it would be prudent to get legal advice before we proceed.  I think we should get the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser to give us legal advice.  It would be irresponsible of us not to.</p> <p>  If we go ahead as several members have said, why can we not do it once the presidential election is over?  If we want to do it, if we feel it is legal and if we get advice to that point, why do we take the risk of having an impact, possibly an unintentional one, when we could do it a few weeks' time when this is over?  By God, we have enough of other priorities on the table.</p></speech>

It is actually getting worse.  There is nothing wrong with information, dealt with properly by ourselves in an open and accountable manner.  These types of arguments are actually echoes of what happened with CervicalCheck.  We know best; do it later; now is not the time.  I despair of this level of argument.</p></speech>

This committee has never in the past or will never in the future allow its work to be dictated by timings of elections.  In the previous D&aacute;il, the committee met right up until, and including, the day of the dissolution when an election was imminent within weeks.  The Committee of Public Accounts does not stop its work because elections are somewhere around the corner.</p> <p>  At this stage, I am proposing that, having considered Mr. Fraser's letter on 17 September, the committee has decided that it does not require legal advice on the matter and will on Tuesday, 25 September, proceed to examine the 2016 Appropriation Accounts - Vote 1 - President's Establishment.

It is extraordinary that Dr. Scally is still asking questions in the report because he did not have enough information or enough time to further examine some of the issues.  There are issues about the labs and the roll-over of contracts.  Whether we have a commission of investigation or not has not yet been determined by the Oireachtas.  The committee has a responsibility to look at the areas that come under its remit.  Procurement and audit are clearly under the committee's remit, as are failures in the system and process.</p> <p>  The HSE and the Department are scheduled to come in next week.  That is a little premature.  The committee should do a scoping exercise as to what it now wants to do.  Is it going to do a report?  Are there going to be a number of hearings?  Who should attend the hearings?  Otherwise these people will come in next week and we will all go through the motions.  It will be aimless and there will be no end product.  It is more prudent for the committee to agree terms of reference for our work on this issue either today or next Tuesday and get that from the clerk.  That would be a better way to do justice to the issue.  There is much in the Scally report which falls under the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The committee needs to examine the report and get a report on the issues that are under our remit and then decide the framework.</p> <p>  Will the Comptroller and Auditor General's office examine the Scally report and look at the issues arising in terms of procurement and auditing and the need for a special report?</p></speech>

I have not had an opportunity to look at it yet.  If next week's meeting goes ahead, I will look at the report before then.  We will be looking to see if there are any systemic issues that require further work.  My office has often reported a systemic problem with procurement in the HSE.  That is well established.  I wonder sometimes what is the point in repeating it, but we do, and I imagine we will be doing more work in that area.</p></speech>

What he is saying is sensible.  I also sit on the Joint Committee on Health and this issue will come to that committee.  There is a distinction here and I think we could be quite helpful to the Joint Committee on Health.  There will not be that overlap, about which there were arguments previously, because that committee will get into the components of the Scally report relating to happened with the HSE-----</p></speech>

There are specific issues.  I have spoken to Dr. Scally, a very impressive man who has done a huge report, a number of times and I have gone through the report and spoken with Vicky Phelan, Stephen Teap and Lorraine Walsh.</p> <p>  There is a need for the Committee of Public Accounts to look at specific areas that Dr. Scally has identified and aid the work of the health committee and the Oireachtas.  Those areas include examining how the money has been spent, issues around screening and labs and process and procurement, and how tenders rolled over and were changed and contractually managed.  The key finding of the Scally report was systemic failure.  We all could have written the first page of that report before there was any report.  There is a need to delve into organisational issues within the HSE.  There is a component here which is definitely within the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts and separate from the health committee.</p> <p>  The HSE will be before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Dr. Flannelly has offered to come in, and that must be acknowledged.  The timing, order and manner in which this is done needs to be thought about.  I agree with Deputy Cullinane that we need to put this into a pot and scope it out separately so that we maximise our work.</p></speech>

There is a lot of work that can be done.  My concern relates to next week's meeting.  I am not saying it will be an unproductive meeting because there is always something useful.  It would be more useful to do the scoping exercise as to what is under our remit.  Once the secretariat has time, it could provide a report.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has not read the report, but I am sure he will.  The committee will then have a plan as to how to examine the issues so that there is no crossover between this committee and the health committee.  We will know what we are doing.</p> <p>  That will determine who is invited in.  Dr. Flannelly should come in as part of that.  The Department and the HSE will be here.  Those with responsibility for procurement and auditing would form part of it and whatever else the committee decides.</p> <p>  The plan will determine who comes in and that needs to be done first.

There are detailed responses now from the Minister for Finance and for Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is a lot of stuff for public debate in our correspondence.  That meeting on health can be held over and the committee can deal with the backlog of correspondence from the summer.</p><p>That is great.</p><p> Staff in the secretariat have been working over the summer and I have told them to try to have some slots filled.  I suggested they find a large State agency that has not been before the committee in a while and they have come up with Teagasc.  Some members will be interested in Teagasc.</p><p> On Thursday, 11 October, we will have the Office of Public Works before the committee.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's most recent report will be published at that stage, which means we will be able to raise information from the report with the Office of Public Works.</p><p> On Thursday, 18 October, we will have the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform before the committee for a discussion.  We did not meet officials from the Department last year because we ran out of time.  We will bring them in early in this session.</p><p> On 25 October, we will have a special meeting on housing.  I ask members to start putting together specific points of discussion for that meeting.  That is the provisional schedule. </p></speech>

I merely make the point.  The head of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, has resigned.  There were some media reports on the reasons for his resignation.  I will not repeat them but they are in the public domain.  We were working with the HEA to drive reforms in a number of areas.  If it is the case that the reforms met resistance from the Department, I want to know why and what was happening.  The chair of the HEA should appear to answer some of those questions on the relationship between the authority and the Department.  What we found in our work was the level of governance, who was in charge and who was driving the car in terms of the reforms in governance and policy and the distinction between the two.</p> <p>  A secondary important point, which I have raised on several occasions, is that we still have not received the report into Waterford Institute of Technology.  Correspondence to the committee, which we will not get to today, includes a letter from a trade union representing dozens of people who were asked to come forward and be part of a report at risk to themselves.  We could call them whistleblowers or individuals who have come forward and made their points known.  They believe they have been left hanging because there has been no outcome or report.  It seems, on the face of it, the HEA made a complete mess of this issue, did not do its work in advance and did not anticipate the legal challenges that could arise.  My point is that we had a number of lengthy hearings with the Accounting Officer in-----</p></speech>

We have acknowledged that there is an issue in this area.  There was a deep dive done but there has not been an outcome, which is unacceptable.  It is unfair to leave so many people in Waterford IT hanging.  They deserved a product at the end of the process.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General was doing his report, which was only a small element of the overall picture in terms of research and development in Waterford IT.  By the way, it is a first class institute of technology.</p></speech>

There is no difficulty with quality but there are issues and questions around governance that need to be answered.  It seemed they were answered in this report but we do not have a copy of it.  My point is we need to get the report and apply pressure.  We also need to hear from the HEA's board as to what is happening.  The media reports on this matter need to be examined.  I ask for a response from the Comptroller and Auditor General on the status of his work on that issue.</p></speech>

I was not aware the Deputy had written in on it.</p> <p>  The resignation of Dr. Graham Love from the Higher Education Authority raises serious concerns because of what he wrote regarding his decision.  The HEA and the whole third level education cycle is like the gift that does not stop giving, by which I mean the issues are not being resolved and are still ongoing across the board.</p> <p>  On governance, it is obvious from the structure of the relationship between the Department and the HEA that there is a significant issue between the two organisations.  From a governance point of view, I would like to hear from Dr. Love before he leaves the HEA.  I would like him to appear in front of the committee.</p></speech>

The committee has dealt with many issues relating to a number of third level institutions, including an issue with Cork Institute of Technology which has been ongoing for years.  Some have not been resolved, including issues relating to whistleblowers, their treatment and the processes in place for dealing with them.  I have had direct interactions in respect of some of these cases and I find the way in which they are being dealt with incredible.</p> <p>  All in all, we need to address a number of issues related to the third level sector, the Higher Education Authority, Dr. Love and the Department.  We should have a meeting in the next few weeks and treat it as a priority.  Representatives of the relevant organisations should appear before us and isolate and address the issues before Dr. Love leaves his position.  In fairness, Dr. Love has a contribution to make before he leaves his position and it may be difficult getting him to appear after he leaves.</p></speech>

I very much support the call for a meeting on this matter.  It would be extremely useful.  Given that the boss of the HEA is exiting the organisation, it would be most informative to have him debrief the Committee of Public Accounts.  Notwithstanding the issues with whistleblowers, and Deputy Kelly, Deputy McGuinness and I recently raised in the D&aacute;il a specific matter concerning an outstanding issue with whistleblowers, I would like to have an opportunity to raise an issue with Dr. Love.</p></speech>

It is proposed to meet them somewhere in the House next Wednesday morning.  As Chairman, I propose that I will meet them.

They will ask us to make an input to the discussion.  I ask members to allow me to use my discretion, as Chairman, go give my views on behalf of the committee.  Staff from the secretariat will accompany me to the meeting and will report back.</p> <p>  There is no single national State balance sheet.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, will make his own point.  I believe the Estimates should be cleared before the beginning of each year, not months into the year.  I will raise the issue of what is on the State balance sheet, the various semi-State bodies, the universities, the section 38 entities and companies which receive more than 50% of their funding from the public purse but may not be on the State balance sheet.  I also want to raise the issue of accounting for public private partnerships.  I will also raise the issue of what I describe as contingent liabilities, medical negligence and the accounting policies of the HSE, the biggest State organisation.  Some of these policies are set down by the Minister in legislation and do not fully comply with international accounting standards.  We exclude contingent liabilities.  I intend raising the issue of agencies such as NAMA, which are not on the State balance sheet.  I will raise these issues to have them taken into consideration.</p><p>The final issue is contingent assets.  There is money out there that the State does not collect.  We all hear about the money the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection does not collect from people who - for example - have received a week's dole payment they should not have received.  We hear nothing at all about employers who owe money for redundancy refunds.  The State does not have a mechanism to account for that.  The Department does not have a contingent assets section to deal with the non-principal private residence charge.  If someone wants to sell a house ten years from now, the Government will be happy to take the &euro;7,000 then, but the money is due now.  There is no mechanism to know what is due.  I will raise those types of issues.</p></speech>

I want to put it on the public record.  The public does not understand this.  As we all know, NAMA was created when the Government took over the banks on behalf of the State and the taxpayer.

The principle of what I am saying is as follows: the idea of setting up an organisation called the NAMA Group was developed in the Department of Finance.  The NAMA Group has a shareholding of &euro;100 million.  Some 51% of it is owned by the private sector.  One of the insurance companies - Irish Life - owned some of the 51%, but it had to divest some of that.  As it happens, quite a lot of the 51% is now owned by trustees on behalf of various Church of Ireland pension funds.  The State owns 49% of the shareholding.  The State's shareholding gives it some power.  The 51% cannot make any decision without the 49%.</p></speech>

The 51% is off the State balance sheet because it is technically in private ownership.  It is a great con job.  Europe and everyone signed up to that mechanism to get it off the State balance sheet.  Logically, it should be part of the State apparatus.  It is not on the State balance sheet.  I want to raise those types of accounting issues.

We will deal with specific matters from our work programme - CervicalCheck and third-level education - and, under the business of the committee, we will have a lot of correspondence to catch up on.  Before we suspend for five minutes, Deputy Aylward would like to raise a final matter.</p></speech>

Like everyone else around the country, I am hearing about problems with the provision of the service, particularly with regard to concessionary tickets.  It causes uproar in rural Ireland at this time of year every year.  I know that a report was compiled last year.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might comment on this.  I wonder whether we have any role to play in this regard.  Can we play a role in examining value for money in the system as it is being rolled out at the moment?  Could we make any input?  Some &euro;195 million in taxpayers' money is being spent on this service every year.  I do not think the service is up to scratch.  It needs to be reviewed and we should play a role in any such review.</p></speech>

Under section 226 of the Act, I am required to carry out periodic reviews of the extent to which NAMA has made progress towards achieving its overall strategic objectives.  The report on the findings of the second progress review is before the committee today and covers the period to the end of 2016.  I propose in these comments to outline the report&rsquo;s findings in just a few key areas, updating where relevant to incorporate information from the 2017 audited financial statements.</p> <p>  NAMA is a complex organisation, comprising a group of interrelated companies.  At group level, NAMA has returned a surplus each year since 2011, following a significant loss incurred in 2010, its first year of operation.  The strongest surpluses were returned in 2015 and 2016.  This is reflected in NAMA&rsquo;s retained earnings of &euro;3.4 billion by the end of 2017, as indicated in the figure now on screen.  As at the end of 2017, the board expected NAMA will return a surplus of between &euro;3 billion and &euro;3.5 billion to the Exchequer upon completion of its work, assuming property market conditions remain favourable while the remaining assets are worked out.</p> <p>  NAMA&rsquo;s primary purpose was to acquire property related loans and related collateral from distressed banks, to hold and manage those assets, and ultimately to dispose of them within the ten-year timeframe in a manner that protects the State&rsquo;s interests.  Members will recall from earlier reports that NAMA paid the banks participating in the rescue a total of &euro;31.8 billion for loans that had a par value of &euro;74.4 billion.  Because the average prices paid for the loans exceeded their assessed November 2009 market value and the property market continued to fall, NAMA subsequently recognised significant loan impairment charges.</p> <p>  After acquiring the loans, NAMA developed strategies for dealing with debtors on an individual so-called debtor connection basis.  Sales of loan assets commenced early on, and additional loans were provided to certain co-operating debtors to fund agreed work-out plans.  The net effect of these changes, including impairment, is reflected in the value of NAMA&rsquo;s stock of loans and receivables, which reduced from &euro;27.9 billion at the end of 2010 to &euro;3.2 billion at the end of 2017, a reduction of 89%, as indicated in the figure now on screen.  On this basis, the disposal by NAMA of its loan assets is substantially completed.</p> <p>  By the end of 2017, NAMA had generated proceeds of &euro;34.1 billion from the sale of loans and receivables. This comprised &euro;23.5 billion realised through the sale of underlying collateral and &euro;10.6 billion realised through loan sales.  Almost &euro;22 billion, or 64%, of the proceeds were generated in the three years 2014 to 2016, when NAMA loan sales peaked, as shown in the figure on screen now.</p> <p>  The 2009 Act requires NAMA to obtain the best achievable financial return for the State in carrying out its statutory functions.  How that return is to be measured is not defined in the Act.  Following examination by this committee in 2014 of the first progress report, the NAMA board set an entity return on investment, EROI, target to be achieved over its projected lifetime.  This measure was designed to relate NAMA&rsquo;s projected final surplus in 2020 to its initial investment, less an estimated &euro;5.6 billion paid to the banks in excess of the loan market values.  The board agreed in 2014 on a target EROI value of 20%.  The final surplus of &euro;3 billion projected by the board as at the end of 2016 would result in an EROI of 33%, that is 1.6 times the target.</p> <p>  The key shortcoming of NAMA&rsquo;s EROI as a performance measure is that it ignores the time value of money, which relates to how long it will take to receive the return.  A better, and market-standard, performance metric for property related investments is the internal rate of return, or IRR.  However, NAMA has not set targets in that regard.  Based on what NAMA paid for its loans and its projected cashflows as at the end of 2016 for each of its loans, the examination team estimated NAMA&rsquo;s projected IRR on all loans to be around 6.2%.  This is the estimated return available to cover NAMA&rsquo;s expenses, including annual interest payments on its borrowing, which were in the range 1.5% to 2.25% between 2010 and 2016, as well as its other operating costs.</p> <p>  A key objective set by the NAMA board was that, by the time the agency was due to be wound up in 2020, it would have generated enough cash to redeem all of the &euro;30.2 billion of senior debt issued.  The board also set intermediate targets for redemption of debt.  NAMA significantly exceeded the intermediate targets and all the senior debt was redeemed by October 2017.</p><p>The only debt outstanding at end 2017 was subordinated debt of &euro;1.59 billion.</p><p> The NAMA board adopted two secondary objectives in 2014 in respect of facilitation of the delivery of residential units and office accommodation in the Dublin docklands strategic development zone, SDZ.  NAMA initially committed to delivering 4,500 new residential units to service the Dublin market over the three years to the end of 2016.  In 2015, that initial target was replaced with a national target of 20,000 units to be delivered up to the end of 2020.  NAMA has reported that by the end of 2016, it had delivered 4,647 units nationally, including just under 3,400 in Dublin.  It was forecasting the delivery of 3,500 units in 2017 and a further 14,000 units between 2018 and 2020.  With regard to the docklands SDZ, the board approved initial strategies for the NAMA-controlled sites in 2014.  NAMA has reported that by the end of 2016, construction had commenced on projects in the SDZ comprising some 166,000 sq. m of commercial and office space and 231 residential units.  There is considerably more detail in the report which I am happy to outline further if the committee requires.</p></speech>

The key financial results set out in the 2016 and 2017 financial statements represent significant progress for NAMA in terms of achieving its objectives.  We recorded an aggregate profit of close to &euro;2 billion over the two years: &euro;1.503 billion in 2016 and &euro;481 million in 2017.  We generated a total of &euro;8 billion in cash in 2016 and 2017 and this was used to redeem &euro;8.1 billion of senior Government-guaranteed debt, the last tranche of which was paid in October 2017, some three years ahead of schedule.  The carrying value of our loan portfolio, which was &euro;7.8 billion at the end of 2015, fell to &euro;3.2 billion by the end of 2017 and further to &euro;2.7 billion by the end of June 2018.</p> <p>  We now project that we will deliver a terminal surplus of &euro;3.5 billion to the Exchequer assuming that we can extract full value from the residual loan portfolio and that economic and property market conditions in Ireland remain relatively benign over the next two or three years.  In addition, based on payments to date and projected payments, we estimate that NAMA's cumulative tax contribution to the Exchequer could ultimately be of the order of &euro;400 million, which would bring NAMA's overall contribution close to &euro;4 billion. This is a long way from the doomsday scenario painted by some commentators back in 2009 that NAMA could lose &euro;10 billion or more.</p> <p>  Much of the portfolio that is left is secured by residual assets which have been retained so that we can maximise their value, either by funding their development or by funding their progression through the planning system and thereby enhancing their ultimate disposal value.  Part of the residual portfolio is also secured by assets which are of relatively low value but which, in many cases, involve legal and other complications which will take time to resolve and which will require careful management if we are to extract maximum value.  Maximising value is an obligation imposed on us by section 10 of the National Asset Management Act, which requires us to get the best financial return for taxpayers.  At this stage, the residual portfolio is almost exclusively secured by assets located in Ireland.  As of now, the value of residual assets located in foreign jurisdictions is less than &euro;100 million.  By comparison, the loan portfolio that we originally acquired was secured by some &euro;15 billion of assets located outside of Ireland.</p> <p>  I now turn to the progress that has been made on the achievement of NAMA's principal objectives.  This is the subject of the Comptroller and Auditor General's second progress report. The report was prepared under section 226 of the National Asset Management Agency Act, which requires the Comptroller and Auditor General, on a triennial basis, to assess the extent to which NAMA has made progress towards achieving its overall objectives. The first Comptroller and Auditor General progress report, which was published in 2014, concluded that, overall, taking account of NAMA's performance to date and its operating cash flow estimates for the period to 2020, it appears that unless there is a further significant economic downturn in the next few years, NAMA will generate sufficient cash to meet its minimum key objective of redeeming the senior debt.  Fortunately, there has been no significant economic downturn in the intervening four years.  This second progress report notes that the key senior debt redemption objective has been achieved and also records progress on a number of other major objectives. It is clear from the report that NAMA is well on course to achieve what it was set up to do and also to deliver a substantial surplus to the Exchequer.  It has also made a number of other valuable collateral contributions, particularly in funding the provision of much-needed commercial and residential accommodation.</p> <p>  The principal objective set by NAMA in its early years was to redeem the debt of almost &euro;32 billion which it issued to the participating institutions in 2010 and 2011 to acquire a large portion of their property related loans.  The senior debt of &euro;30.2 billion, which was a contingent liability - Government-guaranteed - on taxpayers, was repaid in full by October 2017.  In addition, we have now repaid a third of the &euro;1.6 billion subordinated debt and expect to redeem the rest of it by its first call date of 1 March 2020.  Earlier this year, we made an offer to holders of our subordinated debt to indicate terms at which they were prepared to sell some or all of their holdings to us.  In the intervening period, we have bought back &euro;529 million of the subordinated debt at prices which will achieve future savings for taxpayers.  We will continue to avail of any opportunities to redeem subordinated debt in advance of the March 2020 call date, but it is quite possible that some of the holders will wish to retain the debt until then.  The NAMA private investors will be paid after the subordinated debt has been redeemed.  Only then can NAMA's terminal surplus be transferred to the Exchequer.</p> <p>  In addition to the redemption of the senior debt, much progress has also been made on a number of other objectives set by the board and mentioned in the Comptroller and Auditor General's second progress report.  I will refer to two in particular, namely, the development of the Dublin docklands SDZ and the residential delivery programme.  These initiatives were launched by NAMA in 2014 and 2015, respectively.</p> <p>  As regards the Dublin docklands SDZ, the 15 sites in which NAMA initially had an involvement had the capacity to deliver 4.2 million sq. ft of office and other commercial space and 2,200 residential units.  The NAMA board approved its Dublin docklands strategy and business plan four years ago and, at that stage, only 1% of the delivery capacity of the docklands sites had progressed beyond the pre-planning stage.  NAMA undertook to generate activity in the docklands to bring coherence, direction and drive to its regeneration and development.  We said that we would work closely with Dublin City Council and others to bring that about and that we would provide the entire funding if that proved necessary.  Today, four years later, 61% of the 4.2 million sq. ft capacity is at the construction stage, another 18% has been completed or sold and planning permission has been achieved for the development of the remaining 21%.  We are pleased that we have been able to act as a catalyst for the development of the docklands area without putting taxpayer funds at risk.  Much of the funding for the area&rsquo;s development has come from private investors and financial institutions.  The development of the Dublin docklands has substantially improved Dublin's capacity to attract investment, including businesses which may be considering moving out of Great Britain over the coming years in response to the impact of Brexit.</p> <p>  One of our other major objectives is to facilitate the delivery of housing from sites controlled by our debtors and receivers.  Under EU law, we are required to operate on the same basis as private market operators.  This means that we can fund the development of residential projects only if they are commercially viable.  Otherwise, we could be deemed to be in breach of state aid rules.  Deputies may be aware that in January of this year, further to a complaint made in late 2015, the European Commission undertook an extensive review over a period of two years and concluded that NAMA's residential funding programme was not in breach of EU state aid rules.  Judging by some of the public discussion on housing, I am not sure that it is widely understood that the State has limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to funding private residential development.  If a State body is in the business of funding the delivery of private housing, it is required to operate on the same commercial basis as a market operator.  That means that under state aid rules, a State body cannot fund the development of sites that are not commercially viable to develop for private housing regardless of the scale of the supply shortfall in Ireland nor can it subsidise residential development by means of low interest rates or other special concessions that the market would not countenance.  Accordingly, the ability of any State body, including NAMA, to fund the delivery of housing is limited to those sites which are commercially viable at any particular time.</p> <p>  Despite the strong growth in sales prices in recent years, commercial viability is still a constraint on residential development.  Two years ago, the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, estimated that the total cost of delivering a three-bedroom semi-detached house in the Dublin area was of the order of &euro;330,000, including a site cost of &euro;57,500.  In the period since the SCSI published its report, the rise in sales prices has been matched by increases in development land prices and, as a result, achieving commercial viability on many sites remains challenging.  Rising sales prices mean that affordability has become a major issue, especially in the context of the macro-prudential loan-to-income, LTI, and loan-to-value, LTV, restrictions.</p> <p>  Some of the recent public and media discussion on housing delivery has tended to be overly simplistic in its analysis.  There seems to be a widespread but fallacious assumption that any land with residential planning permission which is not actually being developed is thereby being hoarded.  I can only speak on behalf of NAMA but the point applies to others also.  The reality is that one cannot fund the development of a residential site if it is not commercially viable to do so.</p><p>Does that mean that we are supporting the hoarding of land?  We are not.  I can assure the committee that as soon as a site becomes commercially viable, there is no hesitation on NAMA's part to fund its development. </p><p> There are other complications to be considered also.  Each site has its own unique aspects.  Some large sites require rezoning decisions by local authorities if they are to be developed.  Others require revised planning approval if they are to become viable.  Others still cannot be developed in advance of the provision of infrastructure such as roads, water, sewerage and other services.  All of these issues can be resolved over time but they require extensive and patient engagement with planning authorities and other stakeholders.  The prolonged effort that is often required to bring sites to the shovel-ready stage is not widely appreciated; it can often involve detailed preparation for two or three years in advance. </p><p> If there is to be a well-informed public discussion on housing supply, it needs to be recognised that not all of the sites which are zoned or have planning permission for residential development are in fact commercially viable to develop at prevailing prices.  In my view, the more pertinent issue is whether all of the sites which are commercially viable are in fact being developed and, if not, why.  Only in those cases would it be reasonable to claim that sites were being hoarded.  In respect of any sites which have viable planning permissions but are not being developed, I would fully support the use it or lose it principle. </p><p> There has been much talk recently of the emergence of private rented sector, PRS, opportunities.  PRS involves the commitment of capital by investors to the development of apartments which are then rented in the market thereby creating an income stream for the investors.  PRS is a relatively new asset class and, to the extent that it contributes to an expansion of residential supply, it is to be welcomed.  There is no doubt that some apartment sites would not be developed without PRS capital.  However, I would caution against the view of PRS as some kind of panacea which will make a major contribution to long-term supply.  Funds directed towards PRS seek higher returns than are currently available from money and bond market investments and, as long as bond yields are low, PRS will be an attractive asset class to those investors. It will be interesting to see, however, whether PRS will retain its appeal to investors in an environment of rising interest rates as quantitative easing tapers off. </p><p> We remain focused on maximising the delivery of housing from sites controlled by our debtors and receivers.  I believe that the almost 8,000 units that NAMA has directly funded since 2014 represent a significant contribution to housing supply.  Another 2,500 units have been indirectly delivered on sites that we facilitated and supported.  Our target is to facilitate the delivery of 20,000 units by the end of 2020.  We will fund much of this delivery directly but in some cases, where sites are at the shovel-ready stage, it is possible to transfer the development risk to licensees or through sales to private developers. </p><p> Some of our debtors have refinanced their loans and have now made the transition to bank funding or to other sources of capital.  Others will do so over the next two to three years.  In funding residential development, our primary goal is to recover as much as we can from the loans.  The ability of some debtors to refinance their loans on terms that also make commercial sense is a clear sign that the market is reverting to more normal conditions. </p><p> One site which has the capacity to make a major contribution to housing supply in central Dublin is the Poolbeg west strategic development zone, SDZ, in Ringsend.  This site, which is under the control of a receiver, is one of the few large development opportunities still available in Dublin.  It has the capacity to potentially provide up to 3,500 residential units and 860,000 sq. ft. of commercial development as well as school sites and community space.</p><p> This site provides a good illustration of the lead-in time and effort involved in bringing a major residential project to the point at which construction can actually begin.  It was designated as an SDZ by the Government in May 2016.  Dublin City Council, acting as the development agency, published the draft Poolbeg west planning scheme in January 2017.  More than 100 submissions were received from various parties and had to be considered by the council before it approved the plan in October 2017.  There was an oral hearing held by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in April 2018 and final adoption of the Poolbeg planning scheme by An Bord Plean&aacute;la is expected to occur over the coming months.  It will then be necessary to submit planning applications to the council for the development of site infrastructure such as roads and for the first phase of the project.  From the design stage to final planning approval, each phase approval process is expected to each take about 12 months.  It is unlikely that construction of the first phase of apartments will begin before 2020, some four years after the Government designated the site as an SDZ. </p><p> Clearly, development of this strategic site will be a massive undertaking in terms of the capital expenditure required, the significant risks involved and the envisaged seven to ten year timeframe.  The receiver is currently engaged in negotiations with Dublin City Council with a view to reaching a commercial agreement on the funding of the 900 social and affordable units - out of a total 3,500 units - which are required under the plan approved by the council.  If agreement can be reached between the receiver and the council, it will then be possible, after adoption of the scheme by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to proceed with implementation of the delivery strategy. </p><p> Overall, the market is responding, albeit slowly, to the shortfall in residential supply.  The Central Statistics Office estimates that almost 14,500 new dwellings were completed in 2017, an increase of 46% on the output for 2016.  Projections suggest that output in 2018 will be of the order of 18,000 units.  This is still well short of the annual requirement of 30,000 to 35,000 units but things are moving in the right direction.  Funding is now more readily available, particularly from non-bank sources, and the proposed establishment of Home building finance Ireland, HBFI, should help to expand further the supply of residential funding.  Capacity is also an issue and there is clearly a shortage of some key house-building skills.  Against that background, I believe that the gap between annual private housing supply and demand is unlikely to close for three or four years.  The more difficult issue is how the demand for social and affordable housing will be met in the near term.  Resolving this will be crucial if we are to have a more orderly market for renters and purchasers. </p><p> To sum up, I believe that NAMA has made major progress towards achieving its objectives.  Its principal objective - redeeming the &euro;30 billion in senior debt which was a contingent liability for taxpayers &ndash; has been achieved.  There is still a great deal of work to be done by NAMA.  Our focus now is twofold.  We have to extract as much value as possible from our residual portfolio with a view to maximising the terminal surplus that we ultimately hand back to the Exchequer; and, second, we have to fund or facilitate the delivery of as much housing as is commercially feasible from the loans attached to our debtors and receivers</p></speech>

Could Mr. McDonagh give me a brief overview of the geographical location of the overseas assets NAMA holds now, and the strategy employed in disposing of them?</p></speech>

It was certainly very important that we had overseas assets in the early days, when Ireland had gone into a troika programme.  The whole commercial and residential property and land market here had just died; there were no buyers and prices were dropping rapidly.  We used that period to look at our overseas portfolio and to generate cash.  Thankfully at the time, we caught a bit of a wave.</p> <p>  After the 2008-2009 crisis, most of our overseas assets were based in London, to the value of about &euro;10.5 billion.  We sold mainly from 2010 to 2016 into a rising market and we did very well with the London portfolio particularly.  We had about &euro;2 billion of assets in the US and about &euro;2.5 billion of assets in other locations in Europe.  The sale of those assets in the UK was pretty straightforward because it is the same legal system as in Ireland by and large.  Certainly the sale of assets in other overseas jurisdictions was sometimes quite difficult because we had a lot of local vagaries in law which we had to take account of.  Thankfully, we go out of the overseas market.  It was always our objective to be out of it as much as possible by the end of 2016 and we achieved that.  As of today, what we have left is only about &euro;3 million in London.  In regional UK we have about &euro;40 million and in the rest of the world including the US and continental Europe we have about another &euro;40 million.</p><p>It is less than &euro;100 million, as I said in my statement.  As of today, all our portfolios are effectively Irish-centric.  Some 70% of the portfolio is in Dublin.  Dublin and the contiguous counties, or what we call the commuter belt, and Cork, Limerick and Galway account for about 98% of the portfolio.  We have only about 2% in what we would call regional Ireland.  It is a good place to be at this point.</p></speech>

It obviously shows a huge amount of progress on our overseas property and loan portfolio.  Obviously, when an organisation such as NAMA is acquiring in excess of 12,000 loans, there will always be public commentary and debate on aspects that people deem controversial.  It was very clear from the NAMA Act, however, that assets were to be disposed of judiciously and that the aim was to try to get rid of the contingent debt.</p> <p>  I would like Mr. McDonagh to comment on some of the newspaper speculation and sales without getting into significant detail in each case.  I have written down details of reports on sales I have seen in newspapers.  Dock Mill, Barrow Street, sold for &euro;1.3 million and within a year it was resold for &euro;13 million.  A site on Sir John Rogerson's Quay was sold for &euro;7.5 million.  It flipped two years later for &euro;17.5 million.  New Century House in the IFSC was sold for &euro;28 million and was sold six months later for &euro;47 million.  What really got us into trouble in this country was speculation on property.  Sometimes the metric the media and others use to adjudicate on NAMA is that of speculation.  It is asked why the agency does not take advantage immediately of market values that may or may not rise in the future.  It is asked why the agency is not more commercially sensitive or sharp, for want of a better word, but this does not take cognisance of the way it was set up and its remit in legislation, and also its remit to reduce the sovereign debt.  How does Mr. McDonagh feel about this commentary?  Does he believe it is unfair when sales such as the ones I have mentioned are picked out?</p></speech>

First, the Irish market was dead.  We had to get the Irish market moving.  People invested capital in the early days before Ireland got into bailout.  We got the best price we could get for the assets at the time.  We had to generate some cash flow in Ireland and get some activity going to get some investors into the Irish market.  It always amuses me when people pick out examples and ask whether I wish I had held onto certain properties to get more money from them.  Of course I do but at the time we were trying to generate cash.  We had a troika target of paying off &euro;7.5 billion by the end of 2013.  That was non-negotiable.  I used to attend meetings every six months with the troika, with 40 people in the room, including representatives of the IMF, European Commission and the European Central Bank.  They would be shouting across the table at me asking why NAMA was not selling more and generating more cash.  They said they wanted NAMA to generate more cash and that it was too slow generating it.  That happened.  We said we would reach the target of &euro;7.5 billion, and we achieved that.</p> <p>  People do not comment on the other sales in respect of which we have done spectacularly well.  Nobody talks about that because it does not suit anybody to talk about that.  Let me give an example.  I am not saying this is right either but it just shows the other side, about which nobody talks.  Eighteen months ago, when we put on the market an asset that we just sold recently, people were offering us &euro;10 million for it.  We did not sell it then.  We have just completed a sale for &euro;30 million.  Therefore, we got three times the value that would have been realised 18 months ago by changing our minds and saying we would not sell at that point in time.  The buyer is the buyer.  It is a very expensive asset for him &mdash; good luck to him for buying it.  That is a big change in 18 months.  We benefit from that.</p></speech>

Some &euro;74 billion was loaned by the banks.  We took over those loans.  There was over-lending.  We bought the loans for what they were and we had to sell some of them.  As the Deputy outlined, some are disputed.  The values achieved were the best available at the time, when people invested capital but, as I said, on the other side there are examples of assets regarding which we have achieved a huge amount.  Nobody talks about them, however.</p></speech>

One sees this in media commentary.  I genuinely believe this is harsh because, when the agency took over, the property was only worth the value it took in terms of the haircut that was given.</p> <p>  Mr. McDonagh said that when the troika was involved, there were 40 people in the room.  Did he feel real pressure was being applied to the agency in that regard?  Does he believe the Act was too narrowly focused in its use of the word "expeditiously" and in terms of the pressure put on the agency under a short timeframe?</p></speech>

People can say many things about the legislation but I believe section 10, which refers to the best achievable financial return, has been a very good guide and a very good standard bearer for the NAMA board in terms of setting out its job and what it is supposed to do.  The word &ldquo;expeditiously&rdquo; was inserted by the legislators.  The legislation passed through the Oireachtas.  We had to take account of that.  Bearing in mind the word &ldquo;expeditiously&rdquo;, it is not stated that everything must be sold on day one; it just means that one does not hang around.  Ireland was heading into bailout territory even when the NAMA legislation was being dealt with in 2009.  The debt was spiralling very quickly.  When the legislation was passed, I was called in by the then Minister for Finance, the late Brian Lenihan, and he said to me that there was a big problem, that the legislation was passed and that the Oireachtas expected NAMA to get on with it.  He said, "Just do the job properly and do not make the problem worse."  That was his direction to me at the time.  He said, &ldquo;Do not make the problem worse; there are enough problems in this country.  Get on with it.&rdquo;  I have tried to live by that in terms of trying to make sure we come out the right side.</p></speech>

I have been around many Acts in my time.  One of the great strengths of the NAMA Act is the focus it gave to the board and the organisation.  There are all sorts of other solutions talked about from time to time and it is said that perhaps we should have done other things with the loans, but the fact that NAMA was set up and had a very focused remit, reflected throughout the Act, has comprised much of the reason we are where we are today, with a successful outcome, rather than where we could have been.  I know that is based on hindsight but-----</p></speech>

It was one of the first meetings.  I suppose the troika was being very tough on everybody at the early stage in terms of the programme.  I remember, in particular, that the ECB was particularly vociferous in asking why we did not just sell everything.  If we had sold everything at that point, we would not have got back &euro;32 billion, which was what we paid.  Since the market was plummeting, we might have got back &euro;18 billion or &euro;20 billion, and another &euro;12 billion or &euro;14 billion would have been added to the national debt to cover that loss.</p><p>I resisted that and held my ground and I remember the representative from the ECB walking out of that particular meeting.

That was the right thing to do and I stand by that decision to this day.  People talk about NAMA selling off assets in 2010 or 2011 and argue that we got very bad value.  They point out that the buyers of those assets made lots of money afterwards but they must remember that at that time there was very little capital around in terms of people who were prepared to invest in Ireland.  People also forget that most of our portfolio was in Ireland and we had only sold &euro;1 billion of that portfolio by the end of 2012.  That was a very strategic decision made by the NAMA board to sell a certain amount into the market to get the market going.  Every time we sold property we were getting the best possible value at the time.  We knew that the people who bought that property would probably make a substantial profit on it in the future but what could we do?  We needed to generate cash to reach the &euro;7.5 billion target.</p></speech>

The take-up by local authorities of NAMA properties for social housing was only 40%.  In terms of the jigsaw that is the housing crisis, what is Mr. McDonagh's view of how the local authorities are dealing with the issue in the context of NAMA's engagement with them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.205" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092000002#N00700"><p>People must understand that NAMA did not own the properties involved.  Our debtors or receivers owned them.  We only held the loans.  We told our debtors and receivers that there were potential buyers of their assets in the form of local authorities.  We pointed out that there was an opportunity for them to sell unsold stock.  We also worked with the Housing Agency and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We gave them information on the properties that were available, their locations and so forth and asked if they were interested in them.  The Housing Agency then engaged with the local authorities.  Approximately 7,500 properties were offered to the local authorities and confirmed demand stands currently at 2,700.  Some local authorities were very quick off the mark.  They expressed an interest in buying units in certain locations, agreed a price and the debtors or receivers were happy to sell.  We were happy to approve sales on that basis, as long as market value was achieved.  Other local authorities, however, took a very long time to consider the matter.  As the housing crisis has worsened, some local authorities are now regretting having rejected properties offered to them between 2012 and 2015 when the housing crisis was not so acute.  Unfortunately, however, the debtors or receivers have sold them into the market at this stage.</p> <p>  At this point, NAMA has about 2,900 units left in its portfolio, approximately 1,400 of which are in National Asset Residential Property Services, NARPS, our special purpose vehicle, SPV, which means they have been provided for social housing.  They have been leased to approved housing bodies and local authorities.  The remaining 1,500 are effectively rented.  I looked at the figures yesterday and of that 1,500, approximately 190 are unoccupied.  I asked why 190 were unoccupied.  I found that 90 have been sold but the new owners have not yet moved in and the others are being remediated because there are fire safety issues with them.  We are spending a lot of money on remediation so that those units will become available again.  They cannot be occupied at the moment because if something happened, we would be vicariously responsible.  We cannot let people into units when we know that they do not have a fire certificate or that there are other structural issues that render them unsafe.  We have very little stock left at this stage.  Every unit that has not been sold and that can be rented and used is available.  The only additional units that will become available for social and affordable housing will become available through two mechanisms.  The first is Part V, which makes 10% of developments available so that out of every 50 units built, for example, five will go to the local authority.  The other significant mechanism is the deal that will hopefully be concluded with Dublin City Council on the Poolbeg site.  If An Bord Plean&aacute;la approves the 3,500 unit scheme, 10% will be social housing, amounting to 350 units and another 15% or 550 units will be affordable housing which will be sold to Dublin City Council.  Hopefully a deal can be concluded.  That is the situation with NAMA at this point.  We offered up what we had over a number of years.  By the time some local authorities came back to us the debtors or receivers had sold the properties on or in some cases the debtor had paid off his or her par debt and had moved out of NAMA, in which case we could not offer the properties any more.  </p> <p>  I will refer briefly to the issue of unfinished housing estates.  There were many examples of estates of around 35 houses, with ten houses sold and occupied and 15 only half built.  NAMA was very successful in reducing the number of such estates by funding the completion of the remaining houses and making some or all of them available to approved housing bodies or local authorities for social housing.  That solved two problems - the social housing shortage and the problem of unfinished housing estates.  In 2010 there were approximately 1,500 unfinished housing estates in the country, of which 335 were in NAMA.  As of today, there are only three such estates remaining.  A lot of that is down to NAMA making funding available to complete the estates, which has been to the benefit of everybody.</p></speech>

We will probably fund up to 14,000 directly.  The other 6,000 are effectively attached to debtors who were in NAMA and who, due to increases in both house and land prices, are in a position to pay off all of their debts.  They still have sites which they will build on because they have new lenders who must be paid back but we would have given them funding to bring their sites all the way through the planning process.  The sites are shovel ready because NAMA gave them money and supported them.  Fair dues to them for paying off their debts, which is the right thing to do but the units will still be delivered.  It is in that context that we believe that the 20,000 units will be delivered by the end of 2020.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. McDonagh, Mr. Daly and the other witnesses to the meeting.  I wish to focus on a number of different topics.</p><p>Notwithstanding the interesting anecdotes of meetings with the troika and Ministers for Finance, I want to first get some context on the performance of NAMA.  I have no doubt a lot of good work was done and a lot of good decisions, it seems, were made.  Other decisions were questionable and we have scrutinised them in the past, although I will not go back on any of that.  I want to put a question to the Comptroller and Auditor General on the overall context and the macro figures as to how much the State put into the banks in terms of the par value of these loans <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>what NAMA got back.  What was the overall contribution by the State and how much did NAMA recover?  What was the loss, to use that word, given the word &quot;profit&quot; was used a number of times in Mr. McDonagh's opening statement?  Before we start talking about profit, we have to put the context out there.  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General can do that for us.</p></speech>

NAMA paid &euro;31.8 billion for those.  A point has been made that, within that payment of &euro;31.8 billion, &euro;5.6 billion was state aid.  Effectively, it was the premium that NAMA paid over the current market value of the houses.  The fact is that, having paid that &euro;31.8 billion and having covered its costs over a ten-year period, for NAMA to yield a surplus is a kind of contribution back towards the difference between the par value and the acquisition value.</p></speech>

On housing, without getting into who is living in them, there are people living in every one of those 10,500 houses.  It is no harm to remember that, in the past four years, NAMA has delivered roughly 25% of all of the housing that was delivered in this country, even though we were not set up as a housing agency.  In terms of overall performance and overall context, if we go back to the number of houses being delivered each year since 2014, one will find that the percentage directly and indirectly delivered by NAMA is approaching 25%.  That percentage, thankfully, is going to reduce as the number of houses being built in the private sector and elsewhere increases.  In overall terms, in regard to NAMA's performance-----</p></speech>

Therefore, when I look at the supply of houses now, I am conscious of what happened before, where there might have been an oversupply to speculators who bought houses to make money and speculated on the price of houses.  I would much prefer if properties were being sold and given to families who need them and will own them, rather than having huge swathes of homes bought by speculators and companies which are being established to buy up some of these properties.  I am interested in the breakdown of that figure.  Once I get that, it will give me the answer.  Unfortunately, we do not have it today, although I appreciate the points made.</p></speech>

If we add together all of what these major funds have bought in Ireland to rent out in what we call the private rental sector, it is probably about 5,000 units, or 2% of the housing population.</p></speech>

Essentially, NAMA sold houses to Cerberus and Cerberus then sold them back to the State's Housing Agency.</p><p>I can only surmise that they bought the properties at an attractive price, perhaps made money on them, and then they sold them back to the State.</p></speech>

Some weeks ago, there was a story in a particular newspaper.  First it said that it was 26, then it corrected it to say that it was 23 properties which had been bought back by the Housing Agency that were sold as part of a loan sale.  When one analyses this further, only four of those 23 were available at that time.</p></speech>

Mr. McDonagh might give us a note on that.</p></speech>

In it he said that the CSO estimates that about 14,500 new units were completed in 2017 and that will increase to 18,000 units in 2018.  That is far short of the 30,000 or 35,000 units that were estimated would be required. Mr. McDonagh continued by saying that the gap between the annual private housing supply and demand is unlikely to be bridged for three or four years.  Is that a bit optimistic when one considers those figures?  If one looks at figures of 14,500 rising to 18,000, that falls far short of the 30,000 or 35,000.  Why did he say three or four years?  On what was that based?</p></speech>

If one gets the 18,000 this year and one can increase the units delivered by 3,000 year on year, then that rises to 30,000 in four years.  That is what I base it on.  I believe that as demand is there, people will build more houses if they believe they can sell them.  One can see that in the increases coming through in planning permissions.</p></speech>

Almost everyone is now in the private rental sector, including many social housing applicants through the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and similar options.  We need to build more social and affordable housing.  That brings me to my point, namely, if NAMA is not putting enough social and affordable housing stock into the system through what it does, then NAMA becomes part of the problem itself.  That is why I am interested in that breakdown.  Will Mr. McDonagh give that to me?  Does he understand the point that I am making?</p></speech>

He will build the other 90 houses and he will sell them to the private sector.  That is the reality of what will happen.  Some of these debtors are getting into a position where they are moving because of increases in values.  Two years ago they had no chance of paying off all their debt to NAMA and now they are in a position where, because they are building houses and making reasonable profit on them and their landbank has increased in value, they have the opportunity to get banks to refinance them out of NAMA and pay off their debt.  Just because someone is a NAMA debtor, they cannot be treated differently from another guy down the road who has similar planning permission.  It cannot be that he only gives ten houses where the NAMA debtor is supposed to give 20.</p></speech>

I am intrigued in who names all these portfolios and loan sales.  I refer to the Orange portfolio which has 761 apartments.  A Canadian-backed investment company bought it.  Will Mr. McDonagh give a quick overview of what that was and what that firm did with the properties?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.253" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092000002#P01600"><p>Regarding that portfolio and the others that we sold, people were in those schemes.  They were mostly sold with people living in units they were renting.  When we put them on the market, they were openly marketed.  A number of bidders looked at the portfolio.  The winner was the one who would pay the most for it, and they bought it as is.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.254" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092000002#P01700"><p>They are now seen as one of the State's largest private sector landlord companies.  Arguments were made at the time that these apartments ought to have been sold individually.  Was NAMA aware of those arguments?  Were they considered?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.255" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092000002#P01800"><p>Yes, it was considered.  In some of schemes, we have been approached by people who want to buy them, and that is something that happens to this day.  People have the option of making an approach to the debtor or receiver and making an offer to buy the unit if they wish.</p></speech>

Many would argue that socially it would have been much better had the properties been sold to individuals rather than selling them on to an entity that would become a huge private landlord which would make money on the back of people.  Essentially, people are stuck in private rented accommodation and this is driving up the price of rents rather than selling the units off as individual apartments.</p></speech>

It has always been the case that we try to accommodate a situation where someone was renting and they wanted to make an approach to buy the property at whatever it was valued at.  Many occupiers made no approach to buy.  It is not as though these units were vacant and we were kicking people out.  That is not what we do.  They were sold as is with people inside, with leases, and paying rents.</p></speech>

I know that people were living in them.  The point is that they were sold and the matter of who purchases them has an impact on the overall housing situation.</p></speech>

Fair is fair.  If the local authority or an approved housing body had approached us to buy the portfolio we would have made every effort to try to accommodate them, but in many of the portfolios that were offered, no approach to buy them was made by the local authority or the approved housing bodies.  Our obligation under the legislation passed by the Oireachtas is to get the money back to pay off the debt that was hanging over taxpayers, which is what we did.  We had to sell assets.  That is what we have to do, and we have to force debtors to sell assets, and they are assets that debtors do not want to sell, but we tell them that they must sell them.</p></speech>

However, there was an intervention by the State.  Ministers were very clear that NAMA needed to play a part in addressing the overall housing crisis and looking at where the market was at and playing a role in that. There are choices.  It was not all about getting a profit or what might be the best price.  Part of it then had to be about what was in the best interests of the State and in the best interests of resolving the housing situation.  It is unfair to say that there was no commentary around that because there was.  There was direct intervention from Ministers on NAMA having a role to play.</p></speech>

As the Chairman mentioned, 10,500 units have been facilitated and funded by NAMA.  Over that, there are another 2,500 units, making a total of 13,000 units.  During the period between 2002 and 2010, the number of units delivered under Part V, before NAMA existed, was 5,700.  We have delivered 13,000.  We have played our part and we have done so in the context of the legislation passed by these Houses that we have to respect fully.</p></speech>

When every debtor came into NAMA, we asked them to produce a business plan.  These business plans were reviewed by a third party independent reviewer.  We looked at the business plan ourselves and presented it.  In some cases it went all the way to the board.  We know what we paid for the loans.  In some cases the board set a repayment target based on the value of the assets.  In all cases the value was much less than the target set by the board.  If the debtor was able to hit the target, that was the target set by the board.</p></speech>

What is the plan in discussions with the Department of Finance?  I see the work that has gone on in the past year or two, and in fairness I compliment a lot of it in terms of the value NAMA has generated for the taxpayer.  However, Mr. Daly did say in previous hearings that as an organisation, NAMA would not be around forever?  What is the work-out plan, or is there one?</p></speech>

The one that is foremost in our minds all the time is to deliver the promised surplus of &euro;3.5 billion.  That depends on working out the remaining assets which we have, which are &euro;2.7 billion in loans.  We have to work those out.  Our current projections are that most of those will be worked out by 2020 or 2021.  In that, we also have a target of delivering 20,000 houses.  We always said that was a target for 2020.</p></speech>

The imponderable issue is that we have some pretty strategic sites in the remaining assets and loan portfolios.  We have mentioned these in public.  The Irish Glass Bottle Company site is a case in point.  That will not be delivered by 2020.  We also have sites around metro north and places like that.  The value of those sites now is a fraction of what it will be when local area plans and infrastructure are in place.  The question is what to do with them.  Our view, which we stated at the annual report launch this year, is that it would be short-sighted to dispose of those sites now because NAMA will get better value for them after 2020.  Not only will NAMA get better value for them, that will help to ensure that they are utilised in the best way for housing.  This is a personal view and it is probably the view of the board.  Some continued involvement of the State would be beneficial.  That is the debate.  We have a clear trajectory to 2020 regarding housing and the &euro;3.5 billion in assets.  Beyond that, there is probably more value to be got, but how to do it needs to be debated.</p></speech>

Were there any discussions with NAMA regarding its creation?  If so, by whom, when and how?  Was there any suggestion of coming together with this agency after the 2020 milestone, to which I have seen Mr. Daly refer?  I agree with his sentiments concerning the future value of those strategic development zones, SDZs, and other locations when infrastructure becomes available.  Was there any discussion of the creation of this agency with NAMA?  If so, how far back and in what context?  With whom, why and how?</p> <p>  Second, was there a suggestion at any point that NAMA could be combined with other components to create this agency?  </p></speech>

From what I have seen about the LDA and the discussions the announcement around it, it has a very challenging remit at which it will no doubt be successful.  It concerns sites that are not really NAMA sites or sites in which NAMA is interested.  It has an extensive focus besides NAMA.

My view was that it should not be done in a big bang approach and that the Department should undertake a proof of concept first and, for example, take two or three sites and see what could be done with them.

That was helpful.</p> <p>  I have two final questions.  Strategic development zones, SDZs, have been mentioned and were outlined in NAMA's letter.  Regarding a number of other sites, it is inexplicable that NAMA hit certain roadblocks getting them to the development stage.  The example of the Dublin docklands was given.  It has pushed on to 61%.  The Poolbeg site situation will go on for some time.  Are there roadblocks in the process with local authorities and other agencies or is there a lack of legislation to help NAMA push on and develop other sites?  Of the blockages NAMA is hitting, which do the witnesses feel are unreasonable?  Let us forget about statutory planning requirements and so on.  We all know those rules.  This is an opportunity to express whether NAMA has hit any other unreasonable and unnecessary roadblock.</p></speech>

If those areas have been zoned as residential, local authorities will try to work with us to resolve issues.  Strange things have happened in some local authority areas, for example, an access issue.  We have been able to work with them on resolving these.

There were some sites within the commuter belt that required planning permission, and we had to revert to local authorities to have the conditions attached to those permissions changed.  I will give one example that we have since resolved by working with the local authority, but it took a while.  Fair dues to the local authority; it resolved it.  One of the planning conditions attached to the site was that, although 200 houses could be built on it, none of them could be sold until we funded the delivery of a traffic light system 1 km away from the site on land we did not own.</p></speech>

What about the Player Wills site?  It is an incredible site that I know well.  It covers 4.32 ha and has been vacant for more than a decade.</p><p>I know NAMA's remit, I explain it to people from time to time and I know how strict its mandate is, but to the public leaving that acreage in a prime location with access to facilities and the potential for between 600 and 700 houses idle for ten years is a disgrace.  A motion tabled by my colleague, Councillor Rebecca Moynihan, was passed unanimously by Dublin City Council last night.  It called for negotiations between the council and NAMA on the sale of that site.  NAMA has its mandate but it also has access to the site along with housing, flats and sports facilities, etc.  For want of a better phrase, there are "economies" that make sense here.  I understand that NAMA was doing a joint venture, JV, on this that has fallen through and now that it is on the open market, given its mandate, the agency has to pursue it.  Surely there has to be a coming together in this regard whereby NAMA can fulfil its mandate and the council can use the natural economies that exist by developing that site.  Surely the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will not say that it cannot purchase this site at a commercial rate due to a lack of funding.  If that is not the case, then it is robbing Peter to pay Paul because DCC is looking for sites to develop.  This site is available with its economies and the council will end up spending money in other ways, which will not give the taxpayers as much bang for their buck because it will cost more.  This site creates huge economies.  What is the status of the site?  Are there any negotiations with DCC?  Has the JV fallen through?  Will NAMA talk to DCC based on the motion that was passed last night?  I want answers.</p></speech>

We looked at the possibility of trying to do a JV but the big problem that happened here is that land values have increased dramatically over the past 12 months so the valuation of that site has also gone up dramatically.  The situation on that site now is that the valuation could be in excess of the debtor's par debt and the debtor could have equity in the site.  Having said that, that means that whoever buys that site would clearly have to work with DCC on St. Teresa's Gardens on the back of it.  I am aware of the site and the need for a master plan for working together.  Anybody who wishes to approach the receiver and make an offer for the site must be aware that the receiver will consider it but, equally, that the receiver has a legal obligation to the debtor.</p></speech>

I know NAMA's mandate off by heart.  Having said that, it is robbing Peter to pay Paul from the public's perspective because of the economies that would be created by DCC having this site for affordable and cost-rental housing.  It will cost the State more by going down this route.  I know state aid rules well.  I went through them a lot in my two years as an MEP and I even helped amend them years ago in respect of the percentages allowed in different parts of the country, but there has to be some format whereby the mandate of NAMA can be fulfilled and the commerciality of it can be respected in order that the economies of Dublin City Council taking this site and developing it either in conjunction with someone or by itself can be realised.  This is a test case given where we are in the housing crisis.  The council unanimously decided last night to go down this route and we will have to find a way to deal with this within the rules.</p></speech>

He says that NAMA got its designation in 2016 and it will be 2020 before a house has been started on.  It will, therefore, be at least 2022 before somebody moves into a house there all going well.  That is a time lag of six years.  It dawned on me during his opening statement that if the value of that increases substantially over that period, the receiver might have a very different view on what can be achieved.  Is that possible?</p></speech>

The way I would describe it is that ,currently, if it all had planning, we have a landbank that could deliver 42,000 units.

The change from 42,000 to 9,000 is 33,000 units, how many of those does he think NAMA will build or does he think the private sector will write a cheque and walk away?  The reason I ask that is that everyone thinks that NAMA might be the solution given that 42,000 housing units might be built on the land under its control.  Mr. McDonagh must have a good idea.</p><p>It is quite probable that two thirds of them might not be under NAMA's control.</p></speech>

The Chairman is right to go for the big picture in terms of analysing this because as the prices improve in the market, if one is a debtor and one can afford to pay off all of one's debts one is probably better to be with a bank or other financial institution rather than NAMA.</p></speech>

On the positive side, it is great that the people paid back their par debt and the taxpayer gets all of this money back from those loans.  That is great news.  On the other side, it means the State will have lost control of the sites in terms of State development but hopefully the private developer will build.</p></speech>

NAMA is talking about the success it has had in being able to give money back to the State but that applies if one draws a circle.  If one draws an inner circle, in which NAMA is making a surplus, and an outer circle the space between the inner and outer circle is what the taxpayer has borne in addition, through recapitalising the banks, the costs of NAMA etc.  Is that right?</p></speech>

There is a tribunal as we speak, a commission of inquiry relating to a particular project from NAMA and its costs.  I see NAMA as inadvertently part of the problem, whether the witnesses like it or not.  In the context of the mandate they have been given, property prices have to keep rising to make NAMA worthwhile and ensure a return.  Is that not right?</p></speech>

On the question of value for money, if property prices keep rising as they are, NAMA is getting a return and it looks good on paper.  In the meantime we have a housing emergency.  We are paying &euro;300 million in housing assistance payments this year alone to private developers.  These things are the implications of having no social housing and not enough other housing being built, leading to property prices rising.  I have a duty to look at value for money in a different way from the way the inner circle might look at it.</p></speech>

We inherited a distressed assets portfolio and had to sell some because we had no long-term mandate to hold onto them.

I am not an economist or a financial.  That is what I read in the summary and it is repeated in the report.  It says the Act requires NAMA to obtain the best achievable financial return.  In 2014, and only in that year, NAMA set an entity return on investment target of 20% and on that it achieved 33%.  The report says that this measure does not take account of the time value of the money and that the standard performance metric is an internal rate of return.  There is a clear conflict between the two.</p></speech>

It is a difference in professional opinion.  I do not think the Comptroller and Auditor General is saying we are wrong.  He is just saying it is a different way of doing it.  What I am saying to the Deputy is that the biggest part of our residual business is the funding of residential house building.

If the last asset is only worth &euro;10 million, one will only have got &euro;90 million for &euro;200 million worth of loans.  If one says one only got &euro;10 million for selling &euro;120 million worth of loans, it looks like a very small percentage.  However, that ignores the fact that the other assets were sold to which unpaid par debt was attached.  That is the context and explains it in as simple terms as possible.  We look at this in terms of the overall connection because there were asset sales and a residual loan sale.  If one combines the asset sales and the loan sales and looks at it against the unpaid debt, it looks like small amount if one looks only at the loan sale in relation to the unpaid par debt.

If one just looks at it in terms of loan sales and the par debt, it is less than 10%, but that does not reflect the true picture because there were asset sales where we got money where there was unpaid par debt which was sold as part of the loan sale.  It was just residual loans with no assets attached.</p></speech>

In terms of its headline performance, there is no doubt that NAMA has been a huge success.  In terms of the Act that was provided, I say "Well done".  We are going to make the money.  The question is, however, as Deputy Connolly asked.  At what cost has that come?  It is a regret for me personally as a former finance spokesman in the Seanad when the Act went through in 60 hours that we did not have a NAMA No. 2 or No. 3 Bill to provide additional oversight and transparency through the process.  However, with the tools NAMA was given, we are going to make the money, which is great, but at what cost?</p> <p>  I was watching on the monitor earlier as I had to pop out and Deputy Kelly was speaking to the witnesses about the potential disposal of the Player site.  Mr. McDonagh made the point that it is likely, or at least possible, the debtor will have equity in the site and may well get to pay off all the debts and have some money left over, which is great.  If I was Joe Bloggs, a NAMA debtor whose assets were disposed of in 2012, I might take the justifiable view that I was unlucky.  If it had been the Player site, I might have ended up with money because a decision was taken to keep that asset while disposing of mine.  That will be a question.  As politicians, we have all had representations at our clinics over the years from people who felt they did not get optimum treatment in the NAMA process.  Those questions will always linger.  However, that is not the witnesses' fault.  Section 10 was the overarching provision and Ministers of the day had the potential to give directions.  The fact is that they did not.</p><p>For me that was a failing all along, in terms of some of the points Deputy Connolly made.  </p><p> On a personal level, I would like to put on record that, notwithstanding that it is great money will be there, we will always look back and wonder if we could have done this so much differently and so much better, in terms of a social dividend and in terms of Ministers of whatever colour or creed displaying a level of agility and an interest to adjust the process along the way that could have given as good a return in the context of the financial payback to the Exchequer when that time came, and in the context of the cost, whether to developers, to small businesses or to the social dividend, social housing being addressed to a greater extent.  The Player site debtor is in the lucky position where they may have a dividend at the end.  In the case of the person where, for whatever reasons, although perfectly legitimate at the time, a decision was made to dispose of their assets at an earlier stage, there is probably going to be debt following them to their graves.</p><p> Earlier Mr. McDonagh made a reference to a meeting with the ECB, which made demands on him which were resisted and its representative ran out of the room.  Fair play to Mr. McDonagh for doing that.  It is an awful shame we did not do that on the sale of loan books by the pillar banks, where the ECB was applying extraordinary pressure for all of these things to be sold off.  NAMA, the State and everybody else no longer have these problematic debts, some of which are performing.  They have been sold off to third party organisations that are not even regulated in this country.  It is a shame Governments, officials and decision-makers did not resist European pressure in that way, as Mr. McDonagh did back then, when he said he was not selling everything and that he was going to try to get the best he could.  It is a shame we did not have that level of leadership in other quarters of this State, as was outlined earlier, that he showed when it came to standing up to the ECB at that time.  As a former member of the banking inquiry committee which had to go down to Dublin Castle, or wherever that charade of an event was, to ask questions of Mr. Trichet, it was crystal clear that he threw us under the bus.</p><p> Can I ask Mr. McCarthy, given the complexities of NAMA and the number of different companies or whatever - we were given a good organisational chart - has he the diversity of resources and expertise at his disposal to give a really clear audit opinion on all those entities?</p></speech>

Can NAMA give us an assurance that the issues that are raised in the press today are false and that no such conflicts of interest exist?</p></speech>

I am just trying to use the time efficiently and because Mr. Carville is before the committee.  I have seen correspondence that shows the Chief State Solicitor's office wrote to a third party who is taking action against the State to try to gain oversight of the IBRC liquidation, which is a matter I have raised many times here before, and in that the offer was made that the case would be withdrawn if the Department deferred to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Committee of Public Accounts, being a House committee set up under Standing Order 186, does not have its agenda set by the Department of Finance or even by the Taoiseach.  I might have supported the idea of the Department deferring to the Committee of Public Accounts because it could not answer any questions previously about the liquidation because of the case taking place.  However, I do have a problem with the Department offering this committee as a tool to facilitate the Department's ends, as opposed to a process determined by the committee members, without it consulting the committee.  Was Mr. Carville involved in that or could he confirm that the Department was, because I have seen a letter from the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office to the effect?  I was just wondering if Mr. Carville had any hand in the preparation of that letter or in advising the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s office?</p></speech>

Could I ask Mr. Carville again, was he aware that happened?  As I said, I might well agree with the Department withdrawing its case and deferring to the Committee of Public Accounts because I think it would be more in the public interest, but as a matter of courtesy, never mind actual procedures of the House, the Department might have had the manners to contact the clerk to the committee, the Chair of the committee or any one of the other 12 members to ask if it was okay.</p></speech>

I put all these matters on the record at previous meetings when we decided on a course of action.  It is all there, so it is not new.  Yes, of course I speak for myself.  One thirteenth of the view of this committee is mine and I put it out there.</p> <p>  The last report of this committee was published in January and one of its recommendations was the establishment of a committee of inspection for the liquidation of IBRC.

Serviced sites are so valuable because there is a double cost for those who have to repeat the servicing of sites and that is a further call on the public purse.

The developer does not have to pay the full amount upfront but pays a small amount and then pays a certain amount as he or she builds and sells houses on sites.  We have introduced that as a condition of those sales.  It encourages developers to make sure that they build.  Once the house is sold, certain proceeds come back to NAMA, which will go towards the site payment.</p></speech>

Many of these debtors who had better sites and who were attached to those loans have refinanced themselves out of those US funds.  The debtor is now being refinanced by another bank.  Something which NAMA is prevented from doing which the funds are not prevented from doing is cutting a deal with the debtor to say, for example, that a debtor owes &euro;100 million, the assets are only worth &euro;50 million, and to give the fund &euro;52 million and walk away.  We cannot do that.  The big US funds which bought many of the loan sales from NAMA and others do not want to hang around.  They have been selling those portfolios and that landbank.  Much of that landbank has been bought by investment funds and plcs which are into house building.</p></speech>

I was speaking about language and addressing whether there is a difference between having a dialogue and getting direction from the Minister.  There was talk of schools and possible housing, etc., but was there any encouragement or anything other than a specific direction dealing with how assets should be disposed of?  Was it something that would have been routinely spoken of?  There was originally a longer timeline and it was pulled back.  What was the dialogue that led to this?  Was it something considered by the witnesses?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.685" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092000002#JJ00300"><p>There would be regular dialogue between the Minister and us, mainly with me, as the chief executive officer indicated earlier.  It would have ranged over the whole performance of NAMA, where we were going, the timeline, debt repayment and all of that.  Perhaps 2014 is a good example as at that stage we were evaluating in particular the pace at which we were monetising the portfolio.  At that stage things were happening in the market that gave us more confidence that we could get good value for assets and loans.  We would have had that conversation with the Minister.  I go back to the point made earlier by Deputy Connolly as no directions were given to us in that regard.  These are things we would be continuously evaluating ourselves.  I remember we had a fairly extensive strategy discussion in 2014, with various options as to where we could go.  We also had a section 227 report around that time, which was an evaluation by the Department of Finance about where NAMA was going and all of that.  From this emerged a view that we would accelerate the monetisation of the portfolio while the market was good.</p> <p>  Also arising from that came the housing element.  As I said earlier, NAMA was not set up to be a housing agency or anything like that and one would not find any reference in the Act to housing.  However, from 2014, we began to fund the building of houses quite extensively.  The outcome of that was that in the past four years, as mentioned earlier, we have delivered something like 10,500 houses and another 2,500 units of social housing.  I made the point earlier that in that period, despite NAMA not being the housing agency or anything like it, NAMA delivered approximately 25% of all housing that was developed.</p></speech>

Housing is clearly not something isolated from the economy and the cost of housing has a direct bearing on disposable incomes.  In turn, it has an impact on the real economy and people's purchasing power, etc.  Mr. McDonagh describes the housing market in his opening statement as "benign", and the word crops up a couple of times.  Mr. McDonagh's definition may come from a different place from where many people now find themselves.  They may find it impossible to find somewhere to rent or buy at an appropriate price.  How did Mr. McDonagh reach the conclusion that the market is benign?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.689" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092000002#JJ00700"><p>I said property markets are benign, meaning that prices are not falling.  We have &euro;2.7 billion of the portfolio that still must be converted into cash.  If the market falls, the &euro;2.7 billion could become &euro;2 billion or &euro;1.5 billion but currently we are saying we can get &euro;2.7 billion for the portfolio.  It is its fair value.</p></speech>

It relates to whether there is a benefit in having property prices rising.  From a NAMA perspective, it is clearly seen as beneficial that property prices would rise and certainly do not fall.  The witnesses would speak of the impact that would have on the amount returned to the Exchequer.  This is not a siloed argument, however, as there will be a cost in housing assistance payments for the real economy, for example.  There are other aspects to consider and I do not see where the social dividend lies.  There was mention of 10,000 houses from the portfolio.  While I accept the portfolio is not completely residential or available for use, a sizeable amount is available.  The number seems very small and there is a social dividend aspect.</p><p>It certainly does not seem to have played out in housing.  Does Mr. McDonagh accept that is a valid argument?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.692" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092000002#KK00200"><p>I accept that is Deputy Catherine Murphy's view.  The position that we are in is that we have to follow the legislation, as enacted by the Oireachtas, to get the maximum amount for the assets.  On the other side, we cannot give the assets away for free because we do not own the underlying properties.  They are owned by debtors.  If we did give them away, the Deputy would be saying we were not chasing the debtors to repay all of their loans.  What we do is if somebody has a loan and they have property, and the value of that property is set by the market and the market pays that, that is the amount that will go towards repayment of the loan.  In most instances it will not repay all of the loan but in some instances it will.  We have to operate the way that we are set up.  I have my personal views on housing.  It is very expensive.  I was looking at some statistics yesterday with one of my colleagues.  If we look at the last two years, in 2016, based on statistics from the CSO, the income ratio to buy a house in Dublin was 3.2.  In 2018, it has gone up to 3.4.</p></speech>

I started raising the issue of housing mainly because there was a big investment in a multinational in the area where I live and we were seeing the upturn before other places.  There was a big hire of 4,500 people and it sucked up whatever was available in the rental market before the recovery became visible.  This was obvious in 2012 and 2013 in some places, but certainly in 2014.  It seems, however, that many of these assets were bundled and there was a kind of a rush to sell in a rising market.  They were being sold to particular funds that really were not dedicated to building houses.  Was there any serious dialogue about changing course and did NAMA feed into that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.694" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018092000002#KK00400"><p>As Mr. Daly outlined, the Department of Finance did a review of NAMA in 2014.  It was like a Comptroller and Auditor General's section 226 report.  A review must be undertaken by the Minister under section 227 and he did one in 2014.  It said that NAMA was a big contingent liability for the State, a huge debt was still overhanging it, the national debt was up to &euro;200 million and NAMA should move as expeditiously as possible towards extinguishing that contingent liability by selling assets.  That is what we did.  The Minister concurred with NAMA's strategy but that strategy was informed by what the Minister and the Government thought we should be doing.</p> <p>  There are many different people with different responsibilities.  The primary responsibility for housing sits with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  Do I see that there is a big housing crisis?  I certainly do.  Do I agree with Deputy Murphy that we could see the property market beginning to recover in 2012 and 2013?  I certainly did see that as I outlined during previous committee appearances.  There is a finite point to what people can pay.  If we look at the CSO statistics, which I am happy to provide to the committee if members do not have them to hand, we can see that the Central Bank's limits for mortgages is 3.5.  We are at 3.4 in Dublin as of 2018.  If people cannot get a mortgage at more than 3.5, house prices cannot go above that because people will not get mortgages to buy them.  That does not mean that people will not build stock-----</p></speech>

The issue here really boils down to the fact that that does not solve the housing crisis.  It can only be solved, in my view, by having more stock available in the market.  We funded the building, as Mr. Daly said, directly and indirectly of about 10,500 units in the last four years.  There are, however, plenty of other people in the market who have land banks.  They are beginning to build houses now but the issue is that we need more housing stock.  The whole system is choked up.  If we do not have enough housing stock, there will be people renting who would like to buy.  There is also the issue - another Deputy expressed a view on this earlier - that there should be more social housing stock available.  If there was more social housing stock, then those people would not be trying to rent against other people in the system.  This is a fundamental problem and my point is that it can only be solved by increased supply.  We are doing our best to deliver as much housing as we can but we have a limited mandate, our timeframe will probably finish at the end of 2020 and the market is the market.  I ask the Deputy to believe me when I say that we have sites, even in her own constituency, that we would like to develop but for different reasons we cannot get on and develop them.  Those are sites that have good infrastructure.  There are all sorts of complications around this.  It is not straightforward.</p></speech>

I want to be clear with the committee.  Nobody in NAMA is cheerleading for price increases in housing.  Increasing prices have a positive effect for us in respect of our return and, ultimately, the &euro;3.5 billion that we will return to the State.  There is nobody in NAMA, however, saying that it is great for us that house prices are increasing.  There was a time when returns were going the other way and we had to grin and bear it back in 2010 and 2011.</p> <p>  I reiterate a point made this morning.  Under our mandate, as a board and as directors, we cannot fund projects that are not viable and many of them are still not viable.  There is also a capacity issue in the house building sector.</p> <p>  There is a dearth of skills and a dearth of people with the capacity to build.  The committee should look at the 10,500 units that we have delivered in that context.  That is 25% of all of the building that was done in this country over those years.</p></speech>

According to a newspaper article published in the summer, NAMA offered the Housing Agency some properties - I could be wrong on what entity was involved - and the offer was not taken up.  The properties were later disposed of to Cerberus and have since been purchased for market value.  Are there other examples of that or was that a one-off case that resulted in the public purse picking up a cost that was not value for money?</p></speech>

As I explained, that sale involved 23 properties and, effectively, only four of those would have been potentially available.  They were not taken up or were not going to be delivered at the time.  We had subsequent loan sales in Project Emerald and Project Ruby.  We went through those portfolios before they were sold and we went to the Housing Agency.  We took almost 200 properties out of one portfolio and offered them to the Housing Agency.  I think about 180 of them were taken up.  In the other portfolio, which I think amounted to close to 300 units, we delivered about 250 units to the Housing Agency.  We trawled through the portfolio and informed the agency that certain properties were available.  These were properties that were unoccupied.  Some of the properties we sold in the loan sales were already occupied.  We cannot just kick people out of a property because they will have no place to go.  They are sold with tenants in possession.  We are certainly not going to make the problem worse.  We trawled through the portfolios and pulled out as much as we could.  The Housing Agency talked to local authorities and approved housing bodies and took up a certain amount.

The information gleaned from the exchange so far has been beneficial.  I appreciate the frank offer of information.</p> <p>  I wish to begin with Mr. McDonagh's remarks in respect of the social housing engagement NAMA had with local authorities and the offer of 7,000 residential units to them by the agency, of which only 2,717 were taken up.  He stated that many local authorities retrospectively contacted NAMA to indicate regret that they had not availed of those units.  Given the current housing crisis, I also regret that they did not accept the offer.  I wish to explore that because it is a scandal that our local authorities, which often refer to the crisis facing them and the pressure they are under, did not engage with those offers.  How many local authorities retrospectively indicated to NAMA that they regretted not taking up the offer when it was on the table?</p></speech>

We do not engage directly with local authorities but, rather, through the Housing Agency.  Some local authorities have expressed the view that it would be great if those units were available now or if more units were available in their areas.  They were speaking in generalities rather than specifics.</p></speech>

That was a poor rate of take-up by the local authorities.  Many elected members of local authorities are very critical of NAMA but this was a situation where the local authorities had the opportunity to take up units it was making available.  Where were the majority of the units?  Were they concentrated in particular counties?  Were they in commuter counties or spread throughout the country?</p></speech>

Some local authorities believed the housing mix was not right.  Others stated that there was 20% social housing in relevant areas and if they took the offered units, that would be pushed up to 30%.  As the Deputy will be aware, local authorities have parameters in terms of housing mix, such as having a maximum of 20% social housing in an area not wanting an over-concentration of social housing.  That is the reality for them.  They are dealing with the issue on the ground.  All NAMA can do is make such units available through the Housing Agency.  The decision to take them up is for the local authorities.</p></speech>

No local authority or approved housing body has agreed to take on an unfinished estate or one where there was a compliance issue.  We have put in the money to finish such estates and offer them to local authorities in a fully compliant state.  We have spent &euro;130 million on remediation issues and will probably spend another &euro;70 million on them.  NAMA is not afraid to commit money to a project if we believe the end product will be commercially justifiable.</p></speech>

The situation is ridiculous.  Local authorities have thousands of people on housing waiting lists.  As Deputy Connolly said, some have been on the waiting list in Galway for 16 years, while others in my county have been on the list there for ten or 12 years.  In spite of that, local authorities are talking about parameters.  I delved into this issue at a meeting of a housing strategic policy committee in Meath last week.  We do not have any public land on which to build social homes.  When the Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government appeared before the committee, he was not prepared to address land acquisition programmes.  In spite of all that, there was only a 40% take-up of the completed units being offered by NAMA through the Housing Agency, which is a scandal.  The approach of our local authorities to this issue during the housing crisis is scandalous.</p> <p>  In terms of the process, Mr. McDonagh stated that NAMA went through the Housing Agency.  Did the Housing Agency then go directly to the CEOs of the 31 local authorities or did it go through the Custom House?</p></speech>

To return to a point raised by the Deputy, page 43 of our annual report contains a map of where the 2,400 properties we had delivered by March 2018 are located.  We did not have any property in some counties.  Pages 40 and 41 contain examples of before and after and detail the money we put in to improve the units and turn them into quality developments in which people could live.</p></speech>

At times, the Housing Agency focuses more on parameters than county councils or, certainly, elected members.  I presume the Housing Agency reported back to NAMA in regard to the take-up.</p></speech>

For example, as one can see from the map on the screen, 39 properties in Meath were taken up.  I do not know how many we offered in Meath.  If we offered 100 there, the Housing Agency may have come back to say it would take 39, including ten in Navan, five in Trim and five in Kells or whatever part of Meath it may be.  NAMA may have had another 20 units in Navan that the Housing Agency did not want.  We accepted such decisions.  The owner of such properties probably rented the units on the private market or put them up for sale.  We now have approximately 1,500 properties in our portfolio which we have yet to sell.  However, approximately 190 are vacant.  Approximately 90 are in the process of being sold and will soon have new occupants.  The other 90 properties cannot be occupied because they have remediation and fire issues.</p></speech>

I am trying to understand the reasoning behind these decisions.  Mr. McDonagh stated that the properties were subsequently sold, so they were commercially viable properties.  Did the local authorities indicate that the properties were not suitable for them?</p></speech>

We gave that information to the Housing Agency, which discussed it with the local authority.  It might come back to indicate there was too high a concentration of social housing in a particular town and that the local authority did not wish to have any more social housing there.  It might indicate that a one-bedroom apartment was required but we were only offering a three-bedroom house.  What could NAMA do in such a situation?</p></speech>

If I put the list of what NAMA was offering up on my social media account tonight, those properties would be snapped up quickly.  The reasoning behind the decisions is key.  In some instances, did the Housing Agency indicate it did not have the funds to purchase the units?  It was earlier stated that it was short of funds.  Was there a funding issue?</p></speech>

We have a special purpose vehicle that holds almost 1,400 properties, which are being leased to local authorities and approved housing bodies all over the country.  In such cases, we stated that the capital was not needed upfront and that we would take a long-term income stream.  We created a vehicle for that.  It is on NAMA's balance sheet and will have to be sold or something will have to be done with it when NAMA is wound up in 2020 but that is a decision for another day.  We told the local authorities and approved housing bodies that they did not have to have the money upfront.  If they wanted the units, we would find a mechanism to deliver them.</p></speech>

Representatives from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will be before the committee in a number of weeks specifically to discuss the issue of housing.  It will be the sole item on the agenda.  It will make for an interesting conversation on that day.  Mr. McDonagh said the local authority said it had enough in certain areas.  When there are 4,000 people on a housing list in one town, a director of housing or a CEO would have a brass neck to come back and say there is enough of anything in one area because we do not have enough housing.  The fact that NAMA had that number of units on the books and was offering the capital upfront makes the response by the local authorities even more bizarre and scandalous.  </p><p> Was the poor take-up communicated to NAMA by the Housing Agency?  Did it go back to the Department and outline what had transpired?  Was the Minister alerted to it?</p></speech>

Given the funding was not an issue because NAMA would have taken care of the capital upfront, were the so-called parameters which meant they did not want an over-concentration of so many social housing units in a particular area their guiding rule for the refusal?</p></speech>

It is unbelievable to think we are in here week in, week out and that there will be a vote of no-confidence in the Minister next Tuesday night, yet we have a situation where only 2,700 of 7,000 units which were going to be paid for upfront and leased back were not taken.  It goes back to the discussion on the Housing Agency.  I have made this point here before about the so-called parameters, who is running the show and whether local authorities have the gumption to stand up and deal with this issue properly.  There are plenty of blame games being played with the Minister blaming the local authorities and local authorities saying the Minister is to blame.  However, homes were on the table, as Mr. McDonagh said, and three-bed semi-detached houses were being offered but that is not what the local authorities wanted.  It is scandalous.

Unfortunately, there is only one funder of that, which is the State, no matter how it is done, whether through long-term PPP or upfront payments.  We were in a bailout and the country was operating within strict fiscal parameters and it continues to be that way.  We have assets and if whoever buys those assets, whether a local authority or the private sector, has planning and can build houses, somebody's capital has to be used.  All I am saying is there clearly was a shortage of capital in the public system.</p></speech>

We have an in-house planning team, which talks to local authority planning departments all the time about the sites we have, whether there is an local area plan coming up and whether something is to be zoned or unzoned.  When we are in pre-consultation discussions with receivers and debtors around specific sites, we discuss how many houses could be built on a site and what type of houses they could be.  We do all the pre-planning discussions that everybody else on the market does.  That goes on the whole time.  We also have ongoing discussions with local authorities, sometimes directly and sometimes through the Department of Education and Skills, where the Department will say there is land in a particular town and a new school is needed.  We talk to the planners and they say, "Yes."  Part of that will be designated for a school site and then we engage with local authorities on a mechanism to sell the site to the Department of Education and Skills or a local authority.  In fairness to the local authorities, we have good engagement with them, particularly on the planning side with the directors of planning.</p></speech>

Mr. McDonagh talked about whether it is zoned or unzoned.  We have the new regional economic strategies coming down the line, which will lead to significant dezoning in commuter belts where land was potentially overzoned.  The impact of these strategies will be dezoning in development plans.  Has NAMA conducted an assessment on the implications of that for its debtors?</p></speech>

NAMA is not the only landowner affected by that.  Other landowners who are not in NAMA are affected by it also.  This is part of the strategy in Ireland 2040, but we are not the only people affected.  We cannot make a special plea as it affects other people also.  There will always be consequences arising from these policies. </p></speech>

We engaged with local authorities, we worked with them and there were certain sites that were in the NAMA debtors' portfolio.  There was an expectation that there would be a certain amount of LIHAF funding coming for it, but now we hear that actually there will not be LIHAF funding available and that LIHAF funding may now morph into the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF.  There are different parameters around URDF than had been around LIHAF so there is a bit of confusion out there about what is going on.  There are certain key sites we would see in Dublin and its border counties that have serious infrastructure deficits, but not insurmountable infrastructure deficits, that will cost money to resolve.  If it was available LIHAF would certainly be helpful to provide the infrastructure.  These issues are not just to do with NAMA and they affect other landowners who are not in NAMA who we know also.  It is not about special pleadings, it is just the reality of what is going on.</p></speech>

Along with health, housing is the problem.</p> <p>   The Comptroller and Auditor General's report refers to the property management system.  Assets were sold and they came back again.

They would be aware that we are having discussions about housing sites and so on with regard to developing them.  The local authorities would then indicate if they knew, for example, that the Department of Education and Skills was looking for a piece of land in the area, or perhaps another colleague in another department may be looking for amenity land and so on.</p></speech>

We have engaged with them the whole time.  We engage with senior people and the chief executives all the time and we are always talking to them.  In my experience and that of my colleagues, any chief executive in any local authority is very interested in the areas in his or her own local authority and what is going on there, as he or she should be.  They would ask NAMA if we are involved in a particular piece of land in a town or if we are not.  Sometimes everybody believes that NAMA owns all the land in the county and we would then have to say that certain land is not in our ownership at all.  If we are asked if we have any idea who owns certain land we would put the local authority right by trying to find out if we could and let them know if Mr. X or Ms X owns a piece of land.  Our policy from the start has been that if a local authority or a public body expresses an interest in any asset in NAMA we would get an independent valuation.  We would let the local authority know that the independent valuation for a site is, for example, &euro;2.6 million and ask the local authority if it wants to buy the site at that value.  If it wants to buy the site the local authority or public body must close on it within three months.  That is the type of deal we do.  We always try to accommodate that aspect.  NAMA does not own the loans or asset completely and we must go to the debtor to get him or her to agree to the sale.  We must also got to the receiver for his or her agreement, but we have been able to accommodate this process.</p></speech>

In terms of the market understanding about what affordable housing is, if one is a debtor and has loans then one wants to get the maximum amount for those assets to pay off one's loans.  We cannot go in and sell the houses at under value to the local authority because the debtor will say: "Well, you have undermined my ability to be able to repay my loans."  I think there are two different things going on here.  Affordable housing is something that has to be agreed as part of legislation - a planning condition.  If one gets planning, again for argument's sake, for 100 houses and 10% are social and, say, 10% or 15% are affordable, then if that is the planning condition that applies to everybody in the land the market has to adjust and deal with that, but that is not the way legislation is at present.  All that the legislation says at present is that if one gets planning permission then the local authority must set down a minimum of 10%-----</p></speech>

There is nothing in the legislation about a percentage that has to be allocated for affordable housing.</p> <p>  The only scheme that I am aware of, and I have outlined it in my statement, is the Poolbeg West SDZ.  Dublin City Council, when it approved the SDZ - the project has now gone for appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la - said that it is10% social housing and it wants to do a commercial deal on buying 15% of the stock for affordable housing.  That is the only deal that I am aware of.  I have been in NAMA since 2010 and have seen loads of transactions but that is the only transaction where I have seen that type of thing being promulgated.  </p></speech>

I also mentioned that we will have a rump of assets left at that time whose value, in terms of a financial return to the State and, possibly, whose value in terms of the State being able to influence what happens on those things, will happen not by 2020 or 2021 but certainly in 2022 and up to 2025, including the Glass Bottle site.  Can we have a role in that?  They are assets under management of NAMA.  We have an obligation to get the best financial return for those.  I suppose our view is we need, as a board, to be assured that we can do that in one way or another, and there is a discussion to be had about how that can happen.</p> <p>  The reality is that if one goes back to what has been said today, we have demonstrated - and I have not come in here to blow our own trumpet or anything like that which I know will provoke a reaction - that we have actually been quite successful over the past eight or nine years in repaying the subordinate debt, a third of which is gone.  Particularly I suppose to the point made by Deputy Aylward, the Dublin docklands is actually a great tribute to the coherence, direction, funding and skill-set of NAMA.  That place has been transformed.  At this stage, 100% of that SDZ that was in NAMA's control is either constructed, under construction or with planning.  The project has been transformative.  </p> <p>  In housing, and again going back to the figures we have been mentioning, the reality is NAMA has been delivering houses since 2014, quite successfully in a difficult market and with all of the constraints we have.  We have been able to do that because of our team's skill-set, experience and expertise.  If there is a role for that in future, then we would be more than willing to play it but it is not in our remit to decide that.  There is an issue with the European Commission, and I think we have to respect this.  The European Commission does not wish to see NAMA taking on any additional responsibilities or areas of work.  I do not think that the European Commission has any problem with NAMA working out its assets and maximising that value.  It would expect that of an asset management agency.  These are decisions for elsewhere.  To quote Dickens, "Barkis is willing".  We are willing if there is a need.</p></speech>

What percentage of the land portfolio has been used over the past two years since NAMA got involved?  How much of the land portfolio did NAMA envisage it would sell for housing at the very beginning?  Earlier, one of my colleagues here mentioned local authorities did not take up land in places where they should have done so.  How much land did NAMA originally earmark for housing?  What percentage of land remains?  Does NAMA hope to utilise the remainder?</p></speech>

One gets offers on them.  As I said this morning, one particular site that has planning for 200 houses had a valuation of &euro;10 million 18 months ago yet we have just sold it for &euro;30 million.  Land prices have gone crazy and we cannot ignore that because of the section 10 obligation.  Some debtors are in NAMA but because of the rise in land values are in a position to pay off their debt.  These are honourable people who have said, "Actually, I can pay off my par debt now, I have gone to another bank or another funding provider and here, NAMA, I owe you &euro;25 million, and that is all of my debt paid off, and I am taking all of my sites back and I am going somewhere else."

Our best estimate, Deputy, is that, the way things are going, we could be left with a longer-term landbank with stuff that could be rezoned in future area plans.  Some sites might be on the route of Metro North in Dublin, which will come into play as the Metro North is being built.  If one wants a return on that capital investment one must build housing around it, which is not zoned at present, or not part of LAP at present but should be.  We could, potentially, have enough land for about 9,000 units.</p></speech>

One is that one sells it before that.  I have already argued this morning that I do not think that would be the best outcome for the State.

As for whether we could do it, we could do it.</p> <p>  By the way, Deputy Aylward was talking about land being put into housing.  The other figure that is worth mentioning is that NAMA has put more than &euro;1 billion of development funding into that residential delivery programme about which we have been talking.

We all want to get out.</p> <p>  I want to make one observation on NAMA's overall performance and I will put it to Mr. Daly first.  I have some sympathy for his position in respect of decisions his organisation would have to make because it is somewhat subjective.  People will have opinions as to whether good or bad decisions were made.  NAMA has to make, as Mr. Daly put it in the past, real world decisions based on what the market is saying, NAMA's own goals and what is laid down for NAMA in its remit.  There would be internal pressures, external pressures, etc.  One will always have somebody with a different opinion who will say maybe NAMA should have held on, it might have got more or whatever.  I can accept that.  NAMA then has to make decisions.  At some point, it has to make a decision.</p> <p>  While that is the case, NAMA also must have processes to protect the organisation, the management of assets and how the agency goes about its business.  For example, the only project under which we were able to get under the bonnet was Project Eagle.  What we saw there was a deviation, maybe, from some of the sale strategies.  There were concerns, as Mr. Daly will be aware, regarding the management of conflicts of interests and a number of other matters.  The committee published a report, as Mr. Daly will be aware, on Project Eagle.  That is subject to a commission and I am not asking Mr. Daly to talk about any of that.  In terms of our report, we made a number of observations and recommendations.  Has Mr. Daly read the report?  I put the same question to Mr. McDonagh.  Have they read the Committee of Public Accounts' report?  Do they have anything to say or any comment to make on the report, given that we met several times during the course of that?  We did an awful lot of work as a committee and put an awful lot of effort into it.</p> <p>  I appreciate that NAMA has to make decisions and there are factors and all sorts of pressures involved, but process is important to protect an organisation.  Were lessons learned from the Project Eagle sale or other sales and were lessons learned from any of the reports that were done, particularly the report of the Committee of Public Accounts?  That is my first question to Mr. Daly and to Mr. McDonagh.</p></speech>

Very definitely.  I suppose so much of the answer to what the Deputy is asking is tied up with the commission of investigation that I am sort of reluctant to go there but I absolutely agree with him that process is important.  We are an agency that has been in existence for nine years and I believe that all along the way we have learned, as any agency would.  In this committee, when we were in here regarding Project Eagle, we acknowledged that there were areas where our documentation in particular could have been improved, and certainly that has been.</p> <p>  I am confident in relation to the processes we have in place.  If there is anything to be learned from any transaction, project or action by NAMA over the years, we are always open to that learning and we always implement it.  I am very confident of the robustness of our processes now.  We had several discussions around Project Eagle.  I am not saying we agreed with every conclusion in the committee's report but that is something to be discussed within the Cooke commission.  I am very reluctant to go there.</p></speech>

I will make one follow-on point and maybe Mr. McDonagh can come in then.</p> <p>  One lesson I learned from it in terms of my analysis of how loan sales work and how the management of assets work is that one argument that was made consistently by NAMA is that it must work in what it calls the real world where there are market solutions and market ways of doing things.  In fact, there was criticism of some other organisations which perhaps might not have had that expertise, as was pointed out by NAMA, which I did not accept.</p> <p>  Something the market and those in the private sector who manage assets do is use the so-called "internal return rate" to set a benchmark and have a metric in order that one can measure what rate one gets back on individual assets, collective assets or loan sales, but Mr. Daly's organisation chose not do that.  This made it more difficult for us to determine whether good or bad decisions were made.  It goes back to the point I made, which is that once NAMA sold something, it could simply say that is the price it got and for all sorts of different reasons, these are the reasons the agency sold.</p><p>As a result of NAMA not setting an internal return rate, we, the Committee of Public Accounts, cannot say whether we can benchmark it against any objective.  It is so subjective in terms of what could have happened that NAMA is off the hook.  Does Mr. McDonagh accept that omission was a mistake from NAMA's perspective when we are talking about accountability and the Committee of Public Accounts being able to do its job?  In terms of good practice and what happens in the real world, having an internal return rate would have been better practice.  Does Mr. McDonagh accept that it would have been better for all of us all around if that had been in place?</p></speech>

That basically said that we were expected to return 5% on the assets over time.  In the section 226 report, he stated that our return was 6.2%, so we have exceed the 5% target.  That is a financial measure as much as internal rate of return.</p> <p>  NAMA had a mixed bag of assets.  It had some really bad assets, which the banks lent on and were not worth very much.  Even if one had held them from 2010 until today, one might get less today that what one got because the land might have been dezoned and one might have had issues on the cost of holding and the remediation of the asset.  NAMA had some very good assets, medium quality assets and really poor quality assets in a mixed portfolio.</p> <p>  What I said earlier in terms of the business we have, the business that is most comparable to the private sector is our residential funding business.  The board has set an internal rate of return target of 15% on that and we are achieving in excess of that in any of the projects we are funding at present.  Consequently, we have internal procedures.</p></speech>

We have to be able to make judgments.  We, as a committee have to be able to say with some form of reliability, metric and benchmark that something was a good outcome and was a good decision.  We can look at the macro objective to get a specific amount back but once one starts setting a benchmark for each of the individual assets or if one groups them in terms of a loan sale, it is actually better for us.</p></speech>

I am not trying to argue for any particular rate as being a benchmark.  That is for the board to determine.  My argument was that it is a benchmark, it is something with which one can look at individual loans or portfolios as a whole and can determine that we are doing well, we are ahead of the benchmark we have set or we are falling short of it.</p></speech>

I totally agree with the Comptroller and Auditor General on that.</p> <p>  NAMA used to go through a process, until the accounting rules changed this year to fair value.  We used to have an impairment exercise each year, where one would mark up or mark down the value of one's loans based on the value of the underlying collateral.  We would have an in-house management information system, MIS, to which the Comptroller and Auditor General has full access, called an asset sales tracker, where we put in a figure of what we think the value of the asset is going to achieve.  We put it on the market and one can see whether we got above or below that, assess it and it is altered at the end of each financial year.</p> <p>  We do have tracking of every single asset in the NAMA portfolio.</p></speech>

We had a good discussion on housing and a good articulation from both Mr. McDonagh and Mr. Daly on the housing situation.  Again what I would be looking at is their articulation of it and then the practice, when one considers the 13,000 units NAMA delivered and whether, in the overall scheme of things, it was helpful in solving the housing crisis or addressing some of the issues.  They addressed social housing supply, affordable housing, which is massively important and then taking people out of the private rented sector, if possible and reducing the price of rents.  I will benchmark that against what NAMA actually did, but before I do that, Mr. Daly mentioned that NAMA is not a housing agency.  It is correct that NAMA was not set up to be a housing agency and there is a particular skill and mindset that goes with that because it is not just about the market in terms of housing.  When the State looks at housing it must also do so through a socioeconomic lens.  Did NAMA have the expertise in that area to make those type of decisions?</p></speech>

I would say that NAMA absolutely has that expertise.  The board of NAMA has that consciousness about the bigger picture at all times.  I do not want to rehearse the arguments about our remit and the constraints on us, if the Deputy wishes to refer to them as that.  Deputy Connolly referred this morning to the requirement in the Act which enjoins NAMA to take account of the social and economic dividend.  There are several ways in which one provides a social and economic dividend.  We would argue and we have argued before that the most effective dividend that we have delivered is to remove the &euro;31 billion contingent liability from the State and part of that dividend will be the &euro;3.5 billion that we will return in a year or two.  Part of that dividend is the 13,000 houses delivered that the Deputy mentioned; as well as the docklands.  There are all sorts of ways of delivering a social and economic dividend.  I think that within the parameters of our mandate and the constraints on us in the Act - it will be for others presumably in five or ten years' time to do very learned papers on what NAMA contributed - I certainly will be arguing they are elements of the social and economic dividend we have delivered.</p></speech>

Affordability is obviously the biggest issue.  There was actually a very interesting discussing about what contributes to rising prices.  Many experts say that supply is only one element and the bigger issue - one of the biggest issues that the State never grappled with - was land speculation.  Land is a major driver in driving up the price of houses.  Lending was also mentioned as having an impact.  It is obviously more than supply but supply is obviously important.  In my view affordability is the most important thing.  Of those 13,000 housing units, how affordable were they?  If the witnesses do not have the figures now, I understand they will send a note to the secretariat about the breakdown of houses into social, affordable and private.  I would like a breakdown on the average price.</p></speech>

Page 11 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General refers to the rate of return.  A fundamental difference is being highlighted, namely, that NAMA's measure, the entity return on investment, EROI, does not take in the time value of the money.  What the Comptroller and Auditor General is saying is that the "Internal rate of return is a standard performance metric for property-related investments".  NAMA does not use that measure.  Could Mr. McDonagh explain why NAMA does not use what is accepted?  How did it come up with the other measure?</p></speech>

One can have a financial measure of NAMA's performance based on the European Commission methodology, involving a return of 5%.  We are currently returning 6.2% so we are ahead of the benchmark set at the start in terms of the loans we required.</p> <p>  The board said in 2014, after the first Comptroller and Auditor General review of NAMA, that NAMA should go about benchmarking its exercise.  The board considered this and decided to set a measure called the entity rate of return, EROI, which is based on our total portfolio rather than individual pockets of the portfolio and said we have a target of 20%.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's point is that one should take account of the time value of the money in that return.  That is fine.  I do not disagree that the Comptroller and Auditor General has that view.  That is absolutely fine; that is the Comptroller and Auditor General's view.  The board's view is that we do not take account of that; we take account of the measure that we set, which is a 20% target.</p></speech>

We will have interest costs incurred on that and we will have an amount left over after we have sold the assets.  At the end of NAMA's life, all that will matter to the Exchequer is how much surplus NAMA is giving back after it has paid off all its expenses and all the debt it took on to acquire the loans from the institution.

We are commercial and have to act commercially but, going back to discussions we had a while ago, we are an agency that operates under certain constraints that the private sector, or another commercial organisation, would not have to operate under.  We do not have the capacity to hold all these assets to maturity, which another organisation might have.  We have had pressure on us to repay the contingent liability.

I am just trying to get my head around something because we will be writing up a report in due course.  Tied in with this matter is the information on page 33 of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which uses the heading "Internal rate of return - debtor level".  Again, there is a very specific point being made.  At the end of 2010, NAMA had over 750 debtor connections in its loan portfolio, and then so many exited.  It is all set out in the report.  The examination team from the Comptroller and Auditor General's office applied the internal rate of return methodology.  The witnesses can read this.  The approach is based on what NAMA paid for the loans and the actual cash receipts generated by the connections before exiting NAMA.  The weighted average internal rate of return and so on was approximately 3.4%.  That is what the examination found.  The final sentence is: "NAMA's view is that it would be more appropriate to compute the internal rate of return by reference to the market value of the loans at acquisition and not what NAMA paid for them."  NAMA paid &euro;31.8 billion but the market value was only &euro;26.2 billion.  If the market value is used, it obviously looks as if the agency is getting a better return.  Is that not right, or am I being foolish?</p></speech>

It made us value the loans at a 5% discount rate, which we discussed a few minutes ago, and it also said that any private sector body buying this distressed portfolio in the market would have a discount rate of around 15%.  Therefore, if discounted at 15%, one pays only &euro;26 billion.  If discounted at 5%, one pays &euro;31.8 billion.  Therefore, that is the state aid difference to the banks.  I refer to the &euro;5.6 billion, which is based on the different discount rates used.  That is basically what the Commission is saying.  Nobody but a Government would ever pay &euro;31.8 billion for the loans.  If the private sector were prepared to buy the loans, the most it would pay would be &euro;26 billion.</p></speech>

We are saying that we have paid the &euro;31.8 back and we will give an extra &euro;3.5 billion on top of that.  The long-term economic value of the state aid has been repaid.  Remember, at the beginning we had to price everything by reference to 30 November 2009.  Between 2009 and 2012, the first three years of NAMA, the market had dropped 30%.  People were saying that NAMA should have changed the valuation date and should make a valuation as at 2011 when we would have paid less to the banks.  The consequence of that would have been that the Government would have had to come in and put in more money to bail out the banks.  It is a zero-sum game as far as the State is concerned.  It is either putting in equity or it is paying more for the assets.</p></speech>

These were effectively fire sales of assets where it was necessary to remove them from the banks' balance sheets because they were too big.

I have never attempted to say what the figure should be.  That is something for political debate, or a debate between NAMA and the Department of Finance, and is to be explained here.  I believe I heard Mr. McDonagh say that when the state aid figure was being calculated, a discount rate of 15% was used.  Therefore, immediately, one has a figure of 10.3%, to which Deputy Catherine Connolly referred, as compared with the 15%.  In the previous paragraph one has the 3.4% as compared with the 5%.  This is the kind of conversation that I would envisage that we would always have at the Committee of Public Accounts about this kind of activity.  Part of the reason that the EROI was developed was that in the first report, I recommended that the internal rate of return should be used and the targets should be set.  In fairness to NAMA, it did have a conversation about it and came up with EROI and discussed it with us.  To my mind, it did not fully serve the purpose.</p></speech>

If someone was asked to put, say, &euro;100,000 of his or her own money into a project or an investment and in ten years, he or she received &euro;130,000, which is a 30% EROI, would that person be satisfied with it?  It is a very difficult question to answer without considering what return the person would receive if he or she put the money into a bank offering an interest rate of 2% or 4%.  Unless one has meaningful figures that one can use to allow oneself to make a decision, one cannot decide whether one is prepared to put money into the project as opposed to a bank.  One needs the tools, one must have the interest rate and the rate of return.  That is what I have been arguing on this.</p></speech>

I, like Deputy Cassells, sat on a city council for 17 years.  We saw the housing crisis building up.  There was a housing crisis well before 2014.  In fact, it deepened in 2013 or 2014 when the housing assistance payment, HAP, became the only game in town.  That has nothing to do with NAMA except the more rented buildings that it makes available, the more that HAP is used.  A total of &euro;300 million has been spent this year on HAP.  This housing crisis has happened over a period because of a failure to build houses.  The first time NAMA discussed housing seems to have been 2014.  Is that right?</p></speech>

The Deputy will recall that house prices fell by 30% after NAMA acquired the loan portfolio.  Houses could not be built because the cost of building them could not even be recovered.  Under the legislation passed by the Oireachtas, NAMA is not allowed to do that.  From 2013 onwards, some of NAMA's debtors who were house builders said there was a bit of growth in the market again and asked for funding to build houses on a small scale to sell them.  People forget that aspect.</p></speech>

Galway has a bigger crisis than Dublin.  According to the most recent census, 49.9% of Galway people rent.  There are no properties available, there is no public housing and there is a massive waiting list.  By any stretch of the imagination we have a major crisis.

He talked about policing and enforcement a moment ago and I think that is his main concern with this.  If a false declaration is sworn, that gives rise to a criminal offence.  It is also an offence under section 7 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009 to give information to NAMA that is false or misleading where there is recklessness or gross negligence as to the giving of that information.  The consequences for someone who takes a glib attitude to a confirmation or declaration given to NAMA are severe.  That is an important point that needs to be kept in mind-----</p></speech>

He would have done some check or some bit of an audit.  If he had hundreds of thousands of people making their statutory returns there was always some procedure or check in the Revenue Commissioners.

What we found was that for 74 out of the 80 there were section 172 declarations available for review.  For 55 of those, the asset sale contract was available and the examination team could agree the purchaser from the contract to the declaration.  In other words there was a match, the purchaser had made the declaration but for 19 of the sales the contract was not available in NAMA and therefore we could not complete that link.  We also established that NAMA case managers do not carry out a formal verification process of the section 172s which is the point the Chairman is making.</p></speech>

I am still not sure, and the witnesses might be able to tell us, how many of the declarations NAMA has received were signed by organisations outside of the State versus inside the State.

I appreciate Deputy Cullinane has to leave.  I have another question about the surplus.  Has the Department of Finance had discussions at EU level with EUROSTAT about the use of the surplus when it is ultimately handed over?  We had a discussion on this here before.  We were told that because NAMA is unique, there are no specific European or EUROSTAT rules on it.  Historically, financial assets were sold to reduce debt.  That was in the time of the troika.  There is no legal requirement for this to be done, but there might be a political view that it should be done.  Where is this topic?  The Department should not wait until the money arrives before it starts considering it.</p></speech>

I will move on to housing.  I am probably going to come at it slightly differently from everybody else here.  NAMA started off with one mission and that was its mission.  Then, because of the housing crisis, it was asked to build houses and supply land.  That is all very important, but it was not NAMA's main core objective or anything like that.  It was a bit of a by-product.  As I have been listening to everything here, it has struck me that there has been a lot of discussion on the housing issue, which is really only a very small part of NAMA's work.  It is an important part from a social dividend point of view.  I look at it this way.  I am looking at the global picture as NAMA's work is beginning to end.  It has said that it has done roughly 10,000 houses so far and that out of a total of 42,000 - when people are taking back and buying - it will do approximately 20,000 more between now and 2020.  There will be 20,000 extra houses on the land under NAMA's control.</p></speech>

I think there is an assumption that NAMA is a key player in increasing the housing stock and solving the housing problem.  I am just saying I think the general commentary has totally overstated the reality.  When all is said and done, if NAMA adds 1% or 1.5% to the housing stock of the nation over ten years, that will be about it.  I am not criticising NAMA because it was not set up to do housing.  I am just putting it out there.</p></speech>

According to the figures we have been given in NAMA's financial statements, the total income was &euro;40.698 billion.  The senior bonds have been paid back.  A couple of hundred million in tax has been paid.  I presume NAMA pays tax on profits like other companies.</p></speech>

One of the things that he made us benchmark against were asset management companies across the world where costs should be no more than 6% of the whole thing.  We are running much less than that and he used to say that was a really good sign because that was a parameter used by the IMF when measuring the work of bad banks or asset management agencies.</p></speech>

In other words, NAMA was on a negative interest rate.  It was &euro;8.5 million the previous year.  What has been the total negative interest?

If money is left in the Central Bank, and we leave our money there or invest it in NTMA Exchequer notes, it is paying -0.4% on the money.  We have &euro;2 billion in cash at present.  If we left it in the Central Bank we would get a -0.4% return.  The board has a policy which effectively takes account of prudence and tries to see if we can invest the money to generate a return.  It is very hard to generate a return without taking undue kept credit risk in this market.  We might get a higher return but we could lose by not getting our capital back or things like that.  NAMA is like any other private or public sector company at present.  If we have cash and we put it on deposit in a financial institution, it will pay a negative interest rate.</p></speech>

We will call it an interim dividend.</p></speech>

Page 16 of the financial statements gives the NAMA asset disposals year by year, as in 2010 to 2017.  I refer to &euro;7.2 billion on page 16 on the bottom chart.  It can be seen there.  Somebody touched on this earlier.  The witnesses said that NAMA was under pressure from the troika in those first couple of years to generate cash.  Some of that was from sales of property mainly outside of the country where there was a better market.  When we look to 2014 and 2015, there were about &euro;8 billion of disposals each year.  I refer to those people whom NAMA moved on and disposed of their assets or sold their loans at that time.  Have there been any complaints from them that they felt they were rushed?  The Player Wills site and some other sites were mentioned.  Some people were luckier, or perhaps were more truculent, and NAMA did not get them earlier.  They are now actually going to come out clear because they were left until last.  The guys that went early probably suffered the most, whereas the guys who, for some reason or other, are some of the last batch to be sold might actually come out a bit better.  NAMA might also do better because it might recover more.  Is NAMA's profitability on its recoveries, based on its disposals next year, in 2018 and 2017, that bit higher than the profitability of its disposals in the years 2014 and 2015?</p></speech>

We did not have the luxury of hanging around when we had a &euro;30 billion contingent liability with a &euro;200 billion national debt.  There was a directive from the Minister of Finance.</p><p>I want this contingent liability paid off.  The NTMA is in the market trying to raise money and this is a big cloud hanging over us.  We sold assets to pay off the contingent liability.  If we could have chosen the assets that we wanted and just bought all the good assets on the first day rather than taking the mixed bunch of assets we got, it would have been great.  Perhaps we could have had long-term investment and been well funded with no debt while being able to pick and choose over a longer term.  However, they are all "ifs" and that was not the reality.</p></speech>

It is an exciting opportunity.  I have had the pleasure of dealing with the European Parliament but not so much with the Irish Parliament, so it is a particular pleasure today.</p><p>I will give a brief introductory statement.  I ask the Chairman to stop me if I go on for too long.  </p><p> When we look at climate change, we cannot avoid looking at energy policy because energy is the source of around 75% of the emissions that are causing climate change.  This is a global figure.  The percentage is slightly lower in Ireland because we have a very high share of emissions coming from agriculture.  If roughly 75% of emissions is coming from energy then we cannot tackle climate change without tackling energy policy.  Today we are in the midst of what is called the energy transition whereby we are changing our energy systems in Europe and globally.  What does the transition actually mean?  If we are to achieve the national target of 80% decarbonisation by 2050 it means that we cannot have any fossil fuels at all in our heating or transport systems, with the notable exception of aviation and possibly marine.  The target is 80% rather than 100% because we are not yet sure about the possibility of electricity fuelling aeroplanes.  This means that for the other sectors we are talking about a 100% ban on and elimination of fossil fuels from our energy system.  That is a challenge that starts today and we need to meet it over the period up to 2050.  </p><p> How do we manage this energy transition and what does it mean?  There are two pillars involved, the first of which is energy efficiency.  The less energy we use, the easier it is to make the change and of course, energy that is not used is free energy.  The second pillar is that if we have to use energy, which we do, then we must make sure it is sustainable and renewable.  These are the two pillars upon which the energy transition is built.  From the perspective of making a change to our fundamental system, the first thing we must do is draw a line in the sand today and make sure that anything we do from today onwards does not make the situation worse.  We must stop the leak or, as the saying goes, "If you are in a hole, stop digging".  </p><p> I would like to give one or two specific examples of issues that we need to think about in the Irish context.  Ireland is currently developing Part L of the building regulations which is out for consultation at the moment and included within that is the carbon performance coefficient.  The figure proposed is 0.3 and at that point, one cannot use oil heating in buildings.  There is a suggestion that the figure should be 0.35, which would permit oil.  In fact, we should be considering 0.25.  This is very technical but it illustrates an important point.  The number applies to new builds.  We are talking about buildings that have not been constructed yet and it is very important that we pick the right number and stop the leak in our housing stock.  It is also imperative that we are fair to people, both developers and individuals, who build houses.  We should not have a standard in place which means that ten years from now they are going to have to rip out their heating systems and replace them.  It is important to get it right at this stage, before we go down the wrong road.  </p><p> I have chosen my second example because I believe that our young people will ultimately change our society.  They are the ones who will lead us in so many things and therefore, our schools are pivotal.  I recently looked at technical guidance document No. 33 issued by the Department of Education and Skills in February of this year.  It states that heat pumps are not appropriate for use in schools.  In another paragraph, biomass is dismissed.  The document basically states that the only heating systems that can be used in schools in Ireland are either oil or gas.  This is for new heating systems in our schools.  The document also states that where there are permitted development, PD, solar panels on the roof of a school, they must be measured to only supply the school and switch off if there is an excess because they cannot feed that excess into the grid.  This is an issue that must be examined further because it relates to new investments, to money that has not yet been spent.  The question to ask is whether we can spend that money in the right way rather than creating problems that will ultimately have to be rectified later on.  </p><p> One of the first recommendations of the Citizen's Assembly's on climate change was for the development of supervision across Departments in order to get results.  As a former civil servant, I would suggest that there is expertise in each of the Departments here.  Staff know their own areas, policies and actions and the requisite knowledge exists within each Department.  The challenge is to bring that knowledge to the fore and then to a common forum so that it can be maximised across that forum.  If one looks at the experience in other countries, many have set up what is effectively a senior officials' group where officials at Secretary General level meet once per month on the issues of climate change and energy policy.  In the case of Ireland, such a group could be chaired by the Taoiseach's Department or by the Department of Finance, with the mandate to reduce the size of the fines that may come through in 2020.  It could have monthly meetings where all of the policies that are being proposed are reviewed.  There must be a focus on not contradicting ourselves or going backwards and a determination to move forward on actions together.  I would also suggest that a report be prepared every three months, in table format, detailing actions taken and the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions or increase in renewable energy production that will accrue from same in 2020 and thereafter.  A table is all that is required, with further details to be supplied later.  This must get political attention so that actions are taken, decisions are made, policies are put in place and the results can be tracked on a routine basis.  It would allow something to happen immediately because it is not a new structure.  It is true that it does not have statutory responsibility but with political oversight, one can achieve the same objectives very quickly without additional costs.  </p><p> To go back to the two pillars of energy efficiency and renewable energy, when one talks about the former, one must talk about housing.  We use a lot of energy to heat our houses in Ireland.  There are almost 2 million housing units in the country and more than half of those are currently using oil for heating, which produces high levels of greenhouse gas emissions.  A second notable feature is that around 70% of Irish housing units are privately owned.  These are privately held assets and I emphasise this point because the retrofitting of our housing stock is an expensive exercise and it would be impossible for the Government to fund it.  Even if it invested the entire budget, it is not achievable.  The question then is how to get people who own a private asset to invest in that asset for their own benefit.  There are various tools and techniques that one can use to do that, one of which is raising awareness.  I will take an Irish example to illustrate my point.  In Ireland we have the Building Energy Rating, BER, system.  If one proposes to sell or even rent a house, one must have a BER certificate.  When one comes to sell a property, the sale price gets recorded in the Property Price Register, PPR.  However, the PPR does not actually list the BER by the sale.  This is not new information but simply a question of taking two databases and merging them so that people can see the value of sales for properties with different BER ratings.  Studies conducted in Europe show an uplift of between 2% and 3% per band of BER in the value of assets.  Just bringing those two pieces of information together would enable people to see the difference to the value of their assets if they improve the BER.  This could also be done for rental properties using the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.   </p><p> Another issue is that unless people can see, feel and touch a retrofit, it is very hard for them to get their heads around it.  In this context, the Citizens' Assembly is correct that the public sector has a leading role to play in Ireland.  The public sector has an objective of achieving 33% energy efficiency and many of the actors in this space are achieving those numbers.  Do we have open days which allow citizens to come and see the buildings that have been retrofitted, to understand the work involved, what it cost and who carried it out?  Such open days would enable people to see, feel and touch the results and prompt them to ask questions about how to undertake a retrofit themselves.</p><p>A third issue, which is strongly evident from all the studies, is that one needs to have a trusted intermediary.  We have seen successes in Ireland with this.   For example, the Tipperary Energy Agency, an entity set up by the local authority, is independent.  People feel they can trust what it says because it does not have a commercial interest in it.  Accordingly, people can rely on it and it can help them deliver.  Such an opportunity exists for all local authorities for their own citizens.</p><p> Of course, the issue of finance is key and is the hardest one.  We have two opportunities, a carrot or a stick.  The committee has already discussed carbon tax in its previous meetings.  Ultimately, a carbon tax will ultimately influence people's behaviour, even down to the level of their own home.  Tax could also be used as an incentive, as it is used in other countries.  The advantage of using tax as an incentive is that this is not subject to state aid.</p><p> There are other options available.  If one looks at the private mortgage market and the new developments where one can get an energy efficiency mortgage add-in.  For example, a house might cost &euro;400,000 and it might cost &euro;30,000 to energy retrofit it.  If it is part of the mortgage, maybe with a deferred payment but at the same level of interest rate, it is much more attractive to do it that way than to take out a private loan at three times the interest rate.</p><p> Another area is the new renewable energy support schemes where community involvement and benefit is at the heart of it.  Communities can be owners, shareholders or beneficiaries.  For example, a community wind farm could have a benefit of &euro;2 per megawatt hour generated.  This works out at about &euro;250,000 per wind turbine over 15 years.  On average, a wind farm will comprise ten turbines.  That results in a &euro;2.5 million benefit to a community over 15 years.  Could we leverage that revenue in order that funding could be provided to a community to retrofit their houses?  That would mean the community would get a long-term benefit out of this, rather than it being dissipated on useful things but things which do not have longevity.  How can this be done in a way that is constructive and brings people on board?  I do not have to make the point that making all of this happen would require skills and training, as well as bringing jobs into the community.</p><p> If we are leaving fossil fuels behind, what will we use as our energy vector?  Right now, we are looking primarily at electricity.  We see heating, transport and power in the area of electricity.  It is for the most part ubiquitous.  If we can move it to renewables, it would be carbon free and available for all of the community.  Technology costs are coming down.  Ireland is well placed because it has good natural resources in this space.  This is where Ireland can become a world leader.  We have the opportunity, as well as the expertise and resources.  In this transition, it is not just a shift to electricity but in the way in which we generate and use it.  That brings in the whole question of the community.  Communities are at the centre of this energy transition.  We are moving away from large power stations, like Moneypoint, where we generate and then distribute to decentralised generation, consumption on site and sharing of that energy.  That brings in the citizen and the community.  That is a key part of the energy transition.  It has already been reflected in the new renewable energy support schemes.  It is a mechanism to allow everybody, who wants to, to participate in the energy transition.</p><p> We have some way to go.  We have only one community wind farm in Ireland, Templederry, and no community solar park.  In contrast, up to 1 million European citizens are party to community renewable co-operatives where their communities generate power, use it themselves, sell it to the grid and exchange it.  This is the opportunity which exists.  It allows people, whether they are in an urban or rural space, to participate.  In Germany, for example, 50% of solar PV, photovoltaics, panel in 2012 were on farmers' barn roofs.  In cities in Flanders, not only are people putting solar panels on their roofs but industry is too.  Sometimes, these are rented or they will exchange on them.</p><p> Solar PV operates on the basis of light not heat.  We get light in Ireland, even in the winter time.  We need to move on solar generation.  This is an opportunity we cannot ignore.  We need it to balance wind generation.  We have much wind energy production.  Winds are high in the early and the later part of the year but not in the middle.  That is where solar PV comes in.  If one wants to get a technological balance across the year, we need to move across all of the technologies.</p><p> The Citizens' Assembly has already identified the necessity for a tariff for microgeneration, with which I fully agree.  It is also important for communities.  In that context, sometimes one has to follow the rabbit down the warren in terms of philosophy.  We have a situation where there is community involvement in the renewable support schemes.  It is good.  However, one then has to peel back the layers of the onion and find out what it actually means if a community wants to generate power and make it available to the grid.  In another part of the regulations, there is now a requirement for planning permission and a connection fee analysis.  There may be a charge for the connection fee and sometimes one will not get access if the distribution site is full.  We have to take our belief in community involvement through all of the obstacles, as well as the legislative and regulatory operational steps, in order for it to happen for citizens.  For example, we may need to think of ring-fencing, say, 20% of export capacity on the grid for communities, farmers and individuals in order they can get their electricity into the system and get a benefit from it.</p><p> Another area in which we have an opportunity is offshore wind.  This has been developed quite strongly in the North Sea and off the east coast of the UK.  In Ireland, we have not achieved anything in that space.  There is now talk about doing this.  It can happen under the new renewable electricity support scheme.  However, it will never happen unless we get a joined-up Government approach such as a marine spatial planning system.  We need licensing and consenting procedures in order to make the connection from the offshore wind farm to land.  Otherwise, the developers cannot even start work.  On average, and at best, it takes six years from the time one has that in place to when the first windfarm starts to produce.  If we want it, we need to have this in place very soon.</p><p> Bioenergy is a real opportunity in Ireland.  We are an agricultural community.  Bioenergy can have a direct impact on heating and transport.  Biomethane, for example, can be incorporated in the gas system and biofuels can be incorporated in the fuel system.  There is a proposal coming forward for transport of a 10% incorporation of biofuels into transport fuels.  That is to meet the directive requirement of 10%.  In fact, there is nothing to stop us going to 12% of 14% should we choose.  It is effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and is quite easy to do because it is done by mandate.  It is done at the oil refinery stage, meaning that one is not required to mobilise all of the citizens to do it.</p><p>It happens closer to the source.  There is a cost impact, but it is quite small down the line.  The same logic applies liquid energy used in heating, for example, where biofuels could be incorporated to reduce emissions.  This leads me to the topic of agriculture.  I will not go into detail, because the committee is going to discuss this.  There is an opportunity for agriculture.  Agriculture in Ireland can contribute to this energy transition, but it will need a joined-up approach from our farmers, our co-operatives and our policy framework to allow it to happen.</p><p> My last point is that we are running very close to the 2020 target.  A little thing called fines may apply in the end.  It is important to think about what can be done now, in the short time that is left, to mitigate the damage those fines might do.  The first, simplest and easiest thing to do, at least operationally though maybe not politically, is a mandate.  That will mean an instruction from the Government saying "Thou shalt do X" or "Thou shalt not do X".  It can work.  Overnight, plastic bags in Ireland disappeared and smoking in public places stopped.  With political courage and a mandate, things can happen very quickly in a very cost-effective way.  We need to look at the obstacles that prevent the individual citizen from taking action and try to remove them so that citizens can take action right now, before 2020.</p><p> For 2030 we have a target of 40% greenhouse gas emission reduction, even allowing for land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF.  This is a reality.  We are not going to meet the target for 2020.  Given our profile in the world and our food export industry, I do not think it is good for Ireland to continue to miss targets of that kind.  It gives a very negative impression of the country to the rest of the world.  We will have to do something in that context.   For renewable energy the target is 32%.  With cost reductions in renewable technologies they are the cheapest technologies for any new build.  Gas or oil cannot beat them.  There is no other technology that is cheaper than renewables for the generation of electricity.  The issue is how we phase out the existing elements to change the system.  A step change will probably be required in transport, as has been done in Paris.  From 2030, no diesel vehicles will be able to enter Paris.  In Beijing, no internal combustion engines will be on the streets from 2025.  It is a decision taking effect far enough into the future for people to react, but it is a step change.</p><p> This is a long-term challenge for our buildings, but in the 2050 building roadmap we have the opportunity to set out how we would achieve that in a gradual way, phased over the period from now to 2050, so that ultimately we can build very comfortable and pleasant houses in which to live, sleep and work.  I am afraid I may have gone on for a little bit too long.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

That was very informative.  I will start with a number of brief questions and then I will move to my colleagues.  Which renewable technologies have proven most successful for European countries that are reaching their targets and doing a lot better than Ireland?  We have constructed seven offshore wind turbines out of 830 that have received licences.  What are the blockages for us and how can we improve on that?</p> <p>  I am very much in favour of the community feeding into the grid through microgeneration.  This is something we must look at.  We have no clear national guidelines on wind farms which contain proper setback provisions.  Does Ms Donnelly agree that this is an issue?  We are all very much aware of the objections around that.  That is where community involvement comes into this: getting the buy-in of a community so that it benefits from microgeneration.  Perhaps Ms Donnelly will expand on that.</p> <p>  What types of funding or co-funding are available for renewable energy generation research and development at EU level?  One of the problems with EU energy policy is that the price of carbon under the emissions trading system, ETS, is too low.  This means it is still profitable to generate electricity from coal.  How is the EU tackling that issue?  In her time at the Commission, did Ms Donnelly find getting progress in this area frustrating?  Is there something we are missing in discussing the ETS?  That is something of which we as a committee have to be very cognisant.</p> <p>  With the upcoming reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, there is talk of rewarding farmers for sequestering carbon.  To what extent does the Directorate General for Energy influence the way the Commission develops proposals on the agriculture budget?  How can Ireland take advantage of research and development to become a leader in renewables?  Does Ms Donnelly have any advice for our committee on research and development of renewable energy technologies when we write our report?  What direction should we take as a committee?  I know there are several questions there.  I invite Ms Donnelly to deal with them in whatever order she wishes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.1355" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Donnelly" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018092000002#E00300"><p>I thank the Chair for those questions.  I will try to answer them more or less in sequence.  Regarding offshore wind generation, we have seen a quite serious commitment from the countries around the North Sea to the development of offshore wind generation there.  We have seen a very dramatic reduction of costs.  The reason for that is that technology costs decrease with volume.  The wind industry has repeatedly said to us that it does not need a huge amount of support this year and nothing next year.  It needs a steady amount every year.  It can then build capacity for that amount, which will allow efficiencies to develop in the production chain.  In large measure, that is what the 2030 plan is about.  It is about building the volume of demand for, say, offshore wind generation so that industry can scale up and maximise efficiencies in rolling it out.</p> <p>  Copper is used in the production of offshore wind turbines.  It is bought through the exchange in Paris.  Copper risks being a limiting factor in the production of wind turbines unless production figures are made clear.  The second limiting factor is ships.  Very long ships are needed to bring turbines out into the sea and put them in place, and they are in scarce supply.  The idea is to put together a long-term plan which shows volume.  That allows the industry to respond, bringing down costs and increasing efficiency.</p> <p>  By virtue of doing that, the most recent offshore auction in the Netherlands required a subsidy of zero.  That is because it is a part of a phased roll-out of volume.  I note that in the Netherlands the transmission operator pays for the grid access.  That is distinct from the UK where the developer pays for grid access.  There is a little bit of difference there.  The assurance of the volume, however, means it is possible to get the actors together.  For example, the Commission set up a special working group to examine the obstacles.</p> <p>  I will provide some small illustrations.  Offshore wind turbines in German waters cannot cause an acoustic increase beyond a prescribed level.  The UK does not have any requirement at all regarding acoustics.  In Denmark, offshore wind turbines must have two red stripes on the blade.  In Belgium three red stripes are required.  I am not sure the bird can see the difference between two red stripes and three.  These are very small illustrations of how, when things operate in parallel, differences can arise with which industry must cope.  We put the North Sea working group together to look at some of these.</p> <p>  Are the requirements very important?  Could we standardise them so that we can get efficiencies in the system?  Ireland is part of that group.  We benefit from the work going on there and we can bring it to bear on our own offshore industry.  However, we cannot take a step forward until we get foreshore consenting and licensing procedures in place.  The positive news is that financiers, investors and developers are ready to move in the Irish Sea.  It is an opportunity of which we can avail.</p> <p>  With wind farms, the issue of setback and flicker are very real and are of very real concern to people who live in the locality.  Rather than saying "Thou shalt do this or that" through legislation, which can be difficult to change if technology changes, the most important thing is for the community to be involved in the development.</p><p>The community has to say, "Well, maybe it is a little bit close but we can live with it" or "We want it moved from here to there".  However, it must be part of a dialogue.  I really believe that what is coming through now for renewable sources for electricity, RES-E, is really very good.  This community involvement and the requirement for dialogue with the community are mechanisms for resolving a lot of the resistances and concerns that people have regarding wind energy.</p><p> Technology changes all of the time and it is true to say that wind turbines are getting taller.  I do not know whether members have seen the Leonardo DiCaprio film "The Aviator" about the life of the legendary director and aviator Howard Hughes.  One scene shows his character flying a plane through lower altitudes and it shook.  When the plane climbed to a higher altitude, however, it was stable and that is why we fly at such high altitudes.  The higher one goes, the lower the resistance and the steadier the jet stream.  That is why taller wind turbines are being used.  Taller turbines can pick up a much better and consistent wind current than lower ones.  Also, the use of taller wind turbines means that fewer are needed.  The efficiency level for onshore turbines is approximately 35%.  For offshore turbines, it is in the region of 50%.  However, the efficiency level has increased from 28% due to advancements in technology and an ability to identify and pick up the best wind currents.  If something is put into legislation at this stage and then technology advances, it will be very difficult to respond to technological changes in an area where advancements are made all the time.</p><p> In terms of funding for research and development, when I left the European Commission the budget was &euro;700 million over seven years or &euro;100 million per year for research on the area of energy.  A huge amount of that goes to different parts and less so to existing technologies because they are industrialised at this stage and it is for industry to deal with them.</p><p> Let me briefly illustrate some of the research areas which will be important in Ireland.  How does the grid cope with a very high share of renewable electricity that is variable?  I am sure members have seen the pylons and how the cable comes down in a nice arc.  I am not a physicist but I shall outline some aspects of physics that I have picked up.  When electricity passes through, the cable heats up and then sags.  Therefore, people must always monitor how much electricity passes through a cable in order to prevent it from sagging too much.  Up until now, we erred on the side of caution and did not pass more than 80% through cables.  Now that there are IT sensors to gauge the temperature, it is possible to allow 90% to be passed through a cable.  This is part of the research on how one can adjust existing things to make it possible to respond to the energy transition.  Ireland is doing rather well in this regard.</p><p> Under Horizon 2020, Ireland receives a rather competitive 4% of the budget.  Let us remember that we represent less than 1% of the population so the percentage is fourfold and proves that we punch above our weight in terms of the process.  Part of that success is due to excellent research and, even more so, due to our researchers in Ireland collaborating with their counterparts elsewhere in Europe.  That exchange of information is where there is real benefit.  Specifically in terms of research here, marine energy has strong potential in the longer term.  The research is at an early stage at an excellent institute in Cork and we need to continue with it.</p><p> The second area that is very important is understanding how we can use energy, particularly electricity, for the maximum benefit.  I made a presentation on the usage pattern of electricity at an event organised by the Citizens' Assembly.  I outlined that one could reduce the overall cost of the system by 20% simply by changing the usage pattern through the use of digitalisation, such as via one's smartphone.</p><p> On the ETS carbon price, I am pleased to say that the rate is now &euro;20 and is likely to increase a little.  During my time working at the European Commission, the carbon price languished between &euro;4 and &euro;5 per tonne.  The current rate has pushed the wholesale price here in Ireland from &euro;45 per megawatt hour to &euro;65 because our electricity is part of the ETS.  That situation makes renewables more attractive and means that the PSO levy we pay for renewables has almost disappeared.  Will the price continue to increase?  That is very hard to say.</p><p> The ETS system covers utilities and big industry.  I am concerned that there may come a point when, for big industry, particularly that which exports, increasing the cost of carbon will become a serious competitive disadvantage.  As I no longer work for the European Commission, I am free to suggest that the ETS should be divided into large industry, on the one hand, and utilities, on the other, because we must be conscious of the economic impact of the carbon price.  I stress that this is not a policy of the European Commission. </p><p> On the CAP,  it is now about finding ways to allow agriculture to play its role and contribute to the transition.  The agricultural sector has a lot of opportunities to do so.  The new LULUCF relates to the sequestration of carbon inland.</p><p> In terms of sequestration through forestry, there is a great deal of opportunity in this country because we are very far behind.  The opportunity of using land as a carbon sink will be emphasised in the CAP.  From the perspective of both DG Energy and DG Climate of the European Commission, we support that because it makes sense.  We also support the idea that efficiency in farming should be combined with efficiency in energy transition.  Let me outline the situation in France.  In order to harvest grain, one must cut the stalks, etc., and one is left with stubble that can be used to produce bioenergy.  Clearly, the harvesting of grain provides a resource as well.  At the same time, one gets a food product and a raw material for a bioenergy.  To think about agriculture in that context and take it forward is really what the CAP changes are all about.</p></speech>

She has already answered my question on offshore wind energy.  In her written submission to the Citizens' Assembly she stated, "It is essential ... that Government informs the population of the policy direction for Ireland"  We have waited years for guidelines in respect of wind and solar energy production.  I would like to hear her thoughts on the fact that we have not had these recommendations.  There are many unknowns, especially in terms of solar energy.   When people see planning applications for solar farms they do not understand what is involved and are fearful.  Does Ms Donnelly believe it is important that we have clear guidelines regarding wind and solar energy farms?</p> <p>  In the submission to which I refer Ms Donnelly also stated, "heating our homes represents almost half of our energy consumption, this is a priority area".  If we are serious about climate change, we will have to start with home heating.</p> <p>  Ms Donnelly further stated that 88% of housing units here "were constructed before energy efficiency standards were required" and that "almost 1.5 million homes still need to be retrofitted."  She clearly stated that even at a 3% retrofit rate per annum "it would take 33 years to upgrade all of our homes".  That is a long period.</p> <p>  At our meeting a couple of weeks ago, we heard from the ESRI about the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grant scheme.  The ESRI conducted a comprehensive study with a sample of over 160,000 applications.  It was interesting to note that the highest number of applications by far were relating to cavity insulation and attic insulation, which shows that people cannot afford to fit pumps or solar panels.  We need to tease out these matters and I would like to hear Ms Donnelly's thoughts on them.  Obviously, as she stated, the Government cannot afford to retrofit every house but it supplies 35% of the cost for installing a higher grade retrofit.  I imagine that more people would apply for the scheme if more money was made available for retrofitting homes.</p></speech>

There are different shades of retrofitting.  Will Ms Donnelly comment on the quality of retrofitting in Ireland and what we are doing here?  I echo a question asked by Deputy Butler.  How can we aggressively enhance the current level of retrofitting, on which we are far behind as Ms Donnelly noted in her submission?</p> <p>  What have other countries done to enhance the energy efficiency of public buildings?  Ms Donnelly referred to the Department of Education and Skills and its technical guidance.  It is shocking that even now our new schools and buildings are not being built for the future in the context of climate change.  </p> <p>  That brings me to new homes.  There is an issue with supply.  How do we balance that with this committee's concerns about climate change?  What have other countries done to address issues around housing while also providing future-proofing for new homes?  How can we advise on achieving that balance?  We should not build new homes that we will need to retrofit in ten years' time.  That is not a good economic model.</p> <p>  Germany, under Angela Merkel, has aggressively embraced renewable energy.  Can Ms Donnelly outline any lessons from there?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.1360" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Donnelly" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CAJ2018092000002#G00200"><p>On wind and solar guidelines, the technology is changing.  It is difficult to include it in legislation but operational guidelines make sense.  What is happening in community involvement under the RES, renewable energy systems, is the way forward.  It is an issue that not only arises in Ireland but also at European level.  The new renewable directive makes citizens and community involvement a legal requirement and gives every citizen in Europe the right to produce, consume, store and sell electricity.  That is a right that is coming through for everyone in the legislation.  To exercise that right, it is for people to decide that they or their community wish to do it themselves or, where a developer wishes to do it, that the developer must speak to them.<br/><br/>One issue where Ireland has a challenge is that we do not have solar farms.  We do not know what it means to have a solar farm.  We should have one at the very least so that people could go and see it.  The level of negative reaction to renewable energy for solar farms is very low across Europe.  It is higher for onshore wind, but low for solar because in virtually every other member state individuals can install solar panels on their roof and sell electricity to the grid.  They are not excluded from the technology.  That is a very important element in the acceptance of the technology.  When individuals can generate and use renewable energy, they understand how a developer might use it in a wind farm.<br/><br/>On housing, this is a long discussion.  If we look at what is happening in other countries, Ireland is not unique in our housing being in need of retrofitting.  Different approaches are taken in different countries.  I will take Germany first.  Germany has an aggressive policy of retrofitting because it has the KfW bank in place.  It is a public bank, backed by state guarantee and so has AAA rating for borrowings.  It lends for retrofit at interest rates of between 0.49% and 1.5% so loans are almost free.  It comes with technical assistance on what householders need to do, how they need to do it and where.  That is a model that the Irish Government has looked at and not taken forward, but is one that I strongly recommend.  It is a really good model that can and should be transplanted into the Irish context.  If one can borrow at interest rates of that order, it is a better way to move.<br/><br/>Other countries have different policies.  Take the Netherlands, whose housing stock outside Amsterdam is not dissimilar to that around the South Circular Road in Dublin.  There are long rows of houses, maybe two storeys high, relatively compact, and they have what they call the <i>energiesprong </i>system where, off-site, they build and prepare padding, although it is more complicated than that.  This is transported on a big truck and stuck onto the outside of the house.  The roof is changed solar panels installed on it.  The kitchen and bathroom are also changed because that is always popular among residents.  This is done in one day and because it is prepared off-site the quality of the padding, what one could describe as the tea cosy, is assured.  It is done commercially and with a phased payment.  It is done a great deal for social housing.  The laws in the Netherlands have been changed to allow part of a tenant's rent to be used to pay for this retrofitting over a period.  <br/><br/>In France, the &Icirc;le-de-Paris local authority managed to get a very substantial loan from the European Investment Bank, EIB, to retrofit 40,000 apartments on the periphery of Paris.  It will take place over five years.  Once again, this is done at preferential interest rates.  They are managing the process, that is, the technology side, so that people do not have to worry about it, and phasing repayment from the people using and renting the apartments over a period of years.<br/><br/>What one sees across Europe is government policy to make funding available, on the one hand, and local government taking action to support people in the transition.  The local authority tends to be a trusted source.  People can believe it and rely on it in order to help deliver.  If one can get scale, there will be efficiencies and efficiencies bring costs down.  Those are a couple of examples that we could use in the Irish context.<br/><br/>Under the directive, the retrofitting of public buildings is a legal requirement and 3% of public buildings must be retrofitted each year.  Ireland has taken a stronger position on public buildings, setting a retrofitting target of 33% by 2020.  The difficulty with public buildings is that some are large and others small.  Until recently, there was a difficulty in that if public money was used to retrofit a public building, and this funding was borrowed, that was included in the Government's balance sheet as a debt.  That was due to a technical guideline introduced by the European Union's statistical agency EUROSTAT in 1995.  This is why technical guidelines make me nervous.  The guideline, which was introduced in advance of the euro, enumerated the things that count as public debt.  At that time, no one even considered retrofitting buildings, energy performance contracts and energy services companies, ESCOs, but once this started to take a life of its own, this guideline meant that we could not make it happen in Europe.  It took us six years to get around that guideline, including two vice presidents of the Commission leaning on EUROSTAT to get it produce a explanatory note, as it did a year and a half ago.  This sets out the conditions whereby the public sector can contract with an energy performance company under which the company does the retrofit, carries the risk and is repaid over a period of years.  </p></speech>

That is another area for the public sector to look at to see how it can best be used.</p> <p>  For new homes, Ireland is talking about building 600,000 new units, which would amount to one quarter of our stock.  That is why I emphasised building regulations.  Let us get this right.  While it may be a little more expensive, it is much less expensive to do it now than to try to retrofit afterwards.</p><p>Let us make our building regulations future proof and get them right for the new builds that are coming down the track.</p><p> There is an issue with retrofit.  I looked at the BER ratings across the country.  In Dublin and its surrounding counties and in Cork approximately 20% of buildings are A-B rated.  It is 10% in the rest of the country.  There is an obvious reason for that.  In Dublin the average cost of a house is approximately &euro;500,000 so while an investment of &euro;30,000 is a lot, it is against &euro;500,000.  If one's house is worth &euro;250,000, which it might be in country areas, &euro;30,000 is a much bigger investment.  One can see how the economics work in terms of the asset value.  That is why we must link the sale price of a house to the BER rating, so people can see that their asset will retain value in a recession and will have increased value once they have done this, not to mention that the operational costs will be cheaper.</p></speech>

If we were to emulate any country in Europe, which one should it be?  Denmark, for example, aims to be carbon neutral by 2050.  That is an ambitious target and it appears to be on course to achieve it.  Does Ms Donnelly have any thoughts on that?</p> <p>  The Tipperary Energy Agency has been getting a great deal of attention with regard to the local authorities and linking communities.  Does Ms Donnelly think that the model of the Tipperary Energy Agency linking with a local authority should be replicated across the country?  It strikes me that there is a level of expertise there which might not exist in local authorities.  That type of advice would be particularly useful in terms of the type of work local authorities will require in retrofitting their housing stock and looking at new planning applications if the regulations are ever introduced.</p> <p>  With regard to getting information to communities, does Ms Donnelly think that the best way to link into communities where, for example, there are many community groups such as community development groups, would be through the local community development committees, LCDCs, or the public participation networks, PPNs?  They might be a good way of getting communities to think about the types of projects Ms Donnelly referred to earlier in terms of developing their own projects and so forth.</p> <p>  We often hear the argument that wind energy is only generated when the wind blows and we are asked what we will do after that.  Does Ms Donnelly have any views on the battery storage flywheel technology?  I am interested in that because we have one in County Offaly.  It is a most interesting technology.</p> <p>  My other question is on methane.  Should it be in the emissions trading scheme, ETS?  Could we be doing more in agriculture with regard to the sequestration that might be possible there?</p></speech>

Each country has different resources and each has a different philosophy on what it wishes to achieve in terms of the reaction to climate change.  Certainly, Denmark is an obvious country to consider.  What is remarkable about Denmark is the extent of collaboration and co-operation across all the structures in society.  I can offer one illustration of that.  I was recently in Copenhagen and visited its new waste incinerator.  It takes pride of place in the centre of Copenhagen.  When we think about waste incinerators in Ireland we do not tend to think of them taking pride of place in a city or on the skyline of a city.</p> <p>  The incinerator in Copenhagen is the largest waste incinerator in Europe and has recently come on stream.  It was designed by one of Denmark's renowned architects.  The building is a little like a comma and slopes downwards.  The outside has little panels and on one side there is a climbing wall.  The reason it was built in that way is that it is a ski slope for the citizens of Copenhagen to use in the winter.  The design was that it would be a waste incineration plant in the middle of the city that would be part of the city - it should be something that the people of the city could use and enjoy.  Rather than put it in a corner and forgetting about it, the Danes are building very expensive apartment blocks beside it because the air coming out of it is so pure.  However, to get it together the Danes had to get six municipalities, the equivalent of 600,000 people, to agree to send their waste to that site.  Their waste volumes are reducing every year so the Danes had to be sure they would have enough to be able to feed this large incinerator.  Six municipalities had to agree to collaborate to supply it.  That is one illustration of the type of partnership and dialogue that is useful to take place in countries.</p> <p>  Another country that has done a very good job is Portugal.  Like Ireland, Portugal has wind, although more sun than we have.  Portugal imports most of its energy, as we do, so it is paying that money out of the country.  It wishes to try to keep that money in the country and its attitude is to get the citizen involved.  To take the example of solar energy, which is popular in Portugal, people can put four panels on their roof.  Basically, one can go to IKEA, buy four panels, put them on the roof, use the energy and sell it to the grid.  One does not need permission or a licence.  One simply says to the supplier, "I am doing this".  There is no grant for the panels.  One buys them oneself to supply it and one gets paid for what one sells into the grid.  It is as simple, clean and neat as one could possibly imagine.</p> <p>  One of the things the French have done, and this would be particularly relevant for Ireland, is use their agriculture.  The city of Strasbourg has a gas system in place that has used natural gas up to now.  The French have encouraged the development of biogas in the agricultural sector and their objective is to have 20% biogas in that system by 2030 which will come from the agricultural base around the locality.</p> <p>  That is an illustration of the things that are taking place in other countries in Europe that, perhaps, would be interesting for us to examine.  On the Tipperary Energy Agency, we should have one in every county or every two counties or region, whatever the case might be.  It is absolutely essential.  The mechanics could be sorted out as to whether it is a full agency or a full-time person who can share expertise across a number of localities.  I believe that if it is not local, people will not tend to go to it or trust or believe to the same extent.  If there is somebody locally with whom one can think and speak it is much better.  That person can draw in expertise from wherever it is required if it is not in the locality.  That is definitely a priority issue.</p> <p>  In terms of the dialogue with communities, every possibility is required.  We should use all the structures that exist.  I would add the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, the Gaelic Athletic Association, GAA, and others.  There are also the public representatives.  They have a huge role to play in terms of sensitising the population just by opening people's ears and encouraging them to think, talk and find out about it, as the case may be.  Not many people in Ireland think much about energy except to complain about the bill.  They worry about climate change but it is so removed that they feel helpless to do anything about it.  Some dialogue about practical, concrete things that allow people to take action themselves is needed.  One can start the dialogue and build on that into the future.</p> <p>  Storage will be key.  That is part of the issue.  The complaint about renewable energy has always been that it is variable.  We have it when the wind blows but we do not have it when it does not.  That is why we need solar power in Ireland.  We do not have as much wind in the summer and we need solar power to cover that gap.  More than that, however, we must use all the storage possibilities we can, including flywheel, hydro, salt caverns and salt batteries.</p><p>Anything we can find we should use.  One interesting thing, although this is perhaps less relevant in Ireland, is that in many of the villages in Austria, for example, one will see the big water towers one sometimes sees.  These are insulated towers of hot water.  Water is heated during the summertime and is then used in the wintertime for the district heating system.  It is a form of storage.  One must think outside the box when it comes to storage.  What are the services we get from energy?  We get hot water to heat our buildings.  If we can store it in the summer, we can use it in the wintertime.  There are many different ways in which we need to think about storage.  Yes, batteries will be useful, but we need to think much more widely than that.</p><p> Regarding methane and sequestration, if we are to maintain our agricultural sector, we have no choice but to beef up the sequestration side of it.  We must be able to get a better balance in the process.  It is feasible and we have the opportunity to do it, but perhaps we need the structures and the policies in place to make it happen.  It will not be sustainable to have high levels of methane unabated in the country, and I do not think we should jeopardise our industry by failure to take peripheral action to support it.</p></speech>

First, methane is a real issue for us because we have a significant agricultural sector.  The same issues do not arise in other parts of Europe or, indeed, the world.  By its nature, methane is different from carbon, so I think there are other measures we can and should use on methane other than the ETS and that we should leave the ETS as it is for carbon.  ETS, as a carbon mechanism, is probably correct as it stands.</p></speech>

I refer to the bioenergy Ms Donnelly is talking about and the fact that we see other countries availing of the opportunity to grow for ethanol.  Is this something at which she has looked?  Is it something about which we should be thinking?  Does she have any views on that matter?</p></speech>

There is an opportunity to use our land more effectively.  We can use it for agriculture, and, of course, that feeds people, which is very important, but some of it we can use as an alternative to imported fuel, and yes, we should be doing that more.  There is a lot of research that shows the benefits of, for example, special kinds of grasses and rapid turnaround on the crop.  We have a particularly suitable climate for this.  There are other energy crops that we could be growing as well.  V&auml;xj&ouml; in Sweden, for example, is a small city by that country's standards.  The city is run on bioenergy generated by farmers in the vicinity.  It is a combination of biomass and bioenergy.  They have done this for the past 15 years.  They set it up and said they would make their economy independent in terms of energy and do so with the farmers in the vicinity around them.  There are opportunities there.  It requires bringing together a number of the actors in order that one can put the structures in place to make it happen.</p></speech>

I liked the proposal Ms Donnelly had on the Secretaries General of Departments, perhaps, and someone from the Taoiseach's office chairing.  This has come up before.  It really sounds like she is proposing a whole-of-Government, whole-of-society approach to this.  If we have all the Departments, all the local authorities and all the State agencies focusing on this down into communities, that is where we will achieve our success.</p></speech>

It was very useful.  I have some questions that I prepared before she made it.  Some of them might have already been answered.  Then I have some questions about what she has said today if that is okay.  The questions I had earlier were based on the Citizens' Assembly presentation.  I could be wrong but my take on what she is saying and on the pitch she is making is that it is the citizen's responsibility.  I think the problem we have here is that the Government is not taking its responsibility and we need to shift that balance.  Whether or not it is the citizen's responsibility, and citizens do have a responsibility to buy into the system and to make it work, the Government has a responsibility to take the actions to allow the citizens to do that.  The problem we have in Ireland is that citizens are way beyond the Government and want to make change and make things happen.  However, the Government is holding them back.  What we have here is a Government that does not make decisions or make things happen to allow us then to go on.  That is what we need to focus on in this committee: how we get the Government to do things.  What Ms Donnelly said in response to the questions earlier was very interesting.  All the examples she gave relate to Europe and to governments being proactive in facilitating citizens to make these things happen, whereas in Ireland we do not have a proactive Government.  I do not feel that we do in any event.  I could be open to correction.  I am interested in how we get the Government to face up to its responsibilities and actually put in place the measures that will then allow citizens to do what Ms Donnelly is talking about.  That is where we need to focus.</p> <p>  As an example, Ms Donnelly, when referring to the Citizens' Assembly, mentioned in response the German bank KfW and what it is doing in facilitating homeowners.  As an aside, we have recently had issues regarding post offices and how they can be maintained.  One of the proposals from Irish citizens is that KfW would be facilitated through the post offices to provide finance to citizens.  The Government has shot this down, is saying "No" and is pushing the existing bank system in through the post offices, with the exorbitant interest rates with which citizens cannot live, so it is the Government that actually has an awful lot to do.  That is one side of the matter.  I will get to my questions and then Ms Donnelly can come back.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  Rural areas are badly affected by both high energy costs and fuel poverty, so many people, including farmers, do not have ready cash to develop in retrofits or complicated projects.  The oldest and least efficient oil and gas heating systems are located in rural areas.  What is the best way to make renewable energy and renewable heat an integral part of rural life and to ensure that it is there all the time?  Ms Donnelly mentioned how agricultural co-operatives in the Netherlands have been successful in setting up community anaerobic digesters, solar PV cells and so on.  What financial incentives and grants are available from the State to facilitate that?  Ms Donnelly also referred to the two key barriers to renewable energy in Ireland, namely, the lack of a feed-in tariff for small-scale householders and the very slow roll-out of smart metering.  Could she explain a little about where the reluctance lies in the context of allowing this to happen?  What are the barriers to making it happen for householders?</p> <p>  Ms Donnelly also referred to offshore wind capacity and addressed it somewhat further in her previous response.  I ask her to expand a wee bit on the barriers to that, where those barriers lie and how we can overcome them.</p></speech>

Government does have a key role to play in two ways.  The first - and the one that can be taken most quickly - is to remove obstacles.  Rules and regulations or whatever that are there that should not be there should be taken away.  I cited one or two but with a little research I could probably find another few.</p><p>Saying something cannot be done, in a world where people can think outside the box and access things in a different way, is no longer valid.  We must try to avoid situations where we say, "Thou shalt not do", but rather, "You can achieve", and go and do it in the most efficient way.  That is the second role of Government, which is sometimes to incentivise people to take action.  People are clever enough to take the action that is logical and most cost-effective for themselves, but sometimes they need to be prompted to do so.  That is where the Government comes in to facilitate the change, at least at a citizen and community level.  The micro-grid financing tariff is one.  It defeats my logic that one would generate renewable electricity and then either switch off the system or spill the electricity without reward.  I find it difficult to understand that as a logic.</p></speech>

There are possibilities.  This is not just an Irish issue.  It is a general issue around the world.  When a system has operated for years and years with large incumbents, there tends to be a degree of inertia.  Large incumbents move slowly for the most part.  If I may use a German example, rather than an Irish one, RWE and Aon are two of the four huge utility companies in Germany, with a market capitalisation of billions of euros.  In 2009, the chairman of RWE said he did not believe in renewables, that it was a fad and it would disappear.  Within three years, RWE's market capitalisation had halved because the utilities did not invest in renewables whereas the farmers and the citizens did, and suddenly the two big utility companies found themselves on the wrong side of the new technology.  That error has been corrected because they are both investing heavily in renewable technologies today, including onshore wind and offshore wind.  That is an illustration of large utility companies that have been around for a long time and that say they know how to do this and will not have their system disrupted.  It is not unique to Germany.  Sometimes large entities that have been around for a long time need to be forced to move and to move more quickly.</p></speech>

Members of the Oireachtas have a big role to play.  This is where they should say that this is what they want and they want it by a certain date, and they should get on with it.  There should be no acceptance of delay or prevarication or anything else.  Smart metering was mentioned, and Ireland is in arrears on smart metering.  We were supposed to have achieved the full roll-out of smart metering by 2020, but we will start only next year, with 250,000 as a pilot project.  The services linked to smart metering will come on stream only ten months later, and then there will be a progressive roll-out.  I understand why the regulator in Ireland has done that.  It is careful and cautious.  What I do not understand, however, is if, for example, I ask for a smart meter in the morning - I asked but was told they were not available - I want to be able to avail of the services of the smart meter now.  I do not want to have it in my house for a year before I can get the benefits out of it.  It is a question of trying to put oneself in the position of the individual whom we are asking to take on new technology, which can be of huge benefit, but whom we are telling we are not ready to give the benefits to yet.  We need to get our act together and say, "There it is.  You can have the benefits straight away."  These kinds of things need to come together.  I do not want the lights to go out but a little bit less caution moving forward could be useful.  We have an intelligent population who are well able to manage all of these issues, and we could do it.</p> <p>  Regarding the Netherlands, the Dutch Government went into an agreement with both industry and agriculture on mechanisms of climate change and the response to climate change.  It set up a deal as to what would be achieved and what it would do with both the policy framework and the financial elements.  One illustration is that the Netherlands economy had historically run on gas because it had its own gas from the North Sea, but that gas is almost depleted.  In Groningen, the output had to be reduced by 75% because there were earthquakes in the locality.  It has to move out of gas, therefore, and that message is clear in the Dutch mind.  What will they do?  Much of the agriculture, especially the flowers and the glasshouses, has been run with gas.  To tackle the problem, it has decided to go for geothermal heating for the glasshouses on a collective basis.  The Government is supporting the shift of the energy source to geothermal for the glasshouse industry so as to be able to move away from gas.  That is a whole-industry shift done in collaboration with the Government in a planned and structured way.   There are grants involved in it as well, but they are naturally compliant with State aid.</p> <p>  On changing the heating system in rural areas, the Deputy is correct.  Oil heating is largely a rural problem in Ireland because there is no gas grid there anyway.  It is not easy.  We should not be too optimistic about the speed at which it can happen.  If we take 33 years, which is a long time, we can look at some of the realities of housing in Ireland.  We have a churn rate of our houses in Ireland of approximately 20 years whereas in Belgium, where a house is sold every 58 years, nobody moves.  Basically one builds a house, one moves into it and one dies.  In Ireland, however, we know many people who have lived in two or three houses, so the churn rate in Ireland is much higher.  We have an opportunity to take action at the point of churn.  I was talking about the mortgage and how one could build into the mortgage a little icing on the cake that could handle the retrofit.  It is an opportunity to take our own national characteristic and see if we can do something to get that across.</p> <p>  We might take heat pumps as an example.  They are more expensive than oil and gas boilers.  They are too expensive in this country because we do not have the volume to get the price down.  If there was the equivalent of the Tipperary Energy Agency, TEA, in every county, and public procurement rules were used to buy, say, 100 heat pumps and get a volume discount on the price, and if they were then made available to one's own people in one's own county at that lower price, it would bring down the price of the heat pump.  It is perfectly legitimate and can be done using public procurement rules, and is simply made available to people in their own area.  There are ways where collective action can make the cost of this change lower.  The other issue is seeing, feeling and touching.  It is important that people can see what it looks like when the job is done.  Then they can start to think about what it might look in their own house if they did it, what it would cost and what would be involved.  Maybe if they changed their windows five years ago, they would not need to do it, but there are different ways to do it.</p> <p>  On offshore energy, licensing and consenting procedures need to be put in place, and we will have to get agreement on landfall for the grid.  We will also have to get agreement on who will pay for the grid.  Will it be the developer such as in the UK, or will it be the EirGrid, as in the Netherlands and Belgium, for example?  These are questions to answer.  When one looks at our demand for electricity going forward, three factors will increase the volume.  First, if we shift heating and transport from fossil fuels into electricity, demand will increase.  Second, it is projected that we will experience a population increase of almost 1 million over the next couple of decades, which is a 20% increase in population.</p><p>Third, the number of planning applications for data centres indicates demand will increase by more than 50% over the next ten years.  Much of the increase in demand for electricity in Ireland will be the result of large companies needing large volumes of electricity.  This lends itself to what is called corporate power purchase agreements, PPAs, where large corporations purchase their power directly from large producers, for example, offshore wind producers.  This means it is funded through the corporate side of business without subsidy from the taxpayer.  This approach involves a radical thought process but the opportunity exists to use the corporate entity.  We now have the RE100 operating globally.  This is a collection of large companies, including Microsoft and Apple, that are committed to using 100% renewable energy, including in their supply companies.  They are prepared to invest in wind farms and take the off tech as a commercial corporate activity over time.  We have an opportunity to think about what is the nature of our demand profile on the island and what is our potential opportunity for offshore wind.  We could then match the two as an opportunity going forward.  That is just a thought.  It is in the early stages but there are possibilities that could be developed.  </p></speech>

I am a bit gobsmacked at it all.  It is fascinating and complicated at the same time.  I hope the guy in the German utility was fired for making such a dreadful error.  I am very aware sometimes of a rural-urban divide and I am the first Dubliner to speak today.  Ms Donnelly said that 20% of dwellings in the city have an A-B energy rating, whereas only 10% of houses in rural areas have it.  Is that because of affluence or awareness?  Is retrofitting chic and trendy because it allows people in Dublin 4 to speak to their neighbours about it?  Are citizens aware and concerned about climate change or have they given up or taken a defensive attitude - I am putting this politely - similar to that of Donald Trump, in other words, that climate change is nothing to do with them and it is all hocus-pocus?</p> <p>  Ms Donnelly also mentioned onshore wind and the need for guidelines.  My colleague, Deputy Brian Stanley, put forward a Bill on this topic last year.  The issue with onshore wind is that we have not taken communities on board.  That is not just an issue with climate action and energy efficiency.  In most spheres of life communities need to have ownership, including when a builder comes into an area and says he or she plans to do this, that or the other.  The community should be involved from the beginning.  It gets people's backs up when something is seen as being imposed on them, as opposed to being an effort to uplift everybody.  It is a case of who owns the country.  Communities should be involved from the beginning and given ownership in order that they have an idea of the direction they want to go.  This is a no-brainer, yet for whatever reason the powers that be take a paternalistic attitude that they know best and they will tell people what to do.  There can be objections but they will not really be listened to.  I agree with Ms Donnelly's view on that.  </p> <p>  I am new to the issue of the potential for offshore wind.  I thought we had only one offshore bank off the coast of Arklow but Ms Donnelly mentioned several others.  There has been a decrease in the cost of constructing offshore wind turbines.  Ms Donnelly referred to shipping, infrastructure and other technical requirements.  Given the decline in the cost of offshore wind development, how can we progress more offshore wind farms?  I am not sure what term is used.</p> <p>  On the use of solar photovoltaic or PV cells on windows, the scheme announced in July seems be helpful and needs to be expanded.  The majority of the population will never think about this option.  Perhaps those who are retrofitting or perhaps building a home from scratch would consider it.  The technology is available and seems to be easy enough to use.</p> <p>  The feed-in tariff seems to be a waste of an opportunity.  When we go home we only start using what is being produced at that time.  We are putting nothing in the bank, whatever bank that may be, whether it is the national grid or our own bank.  We have no incentive to do this.  Surely it would be easy enough to implement this, as is done in other countries.  Why is Ireland lagging behind in this area?</p> <p>  This is a new committee.  I have not been involved in climate change before and I am still learning.  I use the green bin and do what I can but there is obviously much more involved.  It is about informing the public with words that do not confuse.  While I vaguely know what microgeneration means, I would have to break down the word in my head.  Most people who read it would give up and through it in the bin - hopefully the green one.  This committee and those who appear before it need to use crystal clear English that is as accessible as possible.  I will not use the term "dummy's guide", but we should not bore and overwhelm people.  We may not be able to explain everything but we can explain the basics in understandable and accessible language.  The acronyms turn most people off.</p> <p>  In respect of EUROSTAT and having expenditure off the books, as it were, the local authorities have expanded their warmth and well-being scheme for the insulation of homes, both social and private.  Strict criteria apply to the scheme.  Is there scope to expand it significantly and rapidly?  Do we not have sufficient expertise in companies in this country to deal with this issue?  We need to invest in this area, and if it can be done off balance sheet, we should go for it because the costs will repaid in the long term.  Two years ago, the residents of St. Teresa's Gardens in Dublin took  a landmark case to the Council of Europe involving poor housing, damp and mould and their implications for health.  We also need to understand the implications for public health of poor energy.  I thank Ms Donnelly very much for bringing me on an adventure that I needed to go on.  However, we need to bring our citizens with us.  </p></speech>

If we went into the pub this evening, how many people would discuss energy?

How many of us know how much we are spending on electricity every month?  Do we know how much we are spending on heating every month?  Do we know how much we are spending on transport?  Are these costs that we keep in our heads?  They are not.  When we do not have that awareness of what it is costing us and what is coming out of our pockets, it is very hard to move people into the space of being in an energy transition and all of the wonderful things that go with that.  Senator Devine is right that we have to make this relevant to the citizen.</p> <p>  To pick up on the final point the Senator made because it is important, one of the things that the retrofit of a house does is improve the quality of the air and removes damp and mould.</p><p>I looked at the figures recently and in Ireland we have 470,000 people with asthma, which is the fourth highest in the world.  I understand the Deputy is going to County Tipperary to look at them, but when some of the houses are seen, it can be understood why we have such a problem.  When someone is hunched in front of an open fire, with all of the particles going into his or her lungs and a draught coming in through the windows and doors, it becomes clear why people have a problem with asthma and their health is limited.  We tend not to put enough emphasis on the fact that all of this talk about retrofitting and energy efficiency actually delivers a healthier and more comfortable house in which to live.  That may be an entry point into the conversation for many.  It is something that is relevant to them and they can then start their journey towards retrofitting from there.  The two most important points concern health and how much it will cost.  The Deputy is correct that this is not a common topic of conversation in the pub and that it is hard to get the message across, which is why it is hard to secure community involvement because people tend not to get excited about an energy activity until it is almost visible and then they feel like they were not told about it and that they were not involved.  It is all linked because if people were more excited about energy matters, they would watch what was happening and intervene earlier, but that does not absolve developers and policy makers in making things available in a transparent way and outlining what their plans are, what they will mean, what they will look like, the reasons they want to do it in a certain way and asking for suggestions, all in a simple way in order that people can understand with infographics showing what the plan is.</p><p> On the urban-rural divide when it comes to retrofitting, I have not seen any studies of it, but my intuition is that it is due to asset value.  That is the biggest factor.</p><p> On the off balance sheet, I am not a financier and was only introduced to financing energy projects and renewables a few years ago.  I have had many conversations with bankers and investment funds using terminology I do not necessarily understand; therefore, it is very new to me.  It is new to my colleagues working in Ireland, both in central government and local government.  It was not traditionally the case that a local authority would work out how to use money from an investment fund to achieve an objective.  What was traditionally done was to tell central government that X amount of money was needed and it would be spent.  There is a learning curve in how these new financial instruments are used and in partnership energy efficiency investment funds are needed.  The organisations will fund energy services companies, ESCOs, such as Crowley Carbon which is very successful globally.  They can fund the investment, run it for ten or 15 years to get a payback and guarantee the results for the ten or 15 years.  There is that model and it works, but it is new.</p><p> On offshore projects, it is a huge opportunity that needs to be developed.  It is not a panacea that will solve every problem, but it is a resource that can and should be used.</p></speech>

Can she flesh out what she said a little?  Second, does she have studies, statistics or even anecdotal evidence of where carbon tax was increased recently in some countries and how it transpired politically on the ground?  Third, we spoke about energy prices.  Many people where I come from, particularly in the farming community, talk a lot in the pub about the price of diesel.  It is very much on their minds when it goes up and also when it comes down.  Consumers feel it when they are at the pumps.  It would be fantastic if Ms Donnelly could give me more background information if she has it.</p></speech>

The price of carbon covers utilities and heavy industry polluters.  It languished at &euro;4 to &euro;5 per tonne for many years.  With the clean energy package coming through, it has gone up to around &euro;20 per tonne.  Depending on how the predictions are viewed, it should go to &euro;30 per tonne in the next while and the upward trend could go as high as &euro;50 or &euro;60.  From the modelling, a price of &euro;50 per tonne would make coal totally uncompetitive, but we do not know if we will get to that stage.  The concern is that, at &euro;50 per tonne, if companies were manufacturing steel in Europe, that price would make them very uncompetitive on the global market.  That is why I am concerned about having utilities and heavy duty industry in the same system because what is sauce for the goose is not necessarily sauce for the gander in this instance, but that is just my personal view.</p> <p>  The United Kingdom has a carbon tax which started at &pound;12 but which will increase progressively to about &pound;50.  It is included in its legislation; it is happening and the reason it will divest from coal in 2025.  In France there is-----</p></speech>

In the emissions trading system, ETS, carbon allowances are bought and sold.  Sometimes they can be traded.  Therefore, if there are many of them, the price will be very low.  As happened when the carbon allowances were withdrawn, the price went up.</p> <p>  The next time the Deputy is in the pub, he can say the reason the price of diesel has gone up is we are dependent on fossil fuels from outside the country.  It is not just Ireland but Europe is one of the largest regions in the world and one of the biggest importers of fossil fuels.  However, it does not determine the price of fossil fuels.  The price is determined elsewhere and Europe, in its entirety, is a price taker.  Therefore, when the price goes down, it is great, but when it goes up, there is absolutely nothing we can do about it.  That is one of the reasons we need to go down the route of energy transition.  Think of a utopia where we use our natural resources such as wind, solar, bio and marine energy to produce our own energy vector which we would use for heating and transport and the generation of power.  It would be done with our own resources on our own island and we will be energy independent.  Then we would not have to take the global price for diesel because we would no longer be buying it.  We would decide what our price was.  Energy transition is not just a climate issue, it is also about security of supply and competitiveness because the competitiveness of European industry frequently relies on the international price of oil and gas and can put us at a huge disadvantage when competing against other competitors globally.  Equally, from a security of supply point of view, as the committee knows, we import a lot of gas supplied by a particular colleague through a particular pipe which can be turned off.</p><p>Some 45 million people lost gas supply in the eastern European countries because the supply pipe was turned off.  There are issues of security of supply and competitiveness in energy transition as well as climate change.  The price the farmer is paying for diesel is a factor in that context.  The next time the issue comes up, Deputy Neville can say that farmers need to be part of the energy transition.</p></speech>

We have had many meetings on it.  We have been trying to get farmers to buy in to this.  There was toing and froing.  I may not be using the correct technical terms, so please correct me if I get them wrong.  There had to be a collective of 300 or 400 farmers to feed into the system and there were issues around contamination, so there had to be some fail-safe mechanism to ensure there was no cross-contamination within farms as a result of the gas.  That was an area that was being worked on at the time.  I have spoken to the organisation about that and we have been working on it.  We have been communicating with the upper echelons in Leinster House about it as well.</p> <p>  I do not have the technical knowledge to be the facilitator of that.  However, this is an issue that is being discussed more and more, but as Ms Donnelly states, it is a transition and it is managing that transition.</p> <p>  Ms Donnelly referred to speaking to County Limerick farmers.  They cannot be told to change to this system overnight.  It is a case of trying to educate and manage the transition and get them to buy into it.  A kickback buy-in will negate against any investment that will go into it, because farmers are under a lot of pressure at present.</p></speech>

A number of models for doing this exist.  We have agricultural resource as a raw material for anaerobic digestion.  We also have experience of the co-operative model in Ireland.  Milk, for example, is collected from 100 farmers and brought together to a central location.  This idea of collecting the raw material from a number of farmers and ensuring quality and getting it right is something of which we have experience and we have structures in place that can deliver it.  I do not underestimate the cost of the investment, but it is an investment and that means there is a revenue stream.  It is an opportunity for farmers.</p> <p>  I will go back to the German farmers.  The reason that they put the photovoltaic, PV, panels on the barn was not because they were pretty but because they were a source of revenue for them.  Likewise there is potential for this to be a source of revenue for farmers once the structure of the investments is in place.  I agree with the Deputy that it is a big mountain to climb, but it is an opportunity and we need to think about it.</p></speech>

I tabled parliamentary questions in early 2017 on the use of solar panels on farm sheds.  I know there was more of a debate about using land for solar panels.  It has implications for basic farm payments related to the amount of land being used, and it intensifies farming as well.  We have to keep a balance.  I would be in favour of using PV on sheds to generate electricity to sell back into the grid.  That would make perfect sense.</p></speech>

It is quite inspiring because she has given us examples of countries such as the Netherlands and Germany where it all seems so easy.  There are so many different mechanisms to generate energy and to work towards energy security.  We are here on the island of Ireland and we have probably the best wind in Europe available on the western seaboard.  We have the potential for solar energy and we are good at research and development, and innovation.</p><p>Having listened to Ms Donnelly, I am wondering why we are not doing it.  We have every opportunity.  We must become energy secure.  We must decarbonise, without a doubt.  In my local pub, we talk about the weather.  We do not talk about the climate, but I can guarantee that we talk regularly about weather.  How do we change the conversation?  How do we use the best of the Irish to move towards energy security and decarbonise?  The targets are there.  We are not meeting them.  Many of us are very frustrated.  If a person has an examination, he or she sets himself or herself a target, and to proceed and to progress, that person needs to reach that target.  We are not doing that.  There is frustration in our communities.  We see that one good example, Tipperary Energy Agency, and we are looking forward to visiting it.  Ms Donnelly is correct that it should be rolled out to all the local authorities.  Why has it not?  It is not that the Tipperary Energy Agency was formed yesterday.  It has been in operation for a number of years.  Why is it not happening throughout Ireland?</p><p>Ms Donnelly spoke about economies of scale around retrofit in the Netherlands.  We have some retrofitting and again Tipperary Energy Agency is excellent on super-homes.  Why is there not a programme to do that <i>en masse</i>to get the efficiencies instead of this happening one by one in communities, thus not creating the efficiencies of scale?  My central question is the reason for the resistance.  What is the problem in Ireland that does not allow us make the steps and get traction because we are not making the necessary progress?  I would be interested to hear Ms Donnelly's response.</p><p>Some 97 per cent of the members of the Citizens' Assembly recommended that a new independent body be formed as a matter of urgency with new powers and functions in legislation to address climate change urgently, and twice I have used the word &quot;urgently&quot;.  In her opening statement Ms Donnelly suggested, and I agree, that the senior officials in Departments should work together and present a document each quarter.  In respect of that recommendation, does Ms Donnelly think we should have independent body and have the cross-departmental senior officials producing transparent and open reports to allow for the process that my colleague, Senator Devine, mentioned of building the awareness and getting greater understanding?  At present, marine spatial planning is not in place nor is the foreshore consenting licence.  There are so many opportunities and so many steps that we need to take but we are not taking them.</p><p>My final question is on marine capacity.  We have a great maritime capacity, more so than most other European countries.  We should be developing offshore windfarms.  I have friends who work in the offshore sector in the North Sea and I hear of the benefits in terms of job creation, not to mention the benefits of clean and renewable energy.  In terms of carbon sequestration, is there anything we could do with the sea all around us?  I am thinking about is seaweed.  Seaweed is a marine plant and could be beneficial in terms of carbon sequestration.  The Government is talking about licensing aquaculture that will deplete our seaweed resources, such as the large kelp forest in Bantry Bay.  Should there be a cessation of that immediately with regard to our climate potential?</p></speech>

It is not the only one.  Codema, which is the energy agency for Dublin, is also doing a great job.  It brought out an "energy in the home" unit two years ago.  This practical product, which has been made available to citizens in Dublin, won a prize in Europe last year.  The combined energy agencies of Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford are operating in a similar space to Tipperary Energy Agency.  They are doing a very good job.  There is also something in Kerry, although it might not be as developed.  It is a matter for each authority to prioritise climate and energy as an issue and to invest resources in it under the most appropriate structure so that these facilities are available to the people of the local area.</p> <p>  It was mentioned during one of the earlier discussions that some people talk about the weather and some people talk about the price of diesel.  It is clear that Irish people talk about the weather all the time.  Somebody suggested that we should take up a model that has been pursued in Flanders.  When the local equivalent of Met &Eacute;ireann comes on the nightly news, a little chart shows how much renewable energy was made available in the region that day.  People can see the figure every day.  I think that would be a really useful thing to do.  It would not be expensive to put it on the table.  If people could see it every day, it would become relevant.  They would see that 50% of their electricity that day had come from renewables, for example.  If there was no wind, the figure might be 20%.  It is a question of making it visible so that people can talk about it when they are in the pub.</p> <p>  I would like to speak about the first recommendation for an independent body.  I made my suggestion within the group of senior officials primarily because we had that kind of structure within the commission.  While it could be very frustrating sometimes to get beaten up by one's colleagues, I think it delivered better quality policies because there was an internal screening process before going outside.  Such a process often reflected the concerns of stakeholders in each of the Departments and, to some extent, the concerns of society.  It was good from that point of view.  The advantage of this approach is that existing expertise is used immediately.  Such a mechanism could be put in place tomorrow if a decision to that effect were made.  It would take time and money to create an independent body.  Depending on the structure of such a body, there is a risk that it might operate outside mainstream government.  Such an agency might be seen to be on the side, rather than on the top.  I think there is a need for something that is on the top of government, takes senior decisions, has political reporting requirements and takes responsibility for that.  That is why the quarterly report, which should only be a table, should say what has been done and what it means for greenhouse gas emissions and renewables within a certain timeline.  It should set out the actions that have been taken, rather than those that are being considered or consulted on.  If more detail is requested thereafter, it can be provided.  It is important, in the interests of political accountability, to be able to see an actual record immediately.  I emphasise this as a possible opportunity.</p> <p>  The emerging issue of seaweed has not been the subject of an awful lot of study at European level.  Other parts of Europe do not have as much seaweed as Ireland.  The five marine countries along the Atlantic seaboard - Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal and we will possibly still have the UK - will look at this issue.  All five countries are co-operating on marine energy generally.  The whole issue of seaweed has to be looked at across those countries.  As the sea does not operate with boundaries, the reality is that what we do in one country will have an impact on other countries.  It is an issue.  I would say that we should use seaweed as sequestration.  To be honest, I do not have enough knowledge at this stage to be able to comment on whether what is happening is good or bad, or whether another direction could be taken.</p></speech>

It will be Ireland's most sustainable development.  Homes will have no energy costs and will have enough power to power an electric vehicle.  This will lead to a 50% reduction in the annual footprint of homeowners.  Savings of &euro;40,000 a year will be made in respect of social homes with no oil and gas usage.  The community will own 30% of the energy as a co-operative.  That is what is happening in Waterford.  I hope we will be able to use that as a positive example for the future.</p></speech>

She spoke earlier about mandating and legislating for certain issues.  She spoke about a carrot and stick approach.  She used the bag levy and the smoking ban as examples.  I think there is an interesting point here.  Those measures did not impose a cost on consumers.  There was an inconvenience, but it was an acceptable inconvenience because there was no net cost to the consumer.  I think that is an important thing.  We need to look not only at Ireland but also at Europe.  I had a conversation with a German farmer who has a wind turbine.  We discussed the reluctance and resistance to renewables, especially wind, from the Irish agriculture sector.  He said that the fundamental difference is that the wind turbine the farmer in Germany can see when he looks out his kitchen window is his wind turbine, but that is not the case in Ireland.  It is an important difference.  In certain circumstances, renewables have had a legacy of generating wealth and taking it out of the locality.  It goes to big corporations and businesses - out of the country and away.  I think there is a need to ensure the wealth that is generated through renewables in a locality can be distributed and spread around within that locality.  An important change is needed in this respect.</p> <p>  We have seriously missed a trick with regard to microgeneration, community initiatives and the ability to share the power that is generated.  In parts of Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden and in other places, people have been given the ability to generate energy and power and share it with their neighbours.  That is not the case here.  That capacity is still absent here.</p> <p>  Ms Donnelly referred to agriculture many times in her contribution.  Agriculture and transport are often cited as the villains when we speak about many of these issues.  I think we still need to do some work on sequestration of carbon in agriculture.  There is a lot of ambiguity around the numbers, the reality of how much carbon we could sequester and what those values are.  There is a need to attribute those things to agriculture and give it the credit it is due.</p> <p>  I firmly believe agriculture can be part of the solution.  I was interested to hear biogas being mentioned earlier because there has always been an intense heated debate about the competition between land for food and land for fuel.  The fundamental difference is that investment in anaerobic digestion in Ireland and in the UK often involves sole traders or big business.  There is one person, rather than a collective or a co-operative, behind the investment.  I firmly believe there would be an appetite for a shared initiative involving a number of people.  However, the requirement for capital investment and access to finance means that this sector tends to be confined to sole investors or big multinationals.</p> <p>  There was a brief reference to geothermal technology, which I find quite interesting because I do not think it adds up on a commercial basis in the absence of a subsidy.  Given that the agriculture industry is completely and wholly dependent on subsidies, we need to be mindful of the fact that it is not a good place to build a business model on.  We need to look at renewables that will work in business terms without subsidy and support.</p> <p>  We need to be aware of the consequences of our actions and conscious of the competitiveness needs of business, especially in the agrifood area.  It is important that we take an holistic approach to this matter, rather than cherry-picking certain bits and pieces.  If we focus on wind, for example, it can have a knock-on effect.  I will give an example.  I visited one of the most energy-efficient buildings the other day.  I went into a beautiful office looking out over the city, but it was very hot and warm.  The guy I was meeting had his desktop fan on to blow cold air across his desk because he was not allowed to open the fantastic triple-glazed window in this office.  I do not know whether they thought he was going to jump out of it.</p><p>There was no provision to open it.  Reference was made to the climate in this room today.  The air-conditioning is running flat out.  It would be lovely to have a window that could be opened.  We must be careful because although we now have the mechanisms to give us controlled environments, it sometimes may be better to go back to basics and open a window or take off one's coat.</p><p> Ms Donnelly referred to utilising agricultural stubble.  Again, that is part of the discussion about the consequences of our actions because one must remember that if one removes the stubble, one takes out organic matter from the soil, which can lead to soil degradation.  We must be careful not to cherry-pick.</p><p> There is a role for universities and researchers in this regard.  Researchers are working on energy pathways, efficiency and life cycle.  It is important to do the entire calculation and also to factor in the societal benefits of doing these things.  Ms Donnelly rightly highlighted the health benefits which we very often do not factor in to the cost of renewables.</p><p> Historically, we have accepted there is a problem but always assumed that someone else will solve it.  How do we get people to accept responsibility and take ownership of these problems?</p></speech>

The Senator is correct that the issue of community involvement has historically been problematic in regard to onshore wind energy production.  I hope that will be assuaged by the new renewable energy systems, RES, and requirements for community involvement.  It may have been necessary to use a big stick to persuade people to do it but it is the right way forward.  However, a very large proportion of investment in onshore wind farms in Ireland in recent years has been made by Irish companies.  We have not attracted many German, Dutch or other companies to invest in wind farms in Ireland.  The majority of wind farms are Irish-owned, so if there is a problem we should discuss the issues of dialogue and communication among ourselves because-----</p></speech>

That is a very different and important issue in that the area is opening up to people.  The Irish Wind Farmers' Association has been established and is an active group.</p> <p>  An issue of which the Senator reminded me is that if there are, for example, three wind turbines generating power in an industrial park such as that in Ringaskiddy the power generated cannot be sold to other factory outlets on the site because of a rule which I think was brought in by the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995 and which does not allow a direct wire.  To overcome the obstacles that exist, we sometimes have to go back into the archives and remove rules and legislation that made sense then but do not make sense today.  We should remove obstacles that prevent people doing potentially useful things. </p> <p>  My vision for agriculture in this country is that it would be carbon neutral.  That is a vision, objective and aspiration toward which every farmer in Ireland could move.  It will not be easy and will require change and investment.</p> <p>  On the issue of anaerobic digestion, if I was an investor, I would not invest in anaerobic digestion for biogas unless I had the commitment of farmers who were stakeholders in the business because without that, I could not rely on my source of raw material.  I do not see any rationale for investing in it without having the involvement of farmers.  They could be whole or part owners but if one does not have a farmer committed to supplying the raw material, one cannot run one's digester.  It needs a co-operative type structure to deliver it on the ground.  Such structures are in place in certain parts of the country.  However, it is expensive technology.</p> <p>  Geothermal energy is very interesting.  A geothermal map of Europe is available.  Hungary, which sits on a lake of fire, is probably the most interesting place in Europe in that regard.  The entire Hungarian energy system could be run solely on its geothermal capacity.  Another promising location is under the city of Paris.  Many public buildings in Paris are heated and cooled using geothermal energy because the city also sits on a lake of oil.  There are some very useful geothermic areas in Ireland which we should maximise.  The difficulty with geothermal energy is that it requires a very high level of initial capital investment.  Taken over its lifetime, it is a very cheap technology but there is always the question of the upfront investment that is required.</p> <p>  On researchers, I recently attended a meeting at which there was discussion of bringing models for climate change, energy generation and so on together.  All the models were linked.  However, the agricultural side was omitted and I wondered why that was so.  There is an element of getting climate and energy researchers to reach out to the agricultural side but, equally, the agricultural side must put itself in the middle of the debate on energy and climate.  I do not see agriculture as a problem but, rather, an opportunity.  We will only be able to deal with this and reach a positive solution if we take that attitude.</p></speech>

Her expertise is very highly regarded.  I hope that our State will use it as best it can in tackling the significant challenge it faces.  Specific and very practical and useful suggestions have been made.  I tend to agree with Ms Donnelly that the key is for the Secretaries General of Departments to meet rather than having an outside body.  I am very interested in her reference to the Dutch partnership model, with which I am familiar.  We should be pursue a partnership model involving Secretaries General and representatives of the ICTU and IBEC and others because, as Ms Donnelly stated, progress is made when the attention of all is focused on an issue.  Ireland can be successful at that because, as Nancy Pelosi said, it is big enough to be significant but small enough to be flexible.  It would be possible to get all the relevant parties around a table.  Based on the evidence Ms Donnelly has given to the committee, it should outline to Secretaries General that they must have monthly meetings and present quarterly reports in a list rather than essay format.  If possible, we should consider adopting the Dutch partnership model.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, may have already carried out some analysis of that model and its potential application in an Irish context.</p> <p>  The committee or its research team should write to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills to ask why our schools can only be fuelled by fossil fuel heating systems and to clarify how the Department can apply that rule and concurrently teach our children about the importance of the environment in classes such as civic, social and political education, CSPE.  How can schools fly a green flag while the Department of Education and Skills states that they may not use a renewable heating system?  That is a disgrace.  The committee should write to the Secretary General to request an immediate change in that policy.  </p> <p>  It should also write to the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to ask why the Department, in the context of the consultation process, has put forward a 0.35 coefficient which allows for oil-fired central heating systems rather than a coefficient of 0.25 which I presume would also preclude gas-fired heating.  We should write immediately to outline what we have heard today and ask the Secretaries General who will be appearing before the committee and those who will not, such as the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, to explain what we have heard and what are they going to do about it.</p></speech>

As I stated, Ms Donnelly was involved at the highest level in the establishment of the Sustainable Energy for All programme, on which I think the commission did a good job.  I liked the 2020 package developed by the commission but it has learned and changed its approach and the rates have evolved.  We are subject to the new governance system and must assist the Government in achieving targets within the very tight timeline under the new national energy and climate action plans.  I acknowledge that Ms Donnelly left the commission last year but, as she was involved in drafting the governance structures, is she aware of any Government which is successfully implementing such plans?</p><p>There are such tight time limits and my understanding is that we do not really have a plan ready.  What could we do in three or four months?  Does Ms Donnelly have any suggestions when it comes to the actual drafting of the national energy and climate action plan which is, in my understanding of the governance system, the be all and end all of this matter?  Does she have any advice as to how we would write this or how we as a committee might assist the Government in writing it?</p><p> The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was in yesterday and said, in its work of assessing fiscal risk for this country, that both the likelihood and the impact of the risk of Ireland paying climate fines are potentially high and that this is a real concern.  I know that some say that Europe will never fine us; that this will never happen.  Does Ms Donnelly think that we will get fines and can she give any assessment as to what they might be?  How can we avoid them?  Perhaps the latter part of that question is too big.  Is there a real potential for fines, however, and if so can the witness give a figure as to what they might amount to?</p><p> Thinking big here, we have passed Second Stage of a Bill which will end offshore oil and gas exploration in Irish waters and I am convinced and confident that, if the D&aacute;il has time, this Bill will pass into law.  The Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill 2016, introduced by Tr&oacute;caire, Deputy Thomas Pringle and others, was historically important in showing leadership in divestment and I believe that we will have a similar ability to end offshore oil and gas exploration.  The reason I think that is because it is feasible for us to develop offshore wind on the west coast of Ireland, using places like Killybegs, Galway and Shannon, and floating offshore wind, in particular, given that the seas are so rough.  I believe that we should be doing this on the scale of ten, 15 or 20 gigawatts with a view to selling it into the rest of the European system.  As Ms Donnelly said, the industry wants people who are thinking big and thinking long term on this matter.  If we are thinking big then, does she think it a rational industrial, economic and energy policy for us to think of producing that scale of offshore wind on the west coast in order to export to the rest of Europe?  From my own perspective I would like to say that everyone else is betting &euro;100 million a pop on oil exploration that never finds anything.  We know that there is wind out there and that the technology works, so my sense is that this is the scale of ambition for which we should be going.</p><p> I have two further questions.  One of the risks here concerns Brexit.  Ms Donnelly mentioned work on the North Sea countries offshore grid initiative and on the north-west electricity market.  In order to sell the offshore wind on the west coast we would obviously have to either go through the United Kingdom or sell into it.  Should we hold back and wait to see what happens with Brexit or is the regional electricity market with which Ms Donnelly was previously involved still progressing?</p><p> Ms Donnelly cited the example of Flanders, where there has been some really good co-operative investment in renewable energy.  I was very fortunate to meet a company operating as an ecopower co-operative in Flanders and this was the best example I have seen where one was able to invest into the company with as little a &euro;250 per share.  One could invest in large-scale renewables as well as in local, small-scale projects and there was a supply company giving very good energy service supply company assistance.  Why is it that we have no ecopower co-operative in Ireland, in Plunkett House, for example?  I was very moved by a comment at one of our earlier hearings which compared the work of this committee to the work of the recess committee carried out by Horace Plunkett in the 1890s.  This is exactly the model for us to follow as it was collaborative and used the resources of our land well.  Horace Plunkett is a hero and a model for co-operatives in the rest of Europe, certainly in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.  What is the obstacle preventing Irish co-operatives from taking the ecopower model and introducing it here?  What is stopping us?  </p></speech>

With regard to the plan, Deputy Ryan is absolutely right.  The governance process is central to going forward with the clean energy package.  We have learnt many messages from the earlier rounds of legislation and one such message was that if one does not have a joined-up approach to this problem one will end up negating some of the good achieved.  This is because one will inadvertently carry out reverse actions.  In order to get the maximum impact, one needs to take the holistic view, not just of what one is doing oneself, but also of what one's neighbours are doing.  Firstly, this plan asks member states to look at their own systems.  What is each state's own energy need and what is it likely to be?  Does it have an excess or does it have a shortfall?  This is in the context of the fact that there is approximately 32% excess capacity for electricity in mainland Europe today, although this is not of course valid for Ireland.  The problem is that there are not enough interconnectors between the areas with an excess and the areas with a shortfall and this is one of the reasons for the Connecting Europe Facility and the programme for 15% of interconnectors for member states so that we can actually bring this together.  That excess capacity means that, as mainland Europe goes forward with the electrification of heat and transport and if the interconnectors can be put in place, the electricity system as it is will be able to cope with the increased demand.</p> <p>  This is different from where we in Ireland are at.  We are an island, and our growth is such that demand will increase.  We have to deal with that.  We in Ireland, then, are in a slightly different situation.  This issue with this plan is that one not only looks at one's own situation.  Italy, for example, should not only look at its own situation but rather should look at who it is interconnecting with.  What is happening in France?  What is happening in Austria?  What is happening across the Adriatic Sea in Croatia?  Do these countries have an excess or a shortfall?  Can one trade or build a common model?  The plan is about, not only what one does in one's own country, but also what one does with one's neighbours.  Brexit will have something of an impact on us in this respect because, following the departure of the United Kingdom, we will become very much an island.  That, then, is the first point, that one not only looks at one's own situation but look around instead.</p> <p>  Secondly, one should take a long-term rather than a short-term view.  At the moment this view runs to 2030 but the real message is that we not just stop there, we must at least think about what happens beyond that.  The year 2030 is only a milestone in a journey and one can decide if that milestone is going in this way or in that way.  That is an element of it.  It is a milestone that we need to think beyond so that we get a long-term perspective.  The investments we are talking about here are long-term infrastructural investments.  One does not invest in electricity systems for ten years, one does so for 50 years, so any investment we make now we make for the long term.  The idea and the structure of the plan is that one looks at what is happening in one's own space, what is happening beside one, and what is happening in the dimension of time.</p> <p>  To give some good examples so far, the Dutch already have a draft and it is already in consultation.  There are different models out there, of course.  The French are already well advanced with their model, primarily because France is one of that states that has been pushing for this, and it will be written by central Government.  Germany has two versions and has to sort out which one to use.  There are, then, examples of countries that have made progress in this space.  The template is already there.  If the Department is busy or does not have the resources or whatever else, I would suggest that it just get a group of researchers, or a commercial company or whatever, to do a first draft and then take that draft apart.  It is a matter of just getting somebody to put words on a page and then tear that apart as necessary.  The Department cannot delay; it needs something and it needs to be able to react to it.  The sooner the Department gets this, the better.  If one could just use the template with what is currently available then I quite honestly believe that a first draft could be done in approximately six weeks.  This first draft would of course have to be refined and developed, and then sent to Brussels where, no doubt, a number of comments will be made on it, not least of which would be that the ambition not might be sufficient.  I say this because I am quite sure that the ambition for renewable energy coming out of Ireland will not be sufficient.  The target for Europe is 32% and the expectation in Europe is that Ireland will come forward with that target.  It would surprise me greatly, however, if the Irish draft has a target as ambitious as that.</p> <p>  This takes me to Deputy Ryan's second question on fines.  The renewable energy situation, for example, concerns legislation that is on the books and Ireland was part of the process for adopting it.  This is normal legislation.  The European Union operates on the basis of rules.</p><p>What marks the European Union out as different from other regions in the world is we have a common rule book, common legislation and we enforce the legislation.  For example, if we had, which we possibly have, rules on how to build a chair, because we have a Single Market and the chair is built in Germany, it has to be able to be sold in Italy.  If for whatever reason Ireland decided to make chairs with five legs instead of four and then could not sell them, there is legislation on this breach of the rules, there is recourse to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, it will rule, and Ireland will have to conform with the rules because the rules are there for the Single Market.  In the case of renewable energy, it is the rule and the law.  Ireland will be breaking the law.  We will be referred to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg which will ask first to be shown how we have broken the law, which in this instance will not be very difficult.<br/><br/>The second stage is that when a person breaks a Community rule, he or she is required to fix it, and if that person does not do so, he or she is fined every day until that person fixes it.  This happens in all of the areas, not only in energy.  That is why we would be fined.  The law states we must achieve 16% renewable energy.  We will not get there and we are clearly in breach of it.  We will be fined until we get there, which might take two or three years.  That means it is not just a once-off fine.  It is every day until we get there.<br/><br/>The question arises of how the level of fine is assessed.  Generally speaking, the court will use a market levelling mechanism.  It will ask what it would have cost to comply with the legislation, and that is what the fine will be.  That is how we get the figures of roughly &euro;200 million per percentage point because, roughly speaking, one should have been able to achieve a percentage point with &euro;200 million.  I cannot say definitively that will be the number, but that is the mechanism that will be followed.<br/><br/>We will not be able to excuse ourselves.  We will not be able to play the poor mouth.  Ireland is the second richest country <i>per capita</i>in Europe, after Luxembourg.  We have the highest and fastest GDP growth rate in Europe.  We have all the natural resources in the world to achieve this.  Why would somebody in Cyprus or the Czech Republic give Ireland a soft ride?  These countries are much poorer than we are and these countries will make their target.  Why should we get an easy ride?  Politically, I do not see it happening.<br/><br/>There is an express provision in the governance regulation to provide for fines.  That was put in there very deliberately because Europe has to be serious on this issue.  If we are not serious, we are wasting all of our time.  I think we will be facing fines.<br/><br/>On offshore floating turbines, I agree 100% that it is the emerging technology.  Again, it is the five countries I was telling the committee about.  I had the pleasure of going to see the offshore floating turbine off Porto.  It is very impressive.  It works.  It works in storm conditions, even in hurricane conditions.  It is fantastic.  I think we can definitely do it.  There are two issues we need to look at.  If we are to do it off the west coast of Ireland, we will have to bring that power either across the country or around the country to get it to Europe, and we must think about which of the options we will take.  The Celtic interconnector, with 700 MW, is a start.  We will need more than that.  At one stage, Iceland was talking about building an interconnector to the UK because Iceland has lots of power.  That would be 2,000 km in length and nobody seems to be surprised at the notion.  For us to build an interconnector to France, it would be nothing like that length.  It would be much shorter.  We could even build an interconnector to Spain.  It is not only that we would sell our power to them, which is obviously an opportunity, but also that, more important, we would be able to exchange power.  That is where the real benefit comes.  The reason electricity costs less in Denmark than it costs in Ireland is because Denmark exchanges power in Nord Pool, which includes the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and even Norway, so that Denmark can balance its system.  We must pay all of the balancing costs ourselves because we do not exchange with anybody else.  The interconnector is not only a mechanism to sell, but also to buy, which reduces our costs.  As a philosophy for the future, that is the big thinking that we need to have in our heads.<br/><br/>Who knows what Brexit will be?  My personal hope would be, regardless of what happens, that we still have a connection with the United Kingdom, and indeed Northern Ireland, in the electricity space.  It must be remembered that we have a single electricity market on the island of Ireland.  It would be most unfortunate if that were to be broken up.  We need them and they need us.  There are mechanisms for co-operation that can be put in place, regardless of what kind of withdrawal agreement gets put into place.  It would be my personal hope that it is possible to have the same standards on both sides and we should maintain the connection and dialogue.  We have to wait and see how things happen.<br/><br/>On the Flanders co-operative, I know why we do not have energy co-operatives.  One of the limitations, if one looks at the Flanders co-operative in raising co-operatives in Europe, is that a large share of the 1 million people who are party to a community co-operative are operating with PV technology.  The reason I put so much emphasis on PV technology is it is simple.  It is like a light bulb.  One plugs it in and goes away.  It is an easy technology.  No expertise is necessary other than setting it up.  It allows people to participate in the process in a simple way.  It is also an urban opportunity as well as a rural one.  If we were to open, as it were, solar energy in this country, especially on a small scale, we would find co-operatives starting to emerge because it becomes a logical consequence of that as an entity.  That is an area where policy can make a seriously big difference.</p></speech>

First, it is interesting to listen to what Ms Donnelly has to say.  I could listen all afternoon.  It would be good to get Ms Donnelly to speak to our communities.  I had a wind farm on my doorstep and it was horrendous for me, a politician, to have to deal with it.  It was a case of us and them.  Even when I tried to plead the community card, it did not work.  Something I suggested at the time was that one wind farm should be made available to the public as that would cover their ESB bills.  This happens in Scotland and it works well, as Ms Donnelly probably will be aware.  What is happening now, in terms of communities meeting and those developing the wind farms having a conversation, is very important.  The wind farm is there a year and a half to two years, and the level of opposition has virtually died off.  We did get on that mountain - it was Coillte land - a beautiful amenity area, which is being used by up to 2,000 people a month with very little advertising.  It will help tourism in a major way in County Roscommon, which we badly need.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Donnelly one or two questions about that.  Some of the experts will say that such inland wind farms will be a no-no in a few years.  Apparently, Germany does not do much of it anymore.  That is one question.  Does Ms Donnelly believe that to be the case?</p> <p>  Second, Ms Donnelly spoke a great deal about how we bring communities together on this, but how is that barrier broken?  No matter what efforts are made, there will still be a significant barrier to be broken down even to have the discussion.  The trust factor is not there.  I do not have an issue with wind farms once the community is taken into account.  In my own locality, we are fortunate where we have the community programme in terms of funding coming from the owners of the wind farm to help out community projects.</p><p>One of the unfortunate things about it is that a Leader company from east Cork opts for Roscommon.  At the time, Coillte said it did not want to put locals on it and I can see that point to a degree.  They might favour "A" over "B".  However, the arrangement is not satisfactory for a local community.</p><p> Another issue is that people do not trust the planning regime.  They will always say the council will grant permission and Coillte will uphold the council's decision, notwithstanding the total process.  The question, therefore, is how we break that barrier down.  Battery areas or units were referred to in respect of wind farms.  These are now being put in beside the wind farms and in other places and there are huge concerns among the public about this.  They are just afraid of it.  How do we break down that barrier?  I am told in my area that the batteries would be used to gather electricity for release in an emergency and, therefore, we would have fewer power cuts.</p><p> Deputy Ryan made an excellent point on heating systems in schools and, like other members, I support that.  I note the point about offshore wind farms.  It is called the "wild" Atlantic and there will be huge problems servicing those wind farms, notwithstanding what some of the experts say.  Other parts of the world were referred to.  If one looks at the wind factor, it is less severe or bold than it is in the Atlantic, which is ferocious.  There is a big difference between having a wind farm in the Irish Sea compared to the west of Ireland.  Is there an issue there?</p><p> I would like to make a contribution on biofuels but I am not going to go into that any further today.  My final question is on our 2020 targets.  It is a huge issue.  I accept what Ms Donnelly said in that regard.  It is bad for Ireland.  However, the vast majority of the public does not care.  How do we break that barrier down to get it through to the population as a whole that we have a serious fines issue coming down the track?  It is going to hit our budgets and other projects in this country if we are going to get caught with all those fines.  Many  members of the public do not care.  They will talk about it but they do not care.  How do we change that mindset?  I will keep my other questions for another day.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right about that.  That is why Germany is investing in offshore energy.  The difficulty for Germany is as follows: while Schleswig-Holstein has a 100% renewable supply of electricity and exports to the other landers, it is draws electricity from the North Sea whereas a huge centre of demand is in Bavaria in the south.  The question is how to get that energy to the south.  Germany is planning two spines of HVDC pylon links to bring the electricity down to the south.  The consultation process with citizens there has been hugely complicated.  There is resistance to doing this and they have gone through a great many hours of consultation with all the participants and citizens on the routes to put this process in place and get the energy from the north of Germany to the south where it is needed.</p></speech>

If there is a cost, people have to decide whether they are prepared to pay it.   I agree there is no simple answer.  However, Germany is moving to offshore development because it needs the energy.  One has to remember that Germany is taking seven nuclear power stations out of action in 2022.  Germany is using much more coal and lignite now than it did previously but it wants to get rid of it.  That can only happen if enough renewable energy is available.  Germany is caught a little bit in a dilemma as to how to go forward on its power system.</p> <p>  I said earlier that the technology of wind turbines had changed dramatically.  The height has increased because there is better control and that has changed the situation with regard to the acceptability and utility of sites.  Initially, we were always looking at putting turbines on mountain tops but it is not perhaps as necessary to do that today as with the earlier versions of the technology.  It may be more constructive or cost-effective to put a wind farm close to a grid connection, rather than to have to build a grid connection out.  This is a balance because the grid connections for build out will tend to be in areas of sparse population and that might be a preferred option for wind farms.  On the other hand, if one goes to a place where there is a lot of gid connection, there will probably be a lot of people too.  One has to strike a balance economically.  The discussion should be had with people, however, to state a preferred option and the reasons for it and to ask what they think.  It may be, however, that the Government will have to say that while people do not want it, someone has to supply it.  As such, an element of framing will need to be done because we will need, ultimately, to have the power from somewhere.</p> <p>  On battery units, I reiterate that one should touch them and stand beside them.  They should listen to the battery units.  I have seen them in operation in Belfast, for example, where they can react in one tenth of a second to the power situation.  They can operate for three minutes, which is generally enough to prevent a power outage.  While they are not cheap, they are hugely useful, especially when one has renewable energy coming through.  Given where we are now with our technology, it might be better in the future.  If people have a concern, bring them up and let them see it.  Let them hear it, touch it and ask the questions.  Let them put their concerns on the table and answer them honestly and correctly.  People should be given the information.  Some will be convinced and some might not.  Let us at least try to convince those who are open to being convinced.  That is the real issue.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct regarding offshore wind that the conditions off the west coast of Ireland are hostile.  There is no discussion on that.  It is why the five wind farms are in the Irish Sea, which is much more attractive.  However, we should not neglect the west coast.  While it is true that the wind speeds there are higher and there will be more maintenance involved, more power can be generated, so there is an opportunity.  We have to think about it and how to exploit it, but it is there.</p> <p>  On the 2020 fines, apart from the cost, which we are all concerned about, what makes me really nervous is that the population will consider it to be a question of Brussels beating us up again and, because we pay fines, people will become hostile to climate action and the energy transition.  They will become negative about it.  If for no other reason, we have to spend the money as quickly as we can in the country for the benefit of the people who live here.  People might not be sensitive to it now, but if it is a choice between a new hospital wing and paying fines to Brussels, I know how the population will react.  We have to try to pre-empt and minimise that as best we can to avoid a negative reaction on the part of the population.</p></speech>

The ESB is seen as more trustworthy perhaps.  When someone from the ESB knocks on someone's door in connection with putting up an electricity pole, there is more trust.  Is that kind of engagement at local level on onshore wind turbines something one sees in other countries to instil trust?  Is the main broker who comes to a community to convince people from a trusted institution with a reputation as opposed to someone who is seen as an outside developer?</p><p>Is that a key factor in winning over the public?</p></speech>

In most of Europe, it has been developers who have rolled out wind turbines.  I spoke about Germany, where it was developers and not the utilities that did it.  In Spain, Iberdrola is a very big private company that developed and rolled out a lot of the wind turbines.</p></speech>

The decision by the US authorities to cease funding to UNRWA poses a potential humanitarian crisis.  The provision of basic education and health services, particularly in Gaza, is under threat because of this action.  Not only will it cause misery for so many needy people, it also further threatens the already fragile security situation in the region.  We have also heard today about the decision by the Israeli Supreme Court to allow the demotion of a Bedouin village, Khan al-Ahmar.  The international community needs to stand up to its demolition and the forcible transfer of its inhabitants and make it known that it is not an acceptable action.

Many members have been on the ground in Palestine and Israel, and some have also met our group while there.  I wish to avoid details of the wider issues and to focus instead on two particular crises.  The situation has been so bad for so long it can be numbing, and it can be difficult to see one emergency as standing out against the background of the ongoing slow-motion catastrophe.  The reality is that two recent events do stand out and are existential threats for a future Palestinian state.  They are two events that challenge us to live up to the commitments we have made to support peace and justice in the region.  We want to present to the committee on the expected imminent demolition of Khan al-Ahmar and the recent cuts to United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, funding.</p> <p>  While the committee is familiar with our group, I want to quickly state for the record who we are and provide a short introduction to our programme.  The Ecumenical Accompaniment Programme in Palestine and Israel, EAPPI, was founded in response to a call from the heads of churches in Jerusalem.  Since 2002, over 1,500 international volunteers from 22 countries have served as ecumenical accompaniers, EAs.  The work we do includes monitoring and reporting violations of international law, providing a protective presence, supporting the work of peace groups and undertaking public policy advocacy.  We have the largest number of observers on the ground of any group in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and, as such, we are able to provide unique eyewitness testimonies.  I am Lesley O&rsquo;Connor.  I was based in South Hebron Hills in 2017.  I am accompanied by Patrick Costello, who was based in Bethlehem as an observer in late 2014.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.1458" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018092000002#E00200"><p>I will take us through the two issues.  Khan al-Ahmar is a village in the occupied West Bank, just east of Jerusalem.  It is near two large Israeli settlements, Ma&rsquo;ale Adumim and Kfar Adumim, and close to an Israeli industrial zone.  The villagers living there are the descendants of Bedouins who had been living in the Negev but who were expelled from there by the Israeli Government in the 1950s.  On 5 September last, Israel&rsquo;s highest court upheld an order to demolish the entire village.  This has been in the offing for some time and there have been many legal challenges.  Unfortunately, this ruling means the village can be demolished and its residents forcibly transferred at any time from 12 September.<br/><br/>I am sure the committee is aware of the frequent demolitions of Palestinian homes, schools and agricultural structures across the West Bank.  Our observers have frequently witnessed either demolitions or their aftermath.  Like those demolitions, the demolition of Khan al-Ahmar and the resulting forced transfer of its 200 residents, including nearly 100 children, will be a grave breach of the Geneva conventions and a war crime under the Rome Statute.  However, as we said at the beginning, this is a new crisis and marks a turning point, in a way.  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, stated:</p><blockquote>The communities are located in a particularly sensitive part of Area C in the West Bank, an area which is critical for the viability of a future Palestinian state.  Any attempt to develop the land for illegal settlements is therefore a threat to the Two State solution.</blockquote> <p>Building settlements in this area would encircle East Jerusalem, cutting it off from the rest of Palestine.  It would also, essentially, cut the West Bank in two, north and south, again threatening any future Palestinian state and making any contiguous Palestinian state impossible to build.  Due to the sensitive nature of this area, much of the international community has spoken out frequently, calling on Israeli authorities not to demolish the village and stating there would be serious consequences.  Our position if that if we are serious about peace and justice in the region, we cannot allow this demolition to happen or, at least, to happen without consequences.  There was a joint statement by France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom on 10 September condemning the decision but it contained little on meaningful action.  When it talked of consequences, it talked only of the negative consequences for the Bedouin community who would lose their homes.  What is needed now is action.<br/><br/>Since I sent in the briefing which members may have seen, there has been a call from community leaders for a greater international presence.  Many of our eyewitnesses and EAs are there and call for a constant, overnight international presence to provide that protective presence to the villagers.  I want to read a quote from one of the EAs who is currently in the village.  She said:</p><blockquote>One woman told us that the perpetual uncertainty means we are just cooking, cleaning and eating, rather than making long-term plans or improvements to homes.  In the approach to the wedding season the lack of such plans is really notable.  Meanwhile the people are watched by drones.  The schoolteachers reported a dramatic fall in school results.  Mothers tell us their children wet the bed and jump every time a new vehicle arrives.</blockquote> <p>With regard to UNRWA funding, 95% of the residents of Khan al-Ahmar are already refugees from the Negev.  Should the demolitions go ahead, they will end up relying on the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, which, thankfully, is known by the shorter moniker of UNRWA.  As the committee is probably aware, the United States recently ended all funding to UNRWA, cuts which the organisation's commissioner-general has described as an &ldquo;existential threat&rdquo;.  In fact, since sending this presentation to the committee last week, further cuts have been announced by the American regime, including &euro;25 million in cuts to Palestinian hospitals in East Jerusalem and &euro;10 million in cuts to NGOs supporting peace building work on the ground.  There has been a general de-funding of any work in the region to try to promote peace and justice and to try to alleviate the suffering that exists.<br/><br/>During my time in Bethlehem I was close to Aida refugee camp and spent a lot of time there.  Aida is one of several refugee camps in the Bethlehem area and is home to approximately 3,150 refugees who live in dense, cramped and poor conditions, and where poverty and unemployment are high.  It is right next to the separation barrier and a military base, and there are frequent clashes.  When one walks around in the morning, the smell of tear gas and the lingering smell of &quot;Skunk&quot; water are never far away because the camp is regularly choked with tear gas or Skunk water.  Against this difficult background, UNRWA provides education and psycho-social support for children in the camp, food support for families and health services.  Access to education is a difficulty for Palestinian children at the best of times and is something that is worked on by EAPPI and UNICEF.  To lose the funding for schools will have a huge impact.  Alongside this, some 30,000 Palestinian doctors, nurses, teachers and other staff are employed by UNRWA but now face unemployment and, therefore, the prospect of poverty.  In Gaza, the unemployment rate is close to 44% and this will increase further should UNRWA collapse.<br/><br/>The US cuts represent an attempt to undermine the international legal consensus on the protected status of Palestine refugees and, so, are ultimately an attempt to undermine international law.  These cuts threaten what stability currently exists in the region.  There is a growing sense of despair and nihilism among Palestinians that will only fuel the frustration and desperation they feel, and potentially feed into violence and extremism.</p><p>The UNRWA Commissioner-General stated in an open letter to Palestine refugees and UNRWA staff published on 1 September:</p><blockquote>The responsibility for the protracted nature of the Palestine refugee-hood, the growing number of refugees and the growth in needs, lies squarely with the parties and in the international community&rsquo;s lack of will or utter inability to bring about a negotiated and peaceful resolution of the conflict between Israel and Palestine. The attempt to make UNRWA somehow responsible for perpetuating the crisis is disingenuous at best. </blockquote></speech>

However, little has changed.  In the face of these threats, words are no longer enough.  Therefore, we call on the Government to act.  We respectfully request the committee to endorse the following recommendations and press the Government to commit to them: the immediate recognition of the state of Palestine as a simple, yet significant, step towards a two-state solution; pressing for compensation for the demolition of EU-funded aid structures by Israel and systematically demanding compensation every time a structure is demolished; provide increased Government funding directly to UNRWA and for peace-building work in the region; the Government to advocate at EU level for increased funding for UNRWA from the European Union; ending the arms trade with Israel and Government procurement from Israel and dual-use exports; pushing for a review of the Gaza reconstruction mechanism and ensuring we recognise Israel&rsquo;s primary responsibility for closures.  I know that many members have been to Palestine, but for those who have not, I respectfully request that they consider any opportunity to go and see the position for themselves.</p></speech>

It is important to acknowledge the work EAAPI does in difficult circumstances and also the work of the Israeli NGOs, in particular, as they face even more difficult circumstances because of what they are trying to achieve in their country.  The position is intolerable for the Bedouin community.  Forcible transfer is illegal and, in the bigger picture, also immoral.  It is also making a two-state solution impossible.</p> <p>  There has been very good diplomatic pressure from the various embassies in ensuring there are delays in court decisions.  That diplomatic pressure has also worked in a number of other situations.  It is up to the Government to act.  Exactly as the delegates were saying, it is up to politicians and governments to be strong in their statements.</p> <p>  I have seen the Bedouin camps and we should not lose sight of the appalling conditions in which the occupants live.  Forcible transfer is completely and utterly wrong and to be condemned.  We have to look at the living conditions of the Bedouin who deserve better treatment across the board. </p> <p>  I had the opportunity to meet the Palestinian community in Damascus and observe the work of UNWRA on the ground and the opportunities it is giving to the Palestinian people.  Some members of the group I was with had an opportunity to go into the camps in Beirut and the conditions in them were appalling.  Conditions for Palestinians in Damascus were far superior.  I have been to the Aida camp several times.  There is great resilience and hope, as well as a great drive to get on with life that can also be seen in Ramallah and Nablus.  It is important to highlight that, in spite of all the doom and gloom and negativity, the Palestinian people are amazing in the way they get on with what they have to do.  The onus is on us to try to work at the political level to halt the demolitions.  It all comes back to the need for a two-state solution, to which so much lip service is being paid.  When I go there and see the continuing encroachment and settlement building, I ask how there could possibly be a two-state solution.</p></speech>

What I am hearing from the ground is that their lives are limited.  There is even a concern in Khan al-Ahmar about going to shepherd in other areas.  They cannot wander off but have to stay put because of the threat.  That is having a big impact.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.1463" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018092000002#F00500"><p>Within the village there is a school which is referred to as the tyre school as the walls have been built with reused tyres.  It provides an education, not just for children in the village but also for children from a lot of Bedouin communities in the wider area.  If it is demolished, the lives of the Bedouin will be made even more difficult.  I agree with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on these points.  As she said, it is important to make strong statements on the issue.  We are hearing a lot of strong statements, including from the T&aacute;naiste.  However, it is time for action.  Our first ask is for recognition of the state of Palestine.  The power to do this is entirely in the T&aacute;naiste's wrist.  He could do it tomorrow if he wanted to do so.  We need to move beyond statements to action.</p></speech>

The delegates will be aware that I visited Palestine in June with my colleague Deputy Billy Kelleher and a member of our research team.  It was a hugely informative visit for me because it was my first time to visit it.  I concur with everything the delegates have said.  I agree wholeheartedly that all we are getting is lip service.  In particular, the European Union is greatly remiss.  I do not detect any real anywhere in the European Union to deal with the issue.  There was the pre-emptive move in the relocation of the American embassy.  In the last couple of days I believe the PLO office in Washington has been closed or put on notice.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Having seen it, the West Bank is now so fragmented because of the continued proliferation of settlements that I cannot see how a two-state solution is to be achieved.  Is it literally a pipe dream that will never be realised?  I agree with everything the delegates are saying and believe we have to support the requests they have made.  I also agree with what they are saying about the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, who has made a lot of strong statements which now need to be acted on.</p></speech>

As Ms O'Connor said, being there can be eye-opening.  I hope the Deputy will encourage others to go also.  </p> <p>  Some commentators have said this is a challenge to the relevance of the European Union on the world stage.  If it can talk but cannot follow through, what is the point of the European External Action Service?  That problem is exemplified best when Israel demolishes schools and buildings that have been paid for by the European Union.  The European Union should seek compensation each time this happens, as we have stated.</p><p>Ultimately, the EU is fragmented on this issue, so the focus can also be on what we can do.  There are things that the Government can do without needing to wait for Europe.  We would encourage it to do so while also fighting the good fight in Europe.</p></speech>

I also apologise for arriving late.  I was at another function.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  I am familiar with the work that the EAPPI does.  Former students of mine and friends have been out with the EAPPI on different programmes.  I commend it on its important work and for bearing witness to what is happening in Palestine.  It was distressing to hear the witnesses' update and frustrating for all of us.  For years, many of us have raised the issue of the illegality of Israeli settlements as well as the immoral and illegal nature of the demolition of properties and infrastructure in Palestine that, as stated, had been built with EU money.  The EU and other international donors have to pay for their reconstruction.</p> <p>  I echo what others have said and support the requests made by the witnesses.  Through the Acting Chairman, I ask that our committee write to the T&aacute;naiste to express our support for those requests.  The Oireachtas has called for recognition of the state of Palestine, so we may press that matter again.  It is something that the T&aacute;naiste should do without delay.</p> <p>  I wish to ask a specific question.  The witnesses are correct about the relevance of the EU in this, but the EU is not a monolith.  Is there any glimmer of hope that there may be some EU institution or mechanism through which we as a committee could press on the issue of compensation?  That seems to be an area where a softer approach could be taken than would be the case with some of the other requests and, therefore, could be easier to bring about.  What mechanism specifically is the EAPPI calling on to seek compensation?  Is it looking to the European Court of Justice or the European Commission?  How do we as an Oireachtas committee put pressure on whatever the relevant institution is?  The European Parliament has spoken on this matter previously, but on what executive institution can we put pressure?</p></speech>

The European Parliament has been strong on this issue.  The parliamentary delegation for Palestine visited Khan al-Ahmar in the past few days.  Liaising with the delegation on putting pressure on the EEAS would be the most practical way to go about that.</p></speech>

It is important to realise the valuable and courageous work on Palestine that the EAPPI carries out and the major difference that it is making by reporting to and telling the world what is happening.</p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in is acutely aware of the urgent situation facing the residents of Khan al-Ahmar.  It is clear that the destruction of the village and the forcible transfer of its population constitutes a war crime.  Due to the village's strategic location, its destruction is also a major threat to a two-state solution.  My colleague, Deputy Crowe, has repeatedly raised this issue with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  While the Minister has been outspoken on the issue, to date we have seen no action from Ireland or the EU to stop this war crime and major threat to the two-state solution.</p> <p>  I have been informed that Israel's Supreme Court judgment on the demolition did not order it, but merely permitted it.  The decision, therefore, lies entirely with the Israeli Government.  This underlines the importance of international pressure to affect the government's calculus at this moment.</p> <p>  What type of action is needed to ensure this war crime does not happen?  If Israel proceeds to commit it, Ireland should push for the EU to suspend the EU-Israel association agreement.  Would the EAPPI agree with that?</p> <p>  According to the EU's recently issued six-month report on Israeli demolitions, 26 EU-funded structures worth &euro;60,900 have been destroyed or confiscated by Israel.  To echo Senator Bacik's question, would the EAPPI support a demand for compensation?  Such a demand should be forthcoming from the EU.</p> <p>  I have a number of other questions, but if the Acting Chairman prefers to take questions in rounds, I would be happy to wait and do whatever supports that.</p></speech>

We are conscious of the 5 million Palestinian refugees that it supports.  The USA's decision was disgraceful.  The witnesses have outlined clearly how drastically the cuts will affect the communities with which they work.  We support the EAPPI's call for Ireland and the EU to increase their funding to UNRWA.  We will raise this issue with the Minister.</p> <p>  Does the EAPPI have volunteers working in Gaza?  Israel's continuing illegal blockade of Gaza is another crime that must be punished by the international community, including Ireland.  A report by the UN detailed exactly how living conditions in Gaza had significantly worsened in the ten years since the territory was blockaded by Israel.  Due to the repeated military attacks on the densely populated strip of land, it is believed that Gaza will effectively be unlivable by 2020.  It is incredible that the world continues to stand by and allow this to happen.  Should Ireland do more to help Palestinians living in Gaza?</p> <p>  The witnesses will be well aware of Senator Black's occupied territories Bill and the call to recognise the state of Palestine.  The EAPPI has been clear on that call and has supported it.  Would the EAPPI support the Bill?  We view it as an incredibly significant Bill, but it is important that the committee hear the EAPPI's position on same.  The Palestinian President is visiting Ireland this weekend.  Would it not be an opportune time for the Taoiseach to recognise the state of Palestine?</p> <p>  This week, 25 civil society organisations and coalitions, including Tr&oacute;caire, wrote to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, ICC, asking to have an investigation opened into the situation in Palestine.  The situation is rapidly deteriorating and war crimes and crimes against humanity are frequently being committed to entrench Israeli control over Palestinian territory and the Palestinian people, yet Israel continues to act with impunity.  The ICC is the only viable independent judicial body capable of ending impunity for crimes committed in the occupied Palestinian territory and deterring the commission of future crimes.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports this call and believes that the ICC must immediately open an investigation.  Is this something that the EAPPI would also support?</p></speech>

His questions were comprehensive, so he will excuse me if I just jump in.</p> <p>  Regarding the occupied territories Bill, the World Council of Churches, which runs the EAPPI programme internationally, has stated that it encourages and accompanies Palestinian people and communities, member churches and partners throughout the world in their efforts to resist occupation, including through economic measures such as divestment from companies that profit from the occupation or produce goods in illegal settlements in occupied territories.  Such actions seek to advance the cause of peace and justice in Israel and Palestine through active non-violent means using criteria rooted in faith.  Accordingly, we believe that passing a Bill like the one in question would be a good measure for our Government to take.</p> <p>  There is concern about the international presence, given this week's withdrawal of more funding for NGOs.</p><p>In Khan al-Ahmar a number of containers were installed in the past few weeks so internationals could come and be accommodated to be present as a protective presence.  They have been confiscated already by the Israeli military.  Only yesterday, our programme sought to put in an overnight protective presence to keep the presence of internationals.  The local population sees this presence of internationals as vital and it looks as if that is now a concern.</p></speech>

We do not have volunteers in Gaza.  We had tried that in the past but entry into Gaza is tightly controlled by the Israeli Government so it just has not been possible.  We would love to get into Gaza and provide support there.  A variety of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, do great work on the ground in Gaza and I can provide a link to those for the committee if members are interested.  Unfortunately, despite wanting to get into Gaza, we cannot do it.  Again, it is reflective of the occupation, control and siege of Gaza.</p> <p>  With regard to the International Criminal Court, international law is the main underpinning of our programme.  We base ourselves, our reports, decisions and actions on international humanitarian law.  The institutions of international law such as the International Criminal Court are central to that and they need to be supported and allowed to work.  We have also seen attempts to attack and undermine these by Mr. John Bolton, as well as cuts to funding and the unilateral actions by the United States that were mentioned earlier.  We fully support the ICC.</p></speech>

I visited Ramallah two years ago and one can see the daily reality of the oppression of the Palestinian people and apartheid in practice, along with its devastating consequences.  It changes observers forever.  I am thinking of Deputy Collins's comments about his visit.  It is so important and the more people who can see first-hand what is happening in occupied Palestine, the more likely we are to move from words to action from our Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.1484" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1299" speakername="Gino Kenny" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2018092000002#H00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  Any observer of what is happening in Palestine would probably be pretty depressed about and despairing of the position.  It has been an <i>annus horribilis</i>for the Palestinian people, as it is every year.  This year in particular has been absolutely horrendous, with 200 people having been murdered by the Israeli armed forces on the border in Gaza and the recognition of Jerusalem for the Israeli state.  There is a toxic mix of Netanyahu, Trump and Bolton, out and out racists who want to humiliate the Palestinian people on a daily basis.  I was there 20 years ago and I was struck by the artifice and out and out racism of Israel.  One must go there to experience it and see it on a daily basis.</p><p>This comes down to appeasing racism and apartheid, and this is what the European Union does.  As T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney does not have the stomach for this.  He pays lip service to a two-state solution and he kind of condemns the Israeli state but in reality he does not do anything.  For example, the Bill from Senator Black makes sense, as it means an occupier cannot trade with partners.  Although it is extremely limited, the Government will not support the Bill, and that action is absolutely gutless.  In the past ten years, Ireland has imported dual-use arms worth more than &euro;11 million from Israel for the Irish Army.  If Israel is a state that is reckless and racist, why would we buy arms from it?  There is daily humiliation of the Palestinian people.</p><p>There is hope and the boycott, divestment and sanctions, BDS, campaign has gained momentum over the past two or three years.  It is the solidarity of others and such small things that will give the Palestinian people hope.  The constant appeasement by the European Union and Ireland is adding fuel to the fire, propagating the idea that Israel is just a normal state in the Middle East.  It is not a normal state.  It is a racist and apartheid state, and once the EU and this country recognises that, things might change in the Middle East.  I do not know if the witnesses wish to comment on the small things that add to the bigger argument.  The Eurovision song contest will be in Jerusalem next year and this country should not send any artist to the competition.  We should send a statement from Ireland to say we are boycotting this because of the continuing occupation of Palestine.</p></speech>

Israel has favoured trade status with the European Union through the Euro-Mediterranean association agreements and witnesses may be aware there have been loud calls from those who support the plight of the Palestinians that the agreement should be suspended because of the systematic breaches of human rights and international law by Israel in terms of its treatment of Palestinians.  That is whether it is the collective punishment of the siege, the recognition of Jerusalem or, as was highlighted with the "Great March of Return", the denial of the right to return, which is a right afforded under international law.  As the witnesses have highlighted, there is also the destruction of works funded by the European Union on Palestinian territory.  Do the witnesses echo the call of all of those things and more?  Large numbers of young people are held in administrative detention.  We can go through an endless list that includes the demolition of Palestinian homes and the illegal annexation of Palestinian territory.  At what point will Europe say that this is not unacceptable and we will not continue giving Israel effective associate membership of the European Union?  It is absolutely extraordinary.  I am keen for the witnesses to comment on that.</p> <p>  I mentioned the Great March of Return and its significance.  It was a tremendously brave, heroic and peaceful protest that tried to vindicate a right under international law that Israel would rather everybody forget.  It likes to cast this as an intractable conflict between Jews and Arabs when it is not.  What should we say about the right to return, as it is a line for me that should not be crossed?  It is an international right and there is no solution for the Palestinians.  I was just in Beirut visiting Palestinian refugee camps and I have been to the West Bank.  The conditions for Palestinian refugees in Beirut are worse than they are in the occupied territories.  They are horrendous and the idea that there is any solution that leaves them out in the cold and does not give them or millions of other Palestinians imprisoned in refugee camps outside Palestine a right to return is unacceptable.  What do the witnesses think of that?</p> <p>  The Israeli siege of Gaza is shocking and obscene.  As a result, humanitarian conditions in Gaza are beyond belief.</p><p>At the centre of justifying that siege has been the refusal of the Israelis and the European Union to recognise certain political forces that were democratically elected.  What does Mr. Costello think of the effective boycott of certain Palestinian factions which have a democratic mandate in Gaza?  Whatever we may think of those political forces should we not acknowledge their democratic mandate and call Israel out on that?  It cannot justify this siege on the basis that it is trying to because, apart from the humanitarian horrors it is producing in Gaza, it flies in the face of democracy.</p></speech>

The only people who can choose to give that up are the refugees and it cannot be negotiated away by the Palestinian Authority or the Israeli government.  Given that our position is that international law should be paramount, we fully support the refugees' right of return because that is enshrined in international law.</p> <p>  In the context of Gaza, the behaviour of the Israeli Government in the siege is in breach of international law.  The Gaza reconstruction mechanism set up after the most recent conflict in Gaza has shown itself to be ineffective and incompatible with international human rights law and obligations.  International law is paramount and the siege should be ended.  We should be looking for a peaceful resolution.  That is the fundamental point.  There is no justification for the way that people living in Gaza are treated.</p> <p>  In response to the question on the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement,  our focus has been on trade from the illegal settlements in occupied Palestine because they are what is illegal under international law.  I am not sure that we have a formal policy on the agreement.  I can follow up with the Deputy on that afterwards.</p></speech>

This year we are seeking to ratify a particularly important international agreement that seeks to modify the application of existing double tax agreements to ensure that they are robust and in line with evolving Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, base erosion and profit-shifting, BEPS, best practice.  In this regard, I am pleased to bring before the committee on behalf of the Minister of Finance, Deputy Donohoe, a draft Government order as part of the ratification process for the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting.  In addition, I am presenting to the committee a draft order to implement a new double taxation relief agreement with the Republic of Ghana.</p> <p>  Earlier this month, the Minister published Ireland's corporation tax roadmap, which takes stock of the changing international tax environment, outlines the actions we have taken to date and the additional actions that will be taken in the coming months and years.  Among those actions is our commitment to implement the OECD's BEPS recommendations and the other international agreements into which we have entered.  The BEPS multilateral convention seeks to implement all of the BEPS recommendations that relate to bilateral double tax agreements.  Ireland has 74 double taxation agreements in place at present.  With the exception of this agreement with Ghana, they are currently in effect.  Our double taxation agreement network is an important aspect of our competitiveness in attracting investment and facilitating Irish business in operating internationally.  In addition, double tax agreements are a cornerstone of Ireland's trade policy and are a key element in stimulating trade and investment flows between countries.  The benefits of double taxation agreements are well known.  They facilitate trade and investment, provide greater predictability and fairness for taxpayers regarding their tax obligations in foreign jurisdictions and they are key to the prevention of double taxation.  </p> <p>  As part of the OECD's BEPS process, concerns were identified as to how double taxation agreements could potentially facilitate double non-taxation.  The BEPS recommendations that were published in October 2015 include a number of recommendations for amendments.  The double tax agreements ensure that they cannot be used for aggressive tax planning arrangements.  There are approximately 3,000 double tax agreements in existence worldwide.  It was acknowledged as part of the BEPS initiative that it would be impractical to update all of those double tax agreements through bilateral negotiations.  It was agreed that a multilateral convention would provide the most appropriate and timely methods for countries to update their existing double tax agreements.  In November 2016, over 100 jurisdictions concluded negotiations on the BEPS multilateral convention.  Ireland was among the first signatures of this important international agreement in a ceremony in Paris in June 2017.  Upon coming into force, it is expected that the majority of Ireland's double tax agreements will be modified by the BEPS multilateral convention, with the exception of those countries with which we have agreed to update our agreement bilaterally.  Our existing double tax agreements with the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany will be updated bilaterally, and some other jurisdictions with which we have double taxation agreements may request a similar approach because of restrictions in their own domestic law.  As for those partner countries that have not yet signed the BEPS multilateral convention, Ireland has written to them to discuss options for implementing the BEPS recommendations.  We are committed to ensuring that all of our treaties meet the minimum standards agreed in the BEPS process.</p> <p>  In adopting the BEPS multilateral convention countries have choices as to which BEPS measures to adopt.  As an active contributor to the BEPS initiative, it is proposed that Ireland will adopt the majority of the choices contained in the multilateral convention.  While some of the articles are minimum standards and thus compulsory for all signatories, Ireland has also chosen to adopt a number of additional optional best practice measures.  The approach that Ireland is taking to the various options is the same as the provisional approach published when the convention was signed last year.  The key provision in the convention is for countries to include a general anti-avoidance clause in their tax treaties.  Ireland proposes to select a principal purposes test, which requires activity to be in a country for legitimate purposes in order to access the benefits of the country's tax treaties.  It is expected that all countries signing up to the BEPS multilateral convention will select this provision.</p> <p>  Ireland is also opting to allow for double taxation agreement disputes to be subject to binding arbitration where tax authorities cannot reach agreement.  This will be welcomed by businesses as it should minimise the cases where double taxation arises.  Most of the options in the convention which Ireland is not proposing to adopt are primarily technical in nature and not relevant to Ireland's tax systems.</p><p>I would draw the committee's attention, in particular, to the position in respect of permanent establishment rules which were dealt with by Articles 12 to 15, inclusive, of the multilateral convention.  The permanent establishment test determines how much activity a company must have in a country before it must pay corporation tax.  Ireland will opt in to the new anti-avoidance rules in Articles 13 to 15, inclusive, to stop businesses engaging in artificial behaviour to avoid having a taxable presence in a country.</p><p> However, Ireland will reserve its position in respect of Article 12 of the multilateral convention.  Article 12 operates a new test for permanent establishment when a company is operating in a country through an agent.  We believe there is not yet sufficient certainty as to how the new rules in Article 12 would be interpreted and applied and our caution is shared by a majority of countries which have signed the multilateral convention.  This caution is reflected by the fact that it is expected that only 17% of the double tax agreements that are amended by the multilateral convention will include Article 12.  We are committed to keeping the position under review, however, as it would be possible for Ireland to opt in to this article at a later date post ratification subject to governmental approval and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approval should sufficient clarity be reached to its operation.  It would also be possible to include this article in double taxation agreements bilaterally should a treaty partner seek to include it in future negotiations and make a strong case in negotiations.</p><p> Today, the committee's approval is also sought for an order as part of the ratification of a double taxation agreement with Ghana.  In 2012, officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Ghana raised with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade the possibility of negotiating a double tax agreement with Ireland.  Negotiations on the double taxation agreement with the Republic of Ghana, which started in 2014, were successfully concluded in 2016.</p><p> Ireland's bilateral trade with Ghana continues to grow.  For example, in 2016, Ireland's merchandised trade with Ghana was worth &euro;43.4 million.  Ghana is the sixth largest market in Africa for Irish food and drink exports.  A number of companies, such as Guinness, Tullow Oil and ESB International operate there.  The double tax agreement will help to deepen our economic links with Ghana, which is forecast to be among the world's fastest growing economies in 2018.</p><p> The double taxation agreement with Ghana is comprehensive in scope and generally follows the OECD and UN model conventions.  It is worth noting that this double taxation agreement contains a number of provisions from the UN model convention that benefit Ghana as a developing country.  For example, Ireland agreed to the inclusion of the imposition of withholding tax on technical fees as a UN model provision at the request of Ghana even though it is not normally part of our double taxation agreement policy.  In addition, to encourage the development of education in Ghana, there is a two-year tax exemption for teachers, professors and researchers who work in universities, research institutes or other higher education establishments in Ghana.</p><p> If D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the taking of these orders, the Minister for Finance will include the orders in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by way of an amendment in the upcoming finance Bill.  This will enable Ireland to complete the necessary notifications to finalise the ratifications on both agreements.</p><p> I commend these draft orders to the committee.  If required, I will be happy to answer whatever questions members may have.</p></speech>

Why does the new Ireland-Ghana tax treaty contain none of the provisions against treaty abuse agreed in 2015 by the OECD member states, including Ireland, which Ireland has committed to implementing?</p> <p>  In 2017, the finance ministry promised that Ireland would invite tax treaty partners that have not signed the OECD multilateral instrument to introduce anti-abuse measures unilaterally in their tax treaties with Ireland.  Did the Government make such an offer to Ghana?  If so, why did Ghana decline this offer?  If not, why?</p> <p>  What assessment has the Department or Revenue made on the likely spillover effects of the new Ireland-Ghana tax treaty on Ghana's taxing rights and tax revenues in line with the 2015 spillover exercise?</p> <p>  Was the most favoured nation clause in the protocol to the treaty committing Ghana to lowering withholding tax rates for Ireland to match any subsequent rate reductions agreed with future treaty partners included at Ireland's or Ghana's request?</p> <p>  Why does the treaty not permit Ghana to tax capital gains from sales of shares in Irish holding companies deriving their value from moveable assets in Ghana as both the UN tax committee and the IMF have recommended?</p> <p>  Ministers have told the Oireachtas that double tax treaties are beneficial to all sides because they facilitate trade and investment, and yet internal papers that Irish officials prepared in 2012 for cross-Government discussions of the Ghana and Botswana tax treaty negotiations released recently under the freedom of information, FOI, laws admit that when treaties are concluded with developing countries, there is little clear evidence about whether tax treaties boost investment at all, stating that recent empirical literature has been inconclusive in estimating the effect of double tax agreements on the foreign direct investment, FDI, of developing countries.  What does the Government think about this contradiction?  Will the Minister of State inform us on that point.</p> <p>  Those same internal Government papers also state that tax treaties based on the OECD model which Ireland favours cause capital flows from developing to developed nations and that such treaties allow taxpayers to channel money between jurisdictions to minimise tax payable, particularly if withholding taxes are minimised to encourage investment, a practice which would clearly not be encouraged in relation to developing nations, and yet the new Ireland-Ghana halves Ghanaian withholding taxes on technical service fees and royalties.  Why were these international development concerns apparently ignored during the treaty negotiations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.1500" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018092000002#B00300"><p>The treaties are bilaterally agreed between two countries negotiating on equal footing.  We seek to find the best deal that works for both parties and that has been consistent over the 74 tax treaties that we have to date.  Each country is best placed to decide whether a treaty makes sense for it and what works best in its interest in a treaty.</p> <p>  Negotiations on the double taxation agreement with Ghana concluded before Ireland or Ghana's policy positions on measures contained in the multilateral convention had been finalised.  As I stated, this started in 2014 and concluded in 2016.  As a result, the signed double taxation agreement does not have the anti-base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, measures contained in the multilateral convention.  Ghana had not yet signed the multilateral convention.  If it signs and ratifies it, the multilateral convention will modify the application of the existing double taxation agreement to bring it in line with the BEPS standards without any further action from Ireland being necessary.  In addition, Ireland has contacted Ghana's competent authorities proposing a bilateral protocol to the double taxation agreement in case that is Ghana's preferred way to implement the anti-BEPS measures.  If Ghana does not implement the multilateral convention, it can be done bilaterally between Ireland and Ghana.</p> <p>  All options are discussed and the final agreed treaty will have more or less the same UN-type provisions depending on what has been proposed by Ireland's treaty partners and the overall balance of the treaty itself.  This may explain why treaties concluded with developing countries and within the same broad timescale often vary in the amount and type of UN provisions contained therein.  A related factor is the treaty policy in the partner country.  For example, Ireland's treaty with Ethiopia which was ratified in the Finance Act 2015 includes a provision on tax sparing which is a general feature of Ethiopia's tax treaty base and something that is found in most of that country's treaties, whereas a treaty with another developing country, Botswana, ratified in the previous year did not have a tax sparing provision.  The treaty with Ghana before the committee today does not contain this provision either.</p><p>It is similar to Botswana but it is different from Ethiopia.  I am trying to go through these as best I can for the Deputy.  He has put a fairly substantial number of questions to me.</p><p> As to the Department's revenue spillover in 2015, there was a spillover analysis concluded in relation to this treaty, which was carried out before the treaty.  The Department and the Revenue Commissioners were satisfied that there was not a significant spillover in relation to that.  In the negotiations between both countries, there was not a request for favoured nation status.  Both parties were satisfied to put it in as a favoured nation.</p></speech>

Double taxation agreements benefit trade and investment.  This is our 74th agreement.  There are 3,000 in total between countries.  If one looks at our EU partners, Germany has more than 100 while the UK has 130 double taxation agreements.  Double taxation of companies is not a good thing.  It damages business and the objective is to try to encourage business between countries and give companies opportunities to go to a country, trade and have a double taxation agreement so that it is able to pay tax in a single jurisdiction if it chooses to do so, meeting of course, the requirements of the double taxation treaty.  I am satisfied that the double taxation treaties are good.  They benefit developing countries, and they benefit companies which have the opportunity, and which choose to enter those jurisdictions and participate.</p> <p>  Nobody forces a country into doing a tax treaty with Ireland.  Ghana approached Ireland in relation to this.  Ireland's treaties with developing countries generally include provisions based on the UN model treaty, which is designed for the developing countries.  This can be seen from double taxation agreement, DTA, that is before the committee today.  From a developing country's perspective, our DTA with Ghana is fair and allows for withholding tax on royalties and technical fees in accordance with the UN model, which it requested.</p> <p>  What was the Deputy's question about the OECD model in relation to capital flows?</p></speech>

Ireland has been on the record for quite some time that we believe it should be dealt with through the OECD process, through the BEPS process, and this is a really important aspect of it.  We cannot force any country to pass this multi-lateral convention.  We can pass ours.  Then, if countries are not minded to conclude the multi-lateral convention then we will go back to them individually to try to ensure that we do a bilateral agreement.</p></speech>

I just need clarification from the Minister that during the course of the negotiations that, despite the fact our signing of that pre-dated this agreement, this issue was raised, that there is a commitment on the part of Ghana to commit to this and that there is an acknowledgement that the agreement will be modified as soon as it does.</p></speech>

I am always wary when a Minister or Minister of State tells me not to worry about things because they are rather technical.  In this case, we are being told that the opt-out from Article 12 and the choice of option B in Article 13 are not too much to worry about.  From my reading of them, they are more than just technicalities.  I do not know as much about this subject as the Minister of State does, but it seems to me that the measures in question will allow companies to avoid permanent establishment status artificially, or facilitate them in so doing, which is one of the biggest problems in this area.  In light of the presence of the opt-out and the option I have mentioned, my party is of the view that this proposal requires much greater scrutiny.  We would much prefer an open D&aacute;il debate about these elements of the matter.  I ask the Minister of State to consider that.</p> <p>  The taxation agreement with Ghana could end up sounding terribly technical and inconsequential, so it is important to take a step back and remind ourselves why the questions that have been asked by Deputy Cowen are so important.  For every &euro;1 in international overseas development aid that is given to countries in the developing world, approximately &euro;2 is lost as a result of corporate tax avoidance.  These bilateral tax agreements are crucial not only for our own tax affairs and the interests of companies operating here, but also as we reflect on whether we are meeting our obligations to countries in the developing world and whether we are ensuring companies are not abusing tax rules to deny countries like Ghana the vital revenues they need to tackle some of the issues raised by Deputy Cowen.</p> <p>  A range of non-governmental organisations, including Christian Aid and Concern, have continually said that we have a responsibility in this area.  They have reminded us that if we enter into these negotiations without having an eye to the needs of countries in the developing world in addition to our own interests, we will be guilty of driving the getaway car, to adopt a phrase used in a report compiled by some of the organisations in question a few years ago.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the report, which was written by Dr. Sheila Killian.  I am not satisfied with the Minister of State's answers.  The Government of Ghana might not have raised some of the very legitimate concerns that have been highlighted by Deputy Cowen, but that is not a reason for us not to press them.  We have an international obligation to do right by the people of these countries, particularly with regard to certain anti-abuse measures.  While some countries might not have signed up to the convention, the Government has already said on the record that it will seek to have the measures in question included in bilateral treaties with those countries.  As far as I understand it, those measures are not included in the agreement we are considering.</p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in cannot support this motion.  As I have said regarding the first part of it, we think the scale of this matter is so important that it should be the subject of a full D&aacute;il debate.  This is not just a technicality.  It affects the quality of life of huge numbers of people.  We have a responsibility to do right by the developing world.  I will not press the issue of a D&aacute;il debate on the first motion, although I think it would be helpful.  We will certainly not be supporting the second part of the motion.  In light of the serious issues that have been raised by Deputy Cowen and me - I am sure Deputy Mick Barry intends to raise similar issues - I urge the Minister of State to consider the suggestion that this issue should be debated and decided on by the D&aacute;il as a whole, rather than by this select committee.</p></speech>

It has to be said that not every company was doing these things.  We moved before anybody else did.  We moved before we were obliged to move because we felt it was the right thing to do.  Ireland takes very seriously its responsibility to prevent these activities and to help developing countries.  Ireland was a developing country, in terms of our GDP ratios, 40 or 50 years ago.  Our average EU ratio was significantly under the EU spend.  In a European space and in European terms, we have benefitted from our European partners benefitting us via the EU.  This multilateral convention is doing the same thing.  It will ensure companies that are unscrupulously trying to avoid tax will not be allowed to get away with it.  That is what this is about.</p> <p>  I said clearly in my opening remarks that this is a way of updating 3,000 international treaties in one fell swoop.  We cannot make the countries that have not ratified the convention do so but, as we have said, we have a responsibility to go to those countries to update the treaties bilaterally.  I expect that approximately 100 countries, or half the countries on the planet, are involved in the multilateral convention.  I reiterate that we cannot make countries do this.  Different jurisdictions move at different paces.  We have said that we take our responsibilities very seriously.  If we have to, we will go to the various countries one by one to adopt the treaties bilaterally.  We feel this is a better way of doing it.  As I have said, eight or nine of these processes have been finished.  We expect, or hope, to finish our process sooner rather than later.  This will ensure companies that are unscrupulously avoiding tax and thereby taking resources from people in other jurisdictions who need them most - I am not just talking about Ghana - do not get away with it.</p></speech>

He suggested that countries will have the ability to opt in or out of certain provisions.  When he spoke about why we might opt out of certain provisions or make certain choices, he said that the options we are not adopting "are primarily technical in nature and not relevant to Ireland's tax systems".  If Article 12, for example, is not relevant to Ireland's tax system, why not adopt it?  It seems to me that it is not being adopted for some other reason, perhaps because there are concerns arising from it.  The same point can be made about option B in Article 13.  From our point of view, if we wanted to demonstrate that we are serious about the multilateral instrument, we would not simply accept minimum standards - we would accept the maximum standards in all cases, particularly when they affect us.</p> <p>  Perhaps the Minister of State missed the point I was trying to make about the bilateral agreement.  It is obvious that it is much better to try to do this by means of multilateral agreements.  The Government has said on the record that where multilateral agreements do not apply, and we are engaged in bilateral agreements, it will pursue a range of commitments to try to insert provisions which are about protecting our interests while doing the right thing for the people of the developing world.  Christian Aid and other agencies have raised concerns.  Deputy Cowen has also raised concerns.  It seems to me that we are doing the same thing we did before by adopting relatively minimal aspects of these treaties in a primarily self-interested manner.  As a result, we are perpetuating the problems that are contained in these treaties, as all of the non-governmental organisations in the developing world have told us.  We will not be the losers in this scenario - the losers will be the vast majority of the citizens of Ghana and other countries who will be deprived of revenue.  I am not going to press the matter.  I do not think the Minister of State's answer has satisfactorily responded to the questions other Deputies have raised.  We cannot support the motion for that reason.</p></speech>

I did not say in my speech that it was.  I said that we chose to opt out of it because we do not know how it will work.  The multilateral convention is a legally binding convention.  One does not get to choose to opt out of it.  We are satisfied that if it works properly, we can opt into it.  That is why we are choosing not to accept Article 12 right now.  Many other countries are doing likewise.  There is some confusion in this regard.  We do not know how it will establish itself.  We do not know how it will work.</p> <p>  It might be helpful for me to read the note on Article 12, which is an important aspect of this matter.  Article 12, which deals with so-called dependent agents, provides that an enterprise of one country "shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment" in the other country if it operates through a dependent agent, that is, a person or entity that acts under clear instruction of a head office in the first country.  The current permanent establishment standard was creating concerns for civil law countries that are bound by law to interpret the texts strictly.  There was concern about particular structures being set up to avoid having a taxable presence in large market countries.  It is generally expected that other BEPS recommendations being introduced into domestic law should put an end to these structures, regardless of whether Article 12 is adopted by countries.  Some guidance has been reached at the OECD on the level of profits that would be attributed to new permanent establishments created under Article 12.</p><p>However, there is still significant uncertainty as to how the test will be applied in practice.  Reflecting this concern, approximately 60% of the countries that have signed the multilateral convention to date have indicated that they will not accept Article 12.  Of the 74 countries with which Ireland has a tax treaty, only 24 have indicated that they wish to adopt Article 12.  Based on the most recent OECD information available, it appears that only 17% of treaties around the world that will be impacted by the multilateral convention will be updated to include the definitions of Article 12.  It is intended that Ireland will opt not to apply this article due to this uncertainty.  However, this position will be kept under review as it is open to Ireland to lift our reservation on this article at a future date.  It would also be open to Ireland to bilaterally agree to include this article in any of our tax treaties, should treaty partner countries make a sufficiently strong case to include it.  As I stated, very few countries are choosing to accept this article as part of the multilateral convention but we will, on a case-by-case basis and equal negotiating footing, go back to all other countries with which we have a double taxation agreement and if it is appropriate to insert the article, we will do so individually.</p></speech>

I was surprised and interested to learn when I was researching this matter that Ireland has been Ghana's largest source of foreign direct investment since 2012.  Tax revenue accounts for 16% of GDP in Ghana, which is a very low figure.  The European average would be between 25% and 30%.  The proposed arrangement would limit Ghana's taxing rights over income, profits and economic activity.  There is a connection between the fact that taxation accounts for only 16% of Ghana's GDP and the fact that 5% of the country's children do not make it to their fifth birthday.  What is the level and standard of public services in Ghana, for example, the health service and health programmes?</p> <p>  Any taxation agreement must nail down best practice and box off opportunities for wealthy individuals and corporations to avoid tax.  I am not convinced that this agreement meets those requirements and nor are development organisations such as Christian Aid.  The latter has produced a document that includes seven key questions for the Government, of which I will cite only two.  First, why does the new tax treaty contain none of the provisions against tax abuse agreed in 2015 by OECD member states, including Ireland in Action 6 of BEPS, which Ireland has committed to implementing?  Second, in 2017 the Department of Finance promised that Ireland would invite tax treaty partners that have not signed the OECD multinational instrument to introduce anti-abuse measures unilaterally in their tax treaties with Ireland.  Did the Government make such an offer to Ghana?  If so, why did Ghana decline this offer and, if not, why did it not make such an offer?  Those questions have emerged in this discussion already.</p> <p>  I have listened carefully to the answers given by the Minister of State.  I am not sure that I understand every dot and comma of what he said because this is highly technical material.  He can correct me if I am wrong but his argument appears to be that because Ireland raised this matter with Ghana and it did not insist on these measures, there was nothing we could do and in any case there will be processes in the future that will help to nail down these issues.  That is not good enough.  </p> <p>  This is a technical debate but the issues are real.  I support Deputy &Oacute; Broin's suggestion that the core aspects of the Bill be debated on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  I will support any such formal proposal.</p></speech>

Ghana approached Ireland in 2014.  We finished the negotiations in 2016 before the multilateral convention was concluded.  We are now concluding the multilateral convention and we are satisfied that we are not at a minimum standard by any manner of means.  We accepted all of the minimum standards and the best practice standards.  We have some concerns about a multilateral convention.  Having said that, if countries choose not to implement the multilateral convention through legislation, we can deal with them bilaterally by updating current agreements.</p> <p>  We are satisfied that this is the right thing to do.  As I said to Deputy &Oacute; Broin, even before the first OECD report on BEPS was published, Ireland moved on BEPS as well as tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning by some companies.  We will not in any way facilitate such practices.  We have the opportunity, when we move to the multilateral convention, to conclude this matter.  If any country does not implement the convention, we will deal with it unilaterally.  The Deputies can only ask us to do so much.  Ghana, in which we have modest levels of investment of approximately &euro;43.5 million, approached us.  Double taxation agreements are good for business internationally.  When companies are subject to double taxation, it leads to aggressive tax planning, as happened in the past.  That is what happens if one does not deal with the issue.</p> <p>  The OECD is a well respected body and it will be a matter for it to ensure the treaties, over which it has oversight, are implemented.</p></speech>

In light of the issues raised by NGOs, which are at the coalface and understand the practices that apply in these economies, and notwithstanding our commitment to sign new agreements with emerging nations and the benefits that can accrue from them for the economy, I caution the committee at this stage and ask the Minister of State to respond in writing to the questions that have been raised.  We could then reflect on the response and revisit the issue on another date, rather than insisting on a debate in the D&aacute;il at this juncture.  We will adjudicate on the merits of debating the matter in the D&aacute;il, but we need time to reflect on the Minister of State's written response.</p></speech>

The committee was instructed to consider the motion so the message that must go back to the House from the committee is predetermined and states we have considered the motion.

There may be a technical reason for all of these issues but the outcome is pretty much as Deputy Barry described.  The message may go back to the D&aacute;il that we have considered the motion, that the committee requires the further information requested.  I ask the Minister of State to give a detailed reply to the Christian Aid submission.  I suggest that we write to the Business Committee informing it that the members of this committee in attendance have asked for a full D&aacute;il debate on the matter.

Deferral is most commonly availed of by property owners whose annual income is less than &euro;15,000 for a single person and &euro;25,000 for a couple, whether this is a married couple, civil partners or certain cohabitants.  This income threshold can be increased in the case of property owners paying mortgage interest.  In regard to such mortgage interest payees, the higher income threshold will cease to apply for tax years after 2018, unlike the standard income threshold that will continue for one additional year. </p><p>The next valuation date for local property tax is 1 November 2019, which will determine tax liabilities for the years 2020 and 2021.  Arrangements for this are currently being considered as part of the review of the local property tax being carried out by an interdepartmental group, as well as how payment deferrals will operate going forward.  Pending the Minister&rsquo;s consideration of the report of the review group and any Government decisions that may arise therefrom, the higher income threshold applied by section 133 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 is being extended until 31 December 2019 in line with the standard income threshold.  This change is contained in amendment No. 18.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 8 to 17, inclusive, and amendment 19 set out the changes necessary to allow for the continued collection of local property tax when the PAYE system is modernised with effect from 1 January 2019.  They are procedural and technical in nature.  They simply involve a change to the way in which local property tax deducted by employers is reported to Revenue and the documentation to be used for this purpose.  The tax will be deducted at the same time as heretofore and the amount will be exactly the same with no change in rates or computation.</p><p>There are a range of methods for paying local property tax, including the option to deduct at source from a salary or occupational pension.  The Finance Act 2017 introduced a fundamental redesign and modernisation of the PAYE system and includes a move for employers to a real-time electronic system for engaging with Revenue from 1 January 2019.  The changes to the collection of local property tax mirror income tax changes introduced in the Finance Act 2017.</p><p>Employers who are directed to deduct local property tax from the salary of a liable person will be required to notify Revenue of the making of the relevant deduction on or before the making of payments to that liable person.  Employers must also file a monthly return to report the local property tax deducted each month.  Penalties will apply for failure to comply with these requirements.</p><p>The legislative changes underpinning the continued administration and collection of income tax under PAYE modernisation were enacted in the Finance Bill 2017.  The changes proposed simply mirror for local property tax the changes enacted for income tax in the Finance Act 2017 in this regard.</p><p>The Ceann Comhairle has ruled that provisions concerning the local property tax are not appropriate for inclusion in the Finance Bill.  As the proposed provisions must have an operative date of 1 January 2019, they need to be provided for in law before that date. Hence, their proposed inclusion in this Bill.  Will I move on-----</p></speech>

We have a system where the State recognises there are people who simply cannot afford the tax.  We have a mechanism for deferring that tax and yet we charge them a 4% annually accruing interest charge.  If somebody is on a very low income, for example, a pensioner who might be asset rich but income poor, and has a deferral over a long period of time, the charge eventually put on their house is not only the LPT, which is a separate day's argument, but the accruing 4% annual interest charge.  It always seemed to me to be one of the most punitive and ill-thought-out elements of it.  Was any consideration given to removing that when the Minister of State was dealing with the broader substantive legislative amendment he has tabled here?  It seems to me this would have been the ideal time to remove that inequitable element of the original legislation.</p></speech>

It was not considered for this aspect but as the Deputy is aware, the report is due shortly so it is being considered in that context.  It is simple interest being charged also.  It is not compound interest.  However, I hear the Deputy's point about the 4%.</p></speech>

I believe the income threshold is &euro;15,000.  The Minister of State can correct me on the figures but the vast majority - 96% - of those who seek deferrals do so on income grounds, that is, they cannot afford to pay it.  In addition, regarding the deductions made by employers, if I read the figures from Revenue correctly, they indicate that 63,000, and another 22,000 on top of that, which is 85,000 people, have it directly deducted.  I assume many of those, and the Minister of State might be able elaborate on this, do so for reasons of having difficulty paying it but it is taken from them anyway by their employer.  When all of that is added together, 48,000 people seek deferrals and 85,000 from whom it is taken automatically, probably in most cases because they find difficulty in paying it.  That is a huge number of people who just are not able to pay.  Does the Government consider the unfairness of that is something that needs to be addressed and that deferring it does not resolve it?  It simply pushes it down the road and leads to accumulated debt, and the interest on that debt, when that debt arises from the fact their income is not sufficient to allow them pay it.  Has the Government considered that?  Does it believe it is fair?</p></speech>

I am not able to deduce from that number the reason people choose that method.  I am sure there is a range of methods for which some people opt for whatever reasons, but I do not believe the Deputy can deduce it either.</p> <p>  In terms of the income thresholds-----</p></speech>

I do not know why the 97,000 choose not to pay it.  That is a matter for people.  I do not know if the Deputy is able to put himself into their minds.  People choose to pay or not to pay.  It is collected by Revenue.  It is a very high collection rate, and it is a tax that has to be paid.</p></speech>

One of the justifications for the tax at the time was that it was a sort of fair wealth tax.  It certainly is not in the case of the 56,000 who seek deferrals because their income is less than either &euro;15,000 as an individual or &euro;25,000 as a couple.  Is that not low income?  At least in terms of that cohort, is that not fairly harsh?</p></speech>

Multiple times deposits, share value and every other section of wealth is property.  The State collects &euro;0.5 billion out of that significant wealth.  The Deputy disagrees with that.  He, and his colleagues on the left, are the few people who dispute that.  This is a wealth tax.  As I said, the highest form of wealth by a country mile is in the form of an asset that is property.  A little less than &euro;0.5 billion is collected annually from that.  To put that into context, the income tax collection figure for this calendar year, the tax on income, will be &euro;21.5 billion.  It is more than 40 times that collected in income tax versus property.  The Deputy knows from being a member of this committee for many years that a tax on income is a tax on jobs, and we have been in a position where we have to get people back into work.  The Deputy has always disputed that and he continues to dispute it.</p><p>The facts are the facts.  Most of the wealth in Ireland is in property.  A modest amount of the overall tax take is from the highest valued property, which is wealth in Ireland.</p></speech>

Before doing so, I would like to respond to the Minister of State's point that the facts are the facts.  It is not correct to equate a house which is a family home with a second or third house or a portfolio of properties.  The portfolio of properties brings in rental income and is a form of speculation.  The family home is a roof over the heads of a family, including children.  The Minister of State is lumping both together and saying facts are facts.  He needs to drill down into the facts a little more before coming out with comments like that.</p> <p>  The property tax is first and foremost a tax on the family home, which is the reason there was such strong resistance to it.  The Minister of State and his colleagues used the blunt instrument of Revenue in an effort to break that resistance.  The statistics provided to the committee today indicate that the level of resistance to it, despite Revenue being on the battlefield, is, perhaps, a little greater than was previously the case.  I want to drill down into those statistics.  Approximately 97,000 people did not volunteer to pay the property tax and had it deducted by their employers.  Some of them may have liked it that way but I am pretty sure that the vast bulk of them did not.  If one tried to put 97,000 in Croke Park there would be an overspill.  Will the Minister of State say if that number is increasing or decreasing?  Can he provide the committee with the statistics for the previous year and the year before that so that we can see if the curve is upwards or downwards?  Similarly, in regard to the 56,000 deferrals, what number of people sought deferrals in the past two years?</p></speech>

The current figure for involuntary payments is 97,018.  In 2017, it was 90,000 and in 2016 it was 80,000.  On the general question, Ireland was the only jurisdiction in the EU that did not have a property tax.  Maybe Ireland was right and all of the other countries were wrong in terms of the collection of tax from property or maybe it is the other way around.  As I said, the yield is less than 1% of GDP, or &euro;500 million, in a jurisdiction where the total tax yield is approximately &euro;52 billion.  The actual figure is &euro;470 million.  The left in Ireland has chosen to oppose the property tax.  It is the only left in Europe to oppose a property tax, which is a tax on wealth.  I have not lumped properties together.  Rather, I said that property is the highest form of wealth in this country by a country mile.  That is true.  Most properties are held by an individual as a primary home.  I am not disputing that that is the case.</p></speech>

Will he confirm that deferrals, 96% of which are based on insufficient income, have also increased?  In other words, there are people whose income is insufficient to enable them to pay and, therefore, they are seeking deferrals?  The Minister of State said that the figure for deferrals is 56,000.  As far as I am aware, it is 48,000.  There has been a leap in the number of deferrals being sought on the grounds of insufficient income, which is pretty significant.  Will the Minister confirm that is the case?</p></speech>

In 2017, it was almost 59,000 and in 2018 it is 57,700, which means deferrals are decreasing.  I do not have the percentage in this regard because during that period the number of units could have been greater.  As I said there are currently 1.92 million properties but this increases or decreases as new units come on stream and some are excluded.</p> <p>  There are 97,000 involuntary deductions from wages, which is less than 5% of the overall number.  The Deputy references this 5% all of time, as do other people on the left, but he never references the 95% of people who are satisfied to pay the tax.  </p></speech>

Just because 95% of the people pay property tax without deduction does not mean one can conclude that 95% are satisfied to pay their taxes.  If the Government was to revert to the household tax and make it a voluntary payment rather than one forcibly deductible by Revenue if not paid, it would then be possible to gauge the number of people who were happy, or not, to pay it.  I suggest that the reason the Government does not do this is because it knows that an awful lot less than 95% are satisfied to pay what is an odious tax on people's homes.</p></speech>

Taxes are the means by which we fund State services.  Deputy Barry is saying that he would prefer if people were given the opportunity to pay or not.  If we were to do that with income tax or corporation tax, we would not be collecting the amount of money we are collecting and we would not have recovered from the tax revenues of a decade ago, at which time we had transactional taxes which were keeping the ship afloat.  We now have a stable tax base.  As I said, the yield from income tax is almost &euro;22.5 billion.  The next highest yield comes from VAT, followed by corporation taxes and excise and duties.</p><p>If we want to run the country and provide funds for the services which the Deputy decries we are not collecting enough tax, this is one of those taxes and one of the lesser taxes.  It is a tax on the highest form of wealth in this country, which is property.  </p></speech>

We support the Government recommendations for, and await with interest, the consultation process on the property tax.  Having talked to councillors who were faced with a Hobson's choice of altering the property tax in their area by the 15% variation that they have in order to bolster their own finances, one comment they made to me in recent weeks and months is that they are conscious of concessions that were in place previously that may be extended into the future.  For example, if we eventually meet the targets set by Government for new house building perhaps property tax in an area could bolster the income of local authorities rather than them receiving the envisaged "Dear John" letter from the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></speech>

When Home Building Finance Ireland, HBFI, was first announced many of us thought it had the potential to be very useful but only if it met a certain set of criteria.  For the Government simply to put &euro;750 million of taxpayers' money, albeit through the Strategic Investment Fund, into the available pool of lending for viable builders in and of itself was not sufficient to justify such a large amount of expenditure and we believe certain conditions should certainly be explored on Committee Stage.  For example, the idea that this fund should target builders, particularly small and medium sized builders, who have viable projects but have genuine difficulty accessing finance, particularly the cocktail of bank and mezzanine finance, would be an eminently sensible idea because they would need the finance and, therefore, this would assist construction.  Likewise, a corollary of that is that if the Government was simply to make this available to any builder who is viable, it would not add any additionality and, for us, that is a crucial issue.</p><p>A second issue is that of affordability.  While that was not included in the Minister's budget day speech last year, if the Government is going to release that level of borrowing and potentially double the &euro;750 million in terms of its leveraged addition from the private market, that money could have huge benefits in terms of delivering genuinely affordable homes.  The Government is quite confused about affordability but affordability is defined, in the first instance, by the Central Bank.  It is related to people's income, for example, if one is buying a house it might be three and a half times one's gross salary.  We know the households who are locked out of the purchase market are, for example, households whose gross income ranges between &euro;45,000 and &euro;75,000.  Three and a half times those households' gross income tells us the amount they are potentially able to borrow minus their deposit.  If we were to target this measure at those people locked out of the market elsewhere in terms of assisting the delivery of homes within that price range, that would be hugely beneficial.  The problem is that neither of those two criteria is included in this measure.  There was a suggestion at an earlier stage that this measure might breach EU state aid rules but, following our conversation with the Minister of State's officials, if the Government was to model this in a similar way to the Rebuilding Ireland home finance loan and was to have the same type of eligibility criteria, it would clearly get over the state aid rule issues.  It seems to be a question of whether the Government wants to do those two things.  </p><p>Amendment No. 3, which is one of our four or five amendments that have been permitted, basically provides that the only people who should be getting this finance are builders who have viable projects but cannot get finance elsewhere.  If builders can get finance elsewhere, they should not be borrowing this money.  That seems to be pretty straightforward and, on that basis, this is an amendment that is particularly important to making this funding sensible.</p><p>I want to make one other comparison.  Deputy Cowen will recall we a discussion in the housing committee on the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, which provides for &euro;200 million, and there will also be a second round of it.  We were told that fund would have two purposes, namely, to get some infrastructure funding to developers who cannot access that finance to unlock their development and to get an affordability dividend.  What we have seen in the first tranche of contracts signed is that almost none of the developers who got that money needed it.  It has been admitted by the Department that the vast majority of those developments would have happened any way.  The figures from the Department show that there is virtually no affordability dividend in terms of providing homes at a purchase price available for people with gross incomes of between &euro;45,000 and &euro;75,000.</p><p>If we do not insist on those kinds of conditions being built into this legislation, we will have another debacle, as we have had with the housing infrastructure activation fund, except on a much bigger scale.  We would be putting &euro;750 million into the market and we will not get any additionality in terms of supply and we will not get affordability.  I urge the Minister of State between now and Report Stage to think through with his officials how we can we target this fund in a way that meets those two criteria.  I know his officials will tell him, if they have not done so already, that this is what the intention of the lenders will be when they meet people, but I would much prefer if that was copperfastened into the legislation so that it would not be discretionary but mandatory in terms of the lending from this facility.</p></speech>

The suite of measures, when taken together, is shocking in the extreme.  It includes NAMA's policy for disposal, the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, HBFI and the Land Development Agency.  When one thinks about how they add up, it is beyond scandalous.  The Mafia could not have dreamt up a scheme like this.  What we are doing is selling land to private developers at massive discounts via NAMA or giving developers cheap land via the Land Development Agency.  We are then using public money to provide the services infrastructure - roads, sewers and so on - via the LIHAF.  Then we are going to lend money to developers, to whom the banks will not lend, to build on that land.  The public is doing everything for these people and at the end of this process they will sell the properties they build at unaffordable market prices.  We are handing to these people the means of making enormous sums of money, courtesy of the public and, at the end of it, we will have housing that no one can afford.  The people who need that housing will not be able to afford it.</p><p> I am a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight which engaged with representatives of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, yesterday.  They pointed out that while there is no immediate threat of overheating in the economy, the one area where overheating is possible is in the housing sector because rents and property prices are too high.  This is creating pressure and could cause economic overheating by fuelling wage demands and labour shortages, thus reducing the capacity of the economy.  This Government scheme is going to fuel this further.  It is not going to supply housing to the people who need it and will create an overheating pressure within the economy, and yet the Government is going ahead with it.  It is beyond belief.  The only beneficiary from this will be the developer.  I do not understand how the Government can possibly justify this.  I am keen to hear the Minister of State's response, but without an absolute condition that no finance is extended to anyone to do anything other than build social and affordable housing, then HBFI is a scandal.  If it had the conditionality that finance would be extended to build only social and affordable housing, there would be some justification for it, but other than that, it is outrageous.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.1632" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018092000002#M00200"><p>I will read my departmental note first and then I will comment on the Deputies' concerns.  I understand that amendments Nos. 2, 4 and 6 have been ruled out of order so I will focus on amendment No. 3 which seeks to require HBFI to prioritise certain borrowers.  I am required to reject this amendment on the grounds that it would hinder the efficient delivery of funding by HBFI and may have state aid implications, potentially leaving the State open to challenge.  Section 7 provides HBFI with the functions necessary to provide funding on market terms to any commercially viable residential development project in the State which meets its eligibility criteria.  This captures development proposals that include social and affordable housing, cost rental and others set out in the amendments that were originally proposed.  It is important to note that HBFI is designed to avoid displacing funding that exists in the State.  As such it is expected that HBFI will focus its activities on segments of the market that are not well provided for by funders in the market, that is, precisely the type of builders that this amendment seeks to address.</p> <p>  It is well understood that many of the main banks and funds are focused on providing funding only for large developments or those located in key urban centres.  HBFI will be open to smaller projects of more than ten units and will accept applications for viable residential projects throughout the State.  As larger developers are being catered for by the main banks, HBFI&rsquo;s lending will be comparatively more attractive for small and medium-sized builders who are having greater difficulty accessing finance.  This strategic focus should go some way to alleviating some of the Deputies' concerns.</p> <p>  Taking into account HBFI&rsquo;s strategic focus, this amendment would have no practical effect in ensuring that builders who have struggled to receive sufficient finance will be granted access to HBFI funding as HBFI will fund any viable project that meets its eligibility criteria.  Placing an obligation on HBFI to assess whether an applicant has been unable to access sufficient funding from elsewhere for commercially viable residential projects will place a needless administrative burden on HBFI.  This will impede the fast and effective delivery of funding to support much-needed new residential developments.  In crafting the legislation we have been careful to ensure that HBFI is established in compliance with state aid rules and that there would be no element of selectivity in HBFI&rsquo;s lending activities.  Attempting to restrict or prioritise the type of lending HBFI will conduct could give rise to complaints from other prospective borrowers also wishing to access this funding.</p> <p>  The real benefit here is that HBFI can give up to 80% of funding.  As I understand it, the banks will provide 60% of funding to builders to build, after the site is paid for, which means that there is 40% to be bridged.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin touched on the fact that this 40% is hugely expensive.  I have heard of up to 15% mezzanine finance for that 40%, which reduces significantly the margin for building, and the margin for building is what is doing damage to the supply chain.  The smaller builders building ten or more units are not getting a hearing from the banks because they are too small.  The banks would have to do due diligence on someone building ten or 20 houses in the same way as they would for someone building 100 or 200.  The same amount of work goes into that process.</p> <p>  The benefit of HBFI is that the 40% mezzanine finance can be reduced and be as low as 20%.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin agrees that this is the real benefit of HBFI.  This is not designed for a site of six to 12 acres in Dublin city with between 30 to 50 units per acre.  Such projects are being funded already.  The market is sufficiently strong for those projects to be funded directly by the banks and the projects are sufficiently profitable to enable the developers to pay between 12% and 15% for mezzanine finance.  However, projects in my constituency in County Wexford or in Deputy Cowen's constituency in County Offaly are not being funded.  Developers are not even getting a hearing and that is where HBFI will come in.</p> <p>  We can have an ideological debate like the one we had earlier but this is a good thing.  This reduces the level of mezzanine finance that will be required by those smaller, mid-level builders who might have a small site and who can have an impact in the country.  We can disagree about it on a fundamental basis but this is a good thing and it will help.  It might not do an awful lot for Dublin because it is too small, but it is not aimed at developers of large, high-density schemes in the middle of Dublin.</p></speech>

He is correct, even as it relates to some of the large sites.  Firms such as, for example, Hines in Cherrywood will parcel their sites and offer them for sale to smaller builders at extortionate prices.  Those prices increase constantly.  If planning permission is acquired, for example, the price will increase.  If the Government changes the law to reduce standards, the value increases.</p></speech>

All of these little changes, including strategic development zone designation, mean that the value will increases.  Therefore, the little builder who buys a site is doing so at an inflated cost.  It is not viable for a builder to build without charging astronomical prices.  A bank in looking at this situation would not believe it added up and many builders are not getting involved because it does not add up.  Arguably, even the larger builders are not building.  They are just sitting on land because it does not add up to build.  The Minister of State is saying this initiative will not resolve that issue and clearly it will not in places such as Dublin.  It will only be effective in places where the crisis is not acute.  What is the point of that?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.1649" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018092000002#N01500"><p>My only disagreement with Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett is that, unlike LIHAF, this is not a giveaway to builders.  Importantly, it is a loan facility, on which there is a commercial rate of return.  Therefore, it will profit from these loans.  My concern is not about that matter; rather, it is about whether this is the most appropriate use of the money in trying to tackle the housing crisis.</p> <p>  I wish to address the state aid concerns.  The Rebuilding Ireland home loan is a different type of loan, but it still has to comply with state aid rules.  Applicants must indicate refusals or insufficient offers from other lending institutions.  That will allow them to access not only this product but a product that carries a much better interest rate, a fixed rate of 2% or 2.5% for the term of the loan.  That is how it avoids state aid rules.  No one has explained to me how we could not had have a similar facility for this initiative if that is what the Government wanted to do.</p> <p>  There seems to be a contradiction in the Minister of State's argument.  On the one hand, he is telling us that the Government wants to focus on small and medium-sized builders who are having difficulty in accessing commercial finance.  He is right about the cost of mezzanine finance crippling them.  It is as great an issue in Dublin as it is outside it, albeit for smaller developments.  On the other hand, the Minister of State is telling us that the Government cannot lock it into the legislation for fear of being in breach of state aid rules.  That makes no sense.  Either the initiative is targeting those builders or it is not.</p> <p>  My worry is not academic, as this is already happening with LIHAF.  We were told that it was only for builders who could not access infrastructural funding from commercial banks to unlock their developments.  Things would be built that would not be if LIHAF was not in place.  Cherrywood is a good example of what is happening in that developers with no shortage of access to infrastructural funding are accessing considerable amounts of LIHAF funding, but that money is not unlocking a development that would not have happened otherwise.  Nothing the Minister of State has described would prevent such an eventuality with this fund, even if that is not the intention or focus.  Unless we say this finance is for the purpose of unlocking developments only, there is no guarantee the money could not end up with a developer who would have built the houses anyway.</p> <p>  The issues of viability and affordability are important.  I accept that, on the basis of what is in front of us, the initiative will reduce the cost of mezzanine finance, but that will not make the homes in the areas where affordability is a problem any more affordable.  The small reduction in the overall sale price of a home arising from the decrease in the cost of financing will not make a difference.  While the financing cost of the average home price of &euro;320,000 or &euro;340,000 might be &euro;10,000 or &euro;20,000, the cost of land, development fees and developer's profits are pushing up the price.  I do not see how the Government can prevent this fund from ending up with people who do not need it.  The Minister of State might ask why they would apply for it, but the experience of LIHAF suggests they will.  I do not see why the Government would release such a large amount of money without some guarantee of affordability, at least for some of the loans.</p> <p>  The Minister of State will not agree with me on Committee Stage, but he and his officials must examine this issue before Report Stage.  If we could ensure some of the loan finance will get to projects that will make homes available for purchase to people across the State on incomes of between &euro;45,000 and &euro;75,000, it would be a much better use of the money than what is being proposed.  I will not get into a long discussion back and forth with the Minister of State, as we will return to this matter on Report Stage, but I urge him to consider my suggestion before then.</p></speech>

We are all too well aware of the problem.  Unfortunately, it has been the case for too long and is impacting on people in a detrimental fashion, in that property and rental prices are too high.  Increased supply is the answer.  Other efforts are being made to address that issue, but LIHAF has been referenced.  It is commendable but slow.  The local authority house building programme's targets are commendable but slow.  We can argue who is at fault and while it is wrong to get into the blame game, local authorities do not have the discretion they require to do the job we expect them to do.  It is time the Government considered increasing their discretion by a multiple of the current amount of &euro;2 million.  The Department could perform regular audits thereafter to ensure the local authorities were in line with the various expectations, regulations and rules for the procurement of public finance.  That would give greater ownership to local authorities and their members and allow them to play the part they played historically and want to play again to address this issue.  We have been making this suggestion for a long time.</p> <p>  The affordable schemes the Government is seeking from local authorities are commendable, but, once again, they are taking too long.  In terms of the current call, there is no obligation on local authorities to meet it until next June.  It will not result in a property until two years later.</p><p>We are still in the midst of a pilot cost-rental scheme.  It is a fine idea and there was much merit associated with it initially.  It is commendable but too slow.  It is a facet of the Government's handling of the issue.  There is a lack of urgency and determination to get to the root of it.  We are at a juncture where we have to see real and concrete measures that can have the impact other efforts failed to have.  Many will have an impact in time but, as the Minister of State has acknowledged, they will have an impact without the immediacy that is required.  I called for this last year and the year before.  It was announced in last year's budget but it is not yet on the ground, which highlights the lack of urgency that is necessary to make this available.  I make no apologies for saying this is necessary.  There are builders out there, big and small, who cannot get access to finance and if they cannot get access to finance they cannot put homes on the ground.  If we cannot put homes on the ground, property prices and rental prices will stay high.  For some here, it allows them the opportunity to continue to have a drum to beat.  Until the Government wakes up to that reality they will still be beating that drum and unfortunately nobody will get a resolution.  There is much merit in the amendment.  It is the blueprint for what should be the case with all building by local authorities, social housing agencies, the State and private developers in the next two years if not beyond.  It means that 10% should be social, 30% should be affordable and the remainder can be private.  That would meet with universal approval in the committee and the D&aacute;il.  If that was the case for the next two years perhaps the people would see there is a unified attempt to bring about a successful resolution to the issue.  </p><p> I would add to that the credit unions which are an integral part of many communities across the country.  They are under great strain as a result of Central Bank restrictions on their activities in the financial services sector.  It impinges on their ability to make profits which impinges on their ability to provide the sort of support they have provided historically and which they can and want to provide in their communities in the future.  They could contribute based on the amount of funding they have available, which is up to &euro;8 billion.  As a result of the present restrictive rules on their ability to play a role, they are confined to propping up the pillar banks, the same pillar banks who will not lend to the sector.  The Government must allow them to invest in such a vehicle, which in turn can reap rewards for their communities.  It could offer the opportunity of a revenue stream so the credit unions can continue to play a part in their communities when others in their communities are being lost as a result of advances in technology and other things.  It will affect the ability of those communities to thrive into the future.  There is a win-win aspect to much of this and we should not be playing the political game of who is associated with the success.  Everybody is to blame for the failure so everybody can play a part in a successful conclusion despite the unfortunate delays which have happened despite everybody's best will.  </p><p> There is much merit in the proposal.  I echo the comments of Deputy &Oacute; Broin imploring the Minister of State to consider this before Report Stage and to allow it to be a blueprint for development finance.  The State has to intervene as a result of the lack of affordable and competitive finance being made available to the sector, big and small.  Every time one talks about builders and developers, one talks about big developers.  There are many small builders around the country with a lot of people on their books who are prepared to work especially in their own communities and regions.  Carpenters, bricklayers, labourers and electricians are part of the service too.  They are part of the sector.  They have families and they have an entitlement to play their parts in ensuring their families have an opportunity to remain in their own communities.</p></speech>

This is one of a suite of options; it is not the only option.  Deputy Boyd Barrett questioned the usefulness of it.  It is useful and beneficial but it is not the defining piece that fixes it all.  The fixing of the housing and construction sector in Ireland is multifaceted and there are many different options.  My concern about this amendment is about builders not developers.  There are some builders who still have small portions of land but developers have hundreds of acres and they want to build 30, 40 or 50 units per acre.  This is specifically about smaller builders for example a smaller builder with a ten acre plot of land.  If Deputy &Oacute; Broin's amendment is successful, the funding purely for social and affordable housing will be an issue because economy of scale will be an issue.  If a builder owns ten acres of land, for example, and wants to have some private and some affordable he will have to provide 10% social housing under Part V if it is zoned land.  My concern is because of the economy of scale considerations that if one is developing ten acres and one is chiselling out 40%, which is 30% affordable and 10% social, one will only be able to build on a specific four acres and it can only be funded under this scheme.  The developer will still be stuck on the remaining 60% for private housing.  That is what this is for.  It is not an "us and them" situation.  It is not social and affordable housing versus private housing.  Many people in the private housing sector have the opportunity of getting loans from the State under the Rebuilding Ireland scheme.  There is the 40-year loan for individuals earning less than &euro;50,000 and couples earning less than &euro;75,000.  The interaction between private, social and affordable is important and that is where the real benefit comes for a smaller builder on a ten acre site.</p></speech>

We are not dealing with the amendments concerning social and affordable housing because they have been ruled out of order.  There is nothing in these amendments that is being prescriptive.  What it is saying is if this vehicle is going to lend it needs to target people who cannot access finance elsewhere and it needs to target the delivery of homes that people can buy.  The detail of that will be worked out.  We are not proposing that 10% or 20% specifically be allocated because that would affect the viability of any scheme.  The purpose of the fund should be to target certain types of developers to produce certain types of houses.  I just want the Minister of State to be clear on what my intention is and I urge him to have a think about it between now and Report Stage.  We will return to it at that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-09-20a.1654" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2018092000002#O00400"><p>The problem with all this is it is predicated on the idea that if one increases supply it will help resolve the crisis.  If we increase supply but the supply is unaffordable it will not resolve the crisis it will make the crisis worse.  That is the basic point I put to the Minister of State and he did not really answer it.  We had supply at a very high level before the crash but it was unaffordable supply.  At a certain point it became clear that the people who borrowed the money could not pay it back because there was no market for that number of unaffordable properties.  Yet we are going to do it again.  The banks are saying "We are not doing that again" because they can see where it is heading and they see where it headed last time but the Government is going to step in and do what the banks will not do to repeat the mistakes of the past.  I do not see why the Government would do it.  It is crazy to do it.</p><p>Mel Reynolds in particular has been arguing very strongly that housing output will start to decline and will not gradually increase as the Government believes.  Developers and builders know that because they know there is not a market for large-scale housing at current prices.  However, they have to sell at current prices to recover their costs.  They will, therefore, sit on developments or drip-feed housing to keep prices high.  It is now proposed to facilitate more of that through House Building Finance Ireland, HBFI.  This will not solve the problem we are trying to solve, namely, the housing and homelessness emergency where large numbers of people are locked out of the market because of unaffordable prices.  It will also contribute to doing what we did prior to 2008.</p><p> I am not the only one highlighting overheating in the housing market.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, has also highlighted the issue.  It is driving up the cost of accommodation to unsustainable levels with all the dangers that creates for the economy.  The Minister of State has said nothing that answers that fundamental question.  Does he believe that simply by increasing supply, house prices will come down at some point?  If he does, he is living in cloud cuckoo land.  The evidence shows clearly that as housing supply increased, so too did house prices.  They did not go the other way. </p></speech>

I will counter the argument that is always made by my colleague, Deputy Boyd Barrett.  The criteria associated with affordability in Part V of the planning legislation were restrictive and the measure did not have the desired effect because developers were allowed to buy it out.  That practice was subsequently disallowed and the lesson was learned.  A formula can be devised to give an acceptable level of profitability to the builder while accommodating those who are in the affordability gap, namely, the cohort of people who do not qualify for social housing and cannot afford a mortgage from the banks.  This funding can help to ensure that.  For example, if it is made available to somebody developing a Land Development Agency site, which will be public land, it should be definitively predicated on the provision of social and affordable homes as well as private housing.  Developers will see where they will go with private developments, depending on the amount of supply and the impact it will have, and that should level off prices.  However, if we want to assist those who have not received any help, despite the schemes that were introduced in the past two years with the best of intentions, we have to quantify the numbers involved and set criteria to ensure they get an opportunity to buy at an affordable price and do not pay more than 30% of their income on housing.</p></speech>

For HBFI to lend successfully to those entities, it needs to be in a position to guarantee absolute confidentiality to potential applicants and market counterparties.  While the Freedom of Information Act contains protections for third party information, it does not afford the degree of confidentiality expected in the market.  Without the necessary level of confidentiality to the records of HBFI, the danger is it may be made ineffective by severely limiting the appetite of builders and developers to seek finance from HBFI.</p><p>The potential for information to be released in relation to borrowers which would not be made available were they to obtain loans from private institutions would potentially create an uneven market environment for HBFI.  This amendment provides limited exclusions to address these concerns, bringing HBFI in line with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and other commercial state agencies.</p><p>In order to ensure transparency, the Freedom of Information Act will continue to apply as normal to HBFI in relation to such documents as strategy and policy papers, board and management meeting minutes, papers and agendas, internal correspondence, correspondence with Departments and administrative records such as contracts, expenses, etc.</p><p>In addition, it is necessary to extend this partial exemption to the National Treasury Management Agency.  The NTMA is conferred with certain functions under section 9 of the Home Building Finance Ireland Bill 2018.  This may result in the NTMA holding records in relation to the operations of HBFI.  For the same reasons that I have just described, these records need to be protected when they are held by the NTMA in the performance of its functions under the HBFI Bill.  The exemption for the NTMA in this regard is therefore a mirror image of the exemption for HBFI.</p></speech>

This involves &euro;750 million of taxpayers' money.  It is not the same as private commercial investments and there has to be a mechanism to allow Members of the Oireachtas or members of the public to properly scrutinise it.  Increasingly in the housing funding area we are seeing exclusions of this kind, either in practice or in legislation.</p><p>For example, decisions on the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, which is a product that has merit and is not one for which I have criticised the Government, are based on a credit policy that has been designed by the Department or the Housing Finance Agency yet we are not able to get access to that credit policy, even in some redacted form, where we want to ensure that refusals under the scheme have been done in accordance with the rules.  This is a real problem because it is a publicly funded scheme and we want to ensure consistency across local authorities.  We are now having the same problem with the increasing use of public private partnerships in the delivery of social housing.  The Chairman has raised this in other areas, but again, when public private partnerships for social housing are now developed, they are developed on the basis of benchmarking exercises developed by the Department.  This is locked in secrets, however, and we as Members of the Oireachtas have no ability to assess whether there is value for money for the taxpayer.  The level of exclusions is very worrying to me.  Given the scale of the investment - and I know it is a commercial investment with a commercial return - if something goes wrong in this scheme, a committee, whether the Committee of Public Accounts or this committee, could come back in a year or two wanting to know what went wrong.  These exclusions prevent us from doing that.  I am not saying all exclusions would be unnecessary, but the breadth of these exclusions is very worrying, and I certainly could not accept them.</p></speech>

I find difficulty even at local authority level for the same reasons of trying to find out the details of Part V arrangements between the local authority and the private developers in terms of the 10% or, as it was previously with the affordable element, the 20%.  One cannot get sight of these things.  One does not know exactly what the arrangements are, which is completely unacceptable when we are talking about public money but is just an extension of the folly of this entire scheme.  If one wanted to help a small builder, one could just put out a tender for the small builder to build on public land.  By doing it in this way, however, one gets into having to compromise with the market, with all the commercial sensitivity and commercial secrecy stuff, which means public money goes out and there is no real accountability in respect of it.  As well as the reasons Deputy &Oacute; Broin outlined, there are myriad reasons this is totally unacceptable and folly, and we will certainly oppose it.</p></speech>

If someone applied and made all his or her financial details available to HBFI for a loan, that information would not be made available under FOI, so this is the same as NAMA.  Commercial sensitivity is involved, which is the reason we are mirroring exactly what the SBCI and NAMA have.</p></speech>
